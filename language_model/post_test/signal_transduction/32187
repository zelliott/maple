The formation of the zzso mosaic of hair cells and supporting cells in the sensory zzso of the inner ear is regulated by zzso zzso and lateral zzso but the dynamics of this process and precise mode of action of zzso 1 zzso in this context are zzso Here, we zzso the chicken inner ear with a fluorescent reporter that includes elements of the zzso zzso promoter to monitor zzso activity in the developing sensory zzso The zzso reporter was active in zzso cells and supporting cells, and zzso expression was highest in prospective hair cells with low levels of zzso activity, which occasionally contacted more differentiated hair zzso To investigate zzso functions we used zzso in which zzso expression was either zzso regulated by the zzso promoter, or induced by zzso In support of the standard lateral zzso model, both continuous and zzso expression of zzso promoted hair cell differentiation zzso (in zzso and inhibited hair cell formation in zzso However, some hair cells formed despite zzso zzso cells, suggesting that some zzso cells are insensitive to lateral zzso This is not due to the zzso of zzso activity by zzso itself, as induction of zzso did not zzso reduce the activity of the zzso reporter in zzso and supporting zzso Altogether, our results show that zzso functions primarily in trans to regulate hair cell production but also that additional mechanisms operate downstream of lateral zzso to eliminate patterning errors in the sensory zzso of the inner zzso
