The production of zzso is required for immunity to many zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, is essential for zzso zzso production by zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is also required for zzso production by zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso However, zzso mice infected with zzso zzso produce comparable amounts of zzso to infected zzso mice and have an zzso mechanism of resistance to this zzso Furthermore, zzso was not required for zzso production by zzso or zzso cells in response to soluble zzso zzso and zzso from zzso mice contain normal amounts of zzso zzso Together these studies reveal the presence of zzso pathways critical for zzso production in response to inflammatory stimuli and demonstrate a novel zzso zzso of zzso production during zzso
