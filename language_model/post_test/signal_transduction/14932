The role of the zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso is poorly zzso One goal of these experiments was to clarify whether zzso act upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may also inhibit the anabolic zzso of zzso since a molecular zzso previously shown to mediate zzso activity, heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Thus, an additional objective was to determine whether zzso zzso affects the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were conducted using isolated rat zzso zzso zzso zzso increased total protein degradation by zzso zzso zzso prevented this large rise in zzso demonstrating that the zzso was necessary for zzso protein zzso In addition, zzso zzso increased zzso zzso by zzso further supporting the idea of sequential zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso by 35 and zzso respectively, and activated zzso zzso zzso beta zzso by zzso Additionally, zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso protein content by 33 and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso play a dual role in protein metabolism by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of protein zzso
