The zzso complex zzso can be considered as a specialized zzso complex, linking the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso primarily in muscle zzso zzso in several components of the zzso lead to its partial or total loss, resulting in various forms of muscular zzso These typically manifest as progressive wasting diseases with loss of muscle zzso Debate is ongoing about the precise function of the zzso initially a strictly mechanical role was proposed but it has been suggested that there is zzso calcium handling in muscular zzso and, more recently, changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of the zzso Here, we discuss new and interesting developments in these aspects of zzso function and attempt to zzso the zzso calcium and zzso hypotheses to provide a unifying hypothesis of the underlying process of muscular zzso
