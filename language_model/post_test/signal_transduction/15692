zzso is a tropical disease endemic in southeast Asia and northern Australia caused by the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso Although infection is often zzso the lung is frequently zzso zzso zzso is a closely related zzso that at high doses causes lethal pneumonia in zzso We examined the role of zzso receptors zzso essential components of innate zzso in zzso and in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso are required for tumor necrosis factor alpha production induced by zzso zzso In zzso airborne infection, zzso is needed for early, but not late, bacterial zzso and zzso is essential for control of infection and host zzso zzso and zzso are not necessary to contain zzso zzso In high-dose airborne infection, zzso zzso zzso a slight survival zzso Lung and systemic inflammatory responses are induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso independently of individual zzso or zzso These findings suggest that zzso in zzso signaling or other zzso pathways may be important in zzso zzso zzso infection but that zzso mechanisms of inflammation are also zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso infection is substantially comparable to signaling induced by virulent zzso zzso These studies provide additional insights into the zzso interaction in zzso zzso zzso
