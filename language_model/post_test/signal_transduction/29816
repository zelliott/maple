zzso cells zzso are highly efficient zzso cells zzso that collect zzso in body zzso and transport them to draining zzso zzso zzso peptides are loaded onto major zzso complex zzso molecules for presentation to zzso T cells, resulting in the induction of cellular and zzso immune zzso zzso take up zzso through zzso zzso and zzso via different groups of zzso families, such as zzso receptors for zzso complexes, zzso zzso receptors zzso for zzso and pattern recognition zzso such as zzso receptors zzso for microbial zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to presentation of zzso on zzso class I and II zzso zzso are well equipped to distinguish between zzso and zzso by the variable expression of zzso receptors such as zzso and zzso In the steady state, zzso are not zzso zzso but use their zzso capacities to maintain peripheral zzso zzso are continuously sampling and presenting zzso and harmless environmental proteins to silence immune zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and airways are good examples of sites where continuous presentation of zzso and foreign zzso occurs without immune zzso In contrast, efficient zzso immune zzso occurs upon encounter of zzso with zzso zzso of pathogens by zzso triggers specific receptors such as zzso that result in DC maturation and subsequently immune zzso Here we discuss the concept that cross talk between zzso and zzso zzso expressed by zzso of zzso accounts for the different pathways to peripheral zzso such as deletion and suppression, and immune zzso
