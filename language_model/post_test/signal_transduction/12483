Sensor zzso zzso are widely used by bacteria to detect and respond to environmental zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso providing zzso input to the zzso that activates the zzso zzso upon zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso in its zzso sensor domain, which appear to be involved in the sensing of an unidentified zzso zzso produced upon zzso Prior zzso studies have suggested that zzso forms a zzso as a functional zzso and that the most zzso zzso domain zzso plays an important role in sensing the zzso to activate an zzso zzso reaction to a zzso zzso To analyze the structure and function of the zzso in zzso we have used a strain in which the synthesis of zzso is under the control of an zzso zzso zzso In zzso functional studies in combination with zzso deletion analysis show that the zzso zzso forms a zzso as an active form under both zzso and zzso conditions via its zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that a zzso in which the zzso domain was deleted was still able to induce zzso at a zzso level irrespective of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are sufficient to maintain the zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that the primary role of the zzso sensor domain is to form a stable complex as a functional zzso but possibly not for the binding of an unidentified zzso zzso
