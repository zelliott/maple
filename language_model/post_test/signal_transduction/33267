It is well established that zzso oxide zzso acts as a zzso zzso in the nervous system of both zzso and zzso In contrast to classical zzso the zzso NO can act on zzso targets limited by zzso and diffusion zzso This type of diffuse zzso seems to be zzso highly zzso and recent findings concerning the characterization and function of the NO system in insects are summarized in this zzso zzso the properties and the zzso of the NO forming zzso the NO zzso zzso are zzso In the nervous system the brain contains by far the highest zzso zzso As an evolutionary zzso a zzso bug exhibits high zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso the soluble zzso zzso zzso a major target of NO action, and zzso zzso like zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso gated channels are zzso zzso organization of the zzso system in insects reveals evidence for a cellular separation of the release site and target site of zzso although in the zzso zzso of the locust an exception from this rule zzso zzso the implication of the NO system in zzso function in insects is zzso In the zzso the zzso system in the zzso zzso is implicated in the processing of zzso mechanisms during zzso processing, and recent findings support a specific role of the NO system in memory zzso zzso of the results in insects with regard to properties and functions of the zzso NO system is zzso
