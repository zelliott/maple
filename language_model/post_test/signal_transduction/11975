zzso zzso a zzso modification of zzso and a hallmark of stable zzso has gained recent attention given its association with tumor zzso zzso and zzso We also recently reported that zzso transition zzso promotes zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso facilitate tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso Given the induction of zzso associated with inflammation and cancer zzso we tested zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso on a panel of human breast zzso cells to examine their effects on zzso zzso to identify more specific zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso human breast zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso we measured the impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso using protein expression analysis and zzso A zzso reporter zzso and a viability screen were performed to determine if the effects were associated with their zzso zzso properties or were a result of zzso zzso monitoring of zzso attachment was measured utilizing electrical zzso across zzso sensor zzso We compared the selectivity of the zzso zzso to specifically target zzso zzso with traditional zzso zzso zzso and zzso throughout the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso selectively decrease zzso zzso independent of their zzso of zzso zzso scoring of suspended cells treated with zzso and zzso show reduction in the frequency of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso and zzso can decrease zzso zzso without significantly zzso the overall zzso network or cell zzso zzso and zzso display indiscriminate disruption of the zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that selective targeting of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso can reduce zzso frequency and inhibit tumor cell zzso These actions are independent of their effects on zzso zzso presenting a novel zzso property and therapeutic opportunity to selectively target a stable subset of zzso in circulating tumor cells to reduce zzso potential with less toxicity in breast cancer zzso
