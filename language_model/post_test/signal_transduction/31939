Current endeavors in the type 2 diabetes zzso field include gaining a better understanding of zzso signaling pathways that regulate pancreatic zzso zzso Recent data suggest that both zzso and zzso pathways are operative in pancreatic zzso and play a positive role in insulin zzso and zzso zzso Our laboratory found the dual zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be zzso in a mouse model of zzso zzso and zzso lean zzso Because zzso signaling has been proposed to enhance zzso function, we evaluated the role of zzso in adult zzso function using animals in which zzso was globally zzso While zzso animals exhibited no zzso development zzso a subset of zzso exhibited enhanced insulin zzso and improved zzso zzso compared with control animals after zzso exposure to high-fat zzso Loss of zzso in the setting of zzso stress results in altered expression of zzso genes in zzso but did not affect expression of zzso target zzso suggesting that zzso primarily regulates the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that removal of zzso enhances the zzso of the closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso after zzso exposure to high-fat zzso These data imply that zzso regulates expression of these zzso and provide a means by which zzso animals show enhanced insulin zzso and zzso zzso Our studies provide insights into zzso zzso regulation in the zzso zzso and reveal new avenues for improving zzso function under zzso zzso
