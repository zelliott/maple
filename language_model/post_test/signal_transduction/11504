Stem cells, which zzso tissue by producing zzso cells, also produce cells that renew the stem cell zzso zzso from regulatory zzso zzso are thought to cause stem cells to retain zzso zzso However, the molecular characterization of niches remains an important zzso In zzso zzso germ line and zzso stem cells attach to a cluster of support cells called the zzso The hub specifically expresses zzso a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling zzso Without zzso zzso germ line stem cells differentiate but do not zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling greatly expands both stem cell zzso We conclude that the support cells of the hub signal to adjacent stem cells by zzso of the zzso pathway, thereby defining a niche for stem cell zzso
