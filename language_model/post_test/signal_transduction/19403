The zzso of zzso pain is zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso of chronic zzso zzso zzso are effective for pain zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the pain transmission in zzso pain states that zzso by zzso zzso in primary sensory zzso zzso zzso injury zzso model was used as zzso pain zzso zzso rats had been randomly divided into sham group, zzso group and zzso rats treated with zzso zzso zzso Mechanical withdrawal threshold and zzso withdrawal zzso were zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso root zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso and western zzso zzso The mechanical withdrawal threshold and zzso withdrawal zzso in zzso group were lower than those in sham group and zzso rats treated with zzso zzso group zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso in zzso group were higher than those in the other two groups zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso rats treated with zzso zzso group were decreased compared with those in zzso group zzso The results show that zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso pain and zzso primarily zzso pain responses zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso treatment in zzso rats may alleviate chronic zzso pain by decreasing the expressions of zzso and zzso receptors on zzso zzso to inhibit the transmission of zzso pain zzso
