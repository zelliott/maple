The human zzso surface zzso zzso is a common site of zzso disease including zzso and zzso cancer, probably due to serial zzso events associated with successive zzso To comprehend the importance of steroid zzso in the regulation of the zzso we used a custom zzso to zzso the expression of over 250 genes involved in the synthesis and reception of steroid hormones, zzso and zzso The array included a subset of zzso genes commonly involved in zzso zzso zzso cells donated by five patients undergoing surgery for zzso zzso conditions were cultured for 48 h in the presence and absence of 500 zzso zzso zzso Total zzso was zzso into zzso zzso which was zzso to the array and zzso by zzso resonance light scattering and zzso device zzso camera zzso zzso for selected genes were verified by quantitative zzso zzso In five out of five cases, zzso zzso cells expressed genes zzso zzso required for de zzso zzso of cholesterol from zzso and subsequent formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the inability of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso The only zzso gene significantly zzso by zzso was zzso zzso type 1 zzso Other zzso genes were zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes that respond to zzso The only zzso gene significantly suppressed by zzso was zzso Other genes suppressed by zzso were zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso 10, zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and nuclear zzso zzso 2 group F member zzso These results define a zzso zzso of cultured zzso cells and provide a limited expression profile for genes with associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a panel of zzso zzso genes in zzso cells, providing further evidence that cortisol generated by zzso could participate in the local resolution of inflammation associated with zzso
