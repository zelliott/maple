This review attempts to substantiate the notion that zzso DNA structures allow zzso cells to evolve complex signal integration devices that, to some extent, parallel the zzso zzso employed by higher organisms to control cell growth and zzso Regulatory zzso allow the possibility of inserting additional checks, either positive or negative, in every step of the zzso In this context, the major consequence of DNA zzso in zzso is that promoter geometry becomes a key regulatory zzso By using DNA bending, bacteria afford multiple zzso control levels simply through zzso of promoter architecture, so that positive signals favor an optimal constellation of zzso and zzso contacts required for zzso Additional effects of regulated DNA zzso in zzso promoters include the amplification and translation of small zzso signals into major zzso responses and the control of promoter specificity for zzso zzso
