zzso zzso studies have shown that hundreds of zzso genes are induced or zzso zzso by changes in zzso many are zzso to stress response on this zzso To obtain a zzso assessment of which genes are functionally important for innate and/or acquired zzso we combined the use of a zzso pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion strains with zzso zzso zzso As reported in other recent studies that have used deletion zzso to study stress responses, we observed that gene deletions resulting in the highest zzso generally are not the same as those zzso induced in response to heat zzso zzso analysis of identified genes revealed that zzso cellular zzso and zzso regulation play roles in regulating zzso and in acquired zzso However, for most of the genes identified, the molecular mechanism behind this action remains zzso In fact, a large fraction of identified genes are zzso as having unknown functions, further zzso our incomplete understanding of the response to heat zzso We suggest that survival after heat shock depends on a small number of genes that function in assessing the zzso health of the cell and/or regulate its growth in a changing zzso
