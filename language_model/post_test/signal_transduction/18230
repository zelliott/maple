zzso type 1 zzso uses the zzso receptors zzso and zzso as zzso for entry into target zzso Here we show that the zzso envelope zzso zzso activates multiple zzso signaling responses in primary human zzso which are important targets for zzso in zzso zzso from both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso opened zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso These signals were zzso by zzso and zzso because zzso lacking zzso failed to respond to zzso and an inhibitor of zzso blocked zzso current zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, also activated zzso and zzso currents in zzso but zzso zzso channel zzso was unique to zzso zzso zzso levels were also elevated by zzso The patterns of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso were zzso similar but zzso zzso as zzso zzso activated the zzso current more zzso zzso zzso currents that were approximately zzso greater in zzso and elevated zzso zzso to higher peak and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso primary zzso evoked similar current responses as the corresponding zzso zzso Thus, the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso evokes complex and distinct signaling responses in primary zzso and zzso signals differ from those activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling responses of zzso to zzso may zzso zzso steps of infection and cell functions apart from zzso
