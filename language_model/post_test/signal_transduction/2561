The differentiation of zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso cells is regulated in part by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is one of the zzso signals implicated in the control of several aspects of retinal development, including proliferation and cell zzso The way cells interpret zzso signals such as zzso is influenced by the level of expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in some cell zzso To address the influence of zzso level on responses of retinal zzso cells to zzso additional copies of zzso were introduced in zzso and in zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso low zzso of zzso zzso proliferation whereas high zzso biased choice of cell fate, zzso differentiation into rod zzso while promoting differentiation into zzso zzso zzso We report here that introduction of extra zzso into zzso cells in zzso reduced the concentration of zzso required for changes in rod and zzso cell differentiation but did not enhance zzso Introduction of extra zzso in zzso increased the proportion of clones that contained zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso level is normally zzso These findings demonstrate that responsiveness to zzso signals during development can be modulated by the introduction of additional zzso and suggest that the level of expression of receptors for these signals contributes to the regulation of cell zzso
