To clarify the molecular mechanism and significance of zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression in rat zzso cells by Northern zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso zzso in 1 zzso and this reduction was recovered by zzso of zzso cells with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was measured by zzso specific for each zzso Reduction of zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso These results, taken together, suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso by exposure to zzso in cultured zzso zzso This zzso zzso is zzso by zzso production through zzso zzso
