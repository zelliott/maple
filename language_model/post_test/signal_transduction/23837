Loss of zzso contact characterizes zzso cells in benign and zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso from zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrate zzso zzso elevated Ras activity, and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that brain zzso binding protein zzso is elevated in an zzso zzso of zzso zzso mouse zzso cells zzso zzso that grows away from zzso zzso expression was not affected by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso was also detected in zzso cell lines derived from zzso double zzso mice and human zzso zzso expression was induced in normal zzso cells following zzso with zzso but not zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was not inhibited by zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression is downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled process outgrowth from zzso zzso cells and restored interaction with zzso without affecting cell proliferation or zzso Following injury, zzso expression was induced in normal zzso nerves when zzso zzso cells remodeled their zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso by zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso interactions in normal peripheral nerve and peripheral nerve zzso
