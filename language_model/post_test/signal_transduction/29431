The retinal zzso characterized with death of retinal zzso cells is a pathological hallmark and the final common zzso of various zzso zzso Thus, there is an urgent need for identifying potential therapeutic compounds for retinal zzso zzso has been suggested to be zzso for central zzso by acting as an zzso and a calcium zzso In this study, we tested the effects of zzso on the viability of both zzso and zzso cells in mixed rat retinal cell cultures during a long-term zzso or following hydrogen zzso zzso Cellular and zzso analyses demonstrated that 50 zzso zzso significantly preserved zzso zzso and survival in retinal cell cultures following zzso in zzso zzso as well as lethal zzso to hydrogen zzso (10 zzso or 50 zzso for zzso zzso zzso treatments induced remarkable increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation paralleled by the loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso of zzso in the cultures efficiently attenuated the signs of zzso stress and retained abundance of zzso and zzso in association with cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso or zzso significantly increased the vulnerability of retinal zzso or the number of zzso cells in the cultures, respectively, whereas zzso zzso zzso an analog of zzso promoted cell survival in cultures under hydrogen zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso protect retinal cells through multiple pathways and might be a potential therapeutic candidate for retinal protection in certain zzso zzso
