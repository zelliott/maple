zzso oxide zzso is a gaseous free radical involved in many zzso zzso During zzso stress, zzso its derivatives and zzso are zzso Considering zzso zzso role in the central nervous system zzso and toxicity of zzso we investigated the effect of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in rat cortical zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso for various periods of time zzso decreased specific binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, reaching the steady state after zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso addition, abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso for zzso caused a significant zzso increase of the zzso value for zzso without changing the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso before zzso addition increased the zzso effect while the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso treatment with zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in a zzso zzso This treatment influenced zzso binding affinity for zzso activated zzso proteins in cortical zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways by affecting zzso zzso protein zzso
