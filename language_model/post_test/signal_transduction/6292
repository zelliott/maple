zzso that are able to zzso cleave zzso at specific positions have been identified in animals and zzso The first such zzso to be identified was a zzso zzso zzso from zzso which zzso the zzso step of zzso acid zzso Similar zzso are necessary for the synthesis of vitamin A in animals and other zzso molecules in zzso In the model plant, zzso there are nine hypothetical proteins that share some degree of sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Five of these proteins appear to be involved in zzso acid zzso The remaining four proteins are expected to catalyze other zzso zzso reactions and have been named zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothetical zzso zzso and zzso are the most disparate members of this protein family in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso in zzso result from zzso in zzso and zzso Both zzso display a dramatic increase in lateral branching and are believed to be impaired in the synthesis of an unidentified compound that zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso function of zzso the protein was expressed in zzso strains of zzso zzso The activity of zzso was also tested in zzso with several of the most common plant zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso protein zzso a specific zzso zzso of zzso to produce the 10 black triangle zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso in a zzso strain of zzso coli, the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso product appears to result from a secondary zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The sequential zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso are likely the initial steps in the synthesis of a zzso signaling zzso that is necessary for the regulation lateral zzso
