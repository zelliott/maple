More than 25 years have passed since zzso zzso in Ras genes were identified in DNA from human zzso In this time, it has been established beyond doubt that these zzso play a direct role in causing cancer, and do so in collaboration with a number of other zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso Ras proteins are resistant to zzso by zzso zzso of bound zzso and therefore signal zzso Efforts to develop therapies that block Ras zzso function directly have zzso The high affinity of Ras proteins for zzso has discouraged attempts to identify zzso Ras processing zzso have been targeted, but unfortunately, zzso the Ras protein that plays the major role in human cancer, has proven zzso to these zzso Further progress has been made with drugs that block downstream zzso the approved drug zzso zzso zzso zzso and its clinical benefits in liver cancer are greatest in patients in which the zzso activated protein zzso zzso signaling zzso is zzso Other zzso zzso zzso as well as drugs that block zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and various steps in the zzso 3' zzso pathway, are under zzso Here we will discuss the complexities of Ras signaling and their effects on targeting the Ras zzso in the zzso
