During development, zzso of zzso zzso zzso cause zzso defects of zzso and neural crest derivatives including the zzso zzso We used an zzso zzso cell line, zzso able to fully convert into zzso within 12 days, to assess the involvement of zzso receptors during zzso zzso On day 5 of the zzso program, immediately before zzso zzso the cells selectively implement zzso receptors zzso which remain functional until terminal zzso In zzso zzso the zzso exhibits a zzso activity leading to zzso zzso oxide zzso release and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of this intrinsic activity affects the efficiency of zzso by decreasing calcium incorporation within the zzso by zzso zzso bone zzso zzso involves both NO and zzso signaling zzso Moreover, between day 5 and day 10, at the beginning of mineral deposition, the zzso promotes zzso zzso production through zzso zzso zzso zzso From day 10 zzso when C1 zzso undergo conversion into zzso cells, zzso activity is zzso zzso these observations indicate that the zzso contributes in an zzso manner to zzso differentiation and highlight a switch in the downstream targets of the zzso at the terminal stage of the zzso Finally, in addition to its zzso function, the zzso responds to zzso by increasing NO production and AA zzso These findings raise concern regarding the use of zzso drugs that may interfere with bone metabolism in zzso or pathological zzso
