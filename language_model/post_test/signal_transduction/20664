Human zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso act on the same zzso zzso but it is not known whether they elicit the same cellular and molecular zzso This study compares for the first time the zzso of zzso pathways and gene expression in response to zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso of zzso production in zzso and zzso cells permanently expressing zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in primary human zzso cells zzso The expression of selected target genes was measured in the presence or absence of zzso or zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso is zzso more potent than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effect was significantly faster (10 minutes by zzso 1 hour by zzso In zzso continuous exposure to zzso doses of zzso up to 36 hours revealed that zzso zzso production is zzso and significantly higher by zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more potent and sustained by zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso removed the zzso effect on zzso zzso expression by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that: zzso zzso is more potent on zzso production, while zzso is more potent on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respond to zzso constant zzso or zzso stimulation with a fluctuating zzso production and progressive zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso target genes partly involves the zzso of different pathways depending on the zzso zzso the zzso is able to differentiate the activity of zzso and zzso
