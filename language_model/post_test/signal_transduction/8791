The cerebral zzso is a laminated sheet of zzso composed of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso During development, zzso projection zzso originating from the zzso units at the zzso surface of the embryonic cerebral zzso migrate along zzso zzso zzso zzso to form a cellular infrastructure of zzso zzso zzso columns in the zzso cortical zzso However, a zzso of these zzso related zzso also zzso a short lateral shift and transfers from their parental to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso originating from zzso zzso zzso This zzso organization acts as the primary information processing unit in the zzso The molecular mechanisms, role and significance of this lateral zzso for cortical development are not zzso Here we show that an zzso zzso A zzso and zzso A zzso zzso shift in the allocation of zzso related zzso is essential for the proper assembly of cortical zzso In contrast to the relatively uniform zzso of the developing cortical plate by various molecular markers and retrograde zzso in zzso mice, we found alternating zzso of zzso compartments in zzso knockout mice that are caused by impaired lateral zzso of zzso zzso rather than by altered cell production or zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso showed that lateral zzso depends on the expression levels of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso This so far zzso mechanism for lateral zzso zzso seems to be essential for the proper zzso of zzso types in the cortical zzso which, when zzso might contribute to zzso disorders associated with abnormal zzso zzso
