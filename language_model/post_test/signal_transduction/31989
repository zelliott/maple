The transport of zzso receptors from the cell body to zzso is essential during zzso development and may contribute to the regulation of synaptic strength in the mature nervous zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso positively regulates the abundance of zzso zzso receptors at zzso in the zzso nerve zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we identify a zzso family motor zzso in a zzso zzso screen for genes that regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso have decreased abundance of zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso functions before zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso exhibit decreased zzso flux of zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso suggests that they function in the same zzso to regulate zzso in the zzso Interestingly, zzso accumulates in cell bodies of zzso but not zzso zzso However, zzso does accumulate in zzso cell bodies if zzso degradation in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This study identifies zzso zzso as a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso trafficking and reveals a cellular control mechanism by which zzso cargo is targeted for degradation in the absence of its zzso
