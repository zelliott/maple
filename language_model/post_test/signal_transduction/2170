The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in a wide variety of signal zzso zzso yet despite the nearly ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso mice show only one major zzso caused by an intrinsic zzso in zzso the cells responsible for zzso zzso To explore further the role of zzso both in zzso and other cell types, we have generated transgenic mice that express the zzso and zzso versions of the chicken zzso zzso from the promoter of zzso resistant acid zzso zzso a gene that is expressed highly in zzso We demonstrate here that expression of a zzso zzso in only a limited number of zzso can fully rescue the zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of zzso zzso of zzso also reduces zzso in zzso animals and partially zzso a zzso in zzso organization observed in zzso zzso These results suggest that there are essential zzso functions for zzso in zzso zzso examination of zzso from these mice suggest that zzso may function in part by recruiting or zzso other zzso zzso
