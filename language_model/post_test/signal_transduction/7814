zzso zzso zzso is now considered an zzso gaseous mediator, which has been demonstrated to be involved in many inflammatory zzso However, the mechanism of its zzso function remains zzso In the present study, we used zzso human zzso cell line zzso to investigate the effects of zzso in zzso on zzso We found that treatment with the zzso zzso sodium zzso led to significant increases in the zzso expression and protein production of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed further by the zzso of zzso expression on the cell zzso We also observed that zzso could induce a rapid degradation of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso and this effect was attenuated by Bay zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso Furthermore, zzso of cells with Bay zzso substantially inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso We also found that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso a selective zzso zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest for the first time that zzso stimulates the zzso of human zzso with the generation of zzso zzso and this response is, at least zzso through the zzso signaling zzso
