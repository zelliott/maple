zzso precursor cells zzso are generated from multiple zzso zzso in the zzso in zzso succession from zzso to zzso Previous studies showed that zzso signaling zzso the differentiation of zzso into mature zzso Here we explored the hypothesis that zzso signaling limits the generation of zzso from neural zzso during zzso zzso We manipulated zzso signaling in mouse neural zzso cultures and found that zzso signaling influences zzso cell autonomously to alter the production of zzso and that zzso zzso signaling in these cultures limits the efficiency of generating zzso from neural zzso To examine these events in zzso we zzso a soluble zzso inhibitor or a zzso zzso regulator into embryonic mouse zzso zzso zone before the usual onset of zzso production and showed that decreasing zzso signaling in cortical zzso results in early production of zzso Our studies indicate that zzso signaling influences the timing and extent of zzso production in the developing zzso
