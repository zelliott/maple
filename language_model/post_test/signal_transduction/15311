zzso protein zzso an zzso and zzso zzso with an important role in zzso trafficking, is markedly induced in zzso zzso and may regulate the zzso zzso 

To study the role of zzso in cardiac repair and zzso 

We studied cardiac repair in zzso and zzso zzso mice undergoing zzso zzso protocols and examined the effects of zzso on cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso animals had comparable acute zzso zzso However, the absence of zzso resulted in a zzso early zzso response and delayed contraction of the zzso zzso zzso hearts exhibited zzso early zzso followed by rapid wall thinning during zzso maturation associated with zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso mice had comparable zzso zzso the absence of zzso was associated with marked zzso in the cellular content of the zzso zzso zzso had more intense zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso but exhibited reduced recruitment of the zzso of zzso T zzso and zzso cells that expressed zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not zzso cardiac zzso proliferation and zzso but significantly inhibited basic zzso growth zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced growth zzso wound contraction in zzso collagen zzso 

zzso zzso is an essential zzso signal that regulates the cellular composition of the healing zzso and promotes wound contraction, attenuating adverse zzso zzso actions may be due, at least in part, to direct effects on zzso migration and zzso
