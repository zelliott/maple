zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso the surface expression of major zzso class II zzso zzso molecules on zzso via modulating class II zzso zzso protein of the host zzso This results in decreased zzso function of zzso T zzso In zzso zzso is transcribed by the promoters I zzso and IV zzso and the corresponding gene products are referred to as type I and type IV zzso zzso Earlier studies have mainly focused on zzso transcribed by zzso however, these studies also showed that type IV zzso expression was transient and zzso for zzso II zzso In the present study, we observed that the zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso type I as well as type IV zzso but, interestingly, zzso of type I zzso was found to be independent of zzso zzso zzso whereas that of type IV was zzso zzso Moreover, we also present evidence to show that zzso zzso was regulated via zzso of the zzso We found that zzso caused a decrease in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as well as in the levels of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso locus in zzso We also found the involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso In conclusion, our studies suggest that zzso could inhibit the expression of type I and type IV zzso through different zzso Furthermore, zzso could signal through putative receptors other than zzso and that the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was regulated at the zzso zzso
