zzso migration into the central nervous system is a key stage in the development of multiple zzso While much has been zzso regarding the sequential steps of zzso capture, zzso and migration across the zzso the molecular basis of zzso zzso is only just being zzso It is now recognized that zzso zzso between the immune cell and zzso is an essential element in zzso zzso during both normal immune surveillance and under inflammatory zzso The induction of various zzso networks, through engagement of cell surface molecules such as zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso molecules on the zzso cell, play a major role in determining the pattern and route of zzso zzso In this review we discuss the extent of our knowledge regarding zzso migration across the zzso barrier and in particular the zzso cell zzso pathways contributing to this zzso
