zzso plays an important role during zzso and zzso transformation as crucial steps in the development of human zzso In a cellular model of zzso zzso zzso the human disease, zzso occurred independent of the zzso of zzso but through the zzso alternative lengthening of zzso zzso In this zzso model, additional zzso of zzso led to in zzso transformation and zzso of zzso with homogeneous zzso zzso in already immortalized oral zzso zzso cells zzso More interestingly, zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso This strongly suggested a role for zzso in tumor progression in addition to just zzso zzso and zzso an immortalized zzso zzso we sought to identify the regulatory mechanisms involved in this zzso of zzso and in zzso transformation induced by zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso expression and activity are induced through both direct zzso of zzso by zzso as well as zzso zzso regulation involving zzso as a key zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhanced cell cycle progression and proliferation via zzso and zzso of zzso Whereas zzso was induced by zzso in zzso transformation was associated with zzso zzso supporting an additional role for zzso in tumor progression besides zzso zzso
