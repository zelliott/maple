The effect of the zzso zzso and zzso on zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and their degree of specificity was zzso zzso but not zzso was found to inhibit binding of zzso zzso growth factor zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso This effect was a result of zzso and zzso reduction of zzso number and zzso Neither compound directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso both inhibited the zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso 100 zzso and 10 zzso respectively), they also had comparable effects on DNA synthesis in response to zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso When tested in proliferation zzso using cells expressing differing numbers of zzso the growth zzso effects of both compounds were independent of zzso zzso We conclude that, although zzso and zzso both inhibit zzso zzso they do not act specifically on the zzso zzso Moreover, their mechanisms of action do not appear to be zzso
