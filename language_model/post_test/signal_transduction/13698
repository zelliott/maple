The zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso expressed in T cells, zzso cells, and zzso is known to regulate zzso zzso signaling leading to zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we demonstrate that, upon induction of active experimental zzso zzso zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice developed a significantly milder clinical course of zzso and showed markedly less inflammatory infiltrates in the zzso than zzso zzso Moreover, zzso recipients failed to induce zzso after adoptive transfer of zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso T zzso In addition, ex zzso fully activated zzso T cells induced significantly less severe zzso in zzso zzso The ameliorated disease in the absence of zzso was not due to expansion or deletion of a particular T cell subset but rather because of a strong reduction of all inflammatory zzso populations invading the zzso Monitoring the zzso transferred zzso T cells over time demonstrated that they accumulated within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso transfer of complete zzso bone zzso or even bone zzso of zzso zzso mice was unable to zzso zzso in the zzso animals, indicating that the milder zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso transferred zzso accumulated at zzso vessels in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus, our data identify a T zzso mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
