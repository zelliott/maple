Members of the bacterial and zzso zzso cluster zzso assembly machinery include the so-called zzso zzso zzso which support the assembly of a subset of zzso zzso The human zzso encodes two zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso which are related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso To test the cellular role of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were depleted for any of these proteins by zzso interference zzso zzso cells contained zzso swollen and enlarged zzso that were virtually devoid of zzso zzso demonstrating the importance of these proteins for zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso zzso including zzso respiratory complex I, and zzso acid zzso were diminished following depletion of the three zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso content were zzso We further provide evidence against a zzso and direct zzso protein maturation function of zzso and zzso in the zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are specifically involved in the maturation of zzso zzso proteins functioning late in the zzso assembly zzso
