zzso type of zzso receptors zzso zzso synaptic transmission in a zzso regulated manner at several zzso in the zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso transmission at zzso zzso in the zzso and these receptors are zzso active during early zzso zzso Here we use the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso to further characterize the role of zzso in the zzso of synaptic transmission and plasticity in area zzso during the first two weeks of zzso We find that the zzso effect of zzso on evoked zzso is smaller in the zzso zzso than in the juvenile zzso rat zzso due to zzso activity of zzso in the zzso Further, in the zzso but not juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso independent transmission zzso and its effects are dependent on protein zzso C zzso zzso depression of zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso component of long-term depression zzso In contrast, at zzso zzso prevents zzso indirectly via zzso zzso These data show that zzso signaling mechanisms are zzso regulated and suggest distinct functional role for zzso in the zzso of synaptic transmission and plasticity at different stages of zzso
