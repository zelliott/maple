In advanced stages of zzso melanoma zzso zzso to the zzso are frequently zzso Few results are available on zzso factors and zzso features involved in the process of invasion and zzso of circulating zzso cells into the zzso A direct comparison of remote zzso found in different locations of the same patient might help to identify such zzso For this purpose, we screened a panel of zzso cell cultures, which had been established from patients with surgically removed zzso zzso of the zzso for expression and regulation of zzso zzso The results were compared with standard controls and cultures established from zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso No significant differences were observed for expression of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was found in all zzso samples and in fewer than 50% of zzso derived zzso zzso was found to have a weak zzso effect in all zzso cultures, except normal zzso However, in zzso zzso cultures, zzso with zzso reduced expression of zzso to zzso to zzso of the level in zzso zzso The presence and regulation of zzso differs between zzso cells derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso might be a candidate zzso zzso involved in the formation of zzso zzso of zzso
