zzso peptides are an ancient acquisition in zzso suggesting a crucial biological role for these family of zzso Indeed, a key function of these hormones in cell metabolism and growth has been firmly zzso However, their significance in zzso physiology is less zzso although progress in recent years on the zzso properties of insulin and zzso growth factor I zzso supports an important role for these hormones in brain zzso During development, appropriate zzso input is critical in brain growth while the role of insulin at this stage, although not well defined yet, may be related to the control of zzso zzso In the adult, zzso is a zzso signal involved in numerous processes to maintain adequate brain cell functions, while the role of insulin is better known in relation to the control of food consumption and zzso zzso The potential involvement of zzso in brain diseases associated with zzso death is strongly supported by its zzso zzso Further, the unexplained high zzso of zzso metabolism zzso in brain diseases makes also insulin a strong candidate in zzso zzso Because mounting evidence suggests a complementary role of insulin and zzso in the brain, unveiling the cellular and molecular pathways involved in brain zzso actions is helping to establish potentially new therapeutic targets and its exploitation may lead to new treatments for a wide array of brain zzso
