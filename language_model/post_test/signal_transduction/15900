In zzso many receptors must be localized correctly to zzso or zzso for proper zzso During development, receptors for nerve growth and guidance are targeted to zzso and localized to growth cones where zzso zzso by zzso results in promotion or zzso of zzso zzso Signaling outcomes downstream of zzso binding are determined by the location, levels and residence times of receptors on the zzso plasma zzso zzso the mechanisms controlling the trafficking of these receptors are crucial to the proper wiring of zzso zzso proteins accumulate on the zzso surface by multiple routes, including polarized sorting in the trans zzso network, sorting in zzso and removal by zzso zzso also play important roles in the signaling pathways for both zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso derived from zzso are important for signaling from growth cones to cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can use zzso zzso at the growth cone for their respective retrograde zzso In addition to retrograde transport of zzso zzso transport to zzso in zzso also occurs for several zzso including the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also depends on zzso zzso for its zzso zzso In this review, we will focus on receptors whose trafficking has been reported to be modulated by the zzso family of zzso regulators, namely zzso zzso and zzso We will first zzso the pathways underlying the zzso transport of these proteins and then discuss the potential roles of zzso in zzso their zzso
