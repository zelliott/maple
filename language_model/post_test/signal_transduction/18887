The zzso membrane protein zzso has been suggested to regulate cancer invasion and zzso by initiating signaling zzso The zzso signaling pathways involved in this regulation remain to be zzso In this study, we found that stable zzso of zzso into zzso human melanoma cells lacking zzso expression significantly increased cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The enhancement of cell zzso and zzso expression by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and small interfering zzso targeted to focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting an essential role of these signaling components in zzso signaling zzso Also, zzso zzso expression was shown to be zzso by zzso binding to zzso sites in the zzso gene promoter, indicating zzso zzso by zzso signaling zzso Meanwhile, zzso was found to be associated with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso of associated zzso was a prerequisite for zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso on one cell was shown to bind to neighboring cells expressing zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso interacting zzso The zzso interactions of zzso increased zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso cells, along with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso melanoma cells with zzso zzso were also shown to respond to zzso zzso interactions for the induction of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso interactions of zzso stimulate zzso signaling to zzso through zzso pathways in human melanoma cells, leading to enhanced cell zzso and zzso zzso
