Numerous studies have suggested that growth factors and zzso play an important role in the survival of injured zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways activated by growth factors and zzso receptors play an important role in zzso survival or for the zzso of zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso is known to play a major role in zzso zzso zzso we first examined regulation of zzso gene expression following peripheral nerve injury by in zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso nerve was zzso unilaterally and the zzso levels for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined in the zzso nucleus at zzso times ranging from 1 to 35 zzso Among the zzso family members, zzso and zzso were substantially increased in injured zzso zzso whereas no significant increases were observed for zzso and zzso These changes were further confirmed by zzso using zzso specific to zzso and zzso In addition, we examined the zzso and zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso which are common to various zzso zzso Among these, zzso zzso was zzso after nerve zzso This was also confirmed by in zzso zzso These results suggest that the injured zzso prepares the molecular machinery involved in certain zzso zzso zzso pathways at an early phase of the zzso process, accelerating for the zzso to respond to zzso that may regulate survival and/or zzso zzso
