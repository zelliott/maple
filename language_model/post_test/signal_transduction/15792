zzso of pathways downstream of zzso represents a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of zzso death in the USA, since zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways is found frequently in this disease and is associated with poor zzso Taking advantage of a panel of human zzso cell lines and specific zzso of zzso and/or zzso we systematically address the question whether zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways offers advantages over zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We observe greater overall zzso of cell lines to dual zzso compared to targeting zzso zzso However, we find that dual zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to a greater extent than zzso of each target zzso In agreement with this, we show that combined administration of zzso and zzso zzso results in increased zzso activity in zzso and in zzso in models of pancreatic zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor used in our in zzso studies, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in a variety of cancer types, while the zzso inhibitor zzso is a widely used zzso zzso Thus, our studies provide rationale for clinical development of combinations of these compounds for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
