In cardiovascular regulation, zzso zzso zzso activity has been shown to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation by promoting cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso migration remains zzso We aim to zzso the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso severely zzso human zzso migration in a zzso zzso and directional migration zzso in response to zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso in the zzso process during zzso retinal zzso development attenuated zzso coverage over the major zzso branches as compared with sham zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso which subsequently promoted the formation of inactive zzso zzso This compromised zzso zzso and zzso the downstream cascade of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso could reverse the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso 

These findings identify a potent zzso function of zzso in zzso a mechanism that involves zzso and zzso zzso followed by assembly of inactive zzso complexes that zzso effective zzso zzso
