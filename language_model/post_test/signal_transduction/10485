There is increasing evidence that zzso oxide zzso which was first identified as a unique zzso molecular zzso in animals, plays an important role in diverse zzso processes in zzso Recent progress that has zzso our understanding of NO zzso functions in plants, with special emphasis on zzso zzso is discussed zzso Several studies, based on plants with altered zzso have recently provided genetic evidence for the importance of NO in gene zzso For a general overview of which gene expression levels are altered by zzso two studies, involving large-scale zzso analyses of zzso zzso using custom-made or commercial zzso were zzso Furthermore, a comprehensive transcript profiling by zzso zzso length zzso zzso revealed a number of zzso zzso genes that are involved in signal zzso disease resistance and stress response, photosynthesis, cellular zzso and basic zzso In addition, NO affects the expression of numerous genes in other plant species such as tobacco or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso that lead to the zzso or suppression of these genes have not yet been zzso Several lines of evidence point to an zzso between NO and salicylic acid zzso in plant zzso Recent evidence suggests that NO also plays a role in the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso NO donors affect both zzso zzso synthesis and zzso or zzso expression of zzso zzso One of the major challenges ahead is to determine how the correct specific response is zzso despite shared use of the NO signal and, in some cases, its downstream second zzso
