zzso The aim of the present work was to determine zzso modifications in the cascade of zzso events coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso For this purpose, zzso activities were measured on zzso incubated frontal cortical slices from mice exposed to zzso zzso for 72 zzso zzso We found that zzso induced zzso in several cerebral zzso zzso activities: it increased zzso oxide zzso zzso but it decreased both membrane protein zzso C zzso and zzso C zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to increase zzso zzso to greater values in hypoxic zzso than those found in zzso zzso Furthermore, a greater zzso of zzso in response to zzso was observed in hypoxic zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Besides, zzso induced a drastic reduction of zzso activity in hypoxic zzso at zzso that zzso this zzso activity in zzso zzso In the latter, zzso is obtained only with high zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results pointed to a zzso zzso zzso induced by hypoxic zzso zzso The possibility that these effects would account for a zzso mechanism to diminish zzso hyperactivity, probably protecting for NO zzso action in hypoxic brain, is also zzso
