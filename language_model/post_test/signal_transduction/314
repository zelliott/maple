zzso play a central role in defense against infection, but the mechanisms promoting zzso recruitment and zzso remain incompletely zzso Defense against zzso zzso an zzso bacterial zzso requires in zzso zzso induction and zzso recruitment of zzso zzso from bone zzso to sites of zzso zzso we demonstrate that infection of bone zzso zzso with virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in two zzso The first phase is zzso zzso low-level production of zzso and is dependent on zzso zzso The second phase promotes zzso higher level zzso zzso and is dependent on signaling via the type I zzso zzso zzso Although attenuated zzso zzso strains that remain confined to the zzso trigger zzso signals and induce low-level zzso zzso only zzso bacteria promote zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso signaling does not impair early zzso zzso from bone zzso and recruitment to infected zzso Loss of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, results in deficient zzso zzso recruitment and increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that distinct but partially overlapping signal zzso pathways provide zzso that ensures optimal zzso recruitment to sites of microbial zzso
