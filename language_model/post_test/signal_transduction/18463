zzso is essential for tumor zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso factor composed of two zzso zzso and zzso plays a key role in this process, zzso zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso The zzso alpha zzso are critically regulated by oxygen and are also modulated by growth zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly vascular tumor that releases large amounts of zzso and for which we have recently described an essential role for the zzso growth factor zzso zzso We therefore investigated the expression of zzso alpha zzso in zzso from zzso tumors and their zzso by zzso in zzso a zzso cell zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso increased through the tumor development with highest expression in the late zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced zzso of both zzso alpha zzso The induction suggests a translation mechanism as documented by zzso chase experiment coupled with constant zzso levels as evaluated by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was followed by an increase in zzso function as assessed both by reporter gene zzso and by induction of zzso target gene expression zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or with zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso diminishes the zzso and zzso induction of both zzso alpha zzso 

These novel findings show the zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and suggest a coordinated contribution by these pathways to the characteristic vascular zzso of this zzso
