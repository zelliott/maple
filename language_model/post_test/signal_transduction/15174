zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso state upon several differentiated cell types, generating induced zzso stem cells zzso zzso zzso derivation is highly inefficient, and the underlying mechanisms are largely zzso This low efficiency suggests the existence of additional cooperative factors whose identification is critical for understanding zzso In addition, the therapeutic use of zzso relies on the development of efficient zzso means of factor delivery, and although a handful of replacement molecules have been identified, their use yields a further reduction to the already low zzso efficiency zzso Thus, the identification of compounds that enhance rather than solely replace the function of the zzso factors will be of great zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso signaling zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso by enabling faster, more efficient induction of zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling blocks zzso In addition to exhibiting a strong cooperative effect, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the requirement for zzso zzso or zzso highlighting its dual role as a cooperative and replacement zzso The identification of a highly characterized zzso operating in zzso induction will open new avenues for zzso dissection of the zzso zzso
