The zzso zzso zzso zzso is amplified in approximately zzso of human breast zzso zzso of the translation initiation factor, zzso zzso global protein synthesis and activates a stress signaling and growth zzso zzso We have shown that forced zzso of zzso can suppress head and neck, zzso zzso and multiple myeloma tumor growth and/or zzso Here we explore whether zzso zzso zzso zzso and whether forced zzso of the latter can antagonize zzso deregulation of zzso zzso zzso 

We tested whether zzso signaling influenced zzso signaling and whether enhanced zzso of the latter affected zzso zzso zzso zzso We obtained stable zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso via zzso delivery or zzso tumor cells from zzso zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to analyze the effects of zzso zzso on zzso signaling and the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso cells formed zzso zzso structures resembling zzso while zzso zzso induced invasive zzso In these structures we found that zzso but not the zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso gene zzso This occurred without apparent zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or induction of its downstream target zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso was sufficient to inhibit zzso and zzso as well as zzso deregulation of zzso zzso This was linked to enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso induction of zzso and zzso clearing in zzso and to zzso of zzso D1 levels and subsequent proliferation in zzso zzso 

Depending on the strength of zzso signaling there is a differential regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso conditions zzso zzso from zzso zzso However, this signal was restored by zzso treatment in zzso expressing zzso cells as these zzso structures underwent zzso zzso In zzso structures zzso is not induced by zzso and instead a state of zzso with reduced proliferation was zzso zzso that stabilize zzso levels may be effective in treating zzso positive zzso without severely zzso normal tissue function and zzso
