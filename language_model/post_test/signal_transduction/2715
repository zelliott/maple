zzso signaling by the four members of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso is implicated in the genesis or progression of human zzso However, efforts to analyze signaling by these receptors have been hampered by the diversity of zzso and extensive zzso cross zzso We have expressed the four human zzso family zzso zzso and in zzso combinations, in a zzso cell line zzso and investigated the range of interactions activated by the zzso growth factor zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso The results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the response of this zzso family to a single zzso zzso This zzso induced complex patterns of zzso zzso zzso and regulation of zzso cell survival and zzso These data demonstrate the existence of several previously zzso zzso interactions driven by zzso
