The zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in the human zzso cell line zzso and contributes to zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanisms are poorly zzso We used the zzso technique to demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to zzso and thereby stimulates zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso currents within 30 zzso The zzso currents were zzso zzso and were also observed in zzso zzso However, when cells were zzso with zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso The zzso zzso response to zzso was independent of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and was blocked by both zzso and the zzso C inhibitor zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso initiated a rapid formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso the same zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso required the intact zzso because the effects were zzso by zzso zzso C, which removes the zzso from the cell zzso The prevention of zzso zzso zzso synthesis and interference with zzso zzso to the cell surface using zzso also abolished zzso zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso binds to zzso and stimulates the production of zzso via a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn zzso zzso from zzso stores, which leads to the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso
