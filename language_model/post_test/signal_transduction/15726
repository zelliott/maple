The zzso has the capacity to zzso many zzso and zzso The zzso fin is one of the most convenient zzso to approach zzso due to its accessibility, simple structure and fast zzso In this work we investigate how the zzso capacity is affected by zzso fin amputations and by experimental zzso that block zzso 

We show that consecutive repeated amputations of zzso zzso fin do not reduce its zzso capacity and do not compromise any of the successive zzso steps: wound healing, zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso of zzso completely blocks fin zzso zzso if these fins were zzso at the zzso temperature, the zzso zzso fin reached the original zzso even after several rounds of consecutive zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We show that the zzso fin has an almost unlimited capacity to zzso Even after zzso of zzso caused by the loss of zzso zzso a new zzso zzso the zzso capacity within the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso formation does not depend on a pool of zzso cells that require zzso zzso for their zzso
