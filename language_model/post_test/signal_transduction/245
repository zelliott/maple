zzso X syndrome is caused by a lack of fragile X mental zzso protein zzso due to zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso receptors zzso in the central nervous system contribute to higher brain functions including zzso persistent pain, and mental zzso Our recent study has shown that zzso of Group I zzso zzso zzso in anterior zzso zzso zzso a key region for brain cognitive and executive zzso zzso signaling pathways could be involved in the regulation of zzso by Group I zzso In this study we demonstrate that stimulating Group I zzso activates zzso protein zzso IV zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of adult mice zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by stimulating Group I zzso is zzso The enhancement occurs at the zzso level as the zzso zzso level was further elevated compared with zzso zzso Using pharmacological approaches, we found that zzso of zzso could zzso the zzso of zzso by Group I zzso zzso contribute to the regulation of zzso by Group I zzso probably through zzso zzso element binding protein zzso zzso as manipulation of zzso could simultaneously cause the change of zzso zzso induced by Group I zzso zzso Our study has provided strong evidence for zzso as a molecular link between Group I zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and may help us to zzso the zzso of fragile X zzso
