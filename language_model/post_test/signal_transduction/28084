zzso A5 is an zzso zzso zzso used for the treatment of various zzso Previous work has shown that zzso A5 exerts its zzso effects on tumor zzso This was to study the signal zzso pathways that might exert the zzso effects of zzso A5 on tumor cells, as well as to examine the possibility of lower dosing of such drug in zzso treatment with other compounds in zzso 

zzso A5 was applied on a human oral zzso zzso cell line, human oral zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activity was determined by the presence of DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso nuclear zzso The signal zzso zzso was measured through Western zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effect was associated with the sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, suggesting that zzso plays a positive role in the death zzso zzso and zzso might exert a protection zzso from cell zzso Here, it was determined that a combination treatment of zzso A5 and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could lead to enhanced zzso The activities of zzso and zzso are required for cell survival signaling using stable cell clones expressing zzso Upon zzso A5 treatment, cells expressing zzso exhibited significant delays in the onset of zzso where the presence of zzso inhibitor enhanced cell zzso Moreover, the increased activity of zzso and zzso coincided with cell zzso The survival signals exerted by zzso most likely result from the zzso of zzso and zzso 

The zzso enhancement through such zzso treatment in zzso has revealed new therapeutic opportunities and zzso mechanisms contributing to the efficacy of existing zzso zzso
