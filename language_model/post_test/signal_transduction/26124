T cells use a highly complex signaling apparatus to discriminate between a diverse array of foreign zzso and a myriad of self zzso The precise mechanism zzso signals are communicated from the zzso T cell zzso to the zzso signal zzso machinery remains a source of intense zzso This Journal Club article highlights recent research zzso the role of the zzso family zzso zzso in T cell zzso zzso T cells contain a newly described form of zzso zzso that is both necessary and sufficient for T cell zzso but remains zzso from the T cell zzso in the absence of zzso This research allows a zzso of the mechanisms underlying T cell zzso
