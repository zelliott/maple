zzso can be caused by a variety of zzso among which zzso zzso causes one of the most common forms of zzso zzso Depending on the invading zzso the elements of the immune response triggered will zzso For most zzso such as zzso coli, zzso recruitment involves a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso pneumonia, however, zzso recruitment occurs mainly through a zzso zzso Despite decades of research on this issue, the zzso molecules involved in zzso recruitment during lung infection by zzso zzso have not been zzso We have previously shown that zzso a soluble zzso zzso can be found in lungs infected by zzso pneumoniae, but not by zzso coli, and can mediate the zzso of zzso on the zzso cell layer, zzso its role in the recruitment of zzso to lungs infected with zzso zzso In this study, using zzso zzso mice, we report further evidence of the involvement of this soluble zzso in the recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Indeed, in the absence of zzso lower numbers of zzso mainly zzso were recruited to the infected lungs during infection by zzso zzso In the case of zzso recruitment induced by lung infection with zzso coli, the number of recruited zzso was not zzso Thus, taken together, our data suggest that zzso plays a role as a soluble zzso zzso in the recruitment of zzso to lungs infected by zzso pneumoniae, which zzso zzso zzso
