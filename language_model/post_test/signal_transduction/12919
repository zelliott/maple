The zzso pH zzso regulatory mechanisms of peripheral blood human zzso and the effect of zzso acid on the activity of these mechanisms were studied by means of zzso imaging zzso of zzso zzso individual zzso zzso recover from a zzso acid load in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso recovery is highly sensitive to the zzso exchange inhibitor zzso acid zzso and minimally sensitive to the zzso exchange inhibitor zzso suggesting that it is mostly due to the action of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso removal experiments point to the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid stimulates the zzso recovery rate from a zzso acid load in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the presence of zzso zzso acid also zzso the zzso zzso induced by zzso removal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso these results indicate that zzso acid stimulates the activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but has no effect on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso
