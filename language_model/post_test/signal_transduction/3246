Evidence has suggested that zzso functions as an zzso in zzso As a consequence, changes in the inflammatory zzso are thought to promote tumor zzso Regardless of its origin, zzso inflammation has many zzso effects, such as the promotion of cell cycle zzso cell zzso cell migration and cell zzso Given that zzso a major zzso inflammatory zzso regulates zzso zzso and is zzso in glioblastoma, we sought to investigate the zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell proliferation and migration triggered by zzso and to determine the underlying mechanisms of zzso In this study, we show that zzso is a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Exposure to zzso resulted in the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso as well as a marked decrease of the zzso and migratory properties of zzso cells induced by zzso Interestingly, zzso also modulated the expression of two target genes regulated by zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced the recruitment of zzso at the zzso D1 promoter and inhibited zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Overall, these results provide new insight into the role of zzso as a blocker of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso with a potential role in the prevention and treatment of zzso
