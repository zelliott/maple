The kidney is formed by a zzso zzso interaction between two precursor zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso This interaction can be divided into three zzso attraction of the zzso bud toward the zzso maintenance of the zzso in an zzso state versus transition to an zzso state, and further differentiation into multiple zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso In this review we describe our recent findings related to each zzso A zzso nuclear zinc finger zzso zzso controls zzso bud attraction by regulating a novel zzso zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and these cells can partially zzso a three-dimensional structure in organ cultures following zzso zzso While zzso is required for further differentiation of zzso zzso structures, zzso zzso zzso in the embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso than zzso fate by shutting down the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso
