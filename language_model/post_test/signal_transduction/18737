zzso zzso shows a progressive decline in viability after entering stationary phase, a phenomenon known as zzso zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso aging and that the process is regulated by genes controlling two related zzso zzso zzso The first zzso includes the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the second zzso comprises the zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso A double zzso for zzso and zzso displayed an additive effect on zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these genes regulate related but independent zzso These zzso zzso also accumulated less zzso oxygen species and had a delayed initiation of zzso compared with zzso zzso We also found that strains carrying zzso deletion but not those with zzso deletion gained resistance to zzso stress due to exposure to zzso or zzso On the other hand, the additional increase in lifespan shown by the zzso zzso strain correlated with an increased resistance to both zzso stress and heat zzso These results underscore the importance of zzso zzso pathways and zzso oxygen species on zzso lifespan and establish zzso zzso as a new model zzso to study the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso
