Previous studies from our laboratory showed that zzso of zzso zzso is one of the triggers of zzso zzso The zzso events downstream of zzso zzso and their links to the putative final zzso of zzso are not zzso The zzso responsive zzso protein zzso is also zzso by exposure to short episodes of zzso suggesting a triggering zzso The aim of this study was to systematically investigate zzso the zzso pathways leading to zzso zzso during an zzso or zzso zzso protocol zzso changes in zzso zzso during sustained zzso and their significance in zzso zzso 

The isolated zzso working rat heart was zzso by 1 zzso 5 zzso global zzso or 3 zzso 5 zzso global zzso and zzso Drugs to manipulate zzso zzso were added 5 zzso before onset of zzso zzso and zzso hearts were subjected to 25 zzso global or 35 zzso regional zzso followed by 30 zzso zzso zzso sizes were determined using zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined by Western zzso 

Exposure of hearts to 5 zzso global zzso followed by zzso significantly increased zzso zzso This is zzso by, amongst others, release of zzso catecholamines and zzso as indicated by the use of zzso zzso Events downstream of zzso stimulation were evaluated using zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also contribute to zzso zzso as indicated by the use of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso during a zzso protocol partially attenuated zzso zzso zzso was attenuated during sustained global zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso during an zzso zzso protocol may contribute to triggering zzso while reduced zzso during sustained zzso does not appear to be associated with zzso
