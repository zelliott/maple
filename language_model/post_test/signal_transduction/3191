zzso zzso is a group of zzso inflammatory diseases of the eye, prevalent worldwide, that may cause zzso It can be limited to the eye, or associated with a systemic zzso Furthermore, patients suffering from zzso exhibit high serum and local zzso oxide zzso levels as a consequence of cellular responses to zzso privileged zzso within the eye such as zzso zzso binding protein zzso To investigate NO production zzso in zzso zzso and its implication in mechanisms of zzso zzso we first attempted to develop an experimental model of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso using the whole bovine retinal zzso zzso extract zzso and isolated zzso 

Female zzso rats zzso were divided into three experimental groups: zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso animals, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which received a subcutaneous injection, respectively, of 13 zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso in complete zzso zzso On days 7, 14 and 21 post zzso the rats were zzso zzso were assessed in plasma and in zzso of eyes using the zzso zzso Meanwhile, eyes were collected for zzso zzso 

Our results show the sensitivity of the zzso strain to both zzso and zzso zzso In fact, we observed zzso disorders affecting the retinal tissue in both models of zzso On the other hand, a significantly increased production of NO in plasma and zzso of eyes was also observed in comparison to the control zzso Moreover, we noted with interest that zzso production of NO occurs prior to the zzso of retinal zzso 

In zzso our results suggest the early involvement of NO in the mechanisms of zzso of zzso NO can be considered as a key zzso of poor prognosis in zzso zzso zzso
