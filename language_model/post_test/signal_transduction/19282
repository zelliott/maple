The retinal zzso zzso zzso is a major source for zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso at the outer zzso zzso zzso that regulate zzso synthesis at this site may help identify its normal function and its role in zzso states accompanying retinal zzso zzso is one such factor that might act on the zzso after injury and breakdown of the zzso zzso The present study was conducted to identify signaling zzso in zzso zzso synthesis and zzso in primary human zzso zzso and transformed zzso cells zzso and a possible pharmacological strategy to block excess release of zzso 

zzso zzso cells were treated with different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a time course to measure levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mature zzso was zzso zzso of secondary zzso zzso and zzso were measured and zzso inhibited to determine how zzso zzso activity lead to changes in zzso zzso 

zzso primarily acts via the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso increased both zzso and active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to increase in zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso 

zzso zzso calcium zzso and protein zzso C zzso by zzso play a minor role, if any, in zzso synthesis in zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso after zzso stimulation strongly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
