zzso signaling is essential for tooth development beyond the bud stage, but little is known about the role of zzso zzso signaling in zzso Here we compared the expression of zzso a representative of zzso zzso with that of zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the developing zzso and analyzed tooth zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit retarded tooth development beginning from zzso leading to the formation of smaller and zzso patterned teeth with a delayed zzso differentiation at zzso These defects are associated with zzso zzso and zzso expression in the dental zzso and reduced levels of cell proliferation in the dental zzso and zzso zzso tooth development and defective zzso differentiation were also observed in zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso regulates growth, zzso and zzso differentiation during zzso at least partially by modulating zzso zzso zzso
