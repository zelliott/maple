zzso is a leading risk factor for severe complications during an influenza virus zzso Women infected during their second and third trimesters are at increased risk for severe zzso zzso premature delivery, and zzso Here, we establish a zzso model of zzso influenza infection during zzso We find significantly altered innate zzso responses in pregnant mice, including decreased levels of zzso zzso and zzso at early time points of zzso We also find reduced zzso T cell activity and delayed viral zzso We further demonstrate that pregnancy levels of the zzso zzso are able to induce key zzso zzso in immune responses to the virus independently of other hormones or zzso zzso We conclude that elevated zzso levels result in an attenuated zzso immune response, and that zzso zzso occur in the context of this zzso zzso
