The fish zzso nerve zzso process takes more than 100 days after zzso and comprises four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic refinement zzso zzso and functional recovery zzso zzso We screened genes specifically zzso in each stage from zzso fish zzso The zzso for heat shock protein 70 and zzso growth zzso rapidly increased in the retinal zzso cells soon after zzso and function as zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly and zzso increased in the zzso and zzso protein zzso increased in all nuclear layers at zzso days after zzso The zzso gene has an active zzso site and a signal zzso zzso with zzso functions as a zzso factor for thin zzso This zzso effect was closely zzso by zzso acid and blocked by its zzso We propose that zzso works as a zzso zzso to supply zzso acid to damaged zzso which in turn activates target zzso We also searched for genes involved in the second stage of zzso The zzso of zzso molecules increased in retinal zzso cells at zzso days after injury and tissue zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in retinal zzso cells at zzso days after zzso They function as factors for the outgrowth of thick, long zzso Here we present a zzso hypothesis to explain molecular events during the early stages of zzso nerve zzso in zzso
