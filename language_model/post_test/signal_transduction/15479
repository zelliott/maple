zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso family, has been shown to mediate zzso zzso effects of various zzso factors in zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso is activated in the primary sensory zzso and associated zzso cells after nerve zzso However, the precise role of zzso in nerve zzso remains zzso 

This work was aimed to investigate the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso loss after zzso 

zzso zzso nerve crush was performed, and zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso injection of 300 zzso zzso zzso of zzso for 2 weeks in the inhibitor zzso For the control group, only the vehicle was given with the same zzso 

zzso was activated in the crushed zzso zzso and this was significantly reduced by the zzso In contrast, there was no zzso of zzso in the zzso spinal zzso zzso analysis revealed the similar extent of zzso loss in the two zzso In addition, the mean zzso distance in the inhibitor group was lower than that of the control zzso 

These results suggest the crucial role of zzso in nerve zzso but not sensory zzso loss after zzso
