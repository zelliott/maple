The zzso effect of zzso on T cells has been extensively zzso but its influence on the function of zzso is less zzso The data in this study demonstrated that zzso activity of B10 zzso zzso cells zzso exposed to zzso zzso was markedly suppressed as evidenced by the induction of low zzso responses and specific zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso T zzso Administration of zzso significantly prolonged survival of B10 cardiac zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso did not affect DC expression of zzso class II and zzso molecules or zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit DC zzso pathway, however, zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly zzso Indeed, zzso DC similarly displayed poor zzso zzso The zzso downstream product, zzso was also inhibited by zzso but DC dysfunction could not solely be attributed to low zzso production as DC deficient in zzso still exhibited vigorous zzso zzso zzso did not affect DC zzso zzso but markedly suppressed zzso and beta zzso which may in turn zzso DC zzso zzso zzso
