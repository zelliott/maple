We reported previously that heat or ethanol shock in zzso zzso leads to nuclear retention of most zzso zzso but heat shock zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso are efficiently exported in a process that is independent of the small zzso zzso which is essential for most zzso zzso To gain further insights into proteins essential or zzso for export of heat shock zzso in zzso zzso analyses to detect zzso and zzso of proteins were used to examine several zzso zzso strains for their ability to export heat shock zzso following zzso zzso is a zzso protein associated with nuclear pore complexes and contains zzso repeat zzso It is zzso for growth of zzso cells under normal conditions, but we report that it is essential for the export of heat shock zzso following zzso When zzso zzso was induced from a zzso promoter in the absence of stress, it was efficiently exported in a strain lacking zzso indicating that zzso is required for export of heat shock zzso only following zzso zzso a key zzso of export of zzso zzso was not required for heat shock zzso export, whereas zzso a zzso factor essential for zzso zzso export, was also required for export of heat shock zzso after zzso zzso expression of the zzso Rev zzso but not of Rev zzso led to a partial block in export of heat shock zzso following zzso The data suggest a model wherein the requirement for zzso defines the zzso export pathway, the requirement for zzso defines a zzso used for export of heat shock zzso after stress, and additional factors, including zzso and several zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required in both zzso
