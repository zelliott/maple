The vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso is necessary for eye development, though its role in signaling within eye zzso is poorly zzso We investigated this question in two transgenic mouse strains carrying a zzso acid response element zzso fused to zzso that identify regions of the zzso expressing activated zzso acid zzso zzso signaling appears in the zzso and lens zzso of zzso zzso prior to neural tube closure, when lens induction is under zzso To determine if there are interactions between zzso signaling and the zzso factor zzso also essential for lens development, we examined zzso zzso expression in Small eye zzso mice, which carry a zzso zzso zzso signaling in the eye, nose, and zzso of zzso zzso is zzso with the most severe effects in the developing zzso In zzso mice the lens zzso cannot respond to zzso zzso after zzso though it is responsive zzso the zzso and other neural zzso can respond to zzso at any zzso In zzso mice the ability of zzso lens and zzso to produce and/or zzso zzso is also zzso as zzso with a zzso cell zzso These results zzso zzso signaling in lens formation and show that zzso signaling in the developing eye is dependent upon zzso
