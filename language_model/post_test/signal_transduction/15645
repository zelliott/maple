zzso stem cells zzso are zzso adult stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of zzso zzso zzso have significant potential in tissue engineering and therapeutic zzso however, the low differentiation and proliferation efficiencies of these cells in the laboratory are fundamental obstacles to their therapeutic use, mainly zzso to the lack of information on the detailed zzso mechanisms of differentiation into distinct zzso With the aid of zzso profiling studies, we show that the expression of zzso common zzso related zzso zzso zzso is significantly decreased during the early zzso stages of zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced a dramatic increase in zzso zzso whereas its zzso led to decreased zzso differentiation in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso of the insulin zzso in turn leading to decreased zzso of the zzso protein zzso and its downstream zzso zzso (also known as zzso We propose that zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso Furthermore, our data support the possibility that zzso controls the balance between zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our findings contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms underlying zzso activity in the differentiation of zzso and suggest that zzso is a candidate target protein for the control of stem-cell zzso
