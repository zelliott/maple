The budding zzso zzso zzso is a convenient system for zzso zzso G zzso receptors zzso to the zzso response zzso to facilitate empirical zzso screening and/or zzso zzso zzso However, few studies have applied this system to define zzso zzso preferences and furnish information on zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso We thus used different zzso zzso zzso each expressing a specific human zzso zzso protein zzso and determined the pharmacology of various zzso of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso These zzso in conjunction with the application of quantitative models of zzso and zzso revealed that zzso was a zzso zzso that selectively coupled to zzso zzso and zzso whereas the novel compound, zzso zzso was a zzso zzso that selectively coupled to zzso zzso the latter finding suggested that zzso might be functionally zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso was also determined at the various zzso zzso experiments performed in zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells monitoring zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 or zzso zzso zzso zzso were in general agreement with the zzso data regarding zzso efficacy zzso and zzso affinity zzso but revealed that the apparent functional selectivity of zzso could be explained by differences in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that this zzso system is a useful tool for zzso zzso affinity and relative zzso but it may lack the sensitivity required to detect functional selectivity of zzso zzso
