zzso muscle gene expression is dependent on zzso associations between members of the zzso family of basic zzso zzso zzso factors and the zzso zzso factor 2 zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso interferes with the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and it has been suggested that this zzso activity of zzso is directed at an essential zzso that recognizes the DNA binding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Given that zzso proteins interact with the DNA binding zzso of zzso zzso factors to zzso regulate zzso we investigated whether members of the zzso family might serve as targets for the zzso effects of zzso on zzso We show that a zzso activated form of zzso specifically blocks DNA binding by zzso as well as its ability to cooperate with zzso and zzso to activate zzso zzso to zzso requires a zzso region of zzso immediately adjacent to the DNA binding domain that is unique to this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show that this region of zzso interacts directly with the zzso repeat region of zzso These findings reveal a novel mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso and demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso can discriminate between different members of the zzso zzso
