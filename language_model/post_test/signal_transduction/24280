In contrast to zzso cells, the clearance of zzso ones usually is an zzso process which elicits only a marginal immune zzso During zzso zzso zzso is exposed on the outer leaflet of the zzso membrane and serves as target for the zzso zzso of zzso The latter is responsible for zzso zzso and the induction of zzso We were interested whether the zzso of zzso cells can be increased by masking zzso We observed that treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso V zzso significantly increased the zzso immune response against surface zzso of these zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cells were able to elicit a long lasting zzso specific zzso T zzso zzso zzso efficiently blocked the zzso of zzso cells by zzso but not by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso skewed the zzso of zzso cells towards zzso Investigation of patients with zzso diseases further supported the role of zzso surface zzso for zzso clearance of zzso zzso zzso clearance and zzso with zzso are discussed to be responsible for the development of systemic lupus zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cryptic zzso from late zzso cells in a zzso context may challenge T cell zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso debris in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso may result in the survival of zzso B zzso
