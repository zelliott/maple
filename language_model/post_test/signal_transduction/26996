A zzso for zzso zzso zzso has been shown to promote cell zzso Among human T lineage zzso zzso is expressed only on a subset of zzso being absent on mature peripheral T cells from blood, zzso and zzso zzso Among zzso zzso is selectively expressed on a subset of zzso zzso cells, and functions in zzso as shown by the ability of zzso to reduce the speed of zzso locomotion from 11 zzso to 3 zzso Although freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso lack zzso its expression is induced on day 3 of culture in a variety of conditions that support zzso as assessed by acquisition of zzso When MN zzso are cultured on plates coated with zzso expression of zzso is zzso but on zzso surfaces, its expression is transient and lost by day 7 of culture with zzso or zzso Culture of MN zzso on zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso resulted in a lack of zzso zzso Because in the absence of zzso cells, zzso is zzso the effect appears to be one of zzso Although expression of zzso by MN zzso cultured with zzso on zzso surfaces is zzso addition of zzso A resulted in prolonged zzso These observations are consistent with the view that zzso A zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood T cells zzso express zzso upon culture with zzso zzso or zzso T cells that expressed zzso after culture with zzso alone lacked zzso when zzso by zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso indicating zzso of zzso zzso Thus expression of zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso mechanism induced by stimulation through zzso A similar mechanism may operate in zzso cell zzso These results suggest the zzso of zzso during early, presumably zzso zzso zzso development, followed by its induction during zzso stages when locomotion is zzso The apparently strong negative regulatory control over zzso expression by zzso factors and by known zzso and T cell signaling molecules supports this zzso
