zzso inflammation and zzso are important contributors of progression and zzso of the zzso zzso While the role of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and its receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this process has clearly been zzso expression of the zzso zzso has only been documented on zzso and tumor zzso This study examined zzso expression in human zzso plaque and explored its implications for zzso zzso 

zzso artery zzso specimens from 10 patients with unstable plaque were stained for zzso and its specific growth factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso stained positive for zzso and zzso but not for zzso Interestingly, zzso within inflammatory zzso regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso studies confirmed the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso and cultured zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso induced zzso as determined by zzso V zzso by zzso of activated zzso 3, and by the ratio of zzso as well as by DNA zzso zzso studies of advanced human carotid zzso plaque confirmed the zzso of zzso with activated zzso 3 and zzso zzso in zzso indicating an ongoing zzso zzso 

Human zzso express zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso within advanced zzso zzso zzso in turn, mediates zzso zzso and may this way alter plaque zzso
