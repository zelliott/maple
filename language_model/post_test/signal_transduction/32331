Recent data reveal an important role for B cells in the zzso of chronic zzso zzso Patients with zzso have delayed zzso zzso and elevated zzso to zzso ratios compared to patients without zzso The mechanisms promoting and sustaining zzso zzso in this disease, however, remain zzso As zzso increases zzso zzso metabolism and survival and maintains zzso zzso zzso we performed ex zzso analyses of peripheral B cells from 51 patients who either had or did not have active zzso and were greater than 1 year from the time of zzso zzso stem cell zzso We found that B cells from patients with active zzso were in a heightened zzso state and were resistant to zzso zzso zzso treatment amplified cell size and survival in B cells from these zzso We found significantly increased signaling through zzso and zzso that associated with decreased levels of zzso zzso suggesting a zzso link between elevated zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso Thus, we identify a role for zzso in the zzso of zzso and define zzso zzso and survival pathways suitable for novel therapeutic development in zzso
