zzso stress in the central nervous system is strongly associated with zzso cell death in the zzso of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, zzso disease, and zzso lateral zzso In order to overcome the zzso damage, there are some protective signaling pathways related to zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their expression is regulated by several zzso factors and/or zzso like nuclear zzso 2 zzso related factor 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso are associated with, and in some cases, prevent zzso death in animal models of neurodegenerative zzso They are activated by zzso zzso and zzso and also by several gases such as carbon monoxide zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso These might thereby protect the brain from severe zzso damage and zzso neurodegenerative zzso In this paper, we discuss how the expression levels of these zzso zzso are zzso We also introduce recent advances in the therapeutic uses of medical gases against neurodegenerative zzso
