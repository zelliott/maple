To characterize the relationship between the expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity in a zzso model of zzso 

Adult male zzso monkeys were fed a normal or zzso zzso diet for 45 months, after which animals from the AS group were placed on a normal diet for 8 months zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was increased in arteries from animals on the AS diet and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were distributed throughout zzso vessels but predominantly zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso circulating zzso zzso was elevated in the plasma of AS monkeys but not in those on zzso zzso zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso was increased in arteries from monkeys on the AS diet and returned to normal with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso positively correlated with zzso zzso In cultured monkey smooth muscle cells, treatment with zzso zzso increased zzso expression and zzso 

These data identify zzso zzso as potential zzso of zzso resulting in part from increased vascular zzso zzso zzso
