The role of zzso signaling protein zzso in human pigmentation pathways is not definitively understood although its zzso zzso zzso in part, zzso We have reported an association of a zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso with dark hair and eye color among a group of zzso zzso J zzso zzso 2002 zzso Among 147 healthy control subjects, the frequency of the zzso was zzso We hypothesized that this zzso would occur at different zzso among different population zzso Using zzso we zzso 25 East Asian, 86 African-American, and zzso West African individuals for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was present in the West African sample at a frequency of zzso in the African-American sample at a frequency of zzso and in the East Asian sample at zzso The difference in zzso frequency among population groups was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Although the effect of the zzso zzso upon zzso function is unknown, the large difference in zzso frequency between our West African and zzso sample populations lends support to the notion that this gene may be important in human zzso
