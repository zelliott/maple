zzso zzso is a prominent feature in most forms of human zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso can directly mediate acute zzso injury in animal models, but the mechanisms of zzso zzso required for zzso zzso injury are zzso This study examined whether zzso of the zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso signaling zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso An adoptive transfer model was used in which rats were zzso with sheep zzso zzso zzso made zzso by administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and then injected with sheep zzso basement membrane zzso serum zzso zzso Animals were then given an intravenous injection of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and killed 24 h later zzso zzso The induction of zzso and zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso in zzso zzso disease was dependent on transfer of zzso Exposure of zzso to the specific zzso zzso zzso for 3 h before adoptive transfer had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso treatment of zzso caused a zzso reduction in zzso and a zzso reduction in zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso versus vehicle or zzso zzso In conclusion, this study has defined a critical role for the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso
