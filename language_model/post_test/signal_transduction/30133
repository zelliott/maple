zzso is a cell surface zzso expressed on T cells that zzso immune responses through its ability to zzso zzso zzso Even though nearly 50% of the molecular mass of zzso is zzso the zzso significance of zzso zzso is at present zzso In this report, we have investigated the function of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso When zzso was prevented through point zzso in zzso sites in zzso or reduced by zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso significantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso promoter activity greater than that induced through the stimulation of zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso resulting in diminished zzso zzso It is also suggested that zzso regulate the density of zzso zzso upon zzso with zzso The results support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso regulates zzso T cell zzso and zzso
