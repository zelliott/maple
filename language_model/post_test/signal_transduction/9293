zzso typically form a zzso network radiating from the nucleus, creating an interconnected system that supplies the cell with essential energy and zzso These zzso networks are regulated through the complex coordination of zzso fusion and distribution zzso While a number of key zzso zzso proteins have been identified, the precise mechanisms which govern their activity remain zzso Moreover, post zzso modifications including zzso zzso and zzso of the core machinery are thought to regulate both fusion and division of the zzso These proteins can undergo several different modifications depending on cellular signals, environment and energetic demands of the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso may also have dual roles in both dynamics and zzso with regulation of these proteins under tight control of the cell to ensure correct zzso The absolute reliance of the cell on a functional zzso network is highlighted in zzso which are particularly vulnerable to any changes in zzso dynamics due to their unique zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that defects in the shape or distribution of zzso correlate with the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso zzso and Parkinson's zzso This review focuses on our current understanding of the zzso zzso machinery in cell zzso zzso and zzso and the post zzso modifications that regulate these zzso
