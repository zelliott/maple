At zzso zzso cortical tension increases and cells round up, ensuring correct zzso zzso and zzso Thus, cortical tension sets up the geometric requirements of cell zzso On the contrary, cortical tension decreases during zzso divisions in mouse zzso a puzzling observation because zzso are round cells, stable in shape, that actively position their zzso We investigated the zzso leading to reduction in cortical tension and its significance for zzso zzso We document a previously zzso zzso zzso of the cortical zzso essential for first zzso zzso migration to the zzso Using zzso zzso we show that cortical tension decreases during zzso I, resulting from zzso exclusion from the cortex, and that cortical zzso zzso promotes cortical zzso These events soften and relax the zzso They are triggered by the zzso zzso and coordinated zzso zzso zzso stiffening and theoretical zzso demonstrate that a soft zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso
