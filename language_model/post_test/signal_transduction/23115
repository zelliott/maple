zzso evidence indicates that zzso of spinal zzso zzso contributes zzso to nerve injury and zzso persistent pain and chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso beta zzso in spinal zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been extensively used to treat zzso We examined the potential involvement of zzso in chronic zzso zzso tolerance and zzso of spinal zzso using zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso pain and zzso acute zzso However, the zzso zzso induced by chronic zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso also increases zzso expression in zzso zzso which is abolished in zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso treatment increases zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the increased zzso and zzso expression is abolished in zzso zzso zzso is also sufficient to induce zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso results in zzso of zzso and zzso in spinal zzso but not zzso of zzso calcium binding adapter zzso 1 in spinal zzso Finally, zzso zzso elicits persistent mechanical zzso which is inhibited by the zzso toxin zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso these data suggest an important role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso pain zzso and zzso zzso
