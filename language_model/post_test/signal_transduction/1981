zzso zzso zzso channels play a central role in the conversion of sensory information, such as light and zzso into primary electrical zzso We have zzso the zzso channel from bovine zzso and have studied it using electron zzso and image zzso We present the structure of the channel to 35 A zzso This three-dimensional reconstruction provides insight into the architecture of the zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso which initiate the response to zzso zzso below the zzso part of the channel, attached by narrow zzso The structure also suggests that the four zzso zzso zzso present in each channel form two distinct zzso lending structural weight to the suggestion that the four zzso of the zzso channels are arranged as a pair of zzso
