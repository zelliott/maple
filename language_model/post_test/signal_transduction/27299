Two human zzso zzso cell zzso one with a zzso and the other with an zzso zzso were examined for their capacity to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and their zzso This synthesis depends on the zzso of the zzso cells, with zzso higher amounts of both zzso and zzso being produced by the cells with zzso zzso than by those of the zzso zzso In both cell lines this synthesis was affected in a zzso fashion by the zzso added growth factors and exposure to zzso and zzso in combination showed a synergistic zzso This effect of those factors seems to be zzso via protein zzso zzso receptors and was different in the zzso and zzso zzso The synthetic rates of the various zzso formed zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also variously affected by these factors, indicating differences in how the synthesis of the various zzso is zzso The results obtained suggest a close correlation between the presence of the appropriate growth zzso the process of cell differentiation and the synthesis of zzso in these zzso
