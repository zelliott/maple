Our previous studies found that zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling blockade caused cardiac zzso and that zzso is required for zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in the regulation of cell zzso through zzso is little zzso In this study, we hypothesized that zzso may induce cell zzso through zzso but is dependent on zzso zzso Western blots and zzso zzso revealed that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso acts, like zzso would increase zzso through zzso but does not affect the zzso 3 zzso and zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso activity, causes cell zzso and the treatment with zzso further enhances this process, zzso that it occurs through zzso Moreover, zzso zzso revealed that treatment with zzso could enhance the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso but reduce its binding with zzso resulting in the reduction of zzso and the zzso of zzso Taken together, these data provide new insight into the dual role of zzso in the control of zzso dependent cell zzso and involved zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and suppressing zzso may be a good strategy to prevent the progression of heart disease with zzso zzso
