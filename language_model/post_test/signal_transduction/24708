The role of a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell function has been examined in several zzso This zzso has previously been shown to mediate zzso and zzso recognition functions in fish zzso and human zzso zzso We now show that this zzso is distributed in those zzso that contain zzso cells in mice and zzso Further, we show that this zzso functions as an zzso zzso on zzso cells of these zzso That is, zzso zzso directed against this zzso inhibit zzso cell zzso function and trigger signal zzso pathways in each of the zzso Finally, we present evidence that this putative zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which functions to mediate all zzso or zzso recognition functions in a variety of zzso
