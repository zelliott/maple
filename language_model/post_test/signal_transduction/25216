zzso oxygen species can function as zzso zzso but linking these signaling events with specific zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can generate zzso zzso under special conditions but is only known to participate in cell signaling through zzso Here we show that zzso regulates tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso through a mechanism dependent on the production of zzso and completely independent of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells increased zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso that blocks NO production but not its zzso zzso activity, did not prevent zzso zzso Likewise, zzso a competent zzso zzso that lacks zzso activity, retained the ability to increase zzso Similar to the effect of zzso a zzso donor zzso increased zzso production in differentiated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso prevented zzso zzso as did partial deletion of the zzso zzso binding site, a zzso associated with loss of zzso zzso Thus, zzso may zzso a zzso zzso that can lead to the formation of either NO or zzso interrelated but often opposing free radical zzso This arrangement has possible implications for zzso and septic shock where zzso dysfunction results from imbalances in NO and zzso zzso
