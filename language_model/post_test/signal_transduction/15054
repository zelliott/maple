zzso is implicated in zzso and long-term zzso of zzso zzso zzso The authors observed that zzso zzso can zzso cerebral vasospasm, lower zzso production, and preserve normal zzso zzso oxide zzso expression by reduction of zzso NO zzso expression in experimental zzso The authors investigated the potential zzso effects of zzso in an experimental rat model of zzso 

The authors examined the zzso effects of zzso in a zzso zzso model in male zzso zzso The rats underwent subcutaneous zzso of a zzso tube containing corn oil either with or without zzso and some zzso animals also received zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 days after zzso The degree of zzso was determined by averaging the zzso areas of the zzso artery 7 days after zzso The expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and cell death zzso were used for detection of zzso 

Treatment with zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso Seven days after the induction of zzso positive zzso was seen, and DNA fragmentation was increased in the zzso zzso Increased zzso and zzso zzso protein expression and decreased zzso protein expression in the zzso zzso were also zzso These changes were reversed with zzso but not in the presence of zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso did not change after zzso either with or without zzso zzso 

The authors found that zzso appears to zzso an zzso effect that reduces secondary brain injury after zzso via zzso zzso zzso This finding provides support for possible future applications of zzso treatment for the reduction of secondary injury after zzso in zzso
