zzso is a pivotal regulator of energy and zzso zzso and defects in zzso signaling result in obesity and zzso The zzso zzso zzso channels couple zzso metabolism to insulin zzso in pancreatic zzso In this study, we provide evidence that zzso zzso pancreatic zzso functions by promoting zzso channel zzso to the plasma membrane via zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso channels were localized mostly to zzso compartments of pancreatic zzso in the fed state and zzso to the plasma membrane in the zzso zzso This process was defective in zzso zzso mice, but restored by zzso zzso We discovered that the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso involves zzso transient zzso potential 4 and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on both zzso and zzso zzso so at optimal zzso of zzso zzso was activated sufficiently to induce zzso channel trafficking and zzso of pancreatic zzso in a zzso range of zzso zzso zzso There was a close correlation between zzso levels and zzso membrane zzso suggesting that zzso zzso channel trafficking is a key mechanism for regulating zzso membrane zzso Our results present a signaling zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso by modulating zzso zzso
