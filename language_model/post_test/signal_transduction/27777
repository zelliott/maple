Weaver zzso mice have a selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso arising between zzso days after zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of this zzso on different parameters of the zzso and zzso zzso system: apparent D1 and zzso zzso binding sites as well as their signal zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso site, we found a significant loss in apparent D1 zzso binding sites throughout the zzso significant increase of apparent zzso zzso binding in the zzso aspect of the zzso and almost complete loss of zzso zzso sites in these regions of the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso the density of zzso receptors and zzso sites in the nucleus zzso of the zzso mouse did not differ from zzso Despite zzso in the binding of apparent D1 and zzso zzso there was no significant difference in either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest the zzso of apparent D1 zzso binding sites reported in this model, probably does not reflect an important zzso mechanism through which these animals compensate for loss of zzso zzso
