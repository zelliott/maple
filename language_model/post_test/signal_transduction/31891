zzso signaling molecules typically float in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or freely diffuse away from the signaling cell, suggesting that a signal should be sensed equally by all neighboring zzso However, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is zzso biased to selectively determine the induction of a single zzso cell on the zzso side of zzso organ on the zzso zzso Dynamic and oriented cellular zzso emanating from the zzso cell, the source of zzso robustly favor the zzso signaling response in a particular cell among equally competent zzso We propose that these zzso structures enhance signaling by increasing contact between the signaling and responding zzso The zzso polarized direction of the zzso determines the direction of the signaling zzso This zzso cell signaling serves as a zzso mechanism to generate zzso patterned cell zzso
