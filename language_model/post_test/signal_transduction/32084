zzso plays an important role in zzso checkpoint, but what its role is remains zzso Aurora A is a zzso zzso involved in correcting progression of zzso Here, we show that zzso is a negative regulator for Aurora zzso We found that zzso zzso leads to Aurora A zzso zzso expression of zzso or DNA zzso expression of zzso can suppress the expression of Aurora zzso zzso studies show that zzso is a negative regulator for Aurora A expression through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells reduces the level of zzso which, in turn, increases the activity of zzso followed by induction of zzso zzso and its zzso with zzso factor zzso zzso can bind to Aurora A gene promoter, zzso Aurora A gene expression and zzso zzso enhancing the binding of zzso on Aurora A zzso Also, zzso zzso leads to decelerating Aurora zzso turnover rate, due to the fact that zzso zzso causes the zzso of zzso a component of zzso zzso of Aurora zzso zzso zzso zzso Aurora A zzso is zzso when zzso is zzso zzso Thus, zzso Aurora A degradation requires zzso zzso zzso inverse correlation between zzso and Aurora A zzso is translated into the deregulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to high percentages of cells with abnormal amplification of zzso These data suggest that zzso is an important negative regulator of Aurora A, and that loss of zzso in many types of cancer could lead to abnormal zzso of Aurora A and zzso zzso which provides a growth advantage for cancer zzso
