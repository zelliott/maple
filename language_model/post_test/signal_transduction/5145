zzso zzso zzso mediates important zzso and zzso effects of zzso A thorough understanding of zzso action requires intimate knowledge of zzso zzso mechanisms, as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that a zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso zzso were changed to zzso was defective in its ability to activate signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and deficient in zzso zzso but able to allow zzso zzso family of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso We now further characterize the signaling and trafficking characteristics of this zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and its interaction with zzso are indistinguishable from the zzso zzso Yet the zzso differs greatly from the zzso in that zzso zzso zzso is zzso and far more persistent in cells bearing the zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is retained and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The defective zzso zzso and persistent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso do not depend on the sustained presence of zzso or on the cell's ability to carry out new protein zzso zzso receptors that exhibit resistance to zzso zzso are enriched in the zzso form of the zzso which reflects the zzso activated zzso Furthermore, acute zzso zzso a zzso step in zzso is markedly impaired in the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso These findings are discussed in the context of zzso and mechanisms of regulation of zzso zzso
