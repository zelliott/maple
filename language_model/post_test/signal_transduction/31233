To explore the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in regulating zzso via nuclear zzso B zzso related signal zzso zzso 

zzso The zzso index zzso of zzso zzso in aged rats was monitored by flow zzso that of young rats was taken as zzso zzso The differential expression profile of zzso related signals in aged rats allocated in the control group zzso rats, group zzso the zzso treated group zzso B), the zzso (a zzso zzso treated group zzso zzso and the zzso plus zzso treated group zzso zzso was determined and the main significant molecules in them were analyzed with gene zzso of 96 genes related to zzso signal zzso 

zzso zzso of T zzso cell was seen in aged rats, and it was significantly suppressed in group B and zzso In group B, 73 genes were zzso to different extent, including 10 of the zzso gene family, zzso signal zzso member of zzso zzso zzso regulatory target zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso zzso But the zzso on zzso gene family could not be seen in group C and that on others were also zzso while in the group D, the zzso gene family and its related zzso zzso were still activated to some zzso The zzso gene family showed a markedly common feature after zzso intervention, either used alone or in combination with zzso zzso the significant zzso zzso zzso zzso B and I zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can suppress the excessive zzso of zzso zzso in aged rats and activate zzso I zzso and their signal zzso zzso to zzso zzso through adjusting I zzso and I zzso which may be the essential mechanism of zzso in rebuilding the immune zzso of T zzso zzso and zzso zzso
