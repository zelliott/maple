In zzso there are at least 60 members of the zzso zzso family, many of which are able to sense viral zzso zzso By screening all known family members, we identified the zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso sensor in zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso of zzso using small zzso zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso to produce type I zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso was shown to bind zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso by the zzso region of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso (also referred to zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference blocked the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso was independent of zzso and may be a novel zzso for sensing zzso zzso and zzso viruses in zzso
