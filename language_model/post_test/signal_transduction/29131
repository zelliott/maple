zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a system of linked zzso zzso sharply switching the zzso from a zzso state to an active state that becomes zzso and triggers zzso signaling zzso To improve our understanding of this molecular switch, we developed a quantitative model for zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso using parameters derived in large part from zzso kinetic and zzso zzso Our model accurately produces the qualitative and quantitative dynamic features of zzso zzso observed in cells following zzso zzso including a rapid transient buildup of zzso zzso at high zzso zzso In addition, our model predicts a slow buildup of zzso zzso under conditions of reduced zzso activity and no zzso zzso zzso this predicted response is observed in cells treated with zzso zzso further zzso our zzso zzso sensitivity studies clearly show that synergistic zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties result in the selective zzso of the zzso zzso confirming that this model can be used to accurately evaluate the relative importance of linked zzso reactions important for zzso zzso Our model suggests that the functional differences observed between zzso zzso and zzso may have zzso evolved to zzso cell surface signaling zzso
