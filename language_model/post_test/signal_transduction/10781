Cell signaling affects gene expression by regulating the activity of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at a zzso site N terminal to their zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso by preferential recruitment of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso We discovered this zzso interaction in an unbiased affinity zzso screen of zzso nuclear extracts by using either zzso or zzso zzso proteins as zzso zzso between zzso proteins demonstrated a direct zzso Both the zzso site, which lies in an zzso region, and the zzso domain were required for the zzso zzso regions that were competent for induced zzso binding in zzso also supported zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of promoters with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso This study describes a distinctive interface for a zzso zzso complex and demonstrates a functional role for zzso zzso zzso In addition, our findings decipher the zzso link between zzso signaling and two specific zzso factors that are relevant to both normal development and zzso
