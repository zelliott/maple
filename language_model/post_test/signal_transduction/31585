Steel factor zzso and zzso are a zzso pair that regulates growth and zzso of a variety of zzso and zzso zzso This review describes our work investigating downstream signaling pathways activated by zzso with particular emphasis on signaling differences associated with soluble vs zzso bound zzso and our identification of an important role for zzso zzso and zzso influx in supporting zzso positive cells in zzso and in zzso This work led to the identification of a unique form of cell death termed zzso enhanced cell death zzso that involves stimulating a cell with a growth or zzso signal while zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso that we have taken toward identifying cellular factors associated with sensitivity and resistance to zzso are zzso as is our experience with a variety of experimental zzso The use of zzso as a calcium channel blocker and its mechanism of action are zzso as is its potential for development as an zzso zzso
