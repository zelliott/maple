zzso the gene regulatory networks governing zzso signal integration remains an important challenge in zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso function and is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso the core zzso zzso The zzso networks downstream of zzso in the zzso are unknown but, by zzso to other zzso zzso we expect the response to zzso zzso to depend on zzso zzso 

We have undertaken a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso We collected zzso profiles to study how the zzso response to zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was employed to identify genes with zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression data were integrated with zzso binding predictions through gene group enrichment analyses to generate robust hypotheses about zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The analysis results suggest that the zzso response to zzso signaling in the zzso may be partly zzso by established zzso regulated via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso clock zzso zzso and by core clock zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso of several zzso expression levels support a model in which zzso zzso zzso responses are partly achieved by zzso regulation of upstream signaling zzso Our study suggests an important role for zzso signaling in zzso function and provides an example for gaining zzso insights through zzso zzso
