The B cell zzso zzso zzso is a signaling complex that mediates the differentiation of zzso cell fate decisions in B zzso While several studies have shown differences in signal zzso components as being key to contrasting zzso zzso little is known about the differential zzso gene zzso downstream of the signaling zzso 

Here we define the zzso changes that zzso zzso zzso and proliferation of immature and mature B cells, zzso Comparative zzso expression profiling identified 24 genes that zzso between the early responses of the two cell types to zzso zzso Using mice with a conditional zzso we validated the zzso data by demonstrating that zzso is critical to promoting zzso zzso zzso We further investigated the zzso molecular mechanisms and found that zzso promotes a zzso zzso expansion of mature B cells by inducing proliferation and zzso zzso 

This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the early zzso events that lead to either deletion or zzso expansion of B cells upon zzso recognition, and demonstrates that zzso functions as the hub of a zzso network that control zzso fate in the zzso
