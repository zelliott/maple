It was intended to examine the in zzso penetration of zzso zzso through zzso skin in the presence of different zzso of zzso zzso as well as to verify the main barrier for zzso skin zzso In zzso skin penetration of zzso was studied from zzso zzso zzso solutions containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso using zzso diffusion cell and zzso ear zzso zzso experiments with zzso and experiments with skin without stratum zzso zzso were also carried zzso zzso penetration studies of zzso showed that the presence of zzso doubled the drug zzso through the intact zzso However, zzso studies through the skin without SC caused only a small enhancement of zzso zzso compared to intact zzso Moreover, zzso of skin with zzso zzso did not show any significant increase in the flux of the zzso In conclusion, zzso did not act as a real penetration zzso for zzso but it increased the drug partition to the zzso solution improving zzso zzso zzso The absence of improvement in drug zzso by zzso zzso and by the removal of SC indicates that the SC is not the main barrier for the zzso of the metal coordination zzso
