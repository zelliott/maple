zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso found zzso expressed on human primary natural killer zzso cells at low levels was zzso upon stimulation by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell growth factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that engagement of zzso primarily suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell proliferation in response to zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resulted in blocked zzso of zzso and zzso which may have contributed to the observed zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Increased zzso was independent of the zzso pathway, but zzso and zzso protein expressions were diminished, suggesting involvement of the zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that although zzso is an zzso marker for zzso cells similar to that for T cells, zzso serves as a negative regulator for zzso cell zzso Our studies demonstrate a novel zzso role of zzso on zzso zzso
