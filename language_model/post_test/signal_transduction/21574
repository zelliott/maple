Increased reproduction is frequently associated with a reduction in longevity in a variety of zzso Traditional explanations of this zzso of zzso suggest that zzso between reproduction and longevity should be zzso However, it is possible to zzso the two traits in model zzso Recently, it has been suggested that reproduction and longevity are linked by molecular signals produced by specific zzso zzso For example, in zzso zzso lifespan is extended in worms that lack a zzso germ line, but which possess zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso are the sources of signals that mediate zzso In this study, we tested for evidence of such zzso signals in zzso zzso We zzso the germ line using two maternal effect zzso germ zzso and zzso Both zzso result in flies that lack a zzso germ line but that possess a zzso zzso In contrast to the findings from zzso zzso we found that germ line zzso females had reduced longevity relative to controls and that the removal of the germ line led to an zzso of the zzso stem cells in the zzso Our results contrast with the widely held view that it is downstream zzso processes such as the production and/or laying of eggs that are costly to zzso In zzso germ line zzso caused either no difference, or a slight extension, in longevity relative to zzso Our results indicate that early acting, upstream zzso enabling processes are likely to be important in determining zzso zzso In addition, we suggest that the specific roles and putative patterns of molecular zzso in the germ line and zzso zzso are not zzso between flies and zzso
