A molecular approach to enhance the zzso activity of zzso 1 zzso zzso relies on the use of chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression and cell zzso Recent findings showed that zzso zzso and zzso counteract zzso action zzso zzso of DNA strand zzso Moreover, repair of DNA strand breaks induced by poisoned zzso is slower in the presence of zzso zzso leading to increased zzso In the present study we compared the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso in breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells either zzso zzso or zzso both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell lines gave similar zzso zzso zzso cell growth zzso and cell cycle zzso were zzso by the presence of zzso and a 2 fold increase in toxicity was observed in zzso zzso silenced zzso zzso zzso higher levels of DNA strand breaks were found in cells subjected to zzso combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso modification was evident in zzso cells and was reduced by zzso combined zzso zzso zzso a reduction of zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso were found zzso after treatment and were increased by zzso both in zzso zzso and silenced zzso The characterization of such signaling network can be relevant to a strategy aimed at overcoming acquired zzso to zzso zzso
