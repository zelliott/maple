zzso cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of zzso zzso Despite complete zzso of gastric cancer and zzso zzso zzso as well as improvements in chemotherapy and zzso there are still 700,000 gastric zzso deaths per year worldwide and more than zzso of patients with advanced gastric cancer die of the disease or zzso disease within 1 year after zzso None of the treatment zzso we have been applying today can influence the overall survival zzso at present, the overall zzso relative survival rate for gastric cancer is about zzso Cellular zzso due to chronic zzso injury and repair are the most documented processes for zzso It appears that chronic inflammation stimulates tumor development and plays a critical role in zzso sustaining and advancing tumor zzso It is also evident that not all inflammation is zzso Additional zzso can be acquired, and this leads to the cancer cell gaining a further growth advantage and acquiring a more zzso zzso zzso of gastric units, which is called zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso units, which is called zzso zzso zzso and the development directly from the zzso cell zone are three pathways that have been described for gastric zzso Also, an important factor for the development of gastrointestinal zzso is zzso zzso However, the initiating cellular event in gastric zzso is still zzso zzso gastric zzso and its precursor zzso has been under intense investigation, and our paper attempts to highlight recent progress in this field of cancer zzso
