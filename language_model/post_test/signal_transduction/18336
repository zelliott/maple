Recent studies of zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by G zzso zzso In the present study, we explored the effects of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso blocker zzso A zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso with impaired zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso generation of second zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso evoked by zzso II and the calcium zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso at zzso zzso and abolished zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is critical for zzso zzso by zzso II in zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso but not zzso growth factor zzso Thus, zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso through a distinct zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
