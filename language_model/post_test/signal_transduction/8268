zzso zzso is a zzso oral zzso associated with chronic adult zzso Its ecological niche is the zzso zzso where the zzso adapts to the challenges of the infectious process such as host zzso and bacterial zzso zzso responses to environmental changes are partly regulated by zzso signal zzso zzso Several intact systems were zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso as well as an orphan regulator zzso a zzso of zzso a response regulator from zzso zzso With the goal of defining the environmental cues that activate zzso in zzso zzso we used several strategies to identify its zzso zzso from gene expression and zzso binding zzso identified target genes that were either involved in transport functions or associated with zzso stress, and indicated that zzso can act as an zzso and a zzso zzso positively activated the primary sodium zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein also zzso with the promoter regions of zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Given that zzso bleeding and zzso of host zzso cells are symptoms of zzso infection, iron products released from blood and zzso oxygen species from zzso zzso may be potential zzso of the zzso zzso
