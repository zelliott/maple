A zzso zzso integral is used to define and generate zzso that zzso and zzso resemble the zzso observed behavior of episodic zzso zzso Our zzso of the zzso integral in terms of multiple distinct parameters with statistically bounded values allows investigators to zzso model variations in the zzso zzso frequency, and/or zzso of the hormone zzso pulse, as well as zzso in rates of zzso hormone zzso Here we demonstrate the zzso of this new concept of zzso zzso signaling to zzso observed zzso zzso data, zzso sensitivity analysis, the evaluation of statistical errors in hormone peak zzso and the zzso of zzso coincidence rates between two independent zzso zzso
