There is a growing body of evidence that suggests common complications in regional zzso including transient neurological syndrome, are caused by the zzso of local zzso zzso is thought to be one of the safest zzso however, there have been several studies detailing possible zzso zzso At present, the exact molecular mechanism of zzso zzso is zzso The present study was designed to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso The zzso effects of zzso were assessed in spinal zzso by zzso zzso for zzso and in cultured zzso cells by cell viability zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso promoted zzso and caused cell death in a treatment group compared with a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly diminished zzso zzso There were significantly lower zzso levels in cells exposed to zzso compared with zzso The present study demonstrated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso signaling zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso cell death, zzso by zzso may offer an explanation for its adverse effects zzso transient neurological zzso
