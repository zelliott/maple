zzso zzso zzso a structural analogue of zzso is a known zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso This study investigated the functional interaction of zzso with a plasma membrane protein from zzso cells, the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was the zzso protein with a molecular mass of 36 zzso which corresponded to the beta zzso of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso activity was in the zzso range with a zzso zzso of zzso over the zzso In zzso treated plasma zzso it was found that the effect of zzso on zzso zzso was partially zzso which suggests the involvement of zzso such as zzso or zzso In addition, an zzso was developed for the zzso of interaction between the a zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso on a zzso zzso The physical interaction was tested of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso together with zzso zzso in zzso zzso An interaction between zzso zzso and zzso was not observed, which was not in accordance with previously reported results of zzso obtained for zzso from bovine zzso In conclusion, the signal is zzso from zzso to zzso zzso via zzso sensitive zzso Furthermore, it is hypothesized that zzso zzso are not involved in the zzso
