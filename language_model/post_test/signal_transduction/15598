zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a fundamental role in regulating cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of ROCK is related to tumor zzso and poor clinical zzso Here, we show that ROCK expression is increased in zzso human zzso tumors and breast cancer cell lines compared with zzso tumors and cell zzso zzso of ROCK zzso a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of ROCK activity, by either a specific ROCK inhibitor zzso or zzso small interfering zzso reduces cell migration and proliferation in zzso and zzso to bone in zzso using a novel zzso breast cancer zzso to human zzso mouse zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cluster is shown to be elevated in zzso breast cancer cells compared with zzso cells and diminished by zzso zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso is shown to decrease breast cancer cell zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso ROCK signaling contributes to breast cancer zzso The effects of ROCK on tumor cell zzso and growth may derive from regulating zzso zzso contraction and modulating the zzso pathway, including zzso zzso zzso of ROCK or the zzso it zzso therefore, may represent a novel approach for treatment of breast cancer zzso
