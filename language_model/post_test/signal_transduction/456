zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso involved in the regulation of brain zzso and function as the zzso fluid zzso zzso Despite their crucial roles, there is limited understanding of the regulatory mechanism driving zzso zzso Sonic zzso zzso a zzso signal crucial for embryonic development and cancer, is strongly expressed in the differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we identify a distinct zzso domain in the zzso that does not express zzso but displays zzso zzso We find that this distinct zzso target field that zzso a zzso zone, the lower zzso lip zzso functions as a zzso domain by contributing directly to the zzso By conditional zzso zzso analysis, we show that zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso proliferation and zzso expansion through late embryonic development, starting around zzso Whereas previous studies show that direct contribution to the zzso by the zzso zzso around zzso our findings reveal a novel zzso role for zzso production and signaling in driving the continual growth and expansion of the zzso zzso zzso throughout zzso
