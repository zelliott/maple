Recent evidence demonstrates that the zzso zzso complexes of T and B zzso are very similar in general architecture and primary and secondary structure of component zzso and that they use common mechanisms for zzso signal zzso Most importantly, multiple zzso of each zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess a motif of approximately 26 zzso zzso zzso which appears to carry sufficient structural information for zzso zzso zzso
