The precise mechanism of zzso in molecular and gene expression levels of zzso protein and zzso still remains zzso We zzso that zzso might inhibit the formation of zzso zzso by affecting the expression of zzso protein and interfering with the zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso zzso and to clarify the mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso skin zzso and zzso were exposed to various zzso of zzso in zzso medium for 72 zzso then zzso was used to examine the zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso protein was studied both at the zzso and zzso levels, using conventional reverse zzso zzso and Western zzso 

zzso markedly enhanced the expression of zzso zzso but it had no effect on the expression of zzso Further study revealed that zzso could induce zzso to enter the zzso from the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso probably by enhancing the expression of zzso zzso and is a potential treatment for zzso
