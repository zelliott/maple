Free fatty acids zzso are considered as a zzso link between obesity and zzso In various animal models and in humans zzso can stimulate zzso zzso Although the in zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso has been clearly established, the zzso role of zzso and related signaling zzso remain unclear in the regulation of zzso zzso gene zzso In this study, we have identified zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as a critical signaling component in zzso zzso of key zzso zzso We show in primary zzso that both zzso and zzso fatty acids zzso or zzso could activate zzso and increase levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso alpha zzso gene zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso genes and zzso in isolated zzso could be blocked by the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso by zzso was necessary for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso through zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso of zzso requires protein zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the known zzso regulators, zzso and zzso are also integral parts of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
