zzso activates zzso in an ordered sequence of events that includes shape change, increase in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and formation of a stable zzso zzso zzso of this process has also been implicated in the zzso of zzso stroke, and zzso There are two identified zzso receptors on the surface of human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a low apparent affinity zzso zzso of uncertain zzso The goal of these studies is to determine the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and to relate the individual zzso from each zzso to zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso and zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we separated the zzso zzso zzso response of zzso into two discrete zzso rapid spike response caused by zzso followed by a slower prolonged response from zzso Despite having a zzso slower rate of zzso zzso produces the majority of the integrated zzso signal that is sustained by the continuous presence of zzso active zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso is much more effective than zzso zzso in mounting secondary zzso zzso signals from zzso zzso The strong zzso response due to activated zzso however, requires prior zzso of zzso as would normally occur during treatment of zzso with zzso Thus, the late signal generated by activated zzso is not redundant with the early signal from zzso and instead serves to greatly extend the high zzso zzso levels that support the late phase of the zzso zzso zzso
