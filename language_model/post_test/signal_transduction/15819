During immune responses, zzso must integrate survival and death signals from multiple sources to regulate their zzso zzso that activate either the zzso or death zzso zzso pathways can provide powerful stimuli for zzso to undergo cell death, but whether they act zzso in parallel or directly zzso in zzso is not zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso family proteins are not required for zzso cell death in zzso but did not examine whether they could zzso its rapid zzso By monitoring the rate of change in zzso viability associated with zzso of the zzso death zzso zzso using real-time cell imaging, we show that the zzso proteins Bid, zzso and zzso accelerate zzso zzso but are not essential for cell zzso Increased zzso or zzso expression prevents efficient induction of zzso by zzso stimulation indicating that the zzso zzso zzso can directly interfere with zzso zzso zzso has been shown to initiate zzso zzso and gene zzso in cell lines, however gene zzso is not altered in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso occurs independently of gene zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso zzso by Bid impacts on the magnitude of zzso zzso production, implicating a functional role for the zzso zzso in controlling zzso responses to zzso These data demonstrate that the intrinsic zzso zzso directly controls the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
