Three novel zzso response factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a medicinal plant, zzso zzso The deduced zzso contain a zzso nuclear zzso signal and an zzso DNA binding zzso zzso gel zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso were zzso expressed at low levels in all parts of mature plants, and that zzso was expressed at moderate levels in zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso transcript levels were slightly increased by addition of zzso and salicylic zzso zzso were localized in the plant nucleus and functioned as zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased expression of some defense genes which are associated with enhanced disease zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso zzso resulted in elevated zzso levels of the defense gene zzso and in enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso these results provide evidence that zzso mediate the expression of zzso genes in zzso
