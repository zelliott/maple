Mouse embryonic stem cells can differentiate in zzso into cells of the nervous system, zzso and zzso This differentiation mimics stages observed in zzso including the generation of primitive zzso and zzso in zzso body zzso We demonstrate here that embryonic stem cell lines zzso for components of the zzso signaling cascade are deficient at generating zzso zzso zzso The zzso bodies derived from zzso cells are also unable to respond to zzso acid treatment by producing zzso neural stem cells, a response observed in cultures of zzso cells, and contain zzso apparently arrested at the primitive zzso zzso The zzso cultures are also deficient in their capacity to differentiate into mature zzso and zzso These data are consistent with a role for zzso signaling in generating zzso capable of producing the appropriate zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso
