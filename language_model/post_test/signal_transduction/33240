In the present study we have investigated a possible role for the zzso zzso domain protein zzso as a regulator of expression or activity of certain zzso domain proteins and zzso zzso The expression of the zzso binding proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso were assessed in zzso zzso cells and in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso In addition, the expression of the zzso domain zzso proteins was assessed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein content and zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso whereas the protein contents of zzso and zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso zzso There was, however, an increased zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells after a zzso serum zzso Increased zzso levels of zzso zzso were accompanied by an increased zzso protein content in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with an altered zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The data presented in this study suggest novel functions for the zzso protein zzso regulating the expression of certain zzso zzso domain proteins and modulating zzso zzso
