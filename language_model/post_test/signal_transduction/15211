zzso activated zzso zzso play a crucial role in type 2 zzso Mice deficient in zzso a zzso for the latest member of the zzso family, zzso have impaired type 2 immune zzso We therefore reasoned that zzso signaling may be involved in the differentiation and zzso of zzso during airway zzso We report here that zzso changed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso toward an zzso zzso that expressed zzso zzso zzso and produced high levels of zzso and zzso in an zzso manner during zzso airway zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, depletion of zzso zzso reduced zzso airway zzso Additionally, the attenuated zzso airway inflammation in zzso mice was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso In zzso zzso amplified zzso polarization of zzso and bone zzso zzso toward an zzso zzso by increasing the expression of zzso I, zzso as well as the production of zzso and zzso zzso signaling was crucial for zzso zzso amplification by inducing the expression of zzso Finally, we showed that zzso was more abundantly expressed in the lung zzso cells of asthma patients than those from healthy controls, suggesting that zzso may be involved in lung zzso zzso in clinical zzso Taken together, we demonstrate here that zzso plays a significant role in the amplification of zzso polarization and zzso production which contribute to innate and zzso airway zzso
