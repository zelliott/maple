zzso of zzso signaling in zzso is zzso Previous work by our lab suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region zzso of zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso However the roles of the individual zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso response to zzso are not zzso To address this issue, we tested the ability of zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso sites to zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso replacing zzso at zzso or zzso in the zzso region decreased zzso zzso promoter activity, whereas mutating zzso enhanced zzso zzso promoter activity and did not prevent zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of all four zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not zzso suggesting primacy of the two zzso zzso These results suggest that in these zzso cells, zzso of the zzso and possibly zzso sites may act as a brake on the zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso in some manner releases that zzso Renal zzso cells zzso respond differently from zzso or zzso zzso blocking zzso neither changed zzso zzso zzso nor prevented zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso Furthermore, zzso of wild zzso or the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso is a critical event by which zzso enhances zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso
