zzso receptors have an zzso function in the zzso During early development, they mediate zzso effects, which result in zzso of zzso signaling processes that are important for the differentiation of the zzso In more mature stages of development and in adults, zzso receptors acquire their classical zzso zzso The switch from zzso to zzso zzso signaling is triggered through the zzso shift in the balance of zzso zzso that either increase zzso zzso or decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso The maturation of zzso signaling follows zzso patterns, which correlate with the zzso expression profiles of zzso zzso This has first been demonstrated in the zzso zzso where the switch occurs earlier in females than in zzso As a result, there are sensitive periods during development when drugs or conditions that activate zzso receptors mediate different zzso effects in males and zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso or zzso zzso signaling respond differently to zzso factors like zzso zzso during sensitive zzso zzso zzso receptors may act as broadcasters of sexually zzso signals, promoting zzso brain zzso This has particular implications in zzso where both the zzso and treatment of zzso zzso involve zzso zzso zzso It is important therefore to study separately the effects of these factors not only on the course of zzso but also design new treatments that may not necessarily disturb the zzso brain zzso
