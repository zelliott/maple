The zzso zzso zzso zzso has classically been considered the cell's primary energy zzso zzso a novel role for zzso as an zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso has evolved over the past century and extensive work has been conducted to characterize the zzso zzso receptors expressed on almost all cell types in the zzso zzso zzso elicits potent effects on vascular cells to regulate blood vessel tone but can also be involved in vascular zzso such as zzso While the effects of zzso zzso in the zzso have been well zzso the zzso zzso the regulated release of zzso from cells in the blood vessel wall and circulation are now a key target of zzso The aim of this review is to examine the current proposed mechanisms of zzso release from vascular cells, with a special emphasis on the zzso and channels involved in zzso release from vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso cells, circulating red blood cells, and zzso sympathetic nerves, including zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
