We observed that zzso zzso mice had sparse head hair and focal zzso behind their zzso as observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, which are models of the human genetic disorder zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed partial impairment in hair zzso development with reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso which were essential for hair zzso zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso mice zzso using zzso zzso showed reduced numbers of hair zzso and we also detected higher zzso of zzso which is required to suppress normal hair zzso zzso We suspected that zzso might be a novel gene class regulating the development of hair zzso
