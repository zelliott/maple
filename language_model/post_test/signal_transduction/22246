The number of new cases of tuberculosis zzso arising each year is increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of zzso zzso the main zzso agent of zzso in humans, have all contributed to the increasing number of zzso cases zzso zzso that are essential to the pathogen survival and absent in the host, such as zzso of the zzso pathway, are attractive targets to the development of new zzso zzso Here we describe the metal requirement and kinetic mechanism determination of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso True zzso kinetic parameters determination and zzso binding data suggested that the zzso chemical reaction follows a zzso random zzso Treatment with zzso abolished completely the activity of zzso and addition of zzso and zzso led to, respectively, full and partial recovery of the zzso zzso Excess zzso inhibited the zzso activity, and zzso zzso data revealed two sequential binding sites, which is consistent with the existence of a secondary zzso zzso We also report zzso of metal zzso by zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso reduction and zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, during the reaction of zzso was monitored by a zzso zzso under zzso experimental zzso These results provide a better understanding of the mode of action of zzso that should be useful to guide the rational zzso design of zzso of this zzso that can be further evaluated as zzso zzso
