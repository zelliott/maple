The zzso family member zzso zzso different zzso cell types in a zzso fashion in the zzso animal cap zzso High zzso of zzso induce zzso and anterior cell types such as zzso and muscle, while low zzso induce zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In this paper we investigate whether this threshold phenomenon involves the differential effects of the two type I zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso active forms of the receptors (here designated zzso and zzso reveals that zzso strongly zzso the more zzso zzso marker zzso and the zzso marker zzso in animal cap zzso zzso levels of zzso expression are attained using lower zzso of zzso than are required for the strongest zzso of zzso and at the highest doses of zzso levels of zzso zzso decrease, as is seen with high zzso of zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso activates zzso but fails to induce zzso to significant zzso Analysis at later stages reveals that zzso zzso zzso the formation of a variety of zzso zzso including zzso cell types, in a zzso fashion, and that high levels also induce zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso is capable of inducing a secondary axis when injected into the zzso side of zzso stage zzso whilst zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso active forms of both receptors reveals that zzso signals from zzso zzso the zzso zzso signal derived from zzso suggesting that the two receptors use distinct and interfering zzso zzso Together, these results show that although zzso and zzso zzso distinct signals, the threshold responses characteristic of zzso cannot be due to interactions between these two zzso rather, thresholds can be established by zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso zzso are at odds with it behaving as an zzso zzso in the early zzso zzso
