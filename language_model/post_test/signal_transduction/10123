New blood vessels are initially formed through the assembly or zzso of zzso cells, but the recruitment of supporting zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso ensures the formation of a mature and stable vascular zzso zzso zzso coverage is associated with the poorly organized and leaky zzso seen in tumors or other human zzso Here we report that mural cells require zzso a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for normal association with zzso blood vessels zzso zzso zzso mice display zzso zzso vascular defects in skin, zzso gastrointestinal zzso and kidney zzso and abnormal migration of smooth muscle cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells are defective in zzso zzso formation, and polarized migration and show increased zzso Our results indicate that the role of zzso and zzso receptors in these processes involves zzso signaling and suggest that zzso has some zzso zzso
