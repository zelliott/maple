zzso is one of the most widely used zzso zzso However, at zzso zzso resistance of cells to the drug occasionally zzso which greatly limits its effectiveness in cancer zzso In this review, the mechanisms of acquired resistance to zzso are zzso Numerous mechanisms potentially contributing to clinical zzso resistance have been identified, including changes in membrane zzso zzso pathways and the ability to remove zzso zzso from zzso Changes triggered by zzso selection in the resistant zzso involve a secondary layer of complexity that may include zzso in: 1) zzso and protein zzso signal zzso zzso 2) growth factor and hormone zzso 3) zzso structure and gene zzso 4) zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso and 6) zzso transport and zzso It is likely that all of these changes are part of an zzso zzso response to zzso zzso Which of these zzso changes come to predominate may depend on the type of cell and, particularly, on the selection zzso In general, zzso long-term exposure to increasing zzso of zzso seems to lead to permanent zzso in the levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso once a week leads to changes in folate metabolism and zzso zzso while acute administration of zzso once a month leads to defects in drug zzso However, the environment of a tumor is remarkably different from the environment of tumor cells in culture zzso growth factor and hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the various zzso and protein zzso signal zzso pathways are likely to be featured differently in these two zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso of zzso used in the selection of resistance zzso a lethal concentration of zzso may generate DNA zzso in cells, which cause zzso arrest of the cell cycle and subsequently lead to zzso Recently, excitement in this field arose from the findings that zzso zzso bind several cellular zzso termed zzso recognition zzso including some that enhance survival of the cells by zzso DNA repair and others that zzso their death by zzso sensitivity to the zzso
