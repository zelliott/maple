zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved both in the assembly and maintenance of basement membrane structures essential for tissue zzso and the transmission of signals across the plasma zzso We used a zzso zzso approach to investigate the function of zzso during zzso zzso skin zzso The loss of zzso zzso zzso differentiation by affecting the zzso of zzso cells, deposition of zzso and organization of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also affects zzso zzso as shown by the reduction of zzso expression at the zzso zzso without affecting the distribution of zzso zzso This was associated with a decrease of cell zzso a disruption of zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso factor zzso a marker of differentiated zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso prevents and promotes zzso of zzso Our study showed for the first time in zzso that zzso in addition to organizing zzso in the zzso also acts as a key signaling component in the zzso zzso
