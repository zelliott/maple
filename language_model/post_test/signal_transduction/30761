We describe a method for rapid identification of protein zzso zzso zzso was engineered to accept an zzso analog that allows it to uniquely label its zzso with a zzso zzso analog zzso A highly specific, zzso zzso methodology was developed for rapid zzso of zzso peptides derived from labeled zzso zzso Application of this approach to the discovery of zzso B zzso yielded identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Many of these sites are known to be zzso in zzso but most of the proteins have not been characterized as zzso B zzso This approach has the potential to expand our understanding of zzso connections in signaling zzso
