Signaling through the zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso positively regulates the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the synthesis of zzso zzso thereby promoting the complex process of zzso zzso The major zzso are transcribed as a single zzso which must be processed to create the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used a new zzso labeling approach to study the effects of zzso an inhibitor of zzso on zzso zzso zzso not only impaired synthesis of new zzso zzso or zzso zzso but also induced their zzso This prompted us to examine the effects of zzso on zzso zzso We show that zzso also interferes with the processing events that generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and processing occur in regions of the nucleus known as zzso We find that the zzso components zzso and zzso are both present in zzso where they may regulate zzso maturation zzso While zzso has no effect on overall zzso zzso or its zzso it does induce loss of zzso and zzso from zzso These data show that zzso is located in zzso where it acts to regulate events involved in zzso zzso including the maturation of zzso zzso
