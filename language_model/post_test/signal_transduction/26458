The zzso gene zzso controls the zzso expression of many genes implicated in the zzso of a range of vascular disorders, yet our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the rapid expression of this zzso zinc finger zzso factor is zzso Here we show that zzso expression induced by zzso is dependent on zzso zzso and a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prevent zzso induction of zzso Further, zzso activates zzso via the zzso growth factor zzso zzso This is blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso expression is reduced in zzso embryonic zzso zzso deficient in zzso despite unbiased expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso wound repair after mechanical injury requires both zzso and zzso This study reports for the first time that zzso induction by zzso involves zzso and zzso zzso zzso
