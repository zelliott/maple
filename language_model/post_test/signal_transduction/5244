Growth hormone zzso signaling influences longevity in mice, with decreased zzso signaling associated with longer life span and increased zzso signaling with shortened life zzso A proposed mechanism through which zzso signaling influences life span zzso that decreased zzso signaling lowers zzso rate, thus slowing aging by decreasing production of damaging free zzso The influence of altered zzso signaling on metabolism was tested by monitoring oxygen consumption zzso respiratory zzso zzso and heat production in zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and Ames dwarf mice, and short-lived bovine zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and Ames dwarf mice have increased zzso and heat per gram body weight, and decreased zzso whereas zzso zzso mice have decreased zzso and heat per gram body weight and increased zzso In conclusion, decreased zzso signaling associates with increased metabolism per body weight and may zzso affect zzso flexibility by increasing the capacity for fat zzso generally, zzso excess produces opposite zzso zzso
