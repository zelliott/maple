The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are often zzso and may zzso in driving the development and progression of zzso cell lung zzso zzso In addition, zzso amplification is an alternative resistance mechanism for escaping zzso zzso To assess the benefits of combined targeting of zzso and zzso for treating zzso we investigated the activities of these two zzso pathways in zzso cell lines and evaluated their responses to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We showed that zzso interacts with and zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso results in zzso suppression of downstream signaling and of cell proliferation when their zzso are zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso plus zzso strengthens zzso activity in zzso in a cellular zzso zzso The combination led to the zzso of zzso tumors by enhancing the suppression of proliferation and inducing zzso whereas zzso tumor growth was significantly reduced by the combination via suppression of proliferation without inducing zzso zzso alone was sufficient to achieve near-complete zzso of zzso zzso its combination with zzso strongly inhibited the viability of a population of insensitive cells emerging from an zzso zzso tumor zzso Our data suggest that zzso of both zzso and zzso can enhance zzso effects against zzso in a zzso manner and thus provide a strong rationale for combining zzso and zzso zzso in treating zzso
