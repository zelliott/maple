zzso stimulation of zzso zzso exerts negative zzso and zzso effects in the atrium of zzso zzso These effects are crucial to the zzso regulation of the heart zzso This effect is assumed to be zzso via zzso binding zzso zzso because they can be abolished by zzso zzso However, it is unknown which G proteins are zzso 

We studied zzso in isolated left or right atrium from genetically manipulated mice with deletion of one of two G zzso either of the alpha zzso of zzso protein zzso or of the alpha zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso were zzso with zzso alone or after zzso with the zzso zzso zzso For comparison, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso in isolated zzso zzso were zzso 

The negative zzso and zzso effects of zzso alone or in the presence of zzso were identical in zzso from knockout or zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso zzso was greatly attenuated in both types of knockout mice zzso 

These data imply that there is either zzso of G proteins for signal zzso or that zzso zzso proteins other than zzso and zzso mediate the zzso stimulation in the zzso Moreover, different G proteins mediate the effect of zzso in zzso compared with zzso
