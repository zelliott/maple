Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by brain deposition of zzso plaques and zzso zzso zzso along with steady cognitive zzso Although the mechanism by which zzso zzso occurs is zzso accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction and loss of synaptic connections may be an early event underlying disease zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed in zzso and the density of these connections strongly zzso with cognitive zzso zzso investigations into zzso synaptic changes focused on the toxic effects of zzso However, recent research suggests an emerging role for zzso at the zzso Even in the absence of zzso mice zzso human zzso display significant synaptic zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso within zzso in both healthy and zzso brains indicates that zzso might play a role in normal synaptic function, which may be disrupted in zzso zzso is able to impact synaptic activity in several ways: studies show zzso interacting directly with zzso signaling complexes, regulating zzso zzso content in zzso zzso and influencing targeting and function of synaptic zzso Early trials of zzso zzso reduce zzso pathology and zzso loss, indicating that the toxic effects of zzso may be zzso within a certain time zzso zzso the role of zzso in both normal and zzso zzso is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to zzso zzso loss and prevent zzso zzso This article is part of the Special zzso entitled 'The zzso zzso of zzso zzso
