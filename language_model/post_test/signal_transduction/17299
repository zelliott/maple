zzso 71 zzso is a zzso zzso virus that belongs to zzso zzso It causes the zzso disease and fatal neurological diseases in young children and zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso remains zzso The zzso tract is the initial site of zzso zzso but no or only mild gastrointestinal symptoms are observed zzso suggesting that host immune responses of the zzso zzso to zzso may be unique, which, however, remains rarely zzso In this study, we showed that human zzso zzso cells zzso were susceptible to zzso and the infected cells exhibited zzso effects zzso and were prone to zzso zzso and zzso were induced significantly post infection and may be pivotal in the induction of zzso and host innate immune responses against zzso Among zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and may play a key role in zzso zzso We examined zzso and intrinsic zzso pathways and found that both were activated in zzso zzso The zzso intrinsic zzso may also be activated through Bid zzso by active zzso zzso induction of zzso in human zzso zzso cells contradicts the finding that zzso induction was suppressed in other types of the cells, suggesting that mild gastrointestinal symptoms may be the result of sufficient local zzso zzso Our study has demonstrated a unique way of zzso responses in human gut different from other tissue cells in response to zzso which may account for mild symptoms in zzso zzso This finding will broaden our understanding of host defense mechanism and the zzso of zzso zzso
