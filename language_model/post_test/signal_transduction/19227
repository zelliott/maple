zzso have been implicated in the regulation of multiple zzso zzso However, their role in zzso development is not well zzso In this study, we report a new in zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which transmit signals from the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Toll zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of zzso and target genes of Toll and the zzso zzso in zzso maternal zzso reveals that zzso limits the activity of both pathways in the early zzso zzso interaction studies suggest a previously zzso mechanism for zzso zzso zzso can directly bind and zzso an inactive form of zzso thus preventing its zzso by the upstream zzso zzso A simultaneous zzso of different zzso systems in zzso zzso results in an abnormal patterning of the zzso and severe zzso zzso Our findings uncover a new in zzso function of zzso and present a new mechanism of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
