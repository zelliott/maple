The zzso is one of the most studied areas of the central nervous zzso Many of its functions are understood and there is an extensive literature on its role in the control of zzso hormone zzso zzso nervous system activity, regulation of salt, water and food zzso body temperature regulation and aspects of zzso Although the role of the zzso in the control of zzso zzso was zzso in the early 1900s, the chemical nature of these control mechanisms has only been documented in the last few zzso The zzso peptides represent one particular family of chemical compounds which have been shown to have many effects on zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso inhibit the zzso of both zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso terminals of zzso cell zzso zzso also have major actions on the zzso activity of the anterior zzso which has no zzso from the zzso but which is regulated by zzso factors in the zzso portal circulation which runs from the median zzso of the zzso It was therefore of considerable interest when it was discovered that zzso zzso peptides could be detected both in the zzso system and in cells which project into the median zzso The simple presence of a zzso in a zzso does not necessarily imply a zzso If, however, we can demonstrate that regulation of the synthesis of the zzso occurs in a manner which zzso with the expected role of the agent, this provides powerful data in support of a genuine zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso structure of the precursors for the three zzso zzso peptides has provided us with the ability to measure zzso for these peptides in defined areas of the brain and to assess their response to appropriate zzso Not only does zzso for the zzso zzso zzso coexist in the same cells as zzso but we have now been able to demonstrate that stimuli to zzso zzso also result in a markedly increased zzso of zzso zzso Similarly, previous studies have shown that zzso peptides derived from another zzso zzso with zzso releasing factor in a different group of zzso zzso We have now been able to demonstrate that stresses which result in an zzso of zzso releasing factor zzso also result in increased zzso zzso in the same zzso This considerably strengthens the hypothesis that zzso zzso do play a significant role in the control of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
