A zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso produced by zzso is implicated in the development of zzso zzso by recruiting zzso zzso into zzso skin and its expression was induced by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso However, it remains unknown how zzso expression is zzso regulated in zzso 

We sought to determine whether transforming growth zzso 1 zzso 1) regulated zzso expression in zzso 

The effect of zzso 1 on zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line, zzso cells, was evaluated by using zzso and zzso zzso gene transfer was used to determine the effect of zzso proteins on zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso 1 inhibited zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso 1 on the zzso expression was suppressed by zzso of zzso a major zzso regulator of zzso zzso for transforming growth zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso an inhibitor for zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso or zzso major signal zzso zzso was sufficient to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso production in zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso production in zzso cells via zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso signaling zzso may be beneficial for the treatment of zzso zzso
