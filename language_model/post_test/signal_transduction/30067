To understand the molecular mechanism of zzso cardiac zzso cell death, zzso cells were studied by chemical zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were zzso whereas zzso regulated zzso zzso was zzso Only protein zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso was zzso to the membrane fraction zzso its zzso Moreover, the administration of zzso inhibitor suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso and reduced zzso cell zzso An administration of zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso cell deaths, zzso zzso zzso zzso roles in the zzso zzso this study identified a novel zzso zzso zzso signaling module induced by zzso in cardiac zzso Our data show that the zzso zzso signaling module contributes to zzso zzso cell zzso This contrasts with previous zzso zzso zzso protective effect against zzso zzso Thus our data suggest that zzso can mediate alternative signals, zzso beneficiary or deleterious signals, depending on the cell type, intensity, and/or type of zzso
