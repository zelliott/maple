Secondary injury following traumatic spinal zzso injury is induced by the zzso of a number of cellular and molecular zzso zzso a small zzso regulates the organization of the zzso zzso gene zzso cell zzso and has been implicated in the zzso zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of the zzso signaling zzso in the secondary injury that follows traumatic spinal zzso injury in zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions were enhanced significantly in the injured spinal zzso 1 week after surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were administered after spinal zzso injury, and the subjects were evaluated for 5 weeks as per zzso locomotor zzso Poor rat response interrupted the zzso zzso zzso slightly, but significantly zzso zzso delayed the zzso zzso significantly improved the zzso score zzso zzso In conclusion, spinal zzso injury activates the zzso zzso beta associated zzso However, their role in secondary injury or in the improvement of functional recovery remains zzso zzso might exert a zzso effect by mechanisms other than zzso zzso zzso zzso
