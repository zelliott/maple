The development of new methods, including zzso which can even be applied to zzso zzso has significantly increased our knowledge about bacterial zzso and zzso and, in consequence, is profoundly zzso our views on the evolution and the genetic and zzso basis of zzso zzso The presentations at this symposium revealed conceptual links between bacterial zzso and zzso The close zzso of experts in both fields will result in significant zzso and new insights into basic mechanisms of zzso interactions and their zzso The meeting provided fascinating news about the genetic and zzso consequences that the change in their lifestyle had for bacteria that developed from zzso to permanent zzso organisms exemplified by zzso pathogens or zzso In addition, surprising similarities but also striking differences between the strategies involved in the establishment of a symbiotic versus a zzso lifestyle can be zzso In the long run, the characterization of such differences might lead to lifestyle prediction or to an evaluation of the zzso potential of newly isolated bacteria via the definition of genetic and/or zzso signatures characteristic for zzso or symbiotic zzso Moreover, it is expected that these investigations will lead to new strategies for the treatment or prevention of bacterial infections, or the avoidance of pathogen zzso
