zzso phase protein array zzso is a very suitable technique to analyze large numbers of proteins in small samples like for example tumor zzso zzso their small size another major hindrance for the analysis of proteins from zzso is the extraction of proteins from zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso allowing quantitative extraction of large numbers of proteins from zzso zzso and their subsequent analysis by zzso To zzso the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer, we analyzed 23 primary tumors and corresponding zzso for the expression of 25 proteins involved in zzso zzso with special emphasis on zzso transition zzso We found a significant correlation of Snail with zzso and zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso and with zzso in their corresponding zzso Additionally, we showed that high expression levels of the zzso zzso Snail in primary tumors combined with high expression levels of the zzso zzso in zzso lead to an increased risk for death in zzso zzso zzso
