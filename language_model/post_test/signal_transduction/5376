Multiple myeloma zzso cells express zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso induce the zzso survival, and immune surveillance escape of zzso cells through zzso zzso Deciphering zzso function in zzso cells will help in understanding the mechanisms of tumor cell zzso In this study, we examined the response of zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a feature of zzso cells, and we wondered whether zzso zzso could mobilize the zzso zzso We show that five of seven human myeloma cell line zzso cells expressed zzso In the presence of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed in three of five selected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In agreement with zzso zzso only these three zzso responded to zzso although by either an increase zzso or a decrease zzso zzso zzso of zzso We show that zzso increase of proliferation was prevented by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of proliferation in both zzso and zzso zzso was due to zzso zzso We next demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso controlled both zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Moreover, cell death also involved zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and support a switching function of type I zzso in the functional outcome of zzso triggering in tumor zzso
