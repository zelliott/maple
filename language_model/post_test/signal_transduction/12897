The zzso regulatory zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso acid domain found in multiple zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso and competes for zzso binding to zzso To define the core zzso motif and key zzso acid zzso within a zzso zzso zzso we determined the effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso The zzso core zzso zzso consists of 17 zzso acids zzso Within this core zzso two zzso sectors zzso and zzso and zzso are required for zzso whereas zzso and zzso increased zzso values by zzso zzso of spatial relationships between the required sectors in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso also resulted in a loss of biological zzso zzso of three charged sectors zzso zzso zzso within the zzso acid zzso decreased zzso affinity by approximately zzso zzso zzso of selected zzso within the core zzso zzso differently influenced zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso versus zzso These data provide a platform for the development of novel, zzso zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso selectively activate zzso zzso and/or disrupt specific regulatory input to zzso zzso by zzso zzso
