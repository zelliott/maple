The zzso zzso acts both as a hormone and as a zzso As a hormone, its target zzso include zzso blood vessels, liver, zzso and anterior zzso As a zzso zzso plays a role in zzso functions, such as cardiovascular regulation and temperature regulation and is involved in complex behavioral and cognitive functions, such as sexual behavior, zzso formation and social zzso At the zzso level, zzso acts by enhancing membrane zzso and by modulating synaptic zzso The present review will focus on the zzso effects of zzso at the cellular zzso A large proportion of the experiments summarized here have been performed in in zzso systems, especially in brain and spinal zzso slices of the zzso zzso exerts a powerful zzso action on zzso of young rats and zzso It acts by generating a zzso inward current and/or by reducing a zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhances the zzso synaptic input to zzso By virtue of these actions, zzso may regulate the functioning of zzso networks involved in motor zzso In the amygdala, zzso can directly zzso a zzso of zzso whereas zzso a related zzso can indirectly inhibit these same zzso In the lateral zzso zzso exerts a similar dual zzso it excites directly a zzso zzso but causes indirect zzso of virtually all lateral zzso zzso The actions of zzso in the zzso and lateral zzso may represent at least part of the zzso zzso by which zzso influences fear and zzso behavior and social recognition, zzso Central zzso can zzso cardiovascular parameters by causing zzso of spinal sympathetic zzso zzso by increasing the zzso input to cardiac zzso zzso in the nucleus zzso by depressing the zzso input to zzso zzso or by zzso zzso release at solitary tract zzso zzso By acting in or near the zzso zzso nucleus, zzso can influence zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso may exert some control on its own release at zzso zzso zzso The central actions of zzso are mainly zzso by receptors of the zzso type, although recent studies have also reported the presence of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso Major zzso problems are: zzso what is the zzso zzso activated following stimulation of central zzso zzso zzso zzso What is the precise nature of the zzso channels and/or zzso channels operated by zzso zzso Does zzso by virtue of its second zzso interfere with other zzso zzso In recent years, information concerning the mechanism of action of zzso at the zzso level and its possible role and function at the zzso level has been zzso zzso of zzso actions at the cellular level into zzso behavioral and cognitive effects requires an intermediate level of integration, zzso the level of zzso zzso Here, detailed information is zzso Further progress will probably require the introduction of new techniques, such as targeted in zzso zzso recording, large-scale recordings from zzso ensembles or in zzso imaging in small zzso
