zzso zzso is an zzso marking of genes in the parental zzso that ensures the stable transmission of zzso gene expression patterns in a zzso zzso zzso marking systems are thus able to regulate gene activity independently of the underlying DNA zzso Several imprinted gene products regulate cell proliferation and fetal zzso loss of their imprinted state, which effectively alters their zzso might promote or suppress zzso zzso zzso global zzso changes that zzso zzso might affect imprinted gene zzso Here, we review imprinted genes with regard to their roles in zzso predisposition to cancer, and discuss acquired zzso changes zzso zzso zzso modifications and zzso zzso either as a result of cancer or as an early event in zzso We also address recent work showing the potential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and affecting imprinted gene zzso and zzso the effects of loss of zzso in cancer with regard to the roles that imprinted genes play in regulating growth zzso zzso Finally, we speculate on the clinical applications of zzso drugs in zzso
