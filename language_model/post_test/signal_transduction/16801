We have previously shown that zzso administration of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers florid muscle inflammation zzso to appropriate control zzso in various zzso strains of zzso Because severe disease develops even in the absence of zzso immune responses to zzso we sought to identify innate immune signaling components contributing to our model of zzso zzso In zzso stimulation zzso demonstrated zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with either zzso or zzso revealing an zzso capacity exceeding that of other zzso expressed fusion zzso zzso to this apparent functional zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso mice yielded significant zzso zzso of muscle tissue comparable to that produced in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso elimination of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso mice markedly reduced the severity of zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso were absolutely required for in zzso as well as in zzso signaling via these zzso zzso zzso zzso in part, through preferential binding of zzso zzso capable of zzso specific zzso zzso these experiments indicate that multiple zzso signaling zzso contribute to this model of zzso zzso zzso the zzso versatility of zzso and confirming the importance of innate immunity in this zzso
