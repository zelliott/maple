The zzso family of zzso are potent regulators of plant development, affecting a broad range of responses throughout the plant life cycle, including zzso zzso leaf expansion and zzso zzso The plant hormone zzso has previously been linked to these zzso zzso however, these studies have not identified the molecular mechanisms that zzso such extensive zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we show that zzso regulates the emergence of lateral roots, at least partly by manipulating zzso distribution within the zzso Thus, zzso zzso is able to act over long zzso through manipulation of zzso to regulate root zzso This work reveals an important role for zzso as a coordinator of shoot and root development, and provides insights into how zzso is able to exert such a powerful effect on growth and zzso This new link between zzso and zzso may go some way to explain the extensive overlap in responses zzso by these two zzso zzso
