The zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family consists of 10 zzso proteins that regulate development and zzso of the immune zzso Based on an expressed sequence tag, we have cloned a zzso zzso a novel member of the human zzso zzso A closely related zzso designated zzso (for zzso entry zzso was identified independently by another group as a zzso of zzso entry into zzso cells zzso zzso Warner, zzso zzso zzso and Spear, zzso zzso Cell 87, zzso zzso differed from our clone by two zzso acid zzso suggesting that the two proteins represent zzso of a single zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso expression in several human fetal and adult zzso although the zzso sites of expression were zzso zzso such as adult zzso and peripheral blood zzso The zzso region of zzso bound to several members of the zzso factor zzso family, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso of zzso into human zzso cells caused marked zzso of nuclear zzso zzso a zzso regulator of multiple zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso induced also marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso factor zzso a regulator of cellular zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is linked via zzso to signal zzso pathways that activate the immune zzso
