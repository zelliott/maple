The essential role of the median zzso nucleus zzso in the integration of zzso information associated with the zzso state of the rat relies on the presence of a unique population of sodium zzso sensor zzso Little is known about the intrinsic properties of these zzso therefore, we used whole cell recordings in acute brain slices to determine the electrical fingerprints of this specific neural population of rat zzso The data collected from a large sample of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso sensor zzso represent a majority of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso These zzso displayed great diversity in both firing patterns induced by transient zzso current steps and zzso properties activated by zzso current zzso This diversity of electrical properties was also present in zzso sensor zzso zzso of zzso sensor zzso could be zzso however, from the zzso sensor zzso The firing frequency was higher in zzso sensor zzso showing irregular spike zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso was weaker in the zzso sensor zzso than in zzso sensor zzso The diversity among the electrical properties of the zzso zzso contrasts with the relative function zzso zzso zzso However, this diversity might be correlated with a variety of direct synaptic connections linking the zzso to different brain areas involved in various aspects of the restoration and conservation of the body fluid zzso
