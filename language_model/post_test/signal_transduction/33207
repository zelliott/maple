zzso zzso and zzso receptors are highly zzso members of the seven zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Genes of both receptors contain five zzso and share a similar zzso zzso To determine the structural basis of zzso zzso zzso functionally coupled to zzso a series of zzso zzso were constructed by replacing zzso of human zzso zzso zzso from the second to the fifth zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso properties of zzso and zzso receptors were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors that maintained high affinity binding to zzso exhibited zzso increases in zzso calcium zzso similar to both zzso zzso However, only the zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing the second zzso of zzso were able to mediate significantly greater increases in zzso zzso content and zzso zzso activity compared with zzso zzso A zzso zzso was further constructed by replacing five zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso loop with the corresponding five zzso specific zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso maintained high affinity binding to both zzso and zzso and zzso calcium responses similar to zzso zzso However, this first zzso loop zzso also gained positive zzso responses to both zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso 1 zzso and 23 zzso 7 zzso zzso These data suggest that the first zzso loop of zzso is essential for zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
