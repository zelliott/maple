zzso control the resolution of inflammation through the transition from a zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso Here, we present evidence for a role of zzso a master regulator of energy zzso in zzso skewing that occurs during skeletal muscle zzso Muscle zzso was impaired in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and rescue zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso was required for muscle zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso did not fully acquire the zzso or the functions of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso did not acquire the expression of zzso markers during muscle zzso Skewing from zzso toward zzso zzso upon zzso of zzso and zzso cells was impaired in zzso zzso and when zzso zzso was prevented by the zzso of its upstream zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is crucial for zzso zzso skewing from a zzso to zzso zzso at the time of resolution of zzso
