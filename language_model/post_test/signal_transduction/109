The zzso pathway, identified in zzso and zzso in zzso regulates tissue growth by promoting cell cycle exit and zzso In addition to their zzso zzso zzso adult zzso zzso cells zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso zzso Here we examine the molecular basis of this zzso zzso and its impact on cell zzso In the wing zzso disc zzso we observe increased zzso for members of the zzso polarity complexes zzso and zzso as well as zzso junction components when zzso activity is compromised, while zzso markers are not zzso This increase in zzso proteins is correlated with a zzso of the zzso domain and zzso zzso The cell surface zzso of the zzso zzso is also increased in zzso zzso opening the possibility that zzso zzso zzso may participate in overgrowth of zzso zzso Interestingly, however, although the polarity zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso this does not appear to significantly contribute to the zzso zzso zzso by loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls growth and zzso domain size by distinct zzso
