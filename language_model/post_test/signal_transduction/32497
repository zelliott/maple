We examined whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso a growth signal in zzso Since zzso devoid of the I chain were not available, we employed functional depletion of the I chain from a mouse T cell line zzso zzso with zzso for the human H chain and its defective zzso which can bind zzso but cannot zzso a growth zzso The numbers of human zzso mouse I, and mouse H chains expressed in these zzso were similar to each zzso When the human H chain (and zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with 300 zzso human zzso the majority of human H and mouse I chains together with the L chain formed the zzso zzso complex whereas the majority of mouse H chains remained zzso When the human H chain zzso zzso zzso were incubated with 300 zzso human zzso the I chain was expected to be functionally depleted by the formation of the inactive zzso complex with the inactive human H chain zzso However, the human H chain zzso zzso zzso proliferated with a half zzso response to human zzso at zzso zzso which agrees with the zzso affinity zzso value displayed by the mouse L and H zzso The human H zzso zzso proliferated in response the human zzso in a similar zzso with zzso zzso and the human H zzso all responded to mouse zzso in the same zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
