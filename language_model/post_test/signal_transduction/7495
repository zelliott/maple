The plant immune signaling network needs to be robust against attack from zzso pathogens and zzso to zzso immune zzso We investigated the basis of zzso and zzso in the signaling network controlling zzso immunity zzso in zzso A dynamic network model containing four major signaling sectors, the zzso zzso zzso 4, and zzso sectors, which together govern up to zzso of the zzso levels, was built using data for dynamic sector activities and zzso levels under exhaustive zzso sector zzso Our zzso multiple zzso model had a high level of zzso power and captured known and unexpected signal flows in the zzso The sole zzso sector in the model, the zzso sector, contributed centrally to network zzso via its zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso multiple input sites linked specific signal input patterns varying in strength and timing to different network response patterns, indicating a mechanism enabling zzso
