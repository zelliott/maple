The growth of many breast tumors is zzso by IGF-1, which activates signal zzso pathways inducing cell zzso zzso is important in this zzso The aim of the study was to investigate relationships in zzso among zzso effects of zzso on the growth of zzso cells, IGF-1 zzso and zzso Our results showed that zzso could effectively block zzso zzso cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso dependent manner and block cell cycle progression and induce zzso evidenced by the flow zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso Further experiments pointed out that zzso was directly involved in IGF-1 induced cell growth zzso effects of zzso which significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells by an zzso zzso decreased the IGF-1 induced cell growth zzso effects of zzso zzso is thus a possible target of zzso These findings indicate that the zzso effect of zzso on the growth of zzso cells is via zzso IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso
