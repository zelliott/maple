Stem cells reside in zzso zzso or zzso which often contain support cells that control stem cell maintenance and zzso zzso zzso proteins mediate zzso in several adult zzso but a detailed understanding of zzso zzso in stem cell regulation is zzso zzso the zzso female zzso stem cell zzso zzso we show that zzso acts as a critical zzso signal to maintain the normal zzso population of the zzso zzso production in cap cells, a type of niche support cells, is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is then zzso to a second, adjacent population of niche cells, the escort cells, where it activates zzso of the zzso essential factors zzso zzso and Glass bottom boat zzso In zzso zzso zzso protein zzso short zzso that originate in the support cap cells and that are functionally relevant, as they are required to zzso the zzso zzso in the escort cells and to maintain a normal population of zzso These zzso reminiscent of wing disc zzso grow several fold in length if zzso zzso is impaired within the zzso Because these long zzso project zzso towards the zzso region, cap cells sense and react to the strength of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Thus, the zzso niche responds to insufficient zzso zzso by increasing the range of zzso zzso Although the zzso perceived by the cap cells and the zzso involved are still unknown, our results zzso the integration of signals necessary to maintain a functional niche and the plasticity of cellular niches to respond to challenging zzso zzso
