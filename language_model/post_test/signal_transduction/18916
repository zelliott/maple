zzso smooth muscle cells zzso exhibit an extraordinary capacity to undergo zzso change during development, in zzso and in association with zzso Unlike other muscle cells they do not terminally zzso Development and maintenance of the mature zzso zzso is regulated by a number of interacting zzso zzso In response to injury zzso zzso can be induced to change zzso zzso and migrate to effect zzso On completion of the repair process zzso return to a zzso zzso zzso In this way, in the context of zzso a protective zzso cap is formed and maintained at sites of zzso However in disease, when zzso signals are zzso this zzso transition is zzso and zzso are induced to undergo inappropriate differentiation into cells with features of other zzso lineages such as zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, evidence is accumulating that these zzso zzso transitions contribute to the zzso of vascular diseases such as zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso conversion of zzso and the association of this zzso with vascular zzso is a paradigm for how inappropriate differentiation can influence disease zzso zzso of the mechanisms and zzso pathways involved in this particular zzso change is well advanced offering the possibility for the design of successful therapeutic interventions in the zzso
