The zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are required for zzso repair of DNA and zzso zzso Using surface zzso zzso we show here that zzso protein zzso as zzso physically interacts with zzso Analysis of proteins zzso with zzso zzso from metabolically labeled normal zzso human breast zzso cells not only confirmed zzso interactions in zzso but also demonstrated for the first time that exposure of zzso cells to zzso or zzso zzso zzso recruitment of zzso into zzso zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso response showed that stable zzso complex formation is associated with a parallel increase and decrease in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and arrest in zzso phase of the cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso suppression of zzso zzso correlated with a corresponding decline in intact zzso protein zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso a zzso zzso zzso effectively stabilized zzso zzso and rescued zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso degradation of zzso occurs via the zzso zzso zzso is present in both the zzso and nuclear compartments of normal zzso cells, although in response to DNA damage it is predominantly found in the nucleus zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso is zzso zzso with in zzso data, results from in zzso zzso zzso show that zzso mediates addition of one zzso to two zzso zzso molecules on zzso and that inclusion of zzso is essential for its zzso The data presented in the present study suggest that zzso complex formation and zzso zzso modification are important zzso responses that perhaps determine the zzso of DNA zzso zzso
