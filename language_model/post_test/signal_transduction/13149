zzso zzso support rapid growth of zzso toward spinal zzso targets in the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth is accompanied by elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso which then declines in zzso zzso To investigate whether expression of zzso zzso is regulated by retrograde signals, we injected zzso into the zzso tract to block retrograde zzso transport during a time when zzso is normally declining in zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso of high zzso zzso expression in zzso located in layer V (but not other zzso of zzso zzso We next used zzso zzso to infuse soluble adult spinal zzso extract into the zzso zzso This resulted in a premature zzso of zzso zzso in identified zzso zzso zzso repressive activity was found in extracts of the spinal zzso tissue as young as zzso day zzso The effect of spinal zzso extract in zzso was not zzso by adult zzso or muscle zzso zzso of zzso cortical zzso also underwent zzso of zzso zzso when treated with spinal zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling also zzso zzso zzso in cortical cultures, and the repressive effect of spinal zzso extract was diminished by an zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be zzso late in development by a zzso retrograde repressive factor, and this effect may be zzso by zzso second zzso zzso
