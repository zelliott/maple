zzso zzso is a zzso gene that encodes a short-lived protein that, upon zzso zzso growth arrest or zzso zzso of zzso occurs mainly by zzso events that inhibit its zzso zzso We have reported previously that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso activity by zzso zzso degradation of zzso indicating that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso We now have found that zzso zzso but not the inactive zzso zzso can stabilize zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization was especially prominent under induction of zzso zzso zzso also partially inhibited zzso degradation zzso by the human zzso virus E6 zzso but not when zzso by zzso zzso of heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso and zzso induced degradation of zzso and suppressed zzso zzso in normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the effectiveness of zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso degradation and suppress zzso in these cell types indicate that zzso and zzso stabilize zzso through different zzso Our results indicate that zzso has a distinct role in the regulation of zzso stability, especially in response to zzso zzso The present data on the genetic and zzso regulation of the level of zzso have clinical implications for tumor development and zzso
