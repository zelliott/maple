We have evaluated the sizes and lifetimes of zzso in the plasma membrane from the existing literature, with a special attention paid to their zzso broad zzso and the limited time and space scales that are covered by the observation methods used for these zzso zzso the zzso in the steady state zzso zzso from those after stimulation or unintentional zzso of raft molecules zzso zzso zzso is critically zzso In resting cells, the zzso appear small and zzso and the consensus now is that their sizes are smaller than the optical zzso limit zzso zzso Upon zzso the zzso receptors are zzso inducing larger, stabilized zzso probably by coalescing small, unstable zzso or zzso complexes in the zzso zzso This zzso conversion of raft types may be caused by suppression of zzso chain zzso and the zzso lateral diffusion in the zzso with the aid of exclusion of cholesterol from the bulk domain and the boundary region of the majority of zzso zzso We critically inspected the possible zzso to the boundary zzso zzso Finally, we propose a hypothesis for the zzso of zzso zzso signals with zzso signaling molecules in the zzso zzso
