zzso are zzso defense peptides with direct zzso activity and the potential to exert other zzso effects during the innate immune zzso One such function of human zzso is direct binding and zzso of zzso derived zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso blunt zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and decrease tumor necrosis zzso zzso release in zzso zzso exposed to zzso but also other zzso zzso such as zzso acid and zzso In this context, zzso is capable of zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso association in the zzso zzso zzso zzso can reverse diminished zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso By analyzing zzso from zzso mice, we find their zzso production of zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso rather zzso cells show slightly diminished zzso zzso zzso does not render mice more susceptible to lethal zzso zzso These studies indicate the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso response may vary both on the zzso vs zzso origin of zzso and the prior zzso state of the zzso
