The zzso system is an outstanding model for understanding zzso zzso plasticity in zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso in the periphery project onto zzso cells in the zzso bulb zzso and these zzso cells in turn project to zzso zzso zzso Numerous studies have examined changes in zzso after a permanent zzso zzso but little is known about zzso changes taking place in the zzso Permanent zinc zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in a selective loss of the zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso expression in zzso cells in layer zzso of PC after zzso zzso Regulatory elements affected by zzso zzso namely the zzso of zzso were also zzso only in layer zzso zzso These changes could be caused by zzso zzso loss in the zinc zzso zzso or to a reduced zzso To test this hypothesis, we performed both permanent and zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso access to the zzso cavities and zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were zzso 5 d after zzso and this reduction was fully restored 10 d after reopening of the zzso zzso we identified the subset of zzso cells in layer zzso that are especially sensitive to the loss of zzso activity using double retrograde zzso In zzso the present study provides an initial characterization of the molecular mechanisms associated with odor stimulation on second order zzso plasticity and zzso in the zzso zzso
