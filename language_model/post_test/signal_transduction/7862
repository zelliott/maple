zzso zzso is a type I zzso that zzso functions of zzso B, natural killer zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso beta chain and is capable of zzso signals through its zzso with the common zzso zzso gamma chain zzso the protein whose expression is defective in humans with zzso severe combined zzso To clarify the molecular basis of zzso actions, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of all 6 zzso greatly diminished zzso zzso whereas retention of zzso 510 zzso allowed full zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso and zzso T cells from zzso double zzso mice exhibited decreased proliferation in response to zzso + zzso In addition, zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso and consistent with this, specific zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways inhibited zzso zzso zzso these data indicate the involvement of the zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso
