zzso cells zzso induce innate immune responses by recognizing bacterial zzso through zzso zzso zzso In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of zzso knockout zzso zzso and wild type zzso zzso after stimulating with zzso We found that the expression of various inflammatory genes by zzso were zzso Among them, zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso was of particular interest since zzso is a potent natural inhibitor of zzso zzso Using zzso real-time zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrated that zzso was induced by zzso zzso with zzso in the absence of zzso zzso a pharmacological zzso zzso completely zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso expression of zzso might be zzso by zzso zzso Considering that zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso pathways might be crucial in zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso resulted from zzso zzso by zzso
