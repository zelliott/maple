Early zzso adaptation after massive small zzso zzso zzso is driven by increased zzso cell zzso zzso There is a clear clinical difference in the zzso course of patients after the loss of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso small zzso This study examined the effects of the site of zzso on zzso zzso adaptation, and investigated the potential mechanisms zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mid zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mice were sacrificed at 7 days after surgery and zzso and adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed in both zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso depth, zzso cell size, zzso cell size zzso zzso cell number, and zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways including zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso of zzso was further zzso by zzso Data were analyzed using zzso All three zzso models led to significant increases in zzso zzso zzso depth, zzso cell numbers and zzso proliferation rate when compared to respective zzso zzso The strongest zzso changes were found for zzso segments after zzso and for zzso segments after zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis showed that at zzso zzso a tremendous increase in zzso numbers occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas a significant increase in zzso size predominated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a significant increase only after zzso whereas zzso increased significantly after zzso in all investigated models, and this was confirmed by zzso zzso Early zzso adaptation shows distinct differences depending on the site of zzso and is predominately driven by cell zzso in zzso zzso and cell zzso in zzso zzso However, the exact mechanisms, which guide these zzso pathways are still zzso
