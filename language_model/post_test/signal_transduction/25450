To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso and viability of zzso zzso and the involvement of the zzso pathway, we established primary cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and observed their responses to treatment with zzso zzso at different zzso for different zzso Cell zzso was examined under microscope after zzso zzso for zzso zzso cell vitality zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressions of a panel of insulin zzso proteins was detected by Western zzso zzso We show here that, at low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had little effects on the zzso however, at higher zzso of zzso zzso it caused pathological changes, decreased the cell zzso and reduced the expression of insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and B cell zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso not only decreases the viability of zzso zzso but also down regulates the expression of important proteins in the insulin signal zzso zzso We speculate that zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of Alzheimer's through zzso the insulin signaling pathway, therefore decreasing zzso activity and eventually leading to the zzso and cell zzso
