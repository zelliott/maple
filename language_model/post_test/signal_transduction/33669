zzso plays a significant role in zzso stress fibers zzso However, zzso zzso alone or zzso and zzso did not completely suppress the stress fibers suggesting a residual zzso zzso zzso the third member of the zzso zzso is a zzso protein barely zzso in zzso zzso In various cell types, the zzso of zzso induced a strong zzso of both total and active zzso protein levels that were rescued by zzso zzso and related to an enhanced zzso of the zzso The zzso regulation of zzso does not depend on the activity of zzso but is zzso by its zzso zzso The stabilization of zzso was not dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso pathways but required zzso The forced expression of zzso increased zzso zzso whereas its zzso antagonized the induction of zzso following zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso unable to bind zzso was significantly less efficient as compared with zzso zzso in reversing zzso zzso upon zzso zzso These results suggest that, in zzso conditions, zzso is zzso and the suppression of zzso makes it available to stabilize zzso Our results highlight zzso zzso that regulate the stability of zzso
