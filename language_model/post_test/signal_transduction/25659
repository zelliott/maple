zzso of the developing heart requires the structural zzso of the embryonic zzso through the process of zzso zzso form as the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso of the chamber, thereby increasing muscle mass and altering functional zzso Little is understood about the cellular basis for zzso and its genetic zzso Here, we establish the utility of the zzso zzso for the analysis of the mechanisms driving zzso In zzso we can follow zzso in four dimensions and define zzso discrete stages for the zzso zzso and network zzso that form the zzso zzso We find that zzso signaling is required for the initial zzso of the zzso into the zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that optimal blood flow through the zzso is important for the advancement of zzso Thus, our results indicate that the zzso provides a valuable model for investigating possible causes of zzso defects in zzso
