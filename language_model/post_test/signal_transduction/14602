The zzso gene fusion, which has been identified in human zzso encodes a zzso protein endowed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic expression in the mouse zzso lineage results in fatal and rapid zzso zzso In the present report we show that zzso zzso cells from zzso transgenic mice present an zzso zzso differentiation zzso as determined by the expression of zzso cell surface markers and zzso zzso zzso zzso immature zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by the development of zzso leukemia with full zzso in a zzso genetic zzso This disease is similar to the bona fide zzso disease as assessed by zzso and gene profiling zzso zzso signaling zzso with zzso to transform immature zzso and initiate zzso as shown by zzso the delayed leukemia onset in zzso zzso and zzso mice, zzso the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the correction of delayed leukemia onset in zzso zzso mice by an zzso zzso zzso that mimics zzso zzso Although not affecting leukemia zzso and mouse survival, zzso expression was shown to facilitate zzso cell expansion in secondary zzso zzso
