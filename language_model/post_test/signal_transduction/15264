zzso virus zzso zzso zzso a signaling cascade that culminates in a transient DNA damage zzso During this time, host DNA repair proteins convert the linear zzso zzso zzso to zzso circular zzso and zzso in processes zzso by the zzso zzso terminal repeats zzso As the orientation of zzso zzso zzso appears zzso the likelihood of zzso in a desired orientation is low (less than 1 in zzso Using a novel zzso method, zzso zzso Genome zzso zzso this work demonstrates the ability to direct zzso specifically to a desired orientation in human zzso This was achieved by a zzso DNA zzso zzso displaying zzso to distinct zzso zzso capable of forming an zzso bridge for zzso This DNA repair process results in zzso with zzso junctions corresponding to the sequence of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was restricted to zzso not zzso zzso zzso suggestive of zzso zzso zzso with this process, zzso demonstrated zzso polarity biases in all tested zzso except when a portion of the zzso targeted the zzso This approach, in addition to being useful for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may find eventual relevance for zzso zzso large gene zzso
