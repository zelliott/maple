In the zzso zzso zzso three components in the jelly coat of eggs, namely zzso zzso substance zzso zzso and zzso act in concert on zzso zzso to induce the zzso reaction zzso zzso recognition between the zzso surface molecules and the egg jelly molecules must zzso signal zzso events triggering the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which stimulates rapid synthesis of zzso zzso pH and zzso This transient zzso of zzso level is caused by a zzso zzso zzso and the increase of zzso pH is sufficient for zzso to induce the zzso The concerted action of zzso and zzso could induce elevate zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso and the sustained increase in zzso which is essential for the zzso The signaling zzso induced by these factors seems to be zzso regulated to trigger the zzso in zzso zzso
