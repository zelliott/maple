zzso zzso contain populations of zzso zzso stem cells that also zzso various zzso and growth factors to support repair of damaged zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso stress on human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso outgrowth in cells of the rat zzso cell line zzso 

We found that zzso depletion in zzso caused by treatment with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the promotion of zzso outgrowth in zzso cells through zzso of bone zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso in, and zzso from, zzso zzso of zzso a precursor of the zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso treatment caused zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso was sufficient to suppress zzso and zzso zzso while this expression was significantly zzso by zzso of a zzso active form of zzso which is an upstream zzso from zzso zzso 

Our results clearly suggest that zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso oxygen species, stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent expression of zzso and zzso in zzso Thus, transplantation of zzso into neurodegenerative zzso such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, in which the transplanted zzso are exposed to zzso stress, can be the basis for simple and safe zzso
