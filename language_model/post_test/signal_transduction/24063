zzso zzso zzso influences the response of the cell to a number of other signals via a mechanism referred to as zzso This zzso may act at several levels, including an interaction between the zzso factors involved in the zzso zzso In the present paper, we demonstrate a novel functional interaction between zzso and zzso trans zzso acid zzso zzso We show that, in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene through an zzso element, zzso recognized by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The synergistic effect of zzso did not involve zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso and the zzso complex alone was unable to activate zzso via the zzso Furthermore, the ability of the zzso to zzso was not required, excluding expression of a zzso protein as the mechanism for the zzso zzso Additional zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso was the target for the zzso zzso Furthermore, functional dissection of the zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain zzso of the zzso was required for the zzso A physical interaction between the zzso and zzso proteins was demonstrated in zzso by zzso zzso These results are compatible with a model in which the zzso zzso is zzso by a direct interaction between the zzso and zzso On the basis of the ubiquitous expression of both zzso and zzso a number of genes regulated by zzso are likely to be important targets for zzso zzso
