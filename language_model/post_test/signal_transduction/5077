zzso is a zzso life-threatening hypersensitivity zzso Until recently, it was mainly attributed to zzso released by mast cells activated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, recent reports established that zzso could also be triggered by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso factor subsequent to zzso stimulation by zzso zzso We have investigated the contribution of zzso and Lyn zzso zzso to zzso and zzso signaling in the context of zzso passive systemic zzso zzso We found that mast cell zzso XL induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso XL of mast cells, zzso and zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso release in zzso zzso zzso was enhanced in zzso zzso zzso cells, but decreased in zzso zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso More importantly, Lyn zzso mice displayed significantly exacerbated zzso features whereas no change was observed for zzso zzso mice, compared with zzso zzso zzso we establish that mast cells account for most serum zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings establish pivotal roles for zzso and Lyn in the regulation of zzso and highlight their zzso functions in zzso zzso
