zzso may play a role in airway inflammation and zzso We studied its possible involvement in airway zzso and report here its zzso effect and its zzso and zzso pathways in human airway smooth muscle cells in culture zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso was assessed by the zzso and zzso techniques with and without zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to study zzso of zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso proliferation of zzso and induced zzso zzso both abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso proliferation and totally abolished zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor decreased zzso zzso and totally abolished zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso This finding was confirmed by the decrease of zzso proliferation after treatment with zzso of the zzso or of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involves two distinct zzso zzso zzso selectively activates zzso and the zzso zzso selectively activates zzso Both are necessary to induce zzso zzso
