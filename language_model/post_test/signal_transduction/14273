zzso of cellular zzso and their constituents plays a role for cell survival and zzso In the budding zzso there are recycling zzso from early and late zzso compartments to the late zzso Here, we examined a possible role for zzso a large zzso in the recycling traffic of zzso from early zzso to the late zzso In the absence of zzso we observed an zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso that we identified as early zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso are essential for zzso function in zzso zzso Our finding of genetic interactions of zzso with genes involved in early zzso traffic further suggests zzso functions as a recycling factor in the membrane zzso Finally, we provide evidence that the severe zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is attributed to a mild zzso in the retention of the zzso component zzso at the late zzso as well as a severe disruption of zzso zzso
