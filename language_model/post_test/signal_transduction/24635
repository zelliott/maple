We have examined the possible role of two signal zzso mechanisms, zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso C zzso during zzso growth factor zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso was examined through the use of a zzso zzso zzso This zzso was shown to recognize the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We also studied the response of zzso zzso zzso to sodium zzso a compound that has been shown to elevate zzso zzso zzso Thirty percent of zzso cultured in 100 zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso to give zzso that were more zzso in nature than either zzso or zzso zzso The role of zzso was evaluated by measuring zzso activity during zzso induction by zzso and by examining the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso did not induce zzso however, zzso of zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alone is not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso induction by zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso could be part of a negative feedback zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on induction by zzso zzso
