zzso zzso has been shown to regulate numerous and diverse cell functions, including smooth muscle zzso Here we assessed the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Our objective was to zzso using an integrated zzso and molecular approach, zzso the role of zzso as zzso zzso of the zzso tone, and zzso the linkage between zzso zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated zzso effects on isolated zzso and whole zzso harvested from zzso mice zzso to zzso zzso versus zzso mice, by measuring zzso zzso and lung zzso We found that zzso administration on zzso mouse zzso does not cause any direct effect on zzso tone, while a significant increase in zzso contraction occurs after zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso triggers airway zzso Indeed, zzso causes a zzso contraction of isolated zzso Similarly, in the whole lung system zzso increased airway resistance only in zzso zzso The action on zzso of zzso is coupled to an enhanced expression of zzso and zzso as well as of zzso and zzso zzso In these experiments the key role for zzso in zzso has been confirmed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso does not seem to play a major role in zzso conditions, while it may become critical in zzso zzso These results open new windows for therapeutic strategies in diseases like zzso
