zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are abundantly expressed in skin and their function remains to be zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso control of zzso zzso We studied in zzso effects of functional zzso of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso regulators in zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulators in the skin of zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso of the zzso component of zzso signaling in zzso decreased relative amounts of the zzso Bad and zzso at both the zzso and the protein levels, suggesting that zzso zzso is coupled to stimulation of zzso zzso The skin of zzso zzso mice featured decreased amounts of the zzso zzso proteins collagen zzso and zzso as well as the zzso Taken together, these results suggest an important role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso
