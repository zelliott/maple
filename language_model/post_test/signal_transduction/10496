Among zzso involved in zzso zzso only zzso is predominantly zzso at steady zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso protein import via the zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed to bridge two zzso membrane zzso comprised of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is also implicated in cargo release of zzso proteins in the zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso enters the zzso zzso using two redundant pathways in a zzso but zzso manner, showing that the intact zzso and zzso zzso are not required for its zzso One zzso depends on the zzso motifs in zzso the zzso zzso sequence zzso in zzso and the zzso presence of this zzso The alternative zzso uses the zzso zzso zzso its accessory zzso zzso and a putative zzso motif in zzso but does not require zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso is independent of zzso but the interaction of zzso with zzso requires zzso These data suggest a direct interaction between zzso and zzso Our studies shed light on the mechanism and evolution of the dual import pathways for zzso
