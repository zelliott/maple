The zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most frequently zzso genes in zzso We have examined the zzso of the zzso zzso and a spectrum of zzso zzso using zzso exchange mass zzso zzso We find that for the zzso zzso the natural transition from an inactive zzso zzso to an activated form on zzso zzso four distinct zzso Analysis of zzso zzso shows that all zzso the zzso by enhancing one or more of these dynamic zzso We provide the first insight into the zzso mechanism by zzso in the zzso between the zzso domain zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso These zzso which are common in zzso zzso enhance two of the natural zzso events: movement of the zzso and zzso zzso relative to the rest of the zzso zzso and breaking the zzso interface on binding zzso C2 domain zzso zzso and zzso also mimic these events, even in the absence of zzso A third event is breaking the zzso domain contact caused by zzso peptides binding to the zzso which is zzso by a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of the C lobe of the zzso domain with zzso is the fourth zzso event, and is zzso by zzso domain zzso zzso zzso All zzso increased zzso binding and zzso activity, even zzso distant from the membrane zzso Our results zzso a unifying mechanism in which diverse zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso motions required for zzso on zzso
