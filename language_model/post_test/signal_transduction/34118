zzso of human embryonic stem cells zzso is promoted by zzso and zzso zzso and differentiation is promoted by zzso zzso but how these signals regulate genes critical to the maintenance of zzso has been zzso Using a defined zzso we show here that both zzso and zzso signals zzso to inhibit zzso zzso sustain expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso and promote long-term zzso proliferation of human zzso We also show that both zzso and zzso zzso can bind with the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity is enhanced by zzso and zzso signaling and is decreased by zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso binding elements reduces zzso promoter activity to zzso levels and makes zzso unresponsive to zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that direct binding of zzso zzso to the zzso promoter plays an essential role in sustaining human zzso zzso
