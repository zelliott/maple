zzso evidence suggests zzso is involved in cell zzso However, the underlying mechanism is zzso Here I have investigated an zzso zzso process in the zzso eye in which two primary zzso cells zzso with a characteristic zzso shape zzso and eventually isolate a group of cone cells from zzso cells zzso This paper shows that in the developing zzso eye the zzso Delta was transcribed in cone cells and zzso was activated in the adjacent zzso zzso In the absence of zzso emerging zzso failed to zzso cone cells, and zzso zzso and zzso two genes coding for zzso molecules of the zzso group that mediate preferential zzso were not transcribed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in single zzso led to zzso expression of zzso and zzso By contrast, in a single zzso that normally transcribes zzso a gene coding for an zzso zzso of the zzso group that binds zzso and zzso zzso of zzso led to a loss of zzso zzso In addition, in a zzso zzso where two emerging zzso failed to zzso cone cells, expression of zzso in zzso precursors restored the ability of these cells to surround cone zzso Further, expression of zzso or zzso in a single zzso or zzso cell, respectively, led to removal of the counterpart from the membrane within the same cell through zzso and forced expression of zzso in all zzso zzso strongly disrupted the zzso zzso Finally, a loss of both zzso and zzso in single zzso precursors led to zzso of the zzso surface that compromised the zzso shape of zzso Taken together, these results indicate that cone cells zzso zzso signaling to instruct neighboring zzso precursors to surround them and zzso controls the zzso process by zzso regulating four zzso zzso
