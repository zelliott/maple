zzso zzso are zzso that help bacteria sense changes in light wavelength and zzso zzso contain a linear zzso zzso that, upon zzso of red or zzso light, zzso a zzso zzso that leads to a zzso change in the zzso The zzso and type of zzso affects the expression of zzso The linear zzso bound by zzso is thought to come from zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso We have discovered that the absence of zzso does not inhibit the normal function of two zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations imply that: zzso a linear zzso can be made zzso either through zzso zzso zzso by a novel zzso or directly from the zzso precursor zzso without ring zzso or zzso that zzso signal zzso does not require a zzso
