High zzso zzso have a dual effect on zzso zzso inducing proliferation in the short-term and zzso in the zzso zzso leads to zzso production of zzso zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso a death zzso regulated by zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso engagement can be switched from death signal to induction of proliferation when the zzso 8 zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso Here, we show that zzso at low zzso may participate in the zzso actions of zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, exposure of human zzso to low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and decreased zzso whereas increasing amounts of zzso zzso zzso had the reverse zzso A similarly zzso induction of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso insulin zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso induction by zzso was zzso Low zzso also induced the zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of which by zzso interference zzso the beneficial effects of low zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso to zzso prevented low zzso zzso zzso zzso with our in zzso results, zzso knockout mice displayed zzso intolerance along with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that low zzso levels positively influence zzso function and turnover through the zzso zzso and that zzso production prevents harmful effects of high zzso zzso
