zzso studies using gene disruption strategies have defined a set of genes that are essential for normal cardiac zzso Although these studies have provided a framework for the molecular regulation of cardiac zzso the genetic program of the cardiac zzso has been incompletely zzso We used a transgenic strategy to specifically target the cardiac zzso early during cardiac zzso With the use of flow zzso and zzso analysis, we zzso defined the molecular program of the cardiac zzso at distinct zzso zzso Definition of the molecular cardiac program early during development may be useful in the identification of cardiac zzso that are resident in the adult zzso These emerging technologies will be further used to define common and distinct regulatory pathways of cardiac zzso in the developing and zzso zzso
