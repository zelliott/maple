It is now revealed that zzso zzso zzso exists for the generation of spatial and zzso zzso signals based on zzso release from zzso It could be understood in zzso with electrical zzso in the cell surface, the plasma zzso A local zzso response is generated by the second zzso zzso following zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso potential or zzso synaptic potential in zzso The local zzso response triggers a zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the action zzso The zzso process is the inherent property of the zzso release channel which is under positive and negative feedback controls by zzso and zzso zzso like zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso spike can be induced artificially by local application of zzso like induction of the action potential by a zzso zzso The zzso spike zzso as a spatial zzso signal throughout the cell, as the action potential zzso The zzso is followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso spikes are generated, depending on the magnitude of zzso zzso between zzso spikes depends on the readiness of zzso stores in terms of the sensitivity of the zzso and extent of zzso zzso The cycle of zzso zzso includes zzso zzso The zzso zzso signals are thus zzso The zzso pattern of transient zzso zzso may be favorable for accomplishing cellular functions without the side effect of cell zzso
