Patients with advanced zzso melanoma have poor prognosis and the zzso underlying its zzso are poorly zzso zzso sequencing has allowed comprehensive discovery of zzso zzso in cancer zzso Here, on analysis of our zzso and zzso sequencing data of 29 melanoma samples, we identified several genes that harbor zzso zzso zzso These included zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which in a prevalence screen of 288 zzso was found to harbor a zzso substitution in 5 zzso All zzso samples were wild type for zzso suggesting a mutual zzso for these zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 4) zzso through increased binding of the zzso protein zzso zzso resulting in increased proliferation and zzso growth of melanoma zzso This zzso represents a potential target for the design of new therapies to treat zzso
