The small G protein zzso signaling zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso and zzso dysfunction in the zzso Earlier cellular studies have suggested that the Ras zzso is responsible for reduced zzso calcium channel current and zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso associated with zzso disorganization in zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the in zzso effects of Ras zzso on cellular calcium handling and zzso organization in adult zzso zzso using a newly established transgenic mouse model with targeted expression of the zzso zzso The transgenic hearts expressing activated Ras developed significant zzso and zzso lethal heart zzso In adult zzso zzso isolated from the transgenic hearts, the calcium transient was significantly depressed but membrane zzso calcium current was unchanged compared with control zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly reduced at zzso zzso The amount of zzso protein was also modestly zzso However, the expression of zzso protein and gross zzso organization remained unchanged in the zzso Ras hearts, whereas zzso zzso of zzso was dramatically inhibited in the Ras transgenic hearts compared with zzso zzso of zzso was also associated with a significant induction of protein zzso 1 zzso zzso our results from this in zzso model system suggest that zzso zzso defects do not involve decreased zzso calcium channel activities or disruption of zzso zzso Rather, suppressed zzso calcium zzso due to reduced zzso expression and zzso of zzso due to changes in protein zzso expression may play important roles in the zzso dysfunction of zzso zzso zzso
