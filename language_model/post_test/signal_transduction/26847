In zzso spinal zzso and zzso bone zzso protein zzso activates distinct zzso zzso one leading to zzso zzso and the other to zzso orientation and zzso zzso zzso also zzso by the closely related zzso acts through a zzso zzso leading to nuclear zzso and is not zzso zzso zzso Orientation is evoked by zzso but not by zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso by the type II zzso zzso and zzso and is independent of the zzso zzso The responses can be zzso zzso and suggest that zzso but not zzso can selectively activate zzso zzso that engage the divergent zzso Although structural and zzso analyses of selected zzso zzso have identified key regions of interaction, how these translate into function by related zzso is poorly zzso To determine the mechanisms underlying the distinct activities of zzso and the disparate properties of zzso and zzso in spinal zzso development, we have performed a zzso zzso analysis of zzso and used the information to predict and test sites within zzso that may control zzso properties, in particular the ability of a zzso to orient zzso through interactions with zzso 

We demonstrate that whereas all zzso can induce zzso zzso there is selectivity in the ability also to orient zzso or evoke growth cone zzso The degree to which a zzso zzso is not predictable by overall protein similarity with other zzso but comparison of sequences of potent and zzso zzso zzso with that of the zzso zzso revealed three candidate positions within the zzso at which the zzso acid zzso may zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso swapping analysis has identified one zzso zzso in zzso that blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with any of the zzso acids present at the equivalent zzso position in the zzso subset of zzso zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso swapping zzso into zzso reduces zzso zzso The zzso capacity of the zzso was unchanged by these zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso is structurally zzso for zzso interactions that result in the zzso of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso Moreover, since zzso 48 in zzso and the corresponding zzso in zzso are important for type II zzso zzso our results provide a basis for a zzso understanding of the diverse activities of zzso in spinal zzso zzso
