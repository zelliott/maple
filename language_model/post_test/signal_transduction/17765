zzso is an early zzso response to trauma and zzso The role of zzso insulin resistance to the development of this zzso is not well zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the liver becomes insulin resistant and to identify the particular zzso insulin signaling pathways that may be compromised following trauma and zzso Male adult rats were bled to a mean zzso pressure of 40 zzso and maintained at that pressure for 90 zzso followed by resuscitation with zzso zzso Data showed that trauma and zzso rapidly induced profound zzso in combination with significant zzso suggesting the development of insulin zzso After trauma and zzso zzso insulin signaling via the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso signaling was relatively zzso The regulation zzso of a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso was also zzso The present study provides convincing evidence of a rapid onset zzso insulin resistance following a combination of trauma and zzso
