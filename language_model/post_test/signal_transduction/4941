Acute lethal zzso of zzso zzso a toxin produced by zzso zzso has been attributed to protein zzso type 1 and type 2A zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso zzso However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso exposure are less zzso We studied mice zzso injected with saline or 25 zzso zzso for 28 days zzso 2 zzso zzso induced zzso in liver and not in zzso or heart of treated zzso Liver also showed decreased zzso levels zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the control group, zzso zzso activity decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, no difference in total zzso zzso activity was found between both the zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and zzso disruption contributed to the zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso These effects occurred in association with sustained zzso of signaling zzso and development of zzso mechanisms to maintain total zzso zzso zzso
