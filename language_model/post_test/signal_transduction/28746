Human zzso II zzso is the most potent zzso zzso identified so zzso Our previous study showed that zzso is a potent zzso of airway smooth muscle cells zzso inducing zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso The signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso effect remains to be zzso This study was conducted to investigate the signal zzso zzso in the proliferation of zzso induced by zzso 

In primary cultures of rat zzso activities of protein zzso C zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso were zzso The effect of zzso on zzso and zzso was studied by adding zzso A zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, to study the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso The zzso free calcium concentration induced by zzso was measured using zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, after zzso for 20 zzso It increased zzso activity in a zzso manner, being zzso times as that of control for 24 hours zzso zzso zzso It promoted the zzso free calcium concentration increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 50 zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, while zzso 50 zzso had no effect on zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso while having no effect on zzso activity zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increases zzso free calcium concentration and activates zzso zzso and zzso The signal zzso zzso between zzso and zzso has zzso
