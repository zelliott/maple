Since the early days of zzso zzso zzso have been used to investigate zzso acid zzso production, polar transport and zzso Here, using zzso zzso we first showed that polar transport of zzso zzso at the tip region is regulated by zzso Then, the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso to the zzso zzso flow after zzso which results in zzso zzso When zzso was applied to zzso tips, substantial amounts of the stable isotope were incorporated into zzso at the tip region, and the labeled zzso was transported in a polar manner at approximately 7 zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso was present in almost all zzso zzso showed a relatively zzso distribution at the tip, but a zzso cellular zzso at lower zzso Application of the zzso transport zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso A zzso at the very tip region almost completely inhibited zzso movement from the zzso These zzso also severely suppressed zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso that binds to zzso suppressed not only the expression of an zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso on the lower side and zzso on the upper side of the zzso zzso zone, corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso downward zzso of zzso control the differential growth rate of the cells by attenuating zzso zzso response zzso including zzso and therefore result in zzso zzso
