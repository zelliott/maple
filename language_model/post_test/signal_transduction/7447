The zzso of zzso and the zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso are frequently observed in human zzso zzso In the present study, in order to investigate the possible association between the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted on 24 zzso specimens from patients with pulmonary zzso which revealed a significant positive correlation between zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso To investigate the association between zzso and zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso (an inhibitor of zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso were measured by real-time zzso Western zzso analysis was also performed to detect the protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects induced by the zzso of the activity of zzso or zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso cells were investigated, demonstrating that the zzso zzso was inhibited by suppressing the activity of zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso The findings from our study suggest the existence of a positive feedback regulation between zzso zzso and zzso expression and that this loop may play an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
