zzso are dynamic zzso structures found in zzso cells zzso and other cells of the zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso an important zzso zzso produced during DC zzso zzso zzso zzso within minutes after zzso Here, we demonstrate that this response is zzso by zzso zzso occurs downstream of zzso zzso and is dependent on zzso zzso Whereas zzso stimulation leads to zzso of the small zzso zzso decreased levels of zzso and zzso are zzso These results show that zzso stimulation leads to zzso of the zzso axis to promote zzso contraction and subsequent zzso zzso Because zzso zzso is accompanied by de zzso formation of focal zzso we propose that the zzso of these two different zzso structures is zzso regulated by zzso zzso and relative activities of zzso zzso and zzso
