The zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso I zzso in complex with its zzso zzso delivers an zzso signal from zzso with an orange zzso and a repellent signal from a second zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso system with zzso zzso in complex with its zzso zzso we identified by zzso zzso labeling a site zzso on zzso that is zzso active in signal relay to zzso Using zzso spin labeling of zzso with a zzso side chain, we detected a change in zzso following zzso zzso such that the spin probe exhibits a splitting of the outer zzso zzso zzso significantly smaller than that of the electron zzso resonance spectrum in the dark zzso The dark zzso of five zzso complexes that do not discriminate between orange and zzso zzso show shifts to lower or higher zzso values correlated with the zzso in their zzso behavior to one- and zzso zzso These data are interpreted in terms of a model in which the dark complex is populated by two zzso in the wild type, one that zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the other that activates it zzso shifted in the dark by zzso and shifted in the zzso zzso complex in opposite directions by zzso and zzso zzso
