Free fatty acid zzso is believed to be a major environmental factor linking obesity to Type II zzso We have recently reported that zzso can induce zzso in zzso through zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso insulin zzso Our results show that a prolonged treatment of primary zzso with zzso blunted insulin suppression of zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Reduction of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso correlated with zzso of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso prolonged exposure of zzso to zzso failed to reduce zzso zzso of zzso An zzso against zzso prevented zzso suppression of the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, a prolonged exposure of zzso to zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso while slightly increasing zzso zzso of zzso The decrease of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso was reversed by the zzso of zzso We further show that a prolonged exposure of primary zzso to zzso elevated the protein level of the zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso gene in a zzso manner, but had no effect on the zzso level of zzso zzso down the zzso gene prevented zzso to inhibit insulin zzso of zzso and insulin suppression of zzso Together, results from this study demonstrate a critical role for zzso in zzso zzso insulin zzso
