Previous studies have shown that nicotine increases zzso zzso cell zzso numbers and functional zzso However, the mechanisms by which nicotine increases zzso numbers and activity remain to be zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso numbers and activity are associated with zzso zzso which involves zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether nicotine might be able to prevent zzso of zzso through zzso zzso leading to the zzso of cellular zzso 

After prolonged in zzso zzso zzso were incubated with or without zzso The zzso of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso incorporation zzso and colony zzso were employed to assess zzso capacity and zzso expansion potential, zzso To examine further the underlying mechanisms of these effects, we measured zzso activity and the zzso of zzso by Western zzso 

zzso zzso prevented the onset of zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, nicotine increased the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso activity and zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso blockers, either zzso or zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso the effects of nicotine on zzso 

The results of the present study indicate that nicotine delays the onset of zzso zzso which might be related to zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso In addition, the effects of nicotine might be specifically zzso by zzso zzso
