zzso was identified 20 years ago zzso zzso & Baltimore, zzso zzso zzso 46, zzso as a nuclear factor that binds the zzso light chain zzso in zzso (and zzso the name zzso and was shown to play roles in innate and zzso immune zzso More recently, its role in many other cellular processes has become zzso Perhaps, not surprisingly, zzso activity of the zzso zzso has been observed and linked to the progression of several human zzso including zzso Research in the last two decades has identified the major mechanisms of zzso of this zzso and has documented the roles of the key zzso Over 200 zzso stimuli are known to activate zzso These include bacterial and viral products, cellular receptors and zzso zzso and growth factors and physical and zzso stress zzso The major cellular targets of zzso are zzso immune zzso zzso zzso stress response zzso regulators of zzso zzso factors, growth factors, zzso and cell cycle zzso In addition, zzso is known to be important for zzso of several viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso Given that, such a large number of stimuli can activate zzso which in turn activates an equally large number of target zzso understanding how specificity generated within the framework of zzso signaling is a major zzso A thorough understanding of this would be instrumental in designing zzso specific zzso of zzso for the treatment of specific human zzso
