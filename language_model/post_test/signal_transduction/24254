zzso growth factors are proteins that control zzso differentiation and survival, and consequently play important roles in the developing and adult stages of the nervous zzso Study of the genes that are regulated by these growth factors has provided insight into the proteins that are critical to the maturation of the nervous system, suggesting that select zzso may play a role in the control of body zzso by the brain and peripheral nervous zzso Our understanding of the mechanisms of action of zzso growth factors has increased through experimental manipulation of cultured zzso and zzso cell zzso In particular, the zzso zzso cell line, which displays many properties of adrenal zzso cells and zzso differentiation into sympathetic zzso cells when treated with nerve growth factor, has been extensively investigated to identify components of zzso signaling pathways as well as the genes that they zzso zzso was one of the first zzso clones identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso gene is regulated in zzso in the nervous system by zzso by electrical activity, in response to injury or seizure, and by feeding and the zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso rich in paired basic zzso zzso this zzso is zzso processed in zzso and neuroendocrine cells and is released via the regulated zzso zzso Generation and analysis of knockout mice that fail to zzso zzso indicate that this protein plays a critical, zzso role in the regulation of energy zzso providing a possible link between zzso function in the nervous system and the peripheral control of feeding and zzso zzso Future experiments should clarify the sites and mechanisms of action of this zzso zzso and neuroendocrine zzso
