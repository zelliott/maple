The zzso expression of zzso factors is a critical process for any bacterial pathogen to colonize its zzso Here we investigated the mechanisms of niche adaptation of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso by combining genetic approaches and shotgun zzso We demonstrated that expression of the zzso type IV zzso system zzso and its zzso zzso proteins require the alternative zzso factor zzso which levels are controlled by the stringent response zzso components zzso and zzso The zzso zzso requires an active zzso zzso system zzso while zzso expression is controlled by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a strong zzso of zzso zzso expression whereas zzso zzso or zzso deletion fully zzso its zzso In contrast to their zzso effect on the zzso zzso which is critical at the early stage of host infection, zzso and zzso zzso regulate the zzso zzso which mediates zzso zzso infection at a later stage of the colonization zzso Our findings support a model where the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control the zzso expression of zzso adaptation factors during host zzso
