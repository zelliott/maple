The zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and is thought to be dependent upon intrinsic zzso zzso activity, largely because zzso is inhibited by a zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso of the receptors for zzso insulin, zzso and zzso We confirmed that this zzso inhibited the degradation of the zzso zzso However, two different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acids zzso 591 and zzso zzso did not prevent zzso zzso degradation, so demonstrating that zzso zzso activity is not essential for this zzso Three other zzso zzso were found to cause zzso zzso degradation in the absence of zzso most probably by zzso the structure of the zzso loop of the zzso zzso It is known that extensive movement of the zzso is necessary for zzso zzso and is normally induced by zzso It is therefore suggested that some aspect or consequence of the change in structure of the zzso caused by zzso binding also activates zzso zzso so ensuring that zzso is coupled to but is not necessarily dependent upon zzso zzso zzso
