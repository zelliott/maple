zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment to zzso Despite its zzso zzso zzso stress is hypothesized to be one of the key zzso zzso It is thus proposed that manipulation of the expression of zzso genes that are zzso in the presence of zzso zzso may serve as a therapeutic strategy for motor zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing either zzso or zzso genes were tested in the motor zzso zzso cell line, and in the ALS tissue culture model, zzso cells expressing the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells zzso either zzso or zzso showed a significant decrease in zzso zzso stress levels by 40 and 50% respectively compared with controls, whereas cell survival was increased by zzso in both zzso The zzso potential of those two genes was further investigated in zzso in the zzso ALS mouse model, by administering intramuscular injections of zzso virus zzso 6 zzso expressing either of the target genes at a zzso zzso Despite the absence of a significant effect in survival, disease onset or zzso which can be explained by the inefficient viral delivery, the promising in zzso data suggest that a more widespread zzso delivery is zzso
