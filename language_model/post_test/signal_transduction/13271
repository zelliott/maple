The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in regulating cell survival, zzso and zzso However, the distinct role of zzso zzso in regulating tumor development is not yet zzso We have found previously that skin tumor formation induced by the tumor promoter, zzso zzso is suppressed in zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso mice are more susceptible to zzso skin tumor development than zzso zzso The rate of tumor development in zzso mice was significantly more rapid than that observed in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso At the end of 33 weeks of zzso promotion, the number of skin tumors and tumors zzso zzso in diameter per mouse in zzso mice was significantly increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, relative to the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and the number of zzso per mouse were also higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse skin was more sensitive to zzso zzso DNA binding activity and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are two important survival signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso is a crucial zzso of skin tumor zzso
