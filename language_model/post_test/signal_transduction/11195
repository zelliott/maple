zzso is a critical zzso for zzso and cell zzso Here we report delayed zzso and decreased bone mineral density in zzso zzso and zzso mice due to an attenuated zzso differentiation of bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso The mechanism involved in the impaired differentiation of zzso is due, at least zzso to the zzso zzso signaling zzso and the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso along with the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso and ultimately increased zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso signaling may result in the compromised zzso expression in zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso a potential agent for clinical treatment of human diseases, caused accelerated bone loss in zzso mice, which is also associated with the zzso zzso signaling in zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is crucial for the differentiation of zzso by influencing zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso
