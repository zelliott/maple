zzso X syndrome, caused by the loss of zzso gene function and loss of fragile X mental zzso protein zzso is the most commonly inherited form of mental zzso The syndrome is characterized by zzso learning deficits, reduced risk of cancer, zzso spine zzso and facial zzso However, the molecular mechanism that links loss of function of zzso to the learning disability remains zzso Here, we report an examination of small zzso Ras signaling and synaptic zzso zzso zzso trafficking in cultured slices and intact brains of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, synaptic delivery of zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso is impaired, resulting in a selective loss of zzso long-term synaptic zzso zzso Although Ras activity is zzso its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling appears normal, and zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso or zzso signaling is compromised in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling restores synaptic delivery of zzso zzso and normal zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest zzso Ras signaling as a novel mechanism for fragile X syndrome and indicate manipulating zzso signaling to be a potentially effective approach for treating patients with fragile X zzso
