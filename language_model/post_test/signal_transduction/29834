Previously, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso through inducing zzso zzso It has recently been reported that the zzso factors involved in zzso zzso by certain signaling factors may vary in different cell zzso However, little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso expression at the zzso zzso This increase in zzso gene expression was due to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso factor zzso binding site was identified as the zzso for the zzso of zzso promoter by zzso as determined by deletion and zzso zzso In addition, gel shift and zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso element binds specifically to the zzso factor zzso Treatment with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso significantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, the transient expression of zzso with dominant negative zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we report the novel finding that zzso factor zzso that is involved in the zzso control of zzso regulation on zzso in response to zzso has now been zzso
