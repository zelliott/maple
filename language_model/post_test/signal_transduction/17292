Severe poisoning has recently been diagnosed in humans having hip implants composed of zzso zzso due to the release of particulate wear debris on zzso and ceramic implants which stimulates zzso zzso and destroys bone and soft zzso leading to zzso zzso and muscular zzso zzso with this premise, in this study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of zzso zzso on skeletal muscle using mouse skeletal zzso zzso as an in zzso zzso As detected using zzso zzso zzso increasing zzso doses (from 5 to zzso affected the viability of zzso zzso mainly by cell zzso which was attenuated by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso branch of the death domain zzso signaling zzso On the other hand, zzso was hardly zzso as supported by the lack of zzso and zzso zzso the latter resulting in only faint zzso after exposure to higher zzso doses for prolonged time zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso which was characterized by the increased expression of zzso and zzso stress proteins and other typical zzso molecular zzso such as early zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Overall, these results suggested that zzso may impact skeletal muscle zzso as an zzso of cell necrosis and zzso zzso
