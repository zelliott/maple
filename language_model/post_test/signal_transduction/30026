We have previously demonstrated that zzso of the zzso pathways is required for transforming growth factor beta zzso induction of zzso zzso Here we examined the role of the zzso pathways in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso activated the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso an effect that zzso zzso induction of zzso expression in these zzso zzso induction of both zzso activity and zzso zzso was blocked by expression of a zzso zzso of the type II zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso of Ras zzso or by the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso also induced zzso complex formation at the zzso zzso site zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter within 2 h of zzso addition, consistent with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The primary components present in the zzso zzso complex bound to the zzso promoter were zzso D and zzso Moreover, addition of zzso or expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso leading to induction of zzso activity, which, in turn, zzso zzso zzso Our results also indicate that the type II zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso and the resulting zzso of zzso zzso
