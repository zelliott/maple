Waves zzso in zzso zzso is a reliable way to transmit signals in zzso A fascinating example where living cells comprise such a medium is zzso zzso which zzso waves of zzso to attract distant zzso While zzso zzso in a similar fashion as zzso zzso it is unclear if zzso waves exist in zzso zzso and what mechanisms could zzso zzso 

We propose that zzso zzso waves may naturally develop as a result of zzso zzso Using a zzso mathematical model of zzso circuits coupled in space we show that the known characteristics of zzso response favor zzso zzso 

While the zzso wave of zzso is generally beneficial for inflammation resolution, our model predicts that there exist special conditions that can cause chronic inflammation and zzso of acute inflammatory zzso
