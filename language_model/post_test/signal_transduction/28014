The immune system is capable of interacting with tumor cells in such a way as to lead to tumor cell death, and this knowledge has inspired therapies to manipulate patient immune systems to eradicate zzso However, tumor cells are able to mitigate the zzso immune response, a fact that has rarely been addressed in the design of zzso There are many different tumor cell immune functions that play a role in zzso the zzso immune zzso In some cases, these functions appear to be intimately associated with the tumor cell abnormalities that lead to loss of growth control, such as the cases where classical tumor zzso proteins regulate tumor cell immune function zzso In other cases, tumor cell zzso appear to affect only the zzso response, such as tumor cell zzso that eliminate zzso class I zzso Here I review the bases for tumor cell immune functions, noting in particular where tumor cell zzso the gold standard for identifying a zzso function, are known to be responsible for the tumor cell immune zzso This review also discusses other known regulatory anomalies, in the absence of a known zzso that are apparently important for tumor development and that regulate tumor cell immune zzso Surprisingly, in many cases where the tumor cell immune function is well understood in terms of its effect on the zzso immune response, the tumor zzso underlying the tumor cell immune function is completely zzso
