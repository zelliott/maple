We describe the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which spontaneously develops zzso mimicking bacterial speck disease and zzso expresses zzso and molecular markers associated with pathogen zzso Despite the zzso expression of zzso responses, zzso is unable to suppress the growth of virulent zzso However, zzso elicits normal hypersensitive response in response to zzso zzso thus indicating that zzso is not defective in the induction of normal resistance zzso The zzso leaves of zzso support the growth of zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is defective in the transfer of zzso factors into the plant cells, and therefore zzso to zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso expresses many of the cellular processes that are required for pathogen growth during zzso zzso analyses reveal that salicylic acid and zzso are required for zzso formation, while zzso zzso zzso development in zzso suggesting that significant overlap exist between the zzso pathways leading to zzso and zzso cell zzso Our results suggest that host cell death during compatible zzso at least in part, is genetically controlled by the plant and zzso may positively regulate this zzso
