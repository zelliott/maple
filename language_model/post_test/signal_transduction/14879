zzso zzso is the most important zzso oxygen species zzso primarily generated in zzso The main cellular constituents with capabilities to generate zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso respiratory zzso The emphasis of our article is centered in critically examining hypotheses proposing that zzso generated by zzso zzso and zzso are key elements in zzso and hypoxic responses generation in carotid body zzso zzso Available data indicate that zzso cells express a specific zzso of zzso zzso that is activated by zzso generated zzso acting as negative zzso of the carotid body zzso hypoxic zzso Literature is also consistent in supporting that poisoned respiratory chain can produce high amounts of zzso making zzso zzso potential zzso of the CB zzso zzso by zzso zzso However, most data zzso the notion that levels of zzso capable of strongly zzso zzso cells, would not increase the rate of zzso production in zzso making zzso zzso unlikely triggers of hypoxic responses in the zzso Finally, we review recent literature on zzso zzso from two perspectives, as potential zzso in zzso cells and as generators of zzso which is considered to be a zzso scavenger of major quantitative importance in zzso zzso
