The emergence of larger brains with large numbers of zzso is an evolutionary innovation in zzso and zzso However, the corresponding changes in cortical zzso zzso during zzso evolution are poorly zzso Here we examine the cortical development of Madagascar ground zzso and report unique characteristics of their zzso cortical zzso The rates of proliferation and zzso differentiation in the gecko zzso are much lower than those in other zzso zzso zzso is highly activated in the gecko cortical zzso which provides a molecular basis for the low rate of cortical zzso Interestingly, multiple zzso zzso are zzso generated in the gecko cortex, similar to other zzso These results suggest that changes in the regulation of cortical neural zzso have accelerated zzso and provided zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso regulation for making cortical zzso zzso has evolved in a common zzso of zzso
