Plant zzso zzso large numbers of zzso zzso that are structurally related to the zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso found in zzso Here, we describe recent advances in the zzso of several of these plant zzso zzso at the molecular level, including the identification of zzso complexes, small zzso zzso and zzso proteins involved in signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that plant zzso zzso have evolved independently of the zzso zzso families found in zzso This hypothesis is supported by functional studies that have revealed differences between zzso zzso zzso in plants and animals, particularly concerning their interactions with zzso zzso Despite these zzso however, plant and animal zzso zzso share many common features, such as their single zzso structure, their inclusion in zzso complexes, the involvement of zzso and trans zzso in zzso zzso and the existence of zzso and zzso that zzso zzso zzso These points of convergence may represent features that are essential for a functional zzso zzso zzso
