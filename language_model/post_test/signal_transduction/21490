This past decade has brought considerable progress towards zzso the molecular mechanisms of oxygen sensing pathways by which zzso cells are able to detect and zzso or zzso to zzso In contrast, far less is known about the protein and DNA constituents that zzso many zzso species to withstand and recover from even more severe and prolonged zzso zzso In spite of these differences in zzso zzso zzso in oxygen supply is, from zzso to insects to zzso signaled onto the DNA level predominantly by zzso factors zzso Across the animal kingdom, zzso accumulates in zzso but not zzso cells and functions in a remarkably zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and insect zzso zzso models, work by us and others has implicated zzso in restoring zzso delivery via zzso zzso synthesis zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for these zzso to adapt and survive during moderate zzso zzso A similar zzso role for zzso in zzso but not zzso environments had previously been established for another zzso zzso model, the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulations of zzso zzso and zzso genes in cell culture and in zzso have zzso aided in uncovering novel zzso mechanisms that might operate to fine-tune the activity of this zzso factor under steadily zzso rather than changing, oxygen zzso We conclude our review with yet another addition to the growing list of zzso many zzso the control of cellular growth during fly zzso
