The target of zzso zzso zzso a central regulator of zzso cell growth, exists in two essential, yet zzso zzso zzso complexes in the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a component of both zzso complexes, is essential for cell zzso However, it is unclear whether the essential function of zzso is linked to zzso zzso or zzso To that end, we carried out a genetic screen to isolate zzso deletion zzso zzso Here we report that zzso in zzso and zzso suppress zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suggesting that the essential function of zzso is linked only to zzso More importantly, characterization of zzso bypass zzso reveals a role for protein zzso 2A zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso We show that zzso a member of the zzso complex involved in zzso cell cycle arrest, interacts with zzso and zzso zzso components of zzso and deletions of components of the zzso complex and zzso rescue growth defects in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, loss of the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso restores zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exist in a complex with zzso known as zzso suggesting a zzso functional association of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso represents a novel regulatory mechanism for controlling spatial cell growth of zzso
