Combined prospective human cohort and prospective controlled animal zzso 

To determine whether free zzso is available in zzso disc material in zzso sufficient to diffuse to zzso receptors and affect the activity of zzso in the zzso root zzso that may transmit pain zzso 

The severity of zzso zzso pain cannot be fully explained by physical pressure on nerve roots or zzso In experimental models, inflammatory processes are relatively modest under conditions of disc zzso The hypothesis for the current study was that the zzso link and core zzso which contain high zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be a source of zzso when zzso zzso in an environment without zzso zzso zzso zzso would be free to diffuse to the zzso root zzso to affect zzso zzso 

zzso material was harvested during surgery from zzso and zzso portions in patients undergoing zzso zzso disc surgery and subjected to zzso and zzso liquid zzso for assessment of the presence of zzso disc zzso zzso zzso pumps with differing zzso of zzso zzso based on human data were implanted in the rat zzso space for 72 hours and zzso root zzso zzso in the region were zzso 

zzso of disc zzso demonstrated zzso evidence for significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High performance liquid zzso showed significant zzso of zzso in disc material and significantly more in zzso than in zzso disc material zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso root zzso after zzso zzso infusion was found at zzso two orders of magnitude below measured disc zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of adjacent zzso 

zzso originating from zzso disc zzso may diffuse to the zzso root zzso and effect zzso zzso Consideration may be given to treating disc zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso
