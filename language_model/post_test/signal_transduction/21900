To investigate the expression of nuclear zzso zzso B zzso in zzso zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso and to study its role in the zzso of zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was examined in biopsy specimens from 42 zzso patients, 20 patients with primary zzso zzso and 5 normal subjects by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was notably higher than that in normal control zzso zzso and in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was lower than that in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There might be protein degradation of zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso which suggests that zzso signal zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
