zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso that opposes the development of synaptic strengthening and the consolidation of fear zzso In contrast, stress zzso fear memory formation, potentially by zzso zzso releasing factor zzso zzso in the zzso cell group of the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso 

Here, using zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso we examined the expression and role of zzso in regulating synaptic plasticity in rat zzso zzso and its zzso by zzso 

zzso protein zzso zzso was selectively expressed in zzso zzso in the oval nucleus of the zzso Following repeated restraint stress zzso animals displayed a significant increase in zzso behavior, which was associated with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in the zzso as well as selectively enhancing the magnitude of long-term zzso zzso induced in Type III, putative zzso zzso To determine if the changes in zzso expression following zzso were mechanistically related to zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso application of zzso on the induction of zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso acts to buffer zzso zzso against excessive zzso while zzso of zzso after chronic stress may result in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and contribute to prolonged states of zzso Thus, targeted zzso of zzso activity might represent a novel treatment strategy for zzso anxiety zzso
