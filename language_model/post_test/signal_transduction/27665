Both zzso and zzso induce zzso synthesis in B cells by binding to their functional receptors on target zzso These receptors are considered to be composed of zzso and both share the zzso alpha chain zzso zzso as a zzso zzso is an inherited zzso underlying zzso zzso and zzso and generating high zzso zzso and/or high specific zzso against common zzso Based on findings concerning the molecular mechanism of the signal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso alpha was considered a gene that gave rise to zzso One zzso in the zzso alpha zzso zzso has been correlated with zzso by both genetic and functional zzso The strategy used in these studies should lead to identification of other genes involved in zzso Furthermore, these studies should be useful for gene diagnosis of zzso and development of new therapies for zzso in the zzso
