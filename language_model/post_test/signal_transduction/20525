The widespread increase in the production and use of zzso has increased the potential for zzso exposure; however, the biological effects of zzso inhalation are poorly zzso zzso were exposed to zzso titanium dioxide zzso (10 zzso lung zzso at 24 h zzso the zzso muscle was prepared for zzso zzso zzso exposure did not alter zzso nerve stimulation zzso zzso zzso under normal zzso however, zzso zzso zzso revealed a more robust zzso zzso inhalation reduced zzso zzso in response to active zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso experiments, zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso affected only zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso only attenuated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This group displayed an enhanced zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso zzso these studies indicate that zzso exposure reduces zzso NO zzso and alters zzso zzso Furthermore, the enhanced zzso zzso sensitivity suggests an zzso sympathetic zzso
