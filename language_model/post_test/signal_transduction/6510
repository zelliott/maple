The zzso zzso system is the master regulator of zzso gene expression in the zzso pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This paper reports the partial cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are increasingly recognized as opportunistic pathogens in zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are functionally zzso while signal perception by the two sensor proteins seems to be zzso Furthermore, it is shown that, despite the high similarity of the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter recognition by the response regulator proteins differs substantially in these zzso
