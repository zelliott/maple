It is well known that zzso levels are increased during zzso and protect the heart during zzso However, less is known about the role of zzso zzso zzso pathways in hearts with left zzso zzso and zzso zzso we assessed zzso levels and selective zzso expression in transgenic mice with left zzso zzso dysfunction secondary to zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were reduced by zzso at 3 and 6 weeks of age in zzso zzso zzso This change was accompanied by a zzso increase in the levels of zzso and a 50% reduction in the levels of zzso That the increase in zzso density was of zzso significance was shown by the fact that zzso responsiveness to the zzso selective zzso zzso was enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso Similar changes in zzso levels were found in 2 other models of heart failure, mice zzso zzso and mice after chronic pressure overload, suggesting that the changes in zzso signaling were secondary to zzso dysfunction rather than to zzso zzso 

zzso dysfunction secondary to the zzso of zzso is associated with marked zzso in zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso system and its signaling pathways may be a novel therapeutic target in patients with heart zzso
