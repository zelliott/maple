zzso zzso is fundamental to the biology of all living zzso zzso is vital to such diverse zzso processes as carbon zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A defined subset of zzso zzso identified in zzso and zzso are directly activated by zzso As such, zzso represents the first identified biological zzso for fluctuations in zzso zzso carbon zzso The identification of a signal zzso zzso activated by zzso has far reaching implications for understanding how the cell responds to fluctuations in this essential zzso
