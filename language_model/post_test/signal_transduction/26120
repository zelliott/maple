Acute zzso of cells by tumor necrosis factor zzso has been well zzso but little is known about later zzso of zzso responses that are relevant for cells exposed to zzso for several days during zzso We found that prolonged exposure of human zzso to zzso resulted in a wave of delayed but sustained zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso proteins and of calcium zzso that became apparent 1-3 d after zzso zzso These signaling events culminated in the induction and zzso of the zzso zzso factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso which zzso a gene expression program leading to cell fusion and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity primed zzso for enhanced zzso in response to zzso High zzso expression was apparent in zzso zzso in a subset of patients with zzso inflammatory zzso Thus, long-term exposure to zzso activates zzso signaling and an zzso gene zzso program important for cell fusion and zzso These findings identify a signaling zzso activated by zzso that is important for zzso cell differentiation and suggest a role for zzso calcium and zzso signaling in chronic inflammation and associated bone zzso
