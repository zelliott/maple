zzso unloading zzso results in zzso stress, skeletal muscle zzso and increased damage upon zzso Heat shock proteins zzso protect against zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso are depressed with long-term unloading zzso zzso or zzso We tested the hypotheses that long-term zzso would zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso would allow recovery in the zzso Adult zzso rats were divided into three groups: zzso zzso for 28 zzso and zzso + 7 days of zzso zzso zzso mass decreased with zzso and did not recover to control values with zzso zzso decreased with zzso zzso and did not recover with zzso zzso zzso heat shock zzso was depressed with zzso and zzso zzso was reduced with zzso but recovered with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased with zzso but only zzso zzso zzso recovered with zzso zzso zzso increased in both zzso and zzso These data indicate that prolonged unloading and subsequent zzso results in complex, differential regulation of zzso and zzso pathways in the rat zzso zzso Thus zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways may lead not only to muscle zzso with prolonged zzso but also impaired recovery of muscle mass during early zzso
