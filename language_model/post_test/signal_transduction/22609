zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso has great therapeutic potential, and has been shown to prolong zzso survival in a variety of animal zzso To gain further insight into the mechanism by which zzso blockade prevents zzso zzso we studied cardiac zzso survival in the complete absence of B7 zzso using mice lacking zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine the role of B7 on donor vs recipient cells, we used zzso mice as either donors or recipients of zzso zzso zzso recipients acutely reject fully zzso hearts from both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso recipients allow long-term survival of zzso from both zzso and zzso mice, with minimal zzso evidence of either acute or chronic rejection in zzso harvested after 90 zzso The zzso mice acutely reject zzso zzso if zzso stimulation is restored by the administration of zzso to zzso and can mount an zzso in mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are capable of generating zzso both in zzso and in zzso Our results demonstrate that in the zzso to mouse zzso cardiac zzso B7 molecules on recipient cells rather than donor cells provide the critical zzso zzso The indefinite survival of zzso into zzso recipients further shows that the absence of B7 zzso alone is sufficient to prevent zzso
