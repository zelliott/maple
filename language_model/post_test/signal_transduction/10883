zzso proteins are a large family of zzso zzso zzso proteins bind to the zzso receptors and zzso zzso and through stabilizing the critical zzso zzso initiate a complex signaling cascade that plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, mostly by zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso or zzso zzso of zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso have only been discovered in a small fraction of zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso a hallmark of activated zzso zzso pathway, have been observed in most common forms of human zzso indicating that zzso of this zzso may play an important role in tumor zzso Over the past 15 years, our understanding of this signaling zzso has significantly improved with the identification of key regulatory proteins and the important downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso Given the fact that zzso signaling is tightly regulated at multiple cellular levels, the zzso itself offers ample targeting zzso points for cancer drug zzso In this review, we discuss some of the strategies that are being used or can be explored to target key components of the zzso signaling zzso in rational cancer drug zzso
