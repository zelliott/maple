zzso key components in biological processes and their associations is critical for deciphering cellular zzso Recently, numerous gene expression and molecular interaction experiments have been reported in zzso zzso and these have enabled systematic zzso Although a number of approaches have been used to predict gene functions and zzso tools that analyze the essential coordination of functional components in cellular processes still need to be zzso 

In this work, we present a new approach to study the cooperation of functional zzso zzso of functionally related zzso in a specific cellular zzso A cooperative module pair is defined as two zzso that significantly cooperate with certain functional genes in a cellular zzso This method identifies cooperative module pairs that significantly influence a cellular process and the correlated genes and interactions that are essential to that zzso Using the zzso cell cycle as an example, we identified 101 cooperative module associations among 82 zzso and importantly, we established a cell zzso cooperative module zzso Most of the identified module pairs cover cooperative pathways and components essential to the cell zzso We found that 14, 36, 18, 15, and 20 cooperative module pairs significantly cooperate with genes regulated in early zzso late zzso zzso zzso and M phase, zzso zzso module pairs that correlate with zzso and other essential regulators were also zzso These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that our methodology is effective for studying cooperative mechanisms in the cell zzso 

In this work, we propose a new approach to identifying zzso cooperative zzso and importantly, we establish a cell zzso cooperation module zzso These results provide a global view of the cell cycle and the method can be used to discover the dynamic coordination properties of functional components in other cellular zzso
