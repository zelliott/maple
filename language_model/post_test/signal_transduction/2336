Signal zzso mechanisms activated during the early stages of zzso cell death are poorly zzso We have recently identified the zzso 20 zzso zzso stress response zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso is markedly activated as early as 20 zzso after chemical zzso induced by exposure of zzso canine kidney or zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and any one of three zzso of the electron transport chain, cyanide zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since zzso stress activates zzso we zzso that zzso oxygen species zzso which are produced by the electron transport chain during chemical zzso might be responsible for zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso zzso and of production of zzso measured in cells loaded with zzso were compatible with a role for zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso cells with three unrelated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid, reduced both cellular zzso stress and zzso of zzso by zzso An increase in zzso free zzso zzso was necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso of cells with zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso of cells with zzso or the calcium zzso zzso had no effect on zzso activity, but zzso of cells with either of these agents markedly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso versus zzso In zzso chemical zzso activates zzso via an zzso zzso mechanism that is both critically dependent upon and markedly amplified by an increase in zzso This requirement for dual zzso of zzso stress and an increase in zzso may prevent inappropriate zzso of the zzso by milder degrees of zzso stress, which are insufficient to generate an increase in zzso The zzso of zzso may be one of the cell's earliest responses to zzso of zzso cell zzso
