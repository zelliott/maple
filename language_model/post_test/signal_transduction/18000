zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene yields mice with a zzso form of hypertension, raising fundamental questions on the role of zzso in acute regulation of the zzso Here, we show that water zzso food consumption, stool weight, urine volume, and sodium zzso are not significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso mice on standard zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso diet zzso zzso In conscious mice with an zzso zzso the infusion of a zzso saline solution containing zzso zzso resulted in a marked zzso in zzso mice but no response in zzso zzso zzso When zzso saline was given by zzso however, the kidney response of zzso and zzso mice was zzso raising the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract can directly regulate kidney zzso However, administration of zzso saline through an zzso route also resulted in equal kidney responses in zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso lacking protein was infused zzso zzso and zzso mice both responded at the kidney zzso Thus, zzso appears zzso for regulation of zzso zzso in response to changes in dietary sodium zzso but likely becomes critical in volume expansions where the zzso pressure remains constant, such as zzso immersion or the initial and zzso stages of zzso heart zzso
