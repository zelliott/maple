zzso zzso cause thousands of deaths each year in developing zzso The zzso projects of these zzso opened a new era in the identification of therapeutic zzso However, the putative function could be predicted for fewer than half of the zzso zzso In this work, all zzso zzso proteins containing predicted zzso spans were processed through an automated zzso routine and further analyzed in order to assign the most probable zzso The analysis consisted of zzso the whole predicted protein in different zzso More than 5,000 sequences were zzso and the predicted biological functions were grouped into 19 categories according to the hits obtained after zzso One focus of interest, due to the scarce information available on zzso is the proteins involved in zzso zzso In the present work, we identified 54 proteins belonging to this group, which were individually zzso The results show that by means of a simple pipeline it was possible to attribute probable functions to sequences zzso as coding for zzso zzso Also, we successfully identified the majority of candidates participating in the zzso pathways in zzso zzso
