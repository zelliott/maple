Development of the central nervous system is coordinated by zzso zzso zzso established within the neural zzso The zzso organizer zzso located between the zzso and anterior zzso is one such zzso Important signal molecules zzso by the zzso include members of the zzso growth factor and zzso zzso These signals are integrated with zzso and zzso derived signals to regulate development of the zzso and zzso 1 of the zzso The zzso is operational for a remarkably long period of zzso Depending on the zzso stage, it controls a variety of processes such as cell survival, cell identity, neural precursor zzso zzso differentiation and zzso zzso This review focuses on the zzso growth factor zzso its novel molecular regulatory mechanisms and how this zzso regulates multiple aspects of cell zzso in the developing zzso and anterior zzso
