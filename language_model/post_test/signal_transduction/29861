zzso signal zzso systems and their expanded zzso known as zzso are integral elements of the zzso and zzso resistance responses of a wide range of zzso bacteria and zzso and also regulate essential zzso As a consequence, zzso systems and zzso are recognized targets for the development of novel zzso agents and a number of chemically zzso zzso from different chemical classes have been identified by compound library zzso However, in the majority of cases these compounds do not appear to be selective for signal zzso pathways and exert their effect by multiple mechanisms of zzso The key to designing molecules to selectively disrupt signal zzso may lie with the zzso features of response regulators and the structural analysis of complexes of signaling zzso
