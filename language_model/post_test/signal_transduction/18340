zzso induced by zzso zzso has long been a major impediment of clinical applications of this effective zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice are highly resistant to zzso zzso To investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso in this zzso transgenic mice containing high levels of cardiac zzso and zzso controls were treated zzso with zzso at a single dose of 15 zzso and sacrificed on the 4th day after zzso zzso zzso was detected by a terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and confirmed by electron zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cardiac zzso zzso using an zzso method further identified zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited in the transgenic zzso The zzso effect of zzso was further revealed in primary cultures of zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso activated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which was critically involved in the zzso process, as demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were dramatically inhibited in the transgenic zzso The results thus demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso in zzso both in zzso and in zzso and zzso suppresses this effect through at least in part zzso of zzso zzso zzso
