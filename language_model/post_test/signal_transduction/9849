We have previously demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso zzso in rat breast zzso cells, zzso In this report, we have examined the importance of this regulation in human breast zzso 

The regulatory roles of zzso on cell invasion and zzso expression were zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso and survival of breast cancer patients were zzso 

zzso enhanced cell invasion in both zzso and zzso zzso 231 breast cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso 231 zzso zzso results on zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were shown to be a result of differential zzso zzso competency in zzso and zzso zzso High levels of zzso and zzso zzso expression were significantly associated with survival in breast cancer zzso Most importantly, zzso patients had a poorer prognosis when zzso was zzso while zzso patients had a better prognosis when zzso was zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso can act as a zzso or zzso of breast cancer progression by regulating zzso expression in a zzso manner and that zzso and zzso together may be a novel zzso indicator for breast cancer zzso
