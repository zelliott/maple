zzso zzso zzso use zzso zzso to selectively bind zzso cells, initiating their zzso zzso In a related process, the retinal zzso zzso zzso employs zzso zzso to recognize spent zzso outer segment particles zzso Here, we show that zzso cells and zzso compete for binding to these zzso indicating that zzso and zzso cells expose surface signals recognizable by zzso and zzso zzso binding to zzso required protein zzso C zzso zzso In zzso zzso binding was zzso activated even before any zzso challenge and was reduced by zzso zzso In zzso it was dormant but became activated upon zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso differed from zzso binding to the same zzso zzso in zzso cells in that the former followed much faster zzso similar to particle binding zzso by zzso zzso of zzso for particle binding correlated with its recruitment into a zzso zzso a process sensitive to pharmacological zzso of zzso in both types of zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso particle binding required zzso zzso These data constitute the first evidence that zzso zzso actively regulate the earliest phase of zzso zzso particle zzso by controlling zzso zzso
