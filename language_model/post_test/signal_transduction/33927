Previous in zzso studies suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of diabetic zzso but the consequences of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have not been well zzso in diabetic zzso zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso cells zzso In zzso 32 zzso rats were injected with zzso zzso N zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso Eight rats from each group were treated with zzso for 3 zzso In zzso rat zzso were exposed to medium containing zzso zzso zzso or 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso M zzso for 24 zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were determined by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso Western zzso for zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine zzso zzso ameliorated the increases in zzso zzso ratio and protein expression in zzso zzso by 89 and zzso and in zzso zzso by 70 and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Under diabetic conditions, zzso protein expression was zzso whereas zzso zzso protein expression was increased zzso zzso zzso and these changes were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso cells were also significantly increased in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ameliorated these increases in zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso In conclusion, these findings suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has a beneficial effect on the development of diabetic zzso by zzso the increase in zzso expression and zzso
