zzso zzso is of pivotal functional importance and this has resulted in extensive research and rapid development in the zzso zzso zzso involves members of three molecular families: zzso members of the zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso and zzso Recently, considerable structural information on zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso of zzso molecules has been zzso This fact, combined with the identification of several novel zzso zzso has increased our understanding of how they function at the molecular zzso Furthermore, the important issue of how zzso are activated to become adhesive is rapidly zzso It is clearly evident that the knowledge accumulated from basic research will increasingly be applied in clinical zzso In this review we focus on two important families of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and their zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is put on their zzso zzso their mode of regulation and on novel zzso molecules recently zzso
