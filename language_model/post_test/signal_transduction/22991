zzso zzso such as zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso represent zzso minor zzso species that nonetheless are capable of acting as zzso zzso As an organ system dominated by zzso the nervous system would seem a likely benefactor of this form of zzso zzso A major difficulty in determining the zzso importance of these zzso however, has been a lack of cloned zzso The zzso indeed, uncertain existence, of these receptors has been particularly problematic because of the absence of specific, competitive zzso to block zzso Further, these lipids have zzso chemical structures, raising the explanation that any observed effects of zzso applied zzso could be due to zzso membrane zzso During studies of zzso coupled zzso zzso genes involved with cerebral cortical zzso the first zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating zzso zzso signaling as potentially important components of nervous system development and zzso zzso studies indicated roles in zzso cortical development, and effects on zzso particularly zzso and zzso cell zzso Reviewed here are the molecular biology of LP zzso relevant aspects of zzso zzso and their possible roles in the nervous zzso
