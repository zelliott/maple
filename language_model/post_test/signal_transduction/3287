Renal function and blood flow decline during aging in association with a decrease in the number of zzso vessels, but if loss of zzso contributes to this zzso zzso remains zzso We tested the hypothesis that the decreased zzso zzso density with age is aggravated by loss of zzso zzso female zzso mice underwent zzso zzso or sham operation and then were allowed to age to zzso zzso Another comparable group was replenished with zzso after zzso zzso while a zzso group served as young zzso zzso were then dissected for evaluation of zzso density (by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso density of small zzso zzso zzso was decreased in all aged groups compared with young controls zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but tended to be lower in sham compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso density of larger zzso zzso zzso decreased only in aged sham zzso zzso zzso zzso young zzso and zzso signaling was zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso mechanisms were aggravated in aged zzso compared with aged sham, but blunted in zzso in association with zzso transforming growth zzso signaling and decreased zzso stress in the zzso zzso aging induced in female mice zzso cortical zzso loss, which was likely not zzso by loss of zzso zzso However, zzso may play a role in protecting the kidney by decreasing zzso stress and attenuating mechanisms linked to zzso zzso zzso
