zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is zzso in various zzso and plays an important role in tumor zzso However, the expression and functions of zzso in cervical cancer remain zzso In this study, we performed zzso in clinical cervical specimens and found that zzso was zzso in the cervical cancer zzso and its expression correlated with cancer zzso The percentage of zzso cells increased gradually from zzso in the normal zzso to zzso in high-grade zzso zzso zzso and ultimately to zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso in zzso cells and silenced zzso in cervical cancer zzso cells, which expressed low and high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted cell migration, invasion, and an zzso transition zzso signature, which is a complex process that occurs during zzso and cancer zzso whereas zzso zzso had the opposite effect zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells with zzso zzso exhibited a stem zzso state that promoted zzso formation in zzso and exhibited zzso potential in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso in zzso cells inhibited these stem cell properties zzso zzso zzso In addition, we investigated the zzso signaling pathways in cervical cancer and found that zzso expression correlated positively with zzso in clinical samples, and its activity was regulated by zzso in cervical zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in cervical cancer progression by orchestrating an zzso program through zzso zzso
