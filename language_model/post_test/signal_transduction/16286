Over the last decade, a number of zzso zzso and small zzso zzso emerged as potent therapeutic agents in the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso Numerous patients, however, do not adequately respond to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, in turn, zzso effects, which potentially hamper zzso cell treatment, have barely been zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines were treated with zzso zzso and zzso alone using different combinations and zzso Moreover, zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso was added to reveal potential growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling were analyzed as a function of cell zzso zzso parameters were cell proliferation and zzso zzso cells were efficiently driven into zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso administration, however, restored the zzso cell proliferation zzso In contrast, neither therapeutic zzso treatment caused a profound zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso turned out to be the most potent zzso inhibitor in both cell lines even though its impact was significantly zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso was reversed by zzso as well as by zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso compensation of zzso zzso exit was reversed by zzso but not by zzso Apparently, multiple zzso targeting by using zzso zzso and zzso more efficiently affects zzso function zzso and zzso and consequently enhances their zzso zzso Growth zzso by zzso drugs targeted to zzso zzso however, can be significantly undermined in the presence of zzso and in particular by zzso treatment, which suggests that specific therapeutic growth factor zzso might further enhance zzso zzso
