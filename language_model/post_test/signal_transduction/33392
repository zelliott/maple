Positive selection of T cell precursors is an zzso dependent, zzso process by which functionally mature zzso helper and zzso zzso single positive zzso T cells are generated from immature zzso double positive zzso zzso We investigated the requirement for zzso class II interactions during different stages of positive selection of human zzso SP zzso We show that sorted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured in fetal zzso zzso of normal mice were subject to positive selection and differentiated to zzso zzso mature zzso SP, and zzso SP zzso When cultured in zzso zzso from zzso class zzso mice, these precursors failed to develop into mature zzso SP T cells, indicating that in the hybrid cultures, zzso zzso class II molecules are required for the development of mature human zzso SP T zzso We have previously identified zzso SP intermediate zzso that have received at least some of the signals involved in positive selection, since these cells are zzso zzso and zzso but that are still zzso and functionally zzso Here we demonstrate that in contrast to zzso zzso these zzso SP intermediate zzso can give rise to zzso mature and functionally zzso SP progeny both in normal and in zzso class zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso interactions are required for the initial stages of positive selection, but are not essential during terminal differentiation to functionally mature zzso SP T zzso
