zzso is accompanied by an increase in both zzso number and zzso The increase in zzso number is the result of recruitment to the zzso lineage of zzso stem cells present in the vascular zzso of zzso zzso These zzso cells have the potential to undergo commitment and then differentiate into zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso In this article, we show that both bone zzso protein zzso and zzso can induce commitment of zzso zzso stem cells into zzso After treatment of zzso stem cells with these zzso during proliferation followed by exposure to differentiation zzso at growth arrest, nearly all cells enter the zzso development pathway, express specific zzso zzso and acquire the zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso commitment in the absence of zzso whereas zzso of a zzso zzso zzso suppresses commitment induced by zzso Also, zzso of the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso with zzso zzso commitment by the zzso However, zzso of expression of zzso zzso (an zzso in the zzso signaling zzso with zzso had little effect on zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that the zzso signaling zzso has a dominant role in zzso lineage zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso zzso a bona fide downstream target gene of the zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso during zzso lineage commitment, and zzso of its expression zzso the commitment zzso
