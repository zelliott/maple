zzso levels of zzso have a profound impact on prominent biological attributes of the major zzso pathogen of humans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and promotes zzso zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso sensing in zzso zzso are insufficiently zzso Here we identify the zzso factor zzso as a key regulator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso by screening a gene zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to the elevated zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso signaling in zzso zzso involves two zzso the already reported zzso zzso A and another major one that is zzso The two pathways zzso on the zzso factor zzso which is the master regulator of zzso sensing in zzso zzso and plays a critical role in regulation of zzso switching and zzso zzso Our findings provide new insights into the understanding of zzso sensing in zzso zzso that have important implications for higher zzso
