The intrinsic features of zzso zzso T cells that affect their ability to respond to polarizing signals for zzso cell differentiation are not well zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso T cells from mice transgenic for the zzso gene expressed lower levels of zzso The zzso of zzso diminished zzso signaling and the zzso response and enhanced the zzso response under zzso polarizing zzso In zzso zzso T cells, blocking zzso with zzso had the same effect in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused higher expression of zzso to favor zzso cell zzso Thus, the zzso level on zzso zzso T cells is genetically controlled by zzso and determines the ratio of zzso and zzso cell zzso
