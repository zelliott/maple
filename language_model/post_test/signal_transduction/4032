A zzso zzso zzso activity has been characterized from zzso rat zzso tissue which zzso the zzso bond between zzso and the zzso chain of a zzso zzso thus liberating the intact zzso chain from a zzso The majority zzso of the zzso activity was detected in the zzso fraction when the rat zzso tissue zzso was zzso at 100,000 zzso zzso Attempts to purify the zzso indicated that the zzso protein is of zzso nature as it binds to zzso zzso The zzso has been partially zzso using zzso columns in zzso The partially zzso protein was found to be zzso to the zzso raised against the zzso clam zzso The zzso band corresponded to a 64 zzso protein as also found with the clam zzso This zzso zzso indicated probable structural similarities between zzso proteins isolated from widely separated species in the evolutionary zzso The rat zzso was found to have a specific zzso requirement for optimal activity, and the pH optimum was found to be between 5 and zzso The zzso activity is partially heat zzso It is not a zzso zzso requiring zzso however, the activity is totally inhibited in the presence of mercury, indicative of a zzso group in the active site of the zzso The rat zzso zzso activity is inhibited in the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a well-known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso synthetic zzso The zzso seems to be of a competitive nature and the same type of zzso is also observed with clam zzso The zzso activity was found to be highest in zzso tissue compared to the activity found in either pregnant or zzso rat zzso zzso zzso survey indicated the presence of high levels of zzso in zzso rat liver, zzso and zzso moderate activity was detected in kidney and zzso Both virgin and male rat zzso tissue also indicated a basic level of zzso zzso However, newborn zzso and zzso tissue showed a comparable level of activity to that found in zzso rat zzso This report is mainly concerned with the characterization of zzso activity from a zzso source and its importance in cellular zzso
