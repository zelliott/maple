The responsiveness of zzso cells to zzso zzso changes as these cells switch from the zzso stage in growing zzso to the terminally zzso zzso stage after zzso zzso To analyze this transition, two well characterized culture systems were zzso 1) zzso cells isolated from immature rats were cultured in zzso zzso a system that permits analysis of zzso short-term responses to zzso 2) zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso that have been exposed in zzso to surge zzso of zzso zzso zzso were cultured in medium containing zzso zzso a system that permits analyses of cells that have undergo zzso long-term changes associated with zzso To analyze the zzso basis for the switch in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso components was related to the expression of two zzso target zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were analyzed by Western zzso and indirect zzso using specific zzso to the C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso Cellular levels of C zzso and zzso were similar in all cell types and hormone zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was restricted to a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to immature zzso cells caused rapid nuclear import of C zzso within 1 zzso Nuclear C zzso decreased by 6 h after zzso but could be rapidly zzso to the nucleus by the addition of zzso at 6, 24, or 48 zzso Nuclear C zzso was associated with the rapid but transient increases in zzso zzso induced zzso in a zzso manner in which the protein was nuclear at 1 h and zzso at 48 zzso zzso zzso was only expressed at zzso h after zzso a pattern that was not altered by zzso or zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso C zzso was localized in a zzso pattern in the nucleus as well as to a zzso zzso structure, a distribution pattern not altered by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at elevated levels in a zzso zzso Most zzso both zzso and zzso were zzso localized in a zzso pattern within the zzso and not altered by zzso zzso these data indicate that when zzso cells differentiate to zzso cells the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso components changes zzso Thus, either the mechanisms of nuclear import and export or the presence of distinct zzso sites (and functions zzso dictate where zzso zzso and zzso are localized in zzso cells compared with the terminally differentiated zzso zzso
