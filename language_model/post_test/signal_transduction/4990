zzso of learning and memory in mice with zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso activity support the idea that plastic changes of synaptic contacts may depend at least in part on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There is, however, little information on the molecular requirements and mechanisms regulating this zzso zzso development and zzso Here, we report that the zzso inducing zzso zzso complex is localized at the zzso density zzso and activated under zzso conditions in the adult mouse zzso Using different models of conditional genetic zzso of zzso function in mouse principal zzso we show that zzso signaling is critically involved in zzso formation and spine maturation in the adult zzso zzso blockade in the zzso of zzso animals is associated with reduced levels of mature spines and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic transmission and a spatial learning zzso zzso deficits can be restored in adult animals within 1 week by zzso zzso indicating a highly dynamic zzso regulation zzso We further identified the zzso growth factor 2 gene zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to restore zzso density and promoted spine maturation in zzso zzso zzso within 24 zzso This process depends on zzso zzso zzso Our findings illustrate a fundamental role of zzso signaling in zzso formation and maturation in adult mice, thus providing an intriguing link between the molecular actions of zzso in zzso and the memory enhancement factor zzso
