The zzso from a zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as well as human zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso To understand more about T cell biology and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been produced in zzso coli as inclusion bodies and the protein folded to its native zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance analyses indicate that human zzso has a significantly greater affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso than does zzso zzso Yet, T cell binding and zzso activity are independent of zzso when zzso with human zzso as demonstrated with zzso zzso that block zzso association with zzso Even in the absence of direct zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso T cells with zzso zzso produces zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer flow zzso demonstrate zzso is recruited to the site of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that there exists another mechanism for recruitment of zzso during high affinity zzso zzso zzso
