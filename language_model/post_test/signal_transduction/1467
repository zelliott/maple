Members of the zzso zzso family are crucial in recognition of microbial pathogens as part of innate immune zzso zzso an accessory protein to zzso present on the zzso side of the membrane is needed to initiate the signal zzso We have identified a 15 zzso acid region of human zzso that contains several features of other zzso zzso binding proteins and zzso In zzso zzso zzso by this zzso was observed and confirmed by zzso transferred zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have also shown binding of the zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso but not to zzso zzso this zzso inhibited growth of zzso and to a lower extent of some zzso zzso Our results indicate that this region of zzso might be responsible for binding of zzso and confirms the role of zzso as an accessory protein in zzso signaling bestowing the Toll receptors their zzso
