To analyze the function of zzso zzso so as to provide the reference for future zzso 

The zzso gene was knocked down in zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso and the zzso was used to analyze the zzso of zzso zzso after zzso knocked zzso 

A total of zzso genes expressed differently including 202 zzso genes and 176 zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated that the genes expressed differently were mainly related to zzso metabolism and signal zzso The gene zzso category analysis showed that most of these genes might be involved in zzso membrane zzso and cellular zzso 

The gene zzso might play important roles in the process of growth, development, reproduction and metabolism of zzso zzso
