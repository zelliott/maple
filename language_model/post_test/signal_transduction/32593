zzso is a signal zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso zzso zzso We have found that it is zzso predominantly on zzso zzso when zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso appears to be related to the signaling events that are activated by zzso under these circumstances, since two zzso zzso were found to be zzso significantly less than the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso status of zzso had significant effects on the ability of the protein to bind to zzso as evidenced by our observations that the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso with zzso zzso and that zzso treatment significantly enhanced the binding of zzso to zzso We conclude from these studies that the zzso of zzso is likely to play an important role in regulating signaling by virtue of its ability to influence the zzso zzso
