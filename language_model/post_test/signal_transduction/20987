Recently, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso production in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from patients with zzso zzso have been reported by several zzso They measured the total amount of each zzso in culture zzso in their zzso These studies suggested a predominance of type 2 zzso cells in zzso zzso However, it is still unclear whether the zzso imbalance is the result of an imbalance of specific zzso zzso or of zzso of the zzso ability in zzso zzso Here, we examined zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso from patients with zzso zzso at a single cell level by using flow zzso 

zzso from 45 patients with zzso zzso and 24 healthy control subjects were zzso with immobilized zzso zzso zzso for 6 hours in the presence of zzso zzso were zzso made zzso and stained for zzso zzso in combination with zzso for cell surface markers zzso and zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso cells and zzso cells from patients with zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than that from healthy control zzso In contrast, the frequency of zzso zzso cells and zzso cells was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso in the patients with zzso zzso The frequency of zzso cells from patients with zzso zzso was comparable to that from healthy control zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso of type 2 zzso cells, not only among zzso cells but also among zzso cells, were significantly higher in patients with zzso zzso than in healthy control zzso
