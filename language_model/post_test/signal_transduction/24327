zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso highly expressed on zzso cells and zzso is an important component in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activates zzso zzso events and evokes prolonged calcium zzso while zzso engagement of zzso zzso activates zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso interaction, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso function are zzso zzso mechanisms include zzso formation of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso to the zzso border, zzso service as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso ultimately zzso zzso of zzso beta zzso zzso regulation of zzso calcium influx, and zzso mediation of zzso protein association, and/or zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso system to study zzso zzso that specifically disrupt zzso signaling and/or zzso cell zzso We report that zzso beta zzso zzso elicits zzso zzso that requires zzso zzso engagement, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent zzso and additive components of zzso zzso Surprisingly, neither zzso zzso calcium zzso cell border zzso nor the zzso zzso domain was required for zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a passive zzso zzso for zzso zzso which after engagement leads to zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and ultimately zzso in a zzso zzso
