zzso acid zzso has been appeared to be an zzso colon tumor zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso this signaling in zzso zzso 

After zzso treatments, time courses of zzso B binding activity were determined by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso Also, we performed Western zzso of I zzso B alpha to confirm zzso B zzso Time and concentration courses of zzso zzso of zzso were measured with zzso in zzso of cultured media from the zzso To evaluate the role of zzso B, zzso levels were assessed after zzso with using zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso were measured after zzso with zzso 

zzso zzso induced prominent zzso B binding complexes from 30 zzso to 8 zzso and degradation of I zzso B zzso The zzso of zzso were increased with zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment in a time and zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 2 hours caused significant decreases in zzso induced zzso zzso However, transient zzso using zzso or zzso zzso showed no effect on zzso zzso 

zzso may play as a zzso tumor promoter through zzso effect of zzso B zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso B independent zzso expression is inhibited by zzso
