Under zzso a zzso zzso program is zzso called the unfolded protein response zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso is a zzso of the zzso and activates a gene expression program, promoting zzso growth and survival under zzso A key gene induced by zzso under zzso conditions is zzso We characterized the induction of zzso during zzso exposure to determine whether zzso alone was sufficient or there was a more complex regulatory response to zzso There was zzso separation of acute zzso factor zzso and chronic zzso gene expression zzso zzso was regulated by chronic zzso zzso rather than acute zzso zzso zzso by a complex set of pathways and mechanisms, besides zzso induced by the classical zzso there was zzso regulation by nuclear zzso B zzso and zzso stabilization by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso under zzso protected cells from negative consequences of the oxygen stress and involved the zzso zzso pathways that promote zzso zzso and degradation, and reduced zzso level of the zzso protein zzso followed by the zzso repression of zzso We also show that zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso under zzso and provides a regulatory feedback zzso zzso of the survival zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells to zzso consequences of the zzso zzso Thus, the response to zzso is zzso by three pathways independently of zzso suggesting that combined therapeutic approaches would be needed to maximize effects against this zzso
