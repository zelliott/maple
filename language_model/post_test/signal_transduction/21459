zzso immunity to zzso in zzso has gained a substantial interest during the last zzso The discovery of the zzso zzso zzso family has allowed the identification of a class of zzso receptors dedicated to microbial zzso zzso zzso downstream signaling via their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently, the role of zzso microbial sensors has been zzso These molecules include the zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso The zzso microbial sensors lack the zzso domain, but instead zzso downstream signals via two zzso also implicated in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and recruitment domain zzso and zzso zzso In light with these recent findings, we propose that zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent the three arms of innate immune detection of zzso in zzso
