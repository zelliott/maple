zzso is a well-known zzso that possibly promotes tumors and the development of various types of cancer in individuals chronically exposed to zzso in their work or living zzso Many studies have demonstrated the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in several cell types by using lethal zzso of zzso in the range of zzso zzso zzso Since the exposure of humans to zzso is normally at a much lower level in the workplace or in daily life, it is more relevant to study the effects of zzso at this lower exposure zzso In the present study we aimed at redefining the role of signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso transformation as well as zzso using our established in zzso rat lung zzso cell model zzso Our results indicate a molecular mechanism by which zzso pathways might zzso contribute to cell growth regulation and cell death in response to different zzso of zzso A low level (2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and enhanced cell zzso and this zzso zzso activity was blocked by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a high level (40 zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and induced cell zzso and this zzso zzso activity was blocked by zzso inhibitor II, zzso The implications of these findings are that a high concentration of zzso exposure causes zzso whereas a low concentration of zzso exposure is zzso and may result in zzso cell zzso
