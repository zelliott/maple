zzso contraction and generation of zzso zzso zzso were investigated in isolated zzso zzso artery from near term pregnant zzso zzso produced a zzso contraction in the presence or absence of external zzso however, the zzso response in zzso medium was depressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The initial increase of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was not apparent, although a significant rise in both zzso and zzso was observed at 30 zzso zzso and zzso over zzso level, P zzso zzso The generation of zzso zzso zzso was rapid and reached its peak at zzso s zzso over zzso level, P zzso zzso followed by a second rise at 30 zzso zzso over zzso level, P zzso zzso The generation of zzso zzso by zzso was also zzso In agreement with previous contraction studies, the generation of zzso zzso by zzso was blocked by 10 zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso A zzso study revealed that the generation of zzso coincided with the zzso component of the zzso response induced by zzso Our results suggest that through zzso of zzso zzso the generation of zzso plays a critical role in the contraction induced by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
