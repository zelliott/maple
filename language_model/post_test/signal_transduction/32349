zzso zzso zzso zzso is the primary regulator of resistance to sugar zzso stress and sensitivity to zzso or zzso zzso in the citrus zzso pathogen zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso resistance solely to zzso and zzso zzso We report here independent and shared functions of the zzso signaling zzso with zzso and zzso zzso a putative zzso downstream regulator of zzso is primarily required for cellular resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso perhaps acting in parallel with zzso is required for resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not to the zzso compounds - zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because of zzso zzso zzso is likely involved in resistance to zzso zzso stress via the zzso signaling zzso However, zzso lacking zzso displayed zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso localized in the nucleus regardless of zzso zzso When compared to the wild type, zzso zzso exhibited lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities and induced significantly fewer zzso zzso on the susceptible citrus zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso resistance at levels between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso exhibited zzso resistance, similar to the strain with a single zzso gene zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso are smaller and have fewer zzso zzso than those produced by wild zzso All altered zzso in the zzso were restored by introducing and expressing a zzso copy of zzso under control of the zzso zzso
