zzso an zzso hormone, is mainly produced by the stomach and released into the zzso zzso receptors zzso hormone zzso zzso are expressed throughout the brain, including the zzso The zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso stimulation zzso long-term zzso zzso in zzso and also improves learning and zzso zzso we report that a single infusion of zzso into the zzso led to long-lasting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and population spikes zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was accompanied by a reduction in zzso depression of the zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and an enhancement of zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of both zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso infusion zzso increased the zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso Although zzso had no effect on the induction of zzso zzso it prolonged the expression of zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso The Morris water maze test showed that zzso enhanced spatial memory, and that this was prevented by zzso with zzso zzso Taken together, the findings show that: zzso a single infusion of zzso induced a new form of synaptic plasticity by zzso the zzso signaling pathway, without zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a single infusion of zzso also enhanced the maintenance of zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso repetitive infusion of zzso enhanced spatial memory by zzso the zzso signaling zzso Thus, we propose that the zzso signaling zzso could have therapeutic value in cognitive zzso
