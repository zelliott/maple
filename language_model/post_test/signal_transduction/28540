zzso stimulation of group I zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso persistent prolonged zzso zzso in zzso slices via a protein zzso zzso At present, the signaling process underlying the induction of these zzso zzso remains zzso We examined the possible role of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso because these zzso can be activated by group I zzso and their zzso may regulate gene expression and alter protein zzso The group I zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso by zzso zzso or another zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso also prevented the induction of the prolonged zzso zzso by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso 10 zzso did not prevent the generation of zzso zzso zzso nor did they suppress the zzso of zzso by zzso in slices zzso with the zzso zzso (30 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also suppressed by zzso (10 zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso The study shows that group I zzso activate zzso through a zzso zzso process and that this zzso of zzso is necessary for the induction of prolonged zzso zzso in the zzso
