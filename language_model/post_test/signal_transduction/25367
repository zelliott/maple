Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates that zzso play either beneficial or adverse roles in many neurological and psychiatric zzso Their medical significance may be best explained by the emerging concept that zzso are essential zzso of synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous zzso However, the precise molecular architecture of the zzso signaling machinery in the human brain remains zzso To address this issue, we investigated the synaptic distribution of zzso zzso for the most abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso the main zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso pattern corresponding to the termination zones of zzso zzso The highest density of zzso was observed in strata zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and in the inner third of stratum zzso of the zzso zzso At higher zzso zzso zzso were distributed throughout the zzso outlining the zzso main zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis revealed that this pattern was due to the zzso of zzso in zzso spine zzso Similar zzso pattern was also found in zzso of zzso but not of zzso knockout zzso Using two independent zzso developed against zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also revealed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, as observed previously in zzso zzso zzso was enriched in zzso terminals instead of zzso structures at the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate the zzso and zzso segregation of primary zzso responsible for synthesis and elimination of zzso respectively, in the human zzso Thus, molecular architecture of the zzso signaling machinery supports retrograde regulation of synaptic activity, and its similar blueprint in zzso and humans further indicates that zzso zzso role as a negative zzso signal is an zzso zzso feature of zzso zzso
