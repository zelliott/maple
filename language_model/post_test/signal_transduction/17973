Previous studies have shown that zzso expression is zzso in mouse zzso infected with a zzso zzso although the functional significance of this has not been zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso primary mouse zzso undergo zzso followed by a zzso dependent zzso growth arrest and zzso The growth arrest is accompanied by a zzso increase in total zzso zzso and a fourfold increase in zzso active zzso When cultured in the presence of a zzso zzso to zzso the zzso response is zzso zzso of the zzso target zzso increase during zzso as does association of this zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso expression also increase during zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso expressing zzso zzso resist the zzso growth arrest and do not zzso This resistance is associated with low expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and high levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso or response does not block the induction of zzso and zzso but the level of zzso a zzso target zzso is reduced in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, although multiple zzso pathways are activated in response to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or response is sufficient to block the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso form zzso cell zzso following skin zzso these results suggest that in mouse zzso defects in zzso signaling accelerate zzso progression by overcoming zzso induced zzso zzso
