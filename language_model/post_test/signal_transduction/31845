We aim to investigate the additive value of B zzso factor zzso when added to zzso zzso B cells with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and B cell zzso zzso B cells from healthy individuals were incubated under the following conditions: zzso B cells with zzso zzso B cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells with zzso 20 zzso and zzso B cells with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso 20 zzso We found that addition of zzso did not enhance the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso B zzso zzso of B cells with zzso and zzso together leads to a marked zzso of zzso and zzso levels compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher in B cells zzso by zzso than in B cells zzso by zzso These findings suggest that both zzso and zzso contribute independently to B cell zzso
