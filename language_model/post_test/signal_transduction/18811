Recent studies zzso specific zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso in several cell zzso In addition, as will be documented in this review, certain members of the zzso family may also be activated and act upstream of zzso and zzso zzso Each of these zzso has been shown one way or another either to mimic or to modify zzso effects in one or all of the zzso zzso Moreover, each of the zzso has been shown to be activated by insulin stimulation or conditions important for effective insulin zzso Studies attempting to demonstrate a definitive role for any of the zzso have been performed on different cells, ranging from appropriate model systems for skeletal muscle, liver and fat, such as primary cultures, and cell lines and even in zzso studies, including transgenic mice with selective deletion of specific zzso zzso In addition, studies have been done on certain expression systems such as zzso or zzso cells, which are far removed from the zzso themselves and serve mainly as vessels for potential zzso zzso Thus, a clear picture for many of the zzso remains elusive in spite of over two decades of intensive zzso The recent intrusion of transgenic and precise molecular biology technologies into the research zzso has opened a wide range of additional possibilities for direct involvement of individual zzso in the insulin signaling zzso As we hope to discuss within the context of this review, whereas many of the long sought-after answers to specific questions are not yet clear, major advances have been made in our understanding of precise roles for individual zzso zzso in mediation of insulin zzso In this review, in which we shall focus our attention on zzso in the conventional and novel categories, a clear case will be made to show that these zzso are not only expressed but are zzso involved in regulation of insulin zzso zzso
