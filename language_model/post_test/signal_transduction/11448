zzso cell zzso is one of the major characteristics of invasion and zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso Here, we examined the zzso growth factor zzso cell zzso of two human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso and migration was induced in zzso in an zzso manner, whereas they were maintained in zzso even in the absence of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso active, and sequence analysis showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso experiments using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated that no single zzso or combination of two or three zzso caused zzso zzso zzso zzso the expressed amount of zzso protein had a pivotal role in the zzso zzso zzso With respect to downstream signaling molecules of zzso in zzso or zzso the zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was not further activated by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly inhibited spontaneous migration of zzso One zzso zzso cell line with massive zzso of zzso demonstrated scattered zzso and increased zzso activity in association with increased zzso which was partially inhibited by zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso of zzso causes increase in cellular zzso and zzso shows the important contribution on the increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso
