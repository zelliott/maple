The zzso of the most abundant zzso in food, zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent potent zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso studies show that the presence of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso ring at the zzso zzso is crucial for target zzso The presence of a single zzso group or introduction of zzso zzso at the zzso results in a substantial loss of zzso zzso However, biological activity is not exclusively limited to compounds bearing zzso zzso zzso A contradictory zzso relationship is observed for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso tested, zzso bearing zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso most effectively inhibited zzso zzso The absence of zzso groups and/or replacement by zzso zzso was found to strongly diminish zzso zzso We found that either effective zzso zzso or effective zzso zzso is required to achieve a zzso of the central zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, a signaling cascade crucial for the regulation of cell zzso This is consistent with the finding that efficient reduction of cell growth is limited to zzso that are potent zzso or zzso including zzso and del or zzso zzso zzso In zzso depending on the substitution pattern at the zzso zzso interfere with different signaling zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso
