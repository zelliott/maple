The equal potency and efficacy of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso distinguish the zzso zzso from other zzso zzso Investigation of the zzso of the zzso receptors is complicated by the simultaneous expression of different zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells may have led to contradictory reports on the efficacy of the natural zzso of the zzso zzso to induce zzso We decided to investigate the zzso of human and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and to rigorously examine their signaling and zzso zzso For these purposes, we used zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the human or zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as human zzso cells that zzso express the zzso The zzso of zzso calcium by zzso zzso was used as a functional zzso for the zzso zzso While zzso and zzso activated the zzso and human zzso receptors with similar zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso less potent zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso in the cell systems zzso Individual cell analyses of the rate and dose dependency of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso was slightly more resistant to zzso than its human zzso To our knowledge, this is the first individual cell study that has compared the cellular zzso of the zzso states of zzso and zzso expressed zzso This comparison demonstrated that the zzso system zzso the cellular regulatory elements needed to zzso zzso signaling by zzso
