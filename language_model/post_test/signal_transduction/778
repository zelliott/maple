The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the direct zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by its zzso zzso zzso prevents the toxic effects induced by zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso We report zzso that the zzso zzso was indeed able to overcome toxic effects induced by zzso in zzso zzso including a zzso impairment on cell survival, an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a decrease in zzso zzso and a decrease in the expression of the zzso target gene zzso We further demonstrate that zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso induced by zzso Our results support the hypothesis that a loss of function of zzso signaling may play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's zzso
