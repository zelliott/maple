zzso zzso blockade in zzso zzso cultures leads to both an increased expression of zzso zzso and an increase in zzso pool size and turnover rate zzso zzso changes that extend beyond simple synaptic zzso As a molecular zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso type II zzso is increased in response to synaptic zzso Here we set out to clarify the role of zzso in the various manifestations of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso expression of zzso prevented the synaptic zzso increase in zzso as did treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not the inactive analog zzso These results demonstrate that, spurred by zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes increased zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso but not a zzso zzso increased zzso expression on zzso and elevated zzso turnover zzso zzso mimicking the effect of synaptic zzso on both sides of the zzso In cells with elevated zzso relief of zzso blockade uncovered an increase in the frequency of miniature zzso zzso currents that could be rapidly and fully suppressed by zzso blockade of zzso zzso This increased mini frequency involved a genuine zzso enhancement, not merely an increased abundance of zzso This finding suggests that zzso flux through zzso receptors may trigger the acute release of a retrograde zzso Taken together, our results indicate that synaptic zzso increases in zzso expression set in motion a series of events that culminate in coordinated zzso and zzso adaptations in synaptic zzso
