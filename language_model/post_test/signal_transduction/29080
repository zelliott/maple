zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso integral membrane proteins that catalyze the committed step in zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in many types of cells, whereas zzso is usually expressed zzso and zzso The control of zzso protein expression occurs at several levels, and zzso of zzso is associated with zzso such as colon zzso Here we have investigated zzso protein degradation and demonstrate that it can occur through two independent zzso One zzso is initiated by zzso zzso at zzso The zzso group is then zzso and the protein is zzso to the zzso where it zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence from zzso zzso that a zzso acid instability motif zzso regulates zzso zzso of zzso This motif begins with zzso 8 zzso upstream of the zzso site and ends with zzso near the C zzso at zzso Key elements of the zzso include a zzso involving zzso zzso to zzso with zzso near the end of this zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which are located in an apparently zzso downstream region of the zzso The last 16 zzso of the zzso including zzso and zzso appear to promote zzso of zzso perhaps by causing this zzso to become exposed to appropriate zzso zzso A second zzso for zzso protein degradation is initiated by zzso suicide zzso zzso protein is then zzso The zzso steps have not been zzso but zzso degradation is not inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso The zzso involving the zzso occurs at a constant rate, whereas degradation through the zzso process is coupled to the rate of zzso zzso
