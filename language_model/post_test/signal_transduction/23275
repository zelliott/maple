It is poorly understood how sensory systems memorize the intensity of sensory zzso compare it with a newly sensed zzso and regulate the orientation zzso based on the zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso the environmental salt concentration during zzso and exhibits a strong zzso preference for this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso senses decreases in salt zzso and this information is transmitted to the zzso zzso zzso only in the salt concentration range lower than the zzso zzso In this range, animals migrate towards higher concentration by promoting turning zzso upon decreases in salt zzso These observations provide a mechanism for adjusting the orientation zzso based on the memory of sensory stimulus using a simple neural zzso
