zzso are highly zzso scaffold proteins that regulate cell zzso cell migration, and zzso development by binding to diverse target zzso The molecular basis governing zzso interactions is poorly zzso The zzso complex structure solved here reveals that the three SAM zzso of zzso form an integrated zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso As supported by zzso and cellular studies, the interaction between zzso and zzso is unique to zzso zzso that the zzso interaction zzso to regulate zzso brain functions in zzso zzso we demonstrate that three recently identified zzso mental zzso zzso of zzso are defective in binding to zzso We also solved the zzso SAM domain complex structure, which zzso the mechanism underlying zzso zzso Finally, formation of the zzso zzso complex suggests that zzso can mediate assembly of target proteins into large protein complexes capable of regulating numerous cellular zzso
