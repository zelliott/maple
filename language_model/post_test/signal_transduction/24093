zzso muscle zzso is a zzso model of zzso insulin zzso To investigate the molecular basis of insulin resistance in zzso muscle, the downstream signaling molecules of the zzso zzso were examined in intact and zzso zzso muscle of zzso zzso zzso induced a significant fall in zzso clearance rates zzso of control, P zzso zzso as detected by zzso zzso clamp and was associated with a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced zzso association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso activity associated with zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso but the contents of zzso zzso detected by zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso In the face of the apparent zzso we evaluated the expression and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso No major differences in zzso expression were detected between intact and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was reduced in zzso muscle, whereas the blockade of zzso expression by zzso zzso treatment led to partial restoration of zzso zzso contents and to improved zzso zzso Thus zzso of the functional status of zzso may be a major mechanism of insulin resistance induced by zzso
