zzso multiple zzso zzso a zzso inherited disorder characterized by multiple zzso tumors, is caused by zzso in the gene for, zzso or zzso Recent studies have revealed that zzso and zzso are required for the zzso of zzso zzso and exert zzso zzso activity as a zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates the movement and signaling of zzso zzso which plays an important role in the regulation of zzso differentiation and bone zzso In this study, to investigate the biological role of zzso in bone development in zzso and the pathological role of zzso zzso in the development of zzso we generated transgenic mice expressing zzso or zzso zzso in developing zzso zzso analyses and zzso scanning showed that the zzso of zzso zzso and the formation of zzso were zzso in zzso mice, but not in zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso is zzso zzso in zzso and even zzso zzso mice, suggesting an interactive regulation of zzso and zzso zzso These findings support that the zzso gene encodes an essential component of the zzso complex required for the zzso of zzso zzso which may eventually zzso the signaling involved in bone zzso
