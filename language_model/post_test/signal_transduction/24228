The zzso regulated serum and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is localized to the nucleus in a zzso manner, and a zzso zzso genetic screen uncovered a specific interaction between zzso and the zzso nuclear import zzso In zzso zzso pull down zzso demonstrated a strong and direct association of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso whereas both components zzso and zzso to the nucleus after serum zzso zzso with an active mechanism of nuclear zzso the nuclear import of zzso in zzso cells required zzso zzso and a functional nuclear pore zzso zzso addition of a 107 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso which contains the zzso binding region, competitively inhibited the ability of zzso zzso to import zzso into zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso substitution defined a zzso sequence within the central domain of zzso between zzso acids zzso that functions as a nuclear zzso signal zzso required for the in zzso interaction with zzso and for nuclear import of full-length zzso in cultured zzso The zzso nuclear import of zzso requires the zzso recognition of zzso by zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso Our results define a new role zzso in the zzso control of signal zzso by nuclear localized protein zzso
