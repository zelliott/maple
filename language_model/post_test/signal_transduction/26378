zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso that are essential for normal embryonic development of the female zzso zzso The functional role that zzso play in the zzso zzso is poorly zzso We have shown previously that zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in zzso cells of the zzso rat zzso Here we examine the effects of zzso zzso in a rat zzso cell line zzso that displays characteristics of zzso cells at an early stage of zzso zzso We show that zzso cells express a zzso zzso zzso transcript similar in size to that detected in the rat and human zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso in zzso promotes zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso but does not stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso a nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, is expressed in zzso cells and associates with zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso contributes to suppression of zzso zzso in these zzso Our results show that zzso zzso in zzso cells increases zzso zzso zzso expression and promotes resistance to zzso cell zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso opposes zzso activity in zzso cells by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and that rat zzso cells express factors, including zzso that suppress zzso signal zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso
