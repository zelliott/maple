zzso zzso zzso channels of zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso tone and are inhibited by zzso through protein zzso C zzso We aimed to determine whether zzso zzso and zzso II zzso which cause similar zzso of zzso use the same zzso zzso and zzso zzso to exert their effects on zzso and to compare the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso responses to these zzso 

zzso currents recorded using the patch clamp technique with freshly isolated rat zzso zzso cells were inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso of a zzso inhibitor zzso in the zzso solution substantially reduced zzso by zzso but did not affect that by zzso zzso zzso by zzso was reduced by the conventional zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso Selective zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were linked to a zzso carrier zzso to make them membrane permeable and used to show that zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso but did not affect that by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso The zzso inhibitor peptides were also used to investigate the involvement of zzso and zzso in the zzso responses of zzso zzso rings, showing that zzso zzso were substantially reduced by zzso of zzso but unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso of zzso but substantially reduced by zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso channels of zzso zzso through zzso of zzso while zzso does so through zzso This implies that zzso and zzso target zzso channels of zzso through different pathways of zzso zzso so each zzso enables its distinct zzso zzso to interact functionally with the zzso zzso
