A zzso and zzso 10 zzso was identified as a key zzso in the zzso shedding of various zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are important in the development of zzso cell lung cancer zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso characterized the expression of zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso expression was significantly increased in the zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with zzso expression in the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso short hairpin zzso zzso reduced the migration and invasion of zzso zzso We present further evidence that zzso promotes zzso cell migration and invasion via the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may serve as a potential target for the therapeutic intervention of zzso zzso The data provided in this study may aid in the further understanding of the function of zzso in the progression of zzso and open new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso
