zzso signaling has been shown to play a key role in cell fate decisions in numerous zzso zzso Using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso we reported the expression of human zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the expression of human zzso and zzso protein by zzso zzso In zzso study, we detected low amounts of zzso and zzso protein in both zzso and zzso cells, high amounts in zzso zzso as well as B and T cells, but no expression in zzso zzso We further found that an immobilized truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso factor zzso but not zzso zzso factor zzso The widespread expressions of zzso proteins suggest multiple functions for this zzso during zzso These studies further indicate a novel role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso
