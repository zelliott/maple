zzso This paper presents two models of zzso long-distance zzso transport in stems that represent the process at different zzso zzso A simple compartment model using a single constant zzso transfer rate produced similar data to those observed in biological zzso The effects of different underlying biological assumptions were tested in a more detailed model representing cellular and zzso processes that enabled discussion of different patterns of zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso The output that best fits the biological data is produced by a model where polar zzso transport is not limited by the number of zzso and hence supports biological data showing that stems have considerable excess capacity to transport zzso zzso All results support the conclusion that zzso depletion following zzso zzso in pea zzso zzso occurs too slowly to be the initial cause of bud zzso zzso changes in zzso content in the main stem and changes in polar zzso zzso abundance in the main stem are not correlated with zzso bud zzso
