The novelty of applying three-dimensional graphic capabilities involving area and zzso changes was used to understand variations in zzso derivatives and their zzso influence on calcium zzso in skeletal muscle under the zzso of burn zzso zzso injury was achieved by zzso of zzso areas zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso and zzso surfaces of zzso At day 21, zzso influx and zzso procedures were zzso Through multiple regression, the dependency of zzso zzso was determined with respect to three zzso forms each representing independence zzso The contribution of each of these parameters was assigned to a three-dimensional zzso zzso analysis determined the relationship of zzso zzso to each of the independent parameters in control, zzso and 50% burn zzso Such zzso analysis allows for a clear zzso of the zzso that exist between secondary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This clear zzso may allow for a greater understanding of zzso systems that may lead to more effective treatment of the systemic effects of severe burn zzso
