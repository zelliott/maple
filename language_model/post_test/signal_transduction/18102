Signal zzso through the B cell zzso zzso zzso is altered in B cells that express a zzso that recognizes zzso To understand the molecular basis for the change in signaling in zzso B cells, a transgenic model was used to isolate a homogeneous population of tolerant B zzso These cells were compared with a similar population of zzso B zzso We show that the zzso from zzso B cells enters a zzso domain of the cell within 6 s after zzso zzso before a zzso increase in zzso zzso This fraction appears to be important for signaling because it is enriched for zzso zzso but lacks zzso zzso zzso and because the zzso that moves into this domain becomes more highly zzso zzso of the zzso into this fraction is unaffected by zzso family zzso zzso zzso B cells do not efficiently partition the zzso into the zzso domain, providing an explanation for their reduced zzso zzso zzso and calcium flux in response to zzso These results identify an early, regulated step in zzso zzso signaling and zzso
