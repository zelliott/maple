Signaling between cells in the anterior zzso and zzso zzso compartments directs zzso wing disc development and is dependent on expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in P zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso protein signals across the zzso border to establish a zzso organizer that directs pattern formation and growth throughout the wing zzso Here we extend investigations of the processes downstream of en by using expression array analysis to compare A and P zzso A total of 102 candidate genes were identified that express zzso in the A and P zzso four were zzso zzso zzso expression is restricted to A cells due to repression by zzso zzso zzso zzso und zzso zzso are expressed in A cells downstream of zzso zzso and zzso interference for zzso zzso and zzso revealed that each is essential to wing zzso
