We have previously shown that zzso zzso a member of the basic zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors, is zzso in breast cancer samples and has tumor zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso is zzso in breast cancer cells has not been zzso In this study, we show that transformation of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein beta zzso and activates the zzso signaling zzso to block zzso gene zzso zzso repression acts through a zzso binding factor 1 zzso zzso as introduction of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso express high levels of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels in zzso immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso These studies illustrate a novel zzso of tumor zzso gene zzso in zzso breast zzso cells and identify zzso as a target of zzso and zzso zzso
