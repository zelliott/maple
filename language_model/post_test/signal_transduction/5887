The protective effects of zzso growth factor I on the zzso zzso system in the zzso zzso after zzso zzso injury may be zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso a zzso suggested to mediate in zzso zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso rats on zzso and zzso zzso protein and zzso levels, zzso zzso activity, cell death, zzso zzso zzso calcium levels zzso and the zzso signaling mechanisms zzso zzso and zzso did not change zzso levels, but zzso partially restored zzso and zzso zzso 2 protein content and zzso levels and protected against cell death after zzso zzso which was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso displaced zzso from zzso receptors and blocked the zzso induced rise in zzso calcium in isolated rat zzso and moderately increased zzso influx per zzso Our findings suggest that zzso but not its zzso mimics zzso growth factor I effects on the zzso system through a mechanism independent of zzso clearance that involves zzso of calcium and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
