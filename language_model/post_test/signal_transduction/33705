zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system zzso are zzso by numerous zzso pathways carrying information about two zzso important zzso blood zzso and zzso These pathways use a variety of zzso In order to understand normal and pathological regulation of VP zzso the mechanisms underlying integration of these complex zzso signals by the zzso zzso must be zzso The importance of neurotransmitter interactions in determining hormone release is highlighted by the finding that simultaneous exposure to zzso zzso zzso a neurotransmitter acting on zzso zzso and zzso zzso to mimic zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso release that is characterized by an increase in the peak response and conversion of a transient response to a response that is sustained for zzso zzso of the mechanisms responsible for this response indicated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso is required, zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso is required, zzso the sustained component requires new gene transcription, zzso the zzso does not involve zzso mechanisms nor does it occur directly in the neural lobe and zzso zzso zzso imaging techniques demonstrated a sustained increase in zzso and that zzso activates zzso as well as zzso in zzso zzso Since the zzso of zzso differ in their rate of zzso identification of the zzso of zzso participating in the initial and sustained responses to zzso may zzso mechanisms underlying the abrupt and transient responses to zzso zzso versus sustained responses to chronic zzso or zzso
