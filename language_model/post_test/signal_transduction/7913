We have previously shown that disruption of zzso membrane potential by depletion of zzso DNA zzso or treatment with a zzso zzso zzso cyanide zzso zzso a stress zzso which causes resistance to zzso and zzso invasive behavior in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso zzso activated as part of this stress zzso plays an important role in increased zzso zzso and zzso Here we report that, although both insulin and zzso growth zzso zzso levels zzso and zzso zzso are increased in response to zzso stress, zzso of zzso was selectively increased suggesting a shift in zzso zzso Using an approach with zzso an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso by small interference zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is critical for increased zzso 4 and zzso expression and zzso The importance of the zzso zzso in cell survival under zzso stress is demonstrated by increased zzso either by zzso zzso zzso or by treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study describes a novel mechanism of zzso zzso zzso shift involving zzso with implications in resistance to zzso and tumor zzso
