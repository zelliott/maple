zzso zzso and subsequent zzso formation at sites of vascular injury is crucial for normal zzso but it can also cause zzso zzso and zzso The initial capture of flowing zzso to the injured vessel wall is zzso by the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso complex with von zzso factor immobilized on the exposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are then able to bind to zzso through the zzso zzso zzso and to initiate cellular zzso a process that is reinforced by G zzso receptors zzso by locally produced zzso and soluble zzso released from activated zzso These signaling events lead to a rise in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso release of zzso content, and functional zzso of zzso zzso receptors allowing firm zzso and zzso zzso zzso activated zzso also undergo a zzso conversion thereby zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review summarizes the most important zzso systems and signaling mechanisms involved in zzso zzso and zzso formation with special focus on recent zzso
