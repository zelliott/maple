zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of aggressive zzso that are difficult to treat with current zzso This has led to an increased interest in developing novel therapies that target the zzso zzso However, most existing drug zzso are zzso by their inability to specifically target and/or antagonize this zzso zzso a novel class of zzso small zzso are hypothesized to be zzso for zzso for developing highly specific and potent zzso of cancer zzso Here, we describe a zzso full zzso zzso zzso displaying efficacy in both zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso specifically binds to zzso with high affinity and blocks zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso efficiently zzso zzso signaling of zzso zzso and has no zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso results in the trafficking of zzso to late zzso compartments in the absence of zzso In zzso administration of zzso resulted in zzso zzso tumor growth zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso protein levels on zzso biopsy samples show a significant reduction in total zzso following therapy with zzso supporting its zzso mechanism of zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the zzso inhibitor zzso has potentially broad zzso activity that warrants evaluation in zzso
