In mouse zzso loss of zzso zzso activity is associated with an zzso zzso of zzso zzso responses in the precursors of the zzso structures and leads to a complete zzso of the head at early zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso of genes coding for two zzso zzso zzso factors, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso also elicit an zzso zzso response and result in loss of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combinations of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the partial to complete head zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso The demonstration of a synergistic interaction of zzso zzso and zzso provides compelling evidence supporting the concepts that zzso stringent regulation of the level of zzso zzso zzso is necessary for head formation, zzso activity of the zzso zzso is sufficient to account for the zzso effects of zzso in three different components of the signal cascade and zzso zzso parts of the brain and the head are zzso more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and their development is contingent on negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso
