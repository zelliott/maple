To explore the role of nuclear zzso zzso in the signal zzso of protein zzso C zzso regulating the expression of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso by T zzso in zzso 

16 guinea pigs were randomly divided into 2 groups, normal control and zzso zzso 16 zzso patients and 16 normal control persons also participated in the zzso T zzso were isolated and zzso from blood of each guinea pig and each person and divided into 3 groups: cells of 1st group were control group, cells of 2nd group were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of 3rd group were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso were observed by zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso were observed by in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso were measured by zzso 

The percentage of cells of active zzso the percentage of positive cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso of zzso T zzso zzso with zzso were significantly higher than those of zzso T zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso P zzso zzso and those of normal control T zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso P zzso zzso and were significant reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso P zzso zzso There were good positive correlation between the percentage of cells of active zzso and the percentage of positive cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso P zzso zzso respectively), and also good positive correlation between the percentage of active zzso and zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

The active zzso of zzso T zzso increasing the expression of zzso and zzso may be zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso signal zzso of T zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
