The development changes in zzso proteins and the regulation of their appearance by calcium zzso were investigated during early sexual development in zzso zzso zzso gamma S strongly inhibited zzso cell fusion, while zzso beta S slightly zzso it, suggesting that zzso have a critical role in cell zzso A zzso protein recognized by an zzso zzso immune serum, was abundant during zzso early sexual development but decreased in amount zzso with cell zzso This protein remained at high levels in zzso cultures, suggesting that its zzso is linked to the events of sexual zzso Analysis of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso extracts determined that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso The zzso protein was also detected in zzso asexual zzso but diminished rapidly within the first 2 h of zzso Together these data indicate that the zzso protein functions during the growth phase and is lost upon entry into either the sexual or asexual zzso zzso The amounts of several lower molecular weight zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 28 zzso increased during the stage of zzso differentiation and their increases were calcium zzso These data provide the first analysis of zzso during sexual development of zzso zzso and lay the foundation for continued analysis of the signal zzso events zzso cell fusion and zzso zzso
