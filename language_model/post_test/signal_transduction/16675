zzso methods for detecting zzso interactions zzso have given researchers an initial global picture of protein interactions on a zzso zzso The usefulness of this understanding is, however, typically compromised by noisy zzso The effective way of zzso and using these zzso data sets has received little attention to zzso This paper proposes a model to integrate different data zzso We construct this model using our prior knowledge of data set zzso Based on this model, we propose a zzso measurement to select reliable interactions and to zzso the similarity between two zzso interaction zzso Our measurement exploits the zzso network zzso properties of protein interaction zzso Meanwhile, we discovered some additional properties of the zzso We show that our measurement can be used to find reliable interactions with improved performance and to find protein pairs with higher function zzso
