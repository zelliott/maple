With the aim of further zzso the role of the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients we studied the properties and regulation of the zzso zzso in primary cultures of human zzso zzso zzso To facilitate zzso zzso and to gain access to the zzso compartment for injection of zzso we prepared giant cells using a zzso fusion zzso The membrane potential zzso and resistance zzso and their responses to zzso zzso in the bath were measured under control conditions and in the presence of different zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was independent of time after fusion, while zzso dropped from zzso zzso zzso M omega zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso M omega zzso zzso 24) in the 2nd week after zzso The low zzso values reflected a vanishing zzso zzso in the presence of a dominating zzso zzso that increased with zzso In young cells, a zzso zzso prevailed which could be zzso by application of the zzso zzso zzso or of zzso As determined in zzso cells, it had an zzso zzso zzso zzso relationship and exhibited the selectivity sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso With increasing age after fusion, a zzso zzso prevailed in zzso cells which could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and which was zzso by zzso It had a linear zzso relationship and exhibited the selectivity sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if determined from zzso zzso but a sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso if determined from zzso zzso This points to zzso pore zzso of the respective zzso zzso In agreement with observations described in the following publication, the results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso product while the molecular nature of the zzso zzso zzso is not yet zzso
