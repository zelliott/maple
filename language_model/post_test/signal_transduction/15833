Continuous migration of B cells at the zzso contrasts with their stable arrest after encounter with zzso Two main zzso pairs are involved in these cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Little is known regarding the interplay between zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso dynamics and its effect on zzso zzso We used a zzso model to study zzso migration and zzso recognition in real time, and found that zzso signaling strength alters zzso migration, leading to a zzso zzso behavior zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso signaling does not impair zzso immune zzso formation and that zzso is excluded from the central zzso zzso zzso signaling enhances zzso zzso zzso in at least 2 ways: zzso it assists zzso gathering at the zzso by promoting membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso it allows zzso signaling integration in zzso B cells through establishment of zzso migratory zzso Both processes require functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso II motor zzso zzso the zzso signaling effect on shaping zzso dynamics is an effective mechanism that enhances zzso encounter and zzso zzso zzso
