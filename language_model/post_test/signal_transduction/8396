zzso zzso is the most common cause of zzso loosening in total joint zzso The role of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoting factors including zzso in the zzso of zzso has been well zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and cell type in which it is zzso which is responsible for zzso induction of zzso during wear zzso zzso has yet to be zzso To address this, we used mice genetically deficient in these zzso receptors to assess zzso and wear debris responses in zzso and in zzso Wear zzso zzso and zzso expression were observed at similar levels in zzso zzso and zzso mice, indicating that these receptors do not mediate zzso signals in this zzso A conditional knockout approach was used to eliminate zzso expression in zzso zzso that are the zzso source of zzso In the absence of zzso zzso do not express zzso after stimulation with particles or zzso nor do they exhibit high levels of zzso and zzso These results show that zzso zzso are important zzso of zzso through the expression of zzso which is induced after zzso signaling through the zzso zzso
