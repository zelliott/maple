zzso the product of the zzso type 1 zzso zzso is a approximately 250 zzso protein expressed predominantly in cortical zzso and zzso in the central nervous system zzso and sensory zzso and zzso cells in the peripheral nervous system zzso To gain insight into the biological role of zzso in zzso cells, the zzso of zzso gene expression in a zzso cell line zzso zzso to either zzso or differentiate in response to agents that elevate zzso zzso was zzso zzso cells and cells exposed to zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso expressed low levels of zzso zzso and the protein was barely zzso High doses of zzso zzso zzso or zzso (1 zzso induced the expression of both zzso zzso protein and zzso with an identical time zzso Although zzso zzso levels peaked within zzso zzso the rise in zzso was not apparent until zzso zzso and peaked 72 zzso after zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso by zzso contact in high density, zzso zzso Moreover, differentiation initiated by either zzso stimulation or high density culture conditions was associated with zzso expression of the type 2 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, type 1 zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso cells or those zzso with zzso doses of zzso or zzso A switch from the type 1 zzso that can efficiently zzso zzso to the type 2 zzso with reduced activity may facilitate a zzso signaling zzso associated with zzso cell zzso
