Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso are crucial zzso factors that tightly control zzso zzso expression for zzso immunity in T and B zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso for innate immunity in zzso In this study, we report that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso innate immune responses in bone zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso stimulation including zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso induced expression of zzso which was inhibited by zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso zzso from zzso zzso mouse expressed less zzso than wild zzso Despite apparent association between zzso and zzso zzso did not directly activate zzso based on zzso reporter zzso whereas zzso was zzso activated by zzso Instead, zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity which was not increased by zzso and was decreased by zzso zzso examination of zzso of zzso exhibited nuclear zzso of zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso stimulation did not cause nuclear zzso of zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in nuclear export of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso suggesting that nuclear residence of zzso is required for zzso innate immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso II zzso zzso suggested that zzso decreased zzso binding to zzso gene zzso consistent with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This study identifies a novel paradigm of innate immune regulation rendered by zzso which is a well known family of zzso immune regulatory zzso
