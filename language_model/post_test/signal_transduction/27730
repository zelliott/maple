Previous work by us and others has implicated a role for Ral zzso exchange factors zzso in zzso cell growth and zzso zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso are involved in zzso differentiation as zzso zzso of zzso Ras in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells is known to induce differentiation to a primitive zzso zzso zzso but the downstream signal zzso mechanisms involved are zzso We found that zzso differentiation is induced by the Ras zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso expression of zzso active forms of zzso zzso or zzso zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso of zzso activity by expression of dominant negative Ral completely zzso zzso and zzso zzso while it reduces differentiation by zzso and zzso Finally, while zzso does not increase zzso activity, zzso of zzso blocks both zzso as well as zzso zzso suggesting that zzso induce zzso differentiation in a manner depending on zzso zzso or zzso zzso Based on these results we conclude that Ras zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells via an interplay of zzso zzso zzso
