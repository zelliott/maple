Although zzso is expressed in the embryonic central nervous system zzso its possible functions in the regulation of zzso zzso differentiation remain largely zzso We have investigated this question in the zzso a zzso zzso structure previously shown to respond to zzso in zzso and to express zzso zzso and receptors in zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso in the chick zzso in zzso either zzso zzso an zzso protein and zzso or alkaline zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso appeared normal until zzso 8, when they showed a reduction of the inner zzso layer, accompanied by a marked decrease in the frequency of zzso zzso The territory lacking zzso cells showed zzso of zzso factors necessary for zzso cell zzso such as zzso and zzso accompanied by zzso expression of zzso factors associated with the development of horizontal or bipolar zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cell death were also observed in zzso zzso Taken together with previous in zzso studies, our results suggest that zzso is a powerful regulator of zzso differentiation in the central nervous zzso
