Growth and patterning of the zzso wing zzso disc depends on its subdivision into zzso zzso compartments and limb zzso and body wall zzso zzso We present evidence that both the zzso and zzso subdivisions are specified by zzso of the zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso We show that zzso signaling is necessary and sufficient to activate zzso zzso zzso thereby segregating the wing disc into D zzso and V zzso zzso Similarly, we demonstrate that zzso signaling directs the expression of zzso Complex zzso genes in prospective zzso cells, rendering them distinct from, and zzso with, neighboring wing zzso However, zzso signaling acts only early in development to zzso activate zzso whereas it is required persistently during subsequent development to maintain zzso gene zzso zzso as the disc grows, the zzso compartment boundary can shift zzso beyond the range of the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso boundary, which continues to be defined by zzso zzso
