Upon zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the receptors undergo zzso or zzso This in turn leads to the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors, and the zzso of zzso zzso Recent studies have described the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso to be involved in zzso and suppression of host innate immune zzso zzso interferes with zzso and zzso signaling pathways by a mechanism that remains zzso In this study, we show using zzso analyses that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso but interferes only with the zzso zzso We present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain, which reveals significant structural differences in the loop regions compared with other zzso domain zzso We demonstrate that zzso forms a zzso in solution, and the crystal structure reveals the zzso zzso which we validate by zzso and zzso zzso Our study advances the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host zzso by bacterial zzso
