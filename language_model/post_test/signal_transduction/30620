zzso infection triggers zzso of innate immune cells through the interaction of bacterial products with zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso protein involved in downstream signaling through zzso 1, 2, 4, and zzso We examined the role of zzso during infection with attenuated zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice were fully capable of resolving primary infection with zzso and actually exhibited accelerated clearance of bacteria at a late stage of the zzso zzso with enhanced bacterial zzso zzso mice resolved zzso zzso inflammation more rapidly than zzso zzso mice and zzso from zzso zzso mice produced more zzso upon in zzso zzso Upon secondary challenge, zzso and zzso mice displayed a similar level of protective immunity against virulent zzso Together these data indicate that zzso signaling is completely zzso for clearance of zzso infection, and actually has a mild deleterious effect upon the resolution of primary zzso
