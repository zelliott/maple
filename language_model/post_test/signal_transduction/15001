zzso interactions zzso mediate a broad range of functions essential for cellular zzso function, and zzso However, it is still a daunting task to zzso identify and profile zzso zzso in complex zzso Here, we have used a combined zzso and protein zzso strategy to systematically characterize the human zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso between 460 DNA motifs predicted to regulate zzso and zzso human proteins of various functional zzso Among them, we recovered many known zzso for zzso factors zzso We identified a large number of unanticipated zzso for known zzso as well as for previously zzso zzso We also found that over three hundred unconventional zzso proteins zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso One such zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso suggesting important biological roles for such zzso
