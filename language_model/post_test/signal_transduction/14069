In zzso mice, zzso to infection with the zzso zzso zzso major is driven largely by the development of T helper 2 zzso responses and the production of zzso zzso and zzso which share a common zzso zzso the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso While zzso is the main zzso of zzso responses, zzso it has been shown that zzso administered zzso can promote zzso cell zzso zzso production and enhance zzso development if given early during zzso To further investigate the relevance of biological quantities of zzso acting on zzso during in zzso infection, DC specific zzso deficient zzso zzso mice were generated by gene targeting and zzso zzso using the zzso system under control of the zzso zzso DNA, zzso and functional characterization showed zzso zzso expression on zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Following infection with zzso major, zzso mice became zzso to disease, presenting earlier and increased zzso zzso necrosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses and increased type 2 zzso production as well as impaired classical zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice was accompanied by a striking increase in zzso burdens in peripheral zzso such as the zzso liver, and even the zzso zzso showed increased zzso loads in zzso mice and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso produced reduced zzso but increased zzso due to impaired DC zzso with increased zzso expression of zzso and zzso A, zzso previously implicated in promoting zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso of zzso signaling on zzso is severely zzso to the host, leading to rapid disease zzso and increased survival of zzso in infected zzso due to reduced killing zzso zzso
