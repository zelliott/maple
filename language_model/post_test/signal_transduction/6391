Class I alpha zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in the early insulin signaling zzso and plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso Despite extensive investigation, the genes responsible for the development of the common forms of type 2 diabetes remain zzso This study was performed to identify zzso in the coding region of zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso from skin zzso from type 2 diabetics and controls were established to address this zzso zzso alpha zzso was zzso and a single point zzso at zzso zzso was zzso This zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso acid change Met zzso zzso in one subject with type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso in two other diabetic patients and one with severe insulin zzso Interestingly, those patients revealed an impaired zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso alpha without any zzso in zzso alpha zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso protein contents were not significantly changed, and neither were zzso or zzso zzso We conclude from our data that this zzso may have only minor impact on signaling zzso however, in combination with zzso in other genes zzso signaling zzso this may have a functional impact on early insulin zzso
