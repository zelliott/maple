Alternative zzso is a molecular mechanism that produces multiple proteins from a single zzso and is thought to produce variety in proteins translated from a limited number of zzso Here we analyzed how alternative zzso produced variety in protein structure and function, by using human full-length zzso on the assumption that all of the alternatively spliced zzso were translated to zzso We found that the length of alternatively spliced zzso acid zzso in most cases, fell into a size shorter than that of average protein zzso We evaluated zzso the zzso three-dimensional structures of the alternatively spliced products to assess the impact of alternative zzso on gene zzso We found that more than half of the products zzso proteins which were involved in signal zzso zzso and translation, and more than half of alternatively spliced regions comprised interaction sites between proteins and their binding partners, including zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso of the alternatively spliced zzso showed significant zzso to regions of the protein structural core, which likely resulted in large zzso zzso Based on those findings, we speculate that there are a large number of cases that alternative zzso zzso protein networks through significant zzso in protein zzso
