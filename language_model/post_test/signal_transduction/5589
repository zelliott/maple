zzso binding to its zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso which is expressed by zzso hormone zzso zzso stimulates zzso release and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso make close contact with zzso zzso acting at both the cell body and the nerve zzso zzso can act directly on zzso zzso and/or indirectly via synaptic input from other zzso to inhibit inwardly zzso zzso channels and activate zzso zzso channels, with the effect of long-lasting zzso and increased action potential firing zzso This review covers the recent advances in the molecular consequences of zzso action on zzso zzso and how these zzso circuits are integrated in different zzso These studies provide insight into the mechanism by which zzso regulates the zzso zzso
