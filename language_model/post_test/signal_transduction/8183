Respiratory zzso virus zzso is a common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in zzso Severe zzso disease is related to an inappropriate immune response to zzso resulting in enhanced lung pathology which is influenced by host genetic zzso To gain insight into the early pathways of the zzso of and immune response to zzso infection, we determined the zzso profiles of lungs and zzso zzso on days 1 and 3 after infection of zzso zzso zzso infection resulted in a rapid but transient zzso zzso response, as exemplified by the induction of a large number of type I zzso genes and zzso zzso genes involved in zzso and genes involved in zzso zzso Interestingly, this response is much stronger on day 1 than on day 3 after infection, indicating that the strong zzso response in the lung precedes the peak of viral zzso Surprisingly, the set of zzso genes was small and none of these genes displayed strong zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were much less prominent than lung responses and are suggestive of zzso cell zzso Our data indicate that at time points prior to the peak of viral replication and influx of inflammatory cells, the local lung response, measured at the zzso level, has already dampened zzso The processes and pathways induced shortly after zzso infection can now be used for the selection of candidate genes for human genetic studies of children with severe zzso zzso
