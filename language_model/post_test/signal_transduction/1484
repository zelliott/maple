zzso zzso zzso and progressive zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have characterized Parkinson's disease zzso We have hypothesized that the zzso response may be provoked by molecular signals from chronically stressed zzso zzso To test whether zzso precursor protein zzso could serve as such a zzso we evaluated zzso zzso in zzso after unilateral zzso of the zzso zzso bundle zzso in mice either zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso mice displayed comparable zzso response at the zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice zzso zzso was first apparent in the zzso zzso at 3 days zzso zzso marked by zzso change and increased zzso zzso The zzso response intensified at 7 zzso and persisted in the zzso zzso through 14 zzso In contrast, in zzso mice activated zzso appeared predominantly at 7 zzso with little zzso at 3 zzso and none at 14 zzso zzso number in affected zzso zzso at 14 zzso was significantly reduced compared with loss in affected zzso zzso The delayed and limited local zzso zzso and increased zzso survival in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice are consistent with the important role zzso in zzso stress responses in zzso
