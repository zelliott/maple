The zzso zzso nucleus zzso functions as a center to integrate various zzso activities for regulating feeding zzso zzso a recently discovered zzso zzso is localized in the zzso However, the zzso neural zzso of zzso remains zzso Here we show that central injection of zzso activates the zzso and brain stem nucleus zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso targets both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso themselves and stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal zzso specifically in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso against zzso zzso suppresses zzso release in the zzso suggesting zzso actions of zzso zzso anorexia is abolished by an zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso terminals are closely associated with and zzso activates zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso anorexia in zzso zzso zzso The present results reveal the zzso zzso signaling in the zzso that triggers zzso zzso zzso
