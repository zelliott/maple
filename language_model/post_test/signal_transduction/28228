zzso zzso zzso cells in adult kidney can undergo zzso transition zzso a zzso conversion that is fundamentally linked to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Emerging evidence indicates that a large proportion of zzso zzso are actually originated from zzso zzso cells via zzso in diseased zzso Moreover, selective blockade of zzso in a mouse genetic model dramatically reduces zzso zzso after zzso injury, zzso a zzso importance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as an orchestrated, highly regulated process that consists of four key steps: zzso loss of zzso cell zzso zzso de zzso zzso muscle zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso basement zzso and zzso enhanced cell migration and zzso Of the many factors that regulate zzso in different ways, transforming growth zzso is the most potent zzso that is capable of initiating and completing the entire zzso course, whereas zzso growth factor and bone zzso zzso act as zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Multiple zzso signaling pathways have been implicated in zzso zzso in which zzso zzso may play a central zzso This article attempts to provide a comprehensive review of recent advances on understanding the zzso significance, molecular zzso and therapeutic intervention of zzso in the setting of chronic zzso zzso
