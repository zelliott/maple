In this study, we investigated a mechanism by which zzso zzso control zzso cell differentiation into zzso structures via zzso sensitive signaling zzso zzso Using a zzso cell culture, we determined whether zzso or hydrogen zzso signaled zzso tube zzso zzso of the zzso scavenger zzso and the hydrogen zzso scavenger zzso inhibited tube formation in zzso treated zzso zzso Since tube formation on zzso is not specific for zzso cells, we verified our results in a zzso model that better represents tube formation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited tube formation in zzso exposed zzso cells zzso with zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso depended on the zzso so we tested tube formation dependence on the zzso zzso tube formation was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso D and the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso which was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso We determined the functional role of zzso in tube formation by zzso zzso and showed zzso zzso to inhibit tube formation in zzso exposed zzso The major novel findings presented here are that: zzso zzso tube formation requires the presence of zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors and zzso zzso increases zzso zzso via a zzso zzso Furthermore, these studies demonstrate zzso to be an important signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso and may serve as a therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of zzso zzso
