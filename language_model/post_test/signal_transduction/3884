zzso zzso growth factor zzso was zzso by zzso zzso with zzso acid and was immobilized onto the zzso of a polystyrene culture plate by zzso The zzso zzso enhanced the growth of zzso cells more than native or zzso zzso zzso A small amount of zzso zzso was sufficient to enhance the growth of cells and the zzso zzso effect was greater than that of native or zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso did not enhance growth of zzso zzso In addition, signal zzso in the cells zzso only on the zzso surface was observed by zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso These results showed that the enhanced cell growth was due to direct interaction between the cells and the immobilized zzso zzso could be a universal means of fixing growth factors onto an artificial zzso that is devoid of chemically functional groups scaffolding growth factors and could provide a new tool to zzso signal zzso mechanism and could lead to the development of a new zzso cell culture system or tissue engineering zzso
