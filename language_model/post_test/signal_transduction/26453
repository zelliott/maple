Cell zzso for zzso via engineered or artificial zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso has presented a powerful tool for zzso complex traits that are practically useful particularly for industrial zzso and for understanding at the global level the regulatory network of gene zzso We previously further showed that an zzso global regulator zzso zzso from the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso can be tailored to zzso zzso coli zzso zzso with significantly enhanced zzso to different zzso In this work, based on comparative zzso and zzso analyses of the representative strains E1 and zzso harboring the zzso zzso zzso E1 and the zzso wild type zzso respectively, we found that the zzso and zzso of zzso coli were extensively zzso by the tailored zzso zzso Overall, zzso genes (or approximately zzso of zzso coli zzso were significantly altered at the zzso level, including notably genes in the zzso oxide zzso pathway, and genes for zzso zzso The zzso profile revealed significant zzso or zzso of several proteins associated with zzso of the cell membrane and cell zzso zzso of the zzso NO level and cell growth under reduced temperature supported a close correlation between NO and ethanol zzso and also suggests a role for membrane zzso The significantly different zzso profiles of strain E1 indicate that zzso functions as a global regulator in zzso coli, and that zzso may be evolved for other cellular zzso In this sense, it will provide synthetic biology with a practical and zzso regulatory zzso that operates at a higher level of complexity than local zzso This work also suggests a possibility of introducing and engineering other zzso global regulators to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
