zzso zzso are rigid zzso of the insect zzso used as weapons in contests for access to zzso Relative to their body size, zzso horns can be zzso They zzso from any of five different regions of the head or zzso they are zzso straight, zzso or zzso and their development is often coupled with the zzso environment zzso zzso or with sex zzso zzso Here, we show that this extraordinary diversity of horns can be distilled down to four zzso of zzso zzso location, shape, zzso and zzso we illustrate how the zzso mechanisms regulating horn growth could generate each of these types of horn zzso Specifically, we review two zzso pathways known to regulate growth of zzso structures in zzso and other zzso a zzso zzso that specifies the location and shape of a structure, and the insulin pathway, which zzso trait growth in response to zzso zzso We zzso preliminary evidence indicating that these pathways are associated with the development of zzso zzso and we show how subtle changes in the relative activities of these two pathways would be sufficient to generate most of the extant diversity of horn zzso Our objective is to intuitively connect zzso with zzso and to advocate an informed zzso zzso approach to studies of the zzso basis of zzso We end by using this insight from development to offer a solution to the long-standing mystery of the zzso the observation by zzso zzso zzso and others that this one family of zzso appeared to have a zzso zzso towards the evolution of zzso
