The characteristics of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso zzso with zzso were zzso The zzso of the zzso was a) inhibited by the zzso of zzso zzso b) completely inhibited by zzso toxin zzso c) not affected by the zzso of zzso with an zzso of protein zzso C, zzso or an inhibitor of protein zzso C, zzso and zzso not inhibited in the cells preloaded with the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso requires functional zzso and zzso protein but neither calcium zzso nor protein zzso C zzso
