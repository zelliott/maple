Learning zzso plastic changes in zzso However, the regulatory molecules that orchestrate zzso synaptic changes are largely zzso Although it is well established that zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso learning and memory, evidence for the zzso regulation of zzso synaptic plasticity is zzso Here we find that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso mediates the contextual fear zzso strengthening of zzso zzso zzso zzso through the synaptic incorporation of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso fear learning also enhances the strength of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner zzso by the zzso of, not zzso but, zzso zzso zzso We observe a significant correlation between the zzso increases in zzso and zzso synaptic strength at individual zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso regulation of zzso zzso synaptic plasticity may help the development of new therapies for cognitive zzso
