zzso responses associated with zzso were investigated in a single zzso with a special reference to their dynamic properties and their zzso relationships with zzso and chemical responses during zzso The real-time sequence of zzso was directly zzso by zzso contrast differential interference contrast zzso zzso The actual release of contents from such a zzso was proven by examining a cell loaded with zzso with a dual imaging system that allowed us to observe zzso and zzso images simultaneously at a high zzso During the process of zzso formation in a zzso engulfing an zzso zzso the zzso response was observed first in a zzso located near the cell surface initially attached to the zzso and then in other zzso zzso along zzso surrounding the zzso When the zzso was induced in a medium containing zzso a zzso due to active zzso was detected exclusively in the region of zzso suggesting that zzso took place on the zzso membrane and not on the plasma zzso Changes in zzso free calcium concentration zzso were further measured using zzso under the dual imaging zzso zzso zzso were more closely related to the extension of zzso for engulfing zzso and not directly to the zzso These findings lead to a conclusion that zzso associated with zzso is initiated by attachment of the cell membrane to the invading zzso and zzso by local zzso of the zzso zzso
