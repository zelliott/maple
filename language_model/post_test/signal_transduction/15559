Human zzso stem cells from embryonic origins and those generated from zzso zzso cells share many zzso including indefinite proliferation and a sustained capacity to differentiate into a wide variety of cell zzso However, it remains to be demonstrated whether both cell types rely on similar mechanisms to maintain their zzso status and to control their zzso Any differences in such mechanisms would suggest that zzso of zzso to generate induced zzso stem cells zzso results in novel states of zzso In that event, current methods for expanding and zzso human embryonic stem cells zzso might not be directly zzso to human zzso However, we show here that human zzso rely on zzso signaling to control zzso expression and thereby maintain zzso thus revealing their zzso similarity to human zzso We also show that growth factors necessary and sufficient for achieving zzso of human zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso also drive differentiation of human zzso into the same zzso zzso these experiments were performed in fully chemically defined medium devoid of factors that could obscure analysis of zzso mechanisms or render the resulting zzso incompatible with future clinical zzso Together these data reveal that human zzso rely on mechanisms similar to human zzso to maintain their zzso and to control their zzso showing that these zzso cell types are functionally zzso
