zzso zzso zzso an important precursor of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso organisms, has been shown to activate zzso T cells, the major subset of human zzso T zzso The zzso of zzso has been first described as the zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to be key zzso in the zzso zzso also leading to the formation of zzso in some zzso such as zzso zzso Here we report that the low molecular mass fraction of extracts from bacteria using the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso while analogous preparations from bacteria using the classical zzso zzso fail to do zzso zzso of zzso zzso the ability of zzso coli extracts to activate zzso T zzso As the amounts of zzso present in the bacterial preparations are not sufficient to induce significant zzso T cell zzso our data suggest that compounds other than zzso associated with the zzso zzso are responsible for zzso T cell zzso
