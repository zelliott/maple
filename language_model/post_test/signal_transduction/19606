zzso zzso is the zzso agent of anthrax in humans and other zzso In lethal systemic anthrax, zzso zzso zzso large quantities of the toxins lethal factor zzso and zzso factor zzso leading to widespread vascular leakage and zzso Whereas host targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the initial phase of anthrax, less is understood about toxin action during the final stage of zzso Here we use zzso zzso to identify the zzso zzso which acts at the last step of zzso recycling, as a novel target of both zzso and zzso zzso reduces levels of zzso localized zzso and indirectly blocks zzso formation by its binding partner and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso acts more directly to reduce zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso and zzso on zzso inhibit expression of and zzso by the zzso zzso Delta and reduce zzso levels at zzso zzso In human zzso cells, the two toxins act in a zzso fashion to block formation of zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso and reduce zzso expression at zzso zzso This coordinated disruption of the zzso zzso by anthrax toxins may contribute to zzso barrier disruption and vascular dysfunction during zzso zzso zzso
