zzso zzso causes acute zzso and zzso in zzso A variety of zzso bacteria can stimulate zzso protein zzso zzso in host zzso zzso of zzso leads to production of zzso zzso 8 and subsequently causes zzso Thus, zzso zzso were strong candidates for the main signaling zzso of zzso zzso acute zzso 

To determine whether the signaling zzso on zzso zzso infection zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso level of zzso and zzso of zzso by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso infection of zzso cells activated zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso signal zzso leading to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed zzso zzso A strain carrying a deletion of zzso a type three zzso system 1 zzso zzso zzso failed to activate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the stabilization of zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso zzso infection of zzso cells results in the zzso of zzso and that zzso plays a pivotal role in manipulating host cell signaling and is responsible for triggering zzso zzso
