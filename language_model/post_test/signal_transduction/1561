zzso zzso zzso factor zzso high mobility group box zzso factors are the nuclear zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In zzso three members of the zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso with distinct but partially overlapping expression patterns have been zzso The individual zzso zzso family members differ extremely in their properties of target gene zzso We observed that in contrast to zzso neither zzso nor zzso can induce secondary axis formation upon zzso zzso in zzso zzso To identify functional motifs within the zzso zzso factors responsible for target gene zzso or repression, we created various zzso and a set of zzso zzso In zzso studies, we asked whether these zzso can mimic an activated zzso zzso and lead to the formation of a secondary body zzso In addition, we examined their capacity to rescue a zzso zzso given by dominant negative zzso zzso We further analyzed their ability to directly activate target genes in reporter gene zzso using the zzso target zzso zzso and zzso We found that a region zzso to zzso zzso of human zzso is an zzso zzso This is flanked by two small zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our findings zzso that the motifs identified here play an essential role in determining cell zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
