Opiates have long been used as analgesics to relieve pain associated with various medical zzso Here, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of zzso zzso signaling on the zzso wound healing response and assessed downstream pathways known to be protective against zzso zzso Mice zzso were exposed to zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso for 7 days or zzso zzso for 5 days followed by 7 days of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were injected zzso daily for in zzso studies or used for in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso and gross zzso injury and weight zzso diminished zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and promoted zzso healing during zzso zzso also enhanced zzso proliferation zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in both zzso mice and the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso migration was completely zzso by zzso zzso Together, this work shows that zzso zzso protects against and enhances recovery from zzso zzso zzso This is associated with an increase in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso manipulation of zzso signaling may represent a novel means to promote zzso healing and to maintain zzso zzso after zzso zzso
