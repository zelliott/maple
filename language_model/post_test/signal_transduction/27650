Type A scavenger receptors zzso mediate the zzso of modified zzso zzso by zzso The zzso of lipids via this process is thought to lead to foam cell formation in zzso zzso Human zzso cells zzso have not been previously shown to express zzso in normal zzso We therefore investigated whether there is an zzso form of zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso 

zzso activity was analyzed by cellular zzso of zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso using a flow zzso zzso zzso expression was examined using reverse zzso chain reaction, followed by Southern zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso several reporter gene zzso were zzso The first contained a full zzso promoter, the second a part of the zzso promoter that has both zzso and zzso zzso factor binding zzso Other zzso were identical to the second, except that they contained either zzso or zzso motif zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso increased both the percentage of zzso cells and the zzso mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso II also increased zzso zzso and promoter activity in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso C and zzso zzso pathways were involved in zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso was involved in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso motifs were specific response elements to zzso stimulation in zzso 

This study suggests that zzso may express an zzso zzso by which cells can acquire lipids and convert to foam cells in developing zzso
