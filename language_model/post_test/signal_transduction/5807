zzso signaling has multiple roles in regulating processes in animal development, including the zzso and patterning of the zzso In addition, zzso signaling supports self renewal of human embryonic stem cells and is required for differentiation of zzso embryonic stem cells into a number of zzso 

Given the importance of zzso signaling in regulating development and stem cell zzso we aimed to identify the zzso targets of zzso zzso during early development in the zzso model zzso zzso We zzso the effects on gene expression in zzso in which zzso signaling was inhibited by dominant negative zzso zzso 67 genes positively regulated by zzso signaling and 16 genes zzso regulated by zzso signaling were zzso zzso target genes are expressed in distinct waves during the late zzso to early zzso zzso Many of these genes are expressed in the early zzso and zzso zzso A widespread requirement for zzso in regulating genes expressed in the zzso organizer is zzso The zzso targets zzso and zzso are shown to be negative regulators of zzso signaling in early zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in regulating zzso in zzso cells are shown to be down regulated when zzso signaling is zzso 

We have undertaken a detailed analysis of zzso target genes which has generated a zzso well validated data zzso We have found a widespread role for zzso signaling in regulating the expression of genes zzso the function of the zzso zzso In addition, we have found that the zzso targets zzso and zzso are likely to contribute to the complex feedback zzso involved in modulating responses to zzso zzso We also find a link between zzso signaling and the expression of known regulators of zzso
