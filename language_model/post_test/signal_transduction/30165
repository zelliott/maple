zzso of B zzso strictly depends on the signaling competence of the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors undergo negative selection and can be replaced by zzso zzso In addition, the process of maturation of zzso B cells and migration to the zzso referred to as positive selection, is limited by the signaling competence of the zzso Using zzso mice deficient of zzso we have shown that signaling incompetence not only blocks positive selection but also activates zzso zzso Here we study the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso of zzso zzso We find that editing, immature zzso B cells deficient of zzso have elevated zzso zzso signals and that lowering these zzso signals effectively suppresses zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso of zzso zzso signals in zzso immature zzso B cells stimulates significant zzso zzso We also show that positive selection and zzso progression from the bone zzso to the zzso are limited to cells capable of establishing appropriate zzso signals, as in contrast to immature cells, zzso zzso B cells deficient of zzso have zzso zzso signals similar to those of the control zzso zzso This zzso progression is accompanied by zzso of molecules signaling for growth and zzso zzso we suggest that zzso zzso zzso signals are required for promoting positive selection and suppressing the zzso mechanism in immature B zzso
