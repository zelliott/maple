zzso zzso results from zzso differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso zzso that acts as a natural zzso zzso of the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso Several studies have identified the protective effects of zzso on the cardiovascular system, however research on the effects and mechanisms of zzso on vascular zzso is still quite zzso In this study, we determined the effect of zzso on zzso differentiation of zzso and investigated the mechanism involved using the two universally accepted zzso models of zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso of zzso due to decreased alkaline zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso expression and calcium zzso Further study demonstrated that zzso exerted this suppression effect via an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the suppression effect of zzso was time dependent and dose zzso Furthermore, zzso of the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso significantly reversed the zzso of zzso by zzso In conclusion, our study suggests that zzso may inhibit zzso differentiation of zzso through the zzso zzso
