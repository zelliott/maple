We are probing the regulation of zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso In the accompanying paper, we showed that manipulation of the zzso second zzso zzso acid or zzso acid, produced downstream of the zzso zzso zzso did not affect the PC synthesis rates in a manner consistent with direct zzso of the rate limiting zzso in the pathway, zzso zzso zzso However, suppression of zzso zzso production with an inhibitor of zzso zzso reduced zzso PC synthesis as well as zzso zzso Here, we show that the stimulation of PC synthesis and zzso of zzso by zzso requires a signaling zzso that involves protein zzso C and zzso The zzso zzso I and zzso blocked zzso zzso and completely eliminated zzso stimulation of the zzso reaction and PC zzso zzso addition of zzso using a zzso zzso delivery system exactly zzso the zzso of zzso PC zzso suggesting that this mode of zzso delivery can effectively substitute for the zzso generated downstream of the activated zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activated zzso and the zzso of PC synthesis by zzso was blocked by zzso of protein zzso C and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and the zzso supplied zzso stimulate PC zzso not solely by direct action on zzso but via a signaling zzso involving protein zzso C and zzso zzso did not alter the net zzso state of zzso as zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso likely mediates effects on zzso via a process other than zzso zzso
