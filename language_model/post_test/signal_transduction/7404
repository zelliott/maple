How biological systems generate zzso patterns with high precision is a central question in zzso The shoot zzso zzso zzso a specialized tissue producing plant aerial zzso is a zzso system of choice to address this zzso zzso are periodically initiated at the SAM at specific spatial positions and this zzso pattern defines zzso zzso of the plant hormone zzso triggers organ zzso whereas zzso depletion around zzso generates zzso fields that are thought to be sufficient to maintain these patterns and their zzso Here we show that another type of zzso zzso fields, generated directly downstream of zzso by zzso movement of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso fields establish patterns of zzso zzso in the zzso that contribute to the zzso of zzso by imposing a zzso sequence on organ zzso Our findings indicate that not one but two distinct zzso fields may be required for achieving zzso precision during formation of zzso structures at the zzso thus indicating an original mechanism for providing zzso to a dynamic zzso zzso
