The elimination of activated T cells by zzso signaling is an important zzso mechanism used to maintain zzso and prevent tissue zzso T cell zzso signals are required to zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso cell death zzso however, the nature of these signals is not well zzso In this report, we show, using T cells from zzso mice zzso with a zzso zzso zzso that zzso signaling events are a critical part of the competency signal required for zzso This is in part due to defects in zzso zzso signaling complex formation as shown by decreased recruitment of zzso and zzso 8 into zzso zzso following zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso In addition, in the absence of zzso signals, zzso T cells have a selective zzso in zzso zzso following zzso zzso while provision of zzso zzso during zzso partially restores zzso to zzso zzso zzso production and proliferation after primary zzso stimulation is comparable between wild type and zzso T cells indicating that the requirement for zzso signaling events for zzso production is zzso regulated and is particularly critical in previously activated zzso T zzso In total, our results indicate that zzso zzso dependent signaling events specifically regulate zzso T cell survival and zzso Further, these data suggest that zzso signaling events may protect against the decreased zzso production and resistance to cell death seen during chronic immune zzso
