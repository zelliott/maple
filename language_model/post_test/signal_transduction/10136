zzso zzso growth zzso zzso signaling directs both zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso interactions during early mouse lung zzso remains incompletely zzso Fetal liver zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in the embryonic lung zzso zzso expressed in the zzso is a high affinity zzso for zzso We have used both gain and loss of function approaches to investigate the role of this zzso signaling zzso during lung zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso one of the 3 zzso generated by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso stimulates mouse embryonic lung branching zzso in culture and increases the index of proliferation in both zzso and zzso In addition, it zzso differential gene and protein expression among several key lung zzso zzso including zzso of zzso and zzso expression as well as an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic lung culture with an zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso led to reduced zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso proliferation index as well as zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso is involved in driving zzso to zzso zzso in embryonic mouse lung zzso
