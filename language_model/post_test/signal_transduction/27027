zzso zzso zzso has been shown to have a unique zzso effect zzso repeated injection of zzso into a lateral cerebral zzso or a zzso region of the rat zzso below the lateral zzso and including the anterior zzso referred to as the zzso zzso area, causes enhanced motor responses to the zzso To zzso possible zzso mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso 1) we determined the dose and the time required for the development and expression of zzso zzso and 2) we tested the hypotheses that zzso zzso may result in a) zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity or number, and/or b) zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso Our behavioral data show that the magnitude of zzso zzso varies with dose and time, and the effect is dependent on the time zzso between injections, in that an initial zzso zzso injection enhances the sensitivity of the animals to the motor effects of similar zzso injections given 6 h to 6 days later but not to injections given hourly or zzso No changes in zzso zzso binding site density and zzso as measured by zzso binding to zzso synaptic plasma zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation in response to zzso in zzso zzso however, was found to be significantly zzso This enhanced zzso zzso stimulation appears specific to a zzso zzso because it was significantly reduced in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was not found using zzso or the V2 zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
