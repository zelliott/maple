zzso express zzso and water channels to support dynamic regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be modulated by zzso zzso the essential water channel for zzso water zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso can regulate zzso water zzso and the mechanisms of such an zzso Studies were performed on rat primary zzso and a rat zzso cell line zzso with zzso We found that 10 zzso zzso caused an immediate, more than zzso increase in zzso water zzso which was sustained in 5 zzso The water channel zzso was a target for this zzso zzso induced a significant increase in zzso zzso as measured with a zzso based method and with zzso zzso We found that protein zzso A zzso could zzso zzso in zzso Further zzso of zzso to 35 zzso induced a global zzso calcium response and a transient water zzso increase that was abolished in 5 zzso When inwardly zzso zzso zzso were zzso 10 zzso zzso also induced a calcium increase and the water zzso increase no longer zzso In conclusion, we find that zzso of zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso water zzso via zzso signaling involving zzso A prolonged increase of zzso water zzso is zzso dependent and this response can be zzso by zzso calcium zzso Our results support the concept of zzso between zzso and zzso handling in zzso
