zzso production of zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso from activated zzso contributes to human neurodegenerative zzso Our previous study demonstrated the potent zzso of zzso zzso NO production in rat primary zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso a pair of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been used in China for centuries as a zzso zzso as well as to treat zzso We further investigated whether zzso and zzso effectively suppress release of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and the zzso molecular mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated zzso production of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as well as NO in mouse zzso zzso cells, with zzso showing more potent zzso of zzso zzso The western zzso analysis indicated that the potential molecular mechanism for zzso or zzso zzso was implicated in zzso of zzso protein level, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and degradation of zzso In addition, the differential regulation of the three signaling pathways by two zzso was zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso may be effective therapeutic candidates for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by zzso zzso
