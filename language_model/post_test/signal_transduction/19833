Many lines of evidence indicate the importance of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso in directing zzso extension and zzso The signaling networks that involve these proteins regulate zzso zzso dynamics in navigating zzso growth zzso However, the intricate patterns that regulate zzso zzso zzso and signaling are not yet fully zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso The addition of a zzso group to the zzso zzso zzso targets zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and promotes their zzso by zzso interaction with zzso zzso exchange factors and allowing zzso by association with zzso zzso zzso However, it is unclear how these modifications affect zzso extension or how zzso zzso alters signaling from the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we review recent data addressing this issue and propose that zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso
