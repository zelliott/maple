zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso is the key step in liver zzso Increased transforming growth factor beta zzso expression and zzso zzso production in patients with zzso zzso and experimental models of liver zzso support implication of zzso in the zzso of this zzso However, a zzso role for zzso during zzso of zzso has not been delineated in molecular zzso Using a rat cell culture model of zzso zzso we analyzed zzso signal zzso and identified changes between zzso cells and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso opposed to zzso were not inhibited in proliferation activity on treatment with zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso zzso collagen and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was achieved in zzso cells but not in zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses indicated significant expression of zzso receptors I and II in both cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso affinity labeling displayed strongly reduced types I, II, and III zzso presentation at the cell surface of zzso Moreover, zzso did not display zzso zzso proteins in zzso mobility shift zzso with a zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso cells are responsive to zzso treatment and zzso a signal that may play an important role in liver zzso zzso display decreased availability of surface receptors for zzso which could be based on zzso zzso However, lack of activated zzso complexes with zzso activity and absence of zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso raise the possibility of zzso signaling independent zzso zzso in zzso
