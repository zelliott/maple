Diabetes is a zzso zzso The pattern recognition zzso zzso receptors zzso are increased in diabetic patients and have been suggested to play a role in diabetic zzso zzso zzso of zzso involves altered zzso cell zzso function with an expansion of the zzso zzso There is a paucity of data examining the role of zzso and its expression in zzso We zzso the expression of zzso in the zzso might be an important factor contributing to zzso expansion and zzso Thus we evaluated the effect of high zzso on zzso and zzso expression in mouse zzso cells zzso in zzso Exposure of zzso to 25 zzso zzso for 24 h resulted in increased zzso zzso and cell surface zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we were not able to detect expression of zzso in zzso Furthermore, expression of a zzso downstream signaling cascade including zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso and Toll zzso zzso domain containing zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in cells exposed to 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was also a significant increase in zzso zzso along with increased zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of transforming growth zzso were also significantly increased in the presence of 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso activates zzso expression and activity in zzso and could contribute to zzso
