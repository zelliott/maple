The zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso survival, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma zzso zzso Here, we tested the zzso activity of zzso zzso which zzso zzso signaling at the levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso survival zzso showed that zzso cell lines exhibited zzso and zzso decreased viability after exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso cells highly sensitive zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso included both lines sensitive and resistant to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso induced rapid commitment to and induction of zzso and zzso cell zzso Furthermore, normal donor peripheral blood zzso cells were less sensitive zzso zzso zzso than the majority of zzso cell lines tested, suggesting a favorable therapeutic zzso In addition, zzso was able to target zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso cells, or zzso which are known to protect against various zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed that zzso treatment decreased the zzso of zzso signatures previously associated with zzso zzso and zzso function, as well as high-risk zzso and zzso human embryonic stem zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed significant reduction in tumor burden zzso zzso zzso and survival zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with conventional zzso zzso and zzso or novel zzso zzso zzso agents showed lack of zzso These results indicate that zzso merits clinical testing, alone and in combination with other agents, in zzso
