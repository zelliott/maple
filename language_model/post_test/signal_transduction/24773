zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso protein that zzso regulates zzso and growth factor signaling required during zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso interacts with zzso B and C, which are components of a zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to operate as an inhibitor of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso has the distinct function of targeting the zzso specific zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso form a protein complex through interactions between the zzso zzso regulatory region and the zzso domain of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso decreases the steady state levels of zzso zzso and zzso and reduces the focus forming activity of zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso which was stabilized by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso programs zzso degradation by acting as a zzso recognition component of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
