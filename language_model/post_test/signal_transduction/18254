It has been reported that zzso toxin zzso suppresses the function of zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to clarify the role of zzso for zzso signal zzso mechanism in rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscles were zzso with zzso approximately 1 zzso zzso for 2 hours, followed by stimulation with zzso zzso insulin or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in zzso decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso and unchanged zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso to the membrane were suppressed when treated with zzso despite no changes in zzso binding and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, to zzso zzso zzso zzso of 40 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso with 10 zzso insulin for 10 minutes, zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found by zzso analysis with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso by binding of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by releasing of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso after insulin zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
