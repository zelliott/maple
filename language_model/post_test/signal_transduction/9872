Maintenance of zzso zzso is critical for the survival of all zzso zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso as in other zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are generated during metabolism and upon exposure to environmental zzso The abnormal production of zzso triggers defense mechanisms to avoid the deleterious consequence of zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso is necessary to zzso resistance to zzso in budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are hypersensitive to zzso and exhibit high zzso of zzso even at a zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is important for heavy metal zzso in zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a zzso interaction with each other and form a zzso fluorescent complex on the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso associates with zzso and that their interaction is enhanced upon exposure to hydrogen zzso The zzso zzso also exhibit hypersensitivity to cadmium, while cells carrying a deletion of zzso or zzso in a component of the zzso zzso zzso exhibit little or minor sensitivity to zzso We thus propose that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso stress by regulating multiple downstream targets including zzso Since both zzso and zzso belong to highly zzso families of zzso similar mechanisms may exist in other zzso
