zzso are small, highly zzso zzso zzso that regulate gene expression of target zzso through zzso or zzso zzso and are widely involved in zzso and cancer zzso In this study, the expression profile of zzso zzso was examined in breast cancer cells and breast cancer zzso The results showed that expression of zzso in both breast cancer cells and breast cancer zzso was significantly zzso zzso of zzso in tumor cells arrested the cell cycle by drastically decreasing the zzso zzso phase and retarded the newly zzso DNA, suggesting a regulatory role for zzso in proliferation of breast cancer zzso zzso prediction showed that zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a potential target for zzso A dual zzso reporter gene zzso showed that zzso bound to the 3' zzso of zzso but not a zzso 3' zzso thereby zzso the protein expression zzso zzso we found that expression of zzso protein decreased with increased expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells resulted in suppression of the level of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso nuclear zzso These results demonstrate that zzso which may act as a tumor zzso in breast cancer, regulates the cell cycle and proliferation in zzso by targeting zzso through the downstream signal zzso zzso Overall, these results show that zzso may be used as zzso and/or therapeutic target for diagnosis and therapy of breast zzso
