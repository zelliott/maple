Both trafficking and zzso critically depend on accurate and specific membrane recognition and zzso A key step in these processes is the assembly of a complex consisting of a small number of zzso zzso the zzso core zzso In nerve zzso this set consists of zzso and zzso which reside at zzso of synaptic zzso and zzso and zzso at the plasma zzso In this survey, different zzso systems that depend on the zzso core proteins are zzso The possibility that specificity in membrane recognition and fusion is achieved by the numerous zzso of proteins of the zzso core is zzso zzso of the core complex proteins is determined by the complexity of gene families, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Basic zzso properties depend on specific zzso and the possible zzso interactions are determined, in turn, by the zzso of different zzso A correlation between specific zzso and distinct zzso or cellular properties is zzso The outcome of this survey is that zzso in zzso may be dictated by the large number of possible combinations of zzso of only a few zzso
