The correlation between zzso induced changes in the zzso free, zzso concentration zzso and the zzso zzso zzso content in isolated zzso from the rat zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso digital image processing on zzso loaded zzso we observed that zzso increases either simultaneously throughout the zzso zzso or that occasionally, the rise near the zzso can zzso the rise near the zzso part by zzso zzso zzso on cell suspensions revealed a correlation between changes in zzso and changes in the cellular zzso content, and it is concluded that in the individual cells zzso is released to the zzso within the first second after zzso zzso a diffusion zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1992, Science, zzso zzso we have calculated the concentration profile for this zzso in a sphere with a radius of 10 zzso where zzso is released in the center following a zzso function with a rate constant of 4 zzso Assuming that zzso zzso of 1 or zzso of the maximum value is able to release zzso we calculated that zzso waves can appear at a rate of 100 or 40 zzso The present data are consistent with zzso being a cellular messenger, that by zzso zzso the zzso release from the cellular pools within the first fraction of a zzso
