zzso zzso is widely used clinically to treat anemia associated with various clinical conditions including zzso Data from several clinical trials suggest significant adverse effect of zzso treatment on cancer patient zzso However, controversy exists whether zzso zzso zzso is functional in cancer zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso of 65 melanoma cell lines, and increased copy number of the zzso and zzso zzso occurred in 30 and zzso of 130 primary zzso zzso zzso zzso in melanoma cells resulted in diminished zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso decreased cell proliferation and increased response to the zzso effect of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased melanoma zzso size and tumor invasion in zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso of zzso activated cell proliferation pathways in melanoma cells and resulted in increased cell proliferation and resistance to zzso and zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly larger zzso with increased tumor invasion of surrounding tissue in zzso Daily administration of zzso zzso fails to stimulate melanoma growth in zzso but the treatment increased vascular size in the zzso Increased local recurrence after zzso of the primary tumors was observed after zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso plug zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by melanoma cells results in decreased zzso These data support that zzso is functional in melanoma and zzso zzso may promote melanoma zzso and suggest that zzso may stimulate zzso and increase survival of melanoma cells under hypoxic condition in zzso
