zzso of the function of working memory, the zzso cognitive process essential for human reasoning and judgment, is potentially the most intractable problem for the treatment of zzso Since deficits in working memory are associated with zzso zzso and altered zzso zzso signaling within prefrontal cortex, we present the case for targeting novel drug therapies towards enhancing prefrontal zzso stimulation for the zzso of the debilitating cognitive deficits in zzso 

This review examines the role of zzso in regulating cellular and circuit function within prefrontal zzso in order to understand the significance of the zzso zzso found in schizophrenia and related zzso zzso zzso By revealing the associations among prefrontal zzso function, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso we seek to pinpoint the mechanisms by which zzso zzso working memory processes and how these mechanisms may be exploited to improve cognitive zzso 

zzso zzso within zzso prefrontal zzso leads to abnormal recruitment of this region by cognitive zzso Both zzso and clinical studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between prefrontal zzso function and the integrity of working memory, suggesting that insufficient zzso zzso signaling in this region results in cognitive zzso Moreover, working memory deficits can be ameliorated by treatments that augment zzso zzso zzso indicating that this target presents a unique opportunity for the restoration of cognitive function in zzso
