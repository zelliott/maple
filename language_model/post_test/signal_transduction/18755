zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso for numerous living zzso Not only does it serve as a prosthetic group in zzso it also acts as a signaling zzso that controls diverse molecular and cellular processes ranging from signal zzso to protein complex zzso zzso zzso synthesis or function impacts the zzso zzso and nervous systems in zzso Recent studies have revealed a series of zzso zzso factors and signal zzso including zzso a zzso zzso factor that mediates the effects of oxygen on gene zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is zzso regulated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso an iron regulatory protein that mediates the zzso regulation of zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso initiation factor zzso zzso that coordinates protein synthesis with zzso availability in zzso In this review, we zzso the current knowledge about how zzso controls the activity of these zzso regulators and signal zzso and discuss diseases associated with defective zzso zzso degradation and zzso
