In order to identify integral proteins and peripheral proteins associated with the plasma zzso highly zzso zzso plasma zzso from green tissue zzso and zzso were analyzed by mass zzso Plasma zzso were isolated by zzso zzso zzso which yields plasma membrane zzso with a zzso orientation and with a purity of zzso These zzso were turned zzso by treatment with zzso 58 to remove soluble zzso proteins enclosed in the zzso and to remove loosely bound zzso zzso In total, zzso putative plasma membrane proteins were identified, of which 114 are predicted to have zzso zzso or to be zzso zzso zzso About two-thirds of the identified integral proteins have not previously been shown to be plasma membrane zzso Of the zzso identified zzso zzso could be classified according to zzso Major classes are proteins involved in transport zzso signal zzso zzso membrane trafficking zzso and stress responses zzso Almost a quarter of the proteins identified in the present study are functionally zzso and more than half of these are predicted to be zzso
