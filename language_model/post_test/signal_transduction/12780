A major goal in zzso zzso research is the integration of recent findings obtained by sophisticated zzso and zzso analysis of cancer into the more descriptive concepts of experimental zzso It is proposed that the creation of a zzso cell in zzso initiation requires a response modification to zzso or zzso zzso Different types of response modification can be zzso changes in the receptors for growth and differentiation factors and their zzso and nuclear signal zzso zzso increased resistance of initiated cells to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The challenge of a zzso cell to an appropriate promoter results in its selection and zzso expansion, usually to a benign zzso In addition, for zzso zzso changes are required that affect cellular functions that can play a role early or late in zzso These concepts are illustrated with examples from zzso research and zzso zzso
