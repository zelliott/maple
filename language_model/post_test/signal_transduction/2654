zzso of early plant zzso are zzso yet follow different predetermined zzso zzso producing zzso with zzso autonomously developing zzso Evidence is accumulating from a few model systems that information maintaining the determined state of a particular cell type is contained in a zzso manner in the zzso zzso This information can be released to signal back to the cell, thus controlling patterns of gene expression and influencing cell zzso
