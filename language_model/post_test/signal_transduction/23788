Mouse zzso stem cells zzso undergo a zzso transition in several properties, including a marked reduction in their zzso zzso We now show that the zzso timed change in this key function of zzso is associated with their decreased expression of zzso and an accompanying increase in their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in adult zzso zzso their zzso activity in transplanted zzso zzso as does zzso of zzso a well-established zzso target that is zzso in fetal zzso zzso zzso from fetal zzso mice do not exhibit the heightened zzso activity that is characteristic of zzso fetal zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso in adult zzso does not mimic the ability of elevated zzso to activate a fetal zzso differentiation zzso Thus, zzso may act as a master regulator of zzso timed changes in zzso programs with zzso serving as its specific downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso
