zzso of death receptors zzso intrinsic zzso programs in various parts of the zzso To explore the possibility that zzso zzso zzso essential for translation in zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso in two zzso zzso human zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and human zzso cells treated with tumor necrosis zzso In both systems, bands in addition to those of unmodified zzso were detected a few hours after death zzso zzso In both systems, the primary additional band was identical and comprised the zzso region of 28 S zzso The degradation of 28 S zzso was simultaneous with protein synthesis zzso in both zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed zzso degradation and protein synthesis zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that different pathways are activated in the two systems we zzso and the final steps in these pathways use very similar or identical zzso to cleave 28 S zzso These data suggest a zzso link between zzso degradation and zzso of protein zzso In general, zzso execution initiated by death zzso engagement is promoted by protein synthesis zzso zzso by zzso degradation, malfunction of the protein synthesis machinery may prompt death zzso
