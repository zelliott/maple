Liver zzso is characterized by the deposition and increased turnover of zzso zzso This process is controlled by zzso zzso zzso whose expression and activity zzso change during injury zzso zzso one of the most widely expressed zzso is highly expressed in zzso however, its contribution to liver pathology is zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the role of zzso during the development and resolution of zzso by comparing the response of zzso zzso and zzso mice upon chronic liver zzso We show that loss of zzso was beneficial during liver injury, as plasma zzso and zzso levels, deposition of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso a zzso signaling zzso were all significantly lower in zzso zzso The ameliorated course of the disease in zzso mice likely results from a slower rate of basement membrane destruction and zzso zzso as the knockout mice maintained significantly higher levels of type IV collagen and lower expression and zzso of zzso after 4 weeks of zzso zzso liver zzso in zzso mice was associated with slightly higher IGF-1 zzso zzso slightly increased zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels and significantly reduced zzso zzso In addition, primary zzso isolated from zzso mice showed impaired responsiveness towards zzso zzso resulting in lower expression of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso improves the development of zzso zzso through the diminished replacement of zzso zzso zzso with zzso deposits in the beginning of the injury, leading to subsequent changes in zzso and IGF-1 signaling zzso
