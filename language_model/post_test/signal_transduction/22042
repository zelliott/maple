The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso cell surface zzso that belongs to the LDL zzso zzso gene family and that is widely expressed in several zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso attached zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Through its zzso domain, zzso binds at least 40 different zzso ranging from zzso and zzso inhibitor complex to growth factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to interact with scaffolding and signaling proteins via its zzso domain in a zzso manner and to function as a zzso zzso with other cell surface or integral membrane zzso zzso is thus implicated in two major zzso zzso zzso and regulation of signaling zzso which are both involved in diverse biological roles including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso degradation of zzso and tissue zzso The embryonic lethal zzso obtained after target disruption of the zzso gene in the mouse highlights the biological importance of this zzso and revealed a critical, but yet undefined role in zzso zzso gene deletion studies also reveal an important contribution of zzso in vascular zzso foam cell biology, the central nervous system, and in the molecular mechanisms of zzso
