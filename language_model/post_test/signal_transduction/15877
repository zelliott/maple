zzso a major active component of zzso zzso possesses zzso and zzso zzso The present study explores the mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso against zzso and its relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of cortical zzso to zzso results in decreased zzso levels for three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors remain zzso zzso with zzso reversed this effect on zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exerted a zzso effect against zzso zzso zzso This observed effect of zzso was partially blocked by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone; zzso the simultaneous application of both zzso completely reversed the zzso zzso was also found to regulate zzso zzso changes such as increases in zzso size, zzso branching and zzso spine density, as well as elevate zzso expression in cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso reversed the effect of zzso change in zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso In addition, an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso level was observed after zzso treatment, which was further prevented by zzso zzso but not by zzso However, zzso zzso in protein zzso A activity and zzso of zzso response zzso protein levels were inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso and zzso of zzso exhibited by zzso might be zzso at least in part, via the zzso zzso signal zzso
