zzso formation and repair rely on specific combinations of zzso factors, growth factors, and mechanical parameters that regulate the production and spatial organization of type I zzso Here, we investigated the function of the zinc finger zzso factor zzso in zzso formation, healing, and repair using zzso animal models and zzso stem cells zzso Adult zzso of zzso mice displayed a zzso in the expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and were mechanically weaker compared with their zzso zzso zzso was recruited to the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso mouse zzso in zzso zzso was required for the normal gene response following zzso injury in a mouse model of Achilles zzso zzso zzso zzso expression programmed zzso toward the zzso lineage and promoted the formation of in zzso zzso from zzso The application of zzso zzso increased the formation of zzso zzso in a rat model of Achilles zzso zzso We provide evidence that the ability of zzso to promote zzso differentiation is partially zzso by zzso This study demonstrates zzso involvement in adult zzso formation, healing, and repair and identifies zzso as a putative target in zzso repair zzso
