Similar to other zzso and zzso animals, zzso signaling zzso are key components of long-term memory zzso formation in the snail zzso zzso an established experimental model for studying zzso zzso molecular mechanisms of long-term zzso zzso Although a great deal is already known about the signaling zzso activated by zzso the molecules involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso remained zzso Using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso in combination with zzso and zzso methods, recently we have obtained evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso effect of zzso in the zzso nervous zzso Here we first tested the hypothesis that zzso plays an important role in the formation of robust zzso after zzso classical zzso zzso Application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso around the time of zzso training with zzso zzso and zzso blocked zzso zzso suggesting that in this zzso zzso conditioning paradigm the zzso of zzso by zzso was necessary for zzso to zzso We found that in a zzso zzso zzso conditioning zzso lip touch paired with zzso memory formation was also dependent on zzso zzso systemic application of zzso at the beginning of zzso tactile conditioning accelerated the formation of zzso zzso Our findings provide the first evidence to show that in the same nervous system zzso is both necessary and zzso for fast and robust memory formation after reward classical zzso
