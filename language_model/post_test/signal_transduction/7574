zzso signaling in the zzso is crucial in energy zzso We have previously shown that dietary deprivation of the essential zzso acid zzso in mice stimulates fat loss by increasing energy zzso The involvement of zzso signaling in this regulation, however, has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso deprivation promotes zzso signaling in mice maintained on an otherwise normal diet and restores zzso responses in mice maintained on a high fat diet, a regimen known to induce zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso deprivation zzso energy zzso and fat loss was largely blocked in zzso mice zzso for a zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso mouse line zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso transcript 3 zzso Overall, our studies describe a novel link between zzso zzso signaling and stimulation of energy expenditure under zzso zzso
