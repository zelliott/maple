zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso provoke a zzso cardiac zzso signal through a common scaffolding protein termed tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 2 zzso however, zzso signaling in the adult zzso cardiac zzso is not fully zzso This study was aimed to identify the effect of zzso on cardiac zzso and the underlying zzso A significant zzso of zzso expression was observed in mice failing zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in cardiac zzso we used cultured zzso rat zzso with gain and loss of zzso function and zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso positively regulated zzso II zzso zzso zzso growth, as detected by zzso zzso cardiac zzso area, and zzso marker protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso was produced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice and their zzso zzso The extent of cardiac zzso was evaluated by zzso as well as by pathological and molecular analyses of heart zzso zzso zzso in the heart remarkably enhanced cardiac zzso left zzso dysfunction in mice in response to zzso Further analysis of the signaling zzso in zzso and in zzso suggested that these adverse effects of zzso were associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso serves as a novel zzso that enhanced cardiac zzso by zzso zzso zzso
