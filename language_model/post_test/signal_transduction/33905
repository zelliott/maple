zzso junctions mediate zzso and communication between adjoining zzso Although formed by different zzso tight junctions zzso and zzso junctions zzso are functionally and structurally linked, but the zzso pathways behind this interaction are zzso Here we describe a zzso mechanism of zzso between these two types of zzso We show that zzso zzso at zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso adhesive protein zzso This effect requires the release of the zzso activity of zzso box factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts by inducing the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and by limiting the zzso of zzso to the zzso These results offer a molecular basis for the link between zzso and zzso and explain why zzso zzso may cause a marked increase in zzso
