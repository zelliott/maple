Vitamin E zzso supplementation has been tested as prophylaxis against zzso disorders associated with zzso zzso However, recent evidence showing that high maternal zzso intake can adversely affect offspring development raises concerns on the safety of vitamin E zzso during zzso Besides acting as an zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso cell signaling through zzso protein zzso C zzso a zzso that is deeply involved in neural maturation and zzso zzso effects of zzso loads in the maturing brain, where zzso zzso is associated to zzso zzso are poorly zzso Here, zzso doses of zzso were fed to pregnant and zzso zzso to evaluate the effects on zzso signaling and zzso maturation in offspring zzso zzso showed that maternal supplementation zzso zzso zzso incorporation in offspring and leads to marked decrease of zzso zzso throughout zzso zzso accompanied by reduced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso C zzso zzso two zzso zzso involved in neural development and zzso Although processes of zzso zzso zzso formation and targeting appeared zzso offspring of supplemented mothers displayed a marked reduction of long-term synaptic plasticity in juvenile zzso Interestingly, this impairment persisted in adulthood, when a deficit in zzso long-lasting spatial memory was also zzso In conclusion, maternal supplementation with elevated doses of zzso can influence cell signaling and synaptic plasticity in developing zzso and promotes permanent adverse effects in adult zzso The present results emphasize the need to evaluate the safety of zzso maternal intake of zzso in zzso
