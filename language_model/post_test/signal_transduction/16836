zzso development is recognized as a major zzso factor underlying most chronic bacterial zzso When a zzso community is established, zzso cells growing in the surroundings of a tissue switch to a zzso lifestyle and start producing a zzso zzso The initial steps of in zzso zzso development are poorly characterized and difficult to assess zzso A great amount of in zzso evidence has shown that zzso of high levels of zzso zzso zzso is the most prevalent hallmark governing the initiation of zzso development by zzso As mentioned above, recent studies also link detection of zzso by host cells with the zzso of a type I zzso immune response against bacterial zzso We discuss here zzso signaling and the host immune response in the context of the initial steps of in zzso zzso zzso
