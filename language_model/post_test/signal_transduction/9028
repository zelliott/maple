Animals cope with environmental changes by altering behavioral zzso Environmental information is generally received by sensory zzso in the neural circuit that generates zzso However, although environmental temperature inevitably influences an zzso entire body, the mechanism of systemic temperature perception remains largely zzso We show here that systemic temperature signaling zzso a change in a zzso behavior in zzso zzso During behavioral zzso zzso cells as well as zzso cells respond to zzso temperature through a zzso zzso factor that drives newly identified gene expression zzso This systemic temperature signaling regulates zzso zzso zzso through the zzso signaling pathway, producing zzso zzso We provide a link between systemic environmental recognition and behavioral plasticity in the nervous zzso
