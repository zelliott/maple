Systems biology at the molecular level is concerned with networks of interacting zzso their structure, and dynamic response to zzso that give rise to zzso properties that determine zzso zzso zzso At any time, in any cell, multiple types of molecular networks are zzso zzso One of the most important known regulatory systems in zzso cells is zzso protein zzso zzso by protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso it is essential to understand and eventually model the protein zzso informational zzso in cells from sensors and signaling systems to zzso zzso to zzso analyze the dynamic system of zzso and their zzso and to determine the basic rules of information processing in zzso In this chapter, we describe the protocols necessary to zzso and zzso measure the zzso informational networks in zzso The pipeline relies on the selective, quantitative isolation of zzso generated by the zzso zzso of complex protein zzso and their subsequent mass zzso and zzso zzso We believe that the protocols and data processing tools described in this chapter will be a valuable resource for biologists interested in the analysis of protein zzso signal zzso
