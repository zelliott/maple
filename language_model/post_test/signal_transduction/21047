In chronic zzso C, zzso expression is zzso in the zzso especially near zzso zzso and zzso zzso is expressed on the zzso The presence of zzso C virus zzso zzso has been demonstrated both in peripheral blood and among zzso zzso of patients with chronic zzso zzso We studied the killing mechanisms of zzso human zzso using target cells that were sensitive or resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso We show that zzso zzso clones kill zzso bystander cells as well as zzso cells, although the bystander killing is less efficient than the specific target cell killing, and the efficacy of the bystander killing of zzso and soluble zzso cells is greater than that of resistant zzso We also show that the killing of zzso sensitive cells is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso although the latter plays a major role in the killing at a low zzso ratio, and that the killing of sensitive bystander cells is primarily zzso by zzso zzso and zzso on zzso expressed upon specific zzso zzso which may be relevant to the bystander zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso expression is zzso zzso zzso also kill bystander cells by the zzso zzso although it requires a high zzso zzso The effective bystander killing requires a close zzso contact between zzso and target cells, although zzso released from the zzso mediates zzso of the bystander cells without a close zzso zzso
