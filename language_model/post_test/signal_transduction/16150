zzso comprise two zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane receptors zzso and zzso originally identified for binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso Growth zzso (in association with zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated with opposite functions in zzso either as putative tumor zzso and zzso factors, or zzso zzso zzso invasion and zzso Moreover, due to their implication in zzso zzso zzso regulate vascular development and tumor zzso Recent evidence further suggests a role of zzso in cancer progression due to their interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso have been implicated in response to additional growth factors, such as zzso Growth zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these data seem to qualify zzso as signaling platforms on the cell surface, potentially capable of regulating cancer cells, as well as cells of the tumor zzso zzso zzso data often indicate a correlation between increased expression of zzso and advanced stage tumors with poor zzso In this article, we will review the current experimental evidence about the functional role of zzso in cancer and the underlying molecular zzso
