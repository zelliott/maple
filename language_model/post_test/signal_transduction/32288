Light zzso activates a range of cellular processes in a variety of cell types, including stem cells, and can promote tissue zzso This study investigated the effects of light-emitting zzso zzso exposure on dental pulp cells zzso zzso response analysis at zzso intervals up to 120 seconds demonstrated that a LED array emitting zzso red light zzso significantly increased cell growth at 3 and 7 days zzso with 40 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso seconds of radiant zzso zzso cells at days 1 and 4 of a zzso culture period with zzso zzso zzso LED exposure significantly increased cell growth compared with a single dosing zzso zzso analysis demonstrated significantly increased proliferation rates associated with significantly increased zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso NO levels were not reduced by zzso of zzso zzso Light exposure also rescued the zzso of zzso dysfunction and increased levels of in zzso zzso compared with zzso Media exchange experiments indicated that zzso signaling was not likely responsible for zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, data analysis indicated that zzso LED zzso promoted zzso responses relevant to tissue repair, and this is likely zzso by increased zzso zzso
