The zzso protein zzso zzso regulates cellular and zzso energy balance in response to changes in zzso charge and hormonal zzso zzso of zzso in zzso such as skeletal muscle and liver reverses many of the zzso defects associated with obesity and Type 2 zzso Here we report a zzso zzso that zzso activates all zzso zzso zzso in zzso except complexes containing the zzso zzso zzso does not directly activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and differs among other known direct zzso of zzso in that zzso zzso occurs only at low zzso zzso and is not influenced by either zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding sites or deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso has multiple modes of zzso zzso that may be exploited to design zzso zzso as potential zzso for zzso zzso
