The zzso hormone zzso interacts with key zzso circuits regulating energy balance and body zzso Here we provide evidence that the central zzso signaling system is required for alcohol zzso Central zzso administration (to brain zzso or to zzso areas involved in zzso increased alcohol intake in a zzso zzso free choice limited access paradigm in zzso By contrast, central or peripheral administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed alcohol intake in this zzso zzso locomotor zzso zzso zzso release and zzso place preference were abolished in models of suppressed central zzso zzso zzso knockout mice and mice treated with 2 different zzso zzso Thus, central zzso zzso via zzso not only stimulates the reward system, but is also required for stimulation of that system by zzso Our data suggest that central zzso signaling constitutes a potential target for treatment of alcohol-related zzso
