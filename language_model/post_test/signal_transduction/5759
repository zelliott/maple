We have shown previously that acute infection with the respiratory zzso pneumonia virus of mice zzso results in local production of the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso recruitment in response to zzso infection is reduced dramatically in zzso zzso zzso 

In this work, we demonstrate that zzso zzso recruitment is coordinated by zzso zzso zzso recruitment in response to zzso infection was diminished zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice, although zzso from zzso zzso mice expressed transcripts for the zzso zzso zzso and responded functionally to zzso ex zzso Similarly, in the absence of zzso infection, zzso zzso alone could not elicit zzso recruitment in the absence of zzso Interestingly, although supplemental zzso restored zzso recruitment and resulted in a sustained weight loss among zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso recruitment alone did not result in the pulmonary zzso or respiratory failure characteristic of severe viral infection, suggesting that zzso and zzso together are sufficient to promote zzso recruitment but not zzso zzso 

Our findings reveal a zzso zzso zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso which demonstrate that zzso is crucial for zzso zzso recruitment in zzso
