zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso C zzso processes in human zzso was found to be a potent inhibitor of human zzso zzso zzso zzso by structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and vitamin zzso protein release from zzso exposed to zzso zzso human zzso zzso B4 and zzso zzso zzso of the respiratory burst, as measured by zzso zzso production, in zzso zzso with these zzso was also suppressed by zzso These data suggested that zzso inhibited a component of signal zzso that was common to the mechanisms of action of these zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the rise in the zzso free calcium zzso which are early zzso events in zzso zzso were all suppressed in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso These signal zzso events require zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso isolated from zzso was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso however, had no direct effect on zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a close analog of zzso that does not suppress zzso activity, did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, is a novel zzso that is useful in investigating zzso function in zzso zzso zzso
