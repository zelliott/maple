Members of the zzso family function in various processes of innate zzso particularly in controlling important steps in zzso trafficking and zzso zzso zzso is a member of this family of zzso and we have found that zzso is expressed by zzso and regulates their recruitment to the zzso We hypothesized that zzso regulates other key zzso responses, such as zzso zzso Furthermore, we hypothesized that these zzso changes in zzso polarization would alter zzso responses in the zzso We examined the gene expression changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso to promote zzso and zzso cells, zzso We also collected zzso from the lungs of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice to evaluate changes in zzso zzso Lastly, we evaluated the zzso polarization zzso during zzso pulmonary zzso in zzso and zzso mice and assessed mice for differences in weight loss and total collagen zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso function and zzso zzso zzso In both in zzso models, we found deficits in zzso polarization in zzso zzso In zzso lung injury, these changes were associated with reduced zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso Loss of zzso results in reduced zzso polarization and protection from zzso zzso These findings highlight a novel role for zzso in zzso biology and pulmonary zzso
