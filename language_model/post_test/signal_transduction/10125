The vascular zzso plays a crucial role in regulating normal blood vessel zzso The gene products responsible are commonly expressed exclusively, or zzso in this cell zzso However, despite the importance of regulated gene expression in the vascular zzso relatively little is known about the mechanisms that restrict zzso gene expression to this cell zzso While significant progress has been made towards understanding the regulation of zzso genes through zzso zzso it has become apparent that additional mechanisms must also be zzso For example, zzso mechanisms, including zzso DNA zzso patterns and zzso zzso zzso have recently been demonstrated to play important roles in the zzso expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso This review investigates the involvement of zzso regulatory mechanisms in vascular zzso zzso gene expression using zzso as a zzso model, and will address the possible contributions of these pathways to diseases of the zzso
