zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is critical for skin wound zzso The mechanism remains zzso We report here that zzso growth zzso zzso is the major zzso factor in human serum for zzso zzso on type I zzso zzso zzso the full zzso activity of human serum and zzso zzso zzso completely block zzso Although collagen zzso zzso zzso migration without growth factors, zzso migration depends upon attachment of the cells to a collagen zzso The zzso role is to provide zzso and further enhancement for the zzso zzso zzso To study the collagen and zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso we establish zzso zzso plus zzso gene delivery approach, in which groups of genes are studied individually or in combination for their roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are grouped into an upstream zzso gene zzso and the four major zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5) are grouped into a downstream zzso gene zzso The experiments demonstrate 1) the zzso individual roles and zzso 2) their combined effects and zzso and 3) the mechanisms of their zzso connections in zzso migration driven by collagen and zzso
