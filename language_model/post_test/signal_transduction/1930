zzso gene expression mediates many aspects of neural zzso including long-term zzso In the prevailing view, patterned synaptic activity causes zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with appropriate zzso zzso then zzso zzso a group of zzso zzso zzso factors and, eventually, zzso proteins that establish or consolidate synaptic zzso Here, using a zzso model zzso we zzso cellular functions and regulation of the best known immediate early zzso factor, zzso a zzso of the basic zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso We observe that zzso positively regulates both synaptic strength and zzso number, thus showing a greater range of influence than zzso Observations from genetic zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso acts upstream of zzso regulates levels of zzso zzso zzso and functions at the top of the hierarchy of zzso factors known to regulate long-term zzso A zzso zzso module provides a zzso route for zzso zzso zzso thus, zzso regulation of zzso expression may, in some zzso constitute a positive feedback loop rather than the primary step in zzso zzso
