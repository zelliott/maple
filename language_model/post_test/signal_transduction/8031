zzso one of a family of large zzso zzso zzso factors, is zzso in human zzso zzso disorders that include zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior segment zzso zzso early in the developing lens zzso it is central to regulation of lens zzso gene zzso We report a zzso mouse zzso zzso recovered after zzso zzso which results in the zzso zzso at a highly zzso zzso within the zzso 35 zzso minimal zzso domain zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso which cause severe zzso and zzso zzso the zzso caused by the zzso zzso is isolated zzso In reporter zzso zzso results in increased promoter zzso a situation similar to zzso zzso of zzso that also cause human zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein is not inhibited by protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso of large zzso proteins has been shown to interact with the zzso zzso zzso and we demonstrate that zzso zzso enhances zzso recruitment in a zzso dependent zzso We observed the same for the zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso which suggests a common mechanism of zzso
