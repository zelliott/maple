zzso is a zzso factor which acts as a master regulator zzso oxygen zzso An oxygen sensitive signal controlling zzso is provided by zzso zzso reactions which require molecular oxygen and modify specific zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso a zzso These act as zzso enabling capture by a specific zzso zzso and preventing zzso zzso An important challenge is to understand how this simple principle is used to tailor the oxygen response system to the diverse settings that occur in complex organisms such as zzso The emerging picture is of many parameters which are likely to zzso including zzso availability and regulated expression of the zzso zzso
