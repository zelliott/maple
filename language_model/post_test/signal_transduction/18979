zzso is an essential seed zzso mechanism in wild zzso It is believed that independent zzso at zzso zzso led to zzso zzso of cereal zzso To investigate genetic relationships of zzso shattering genes with those of other zzso we mapped zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in wheat and its wild zzso The zzso gene for zzso zzso was mapped to a region zzso by zzso and zzso on the short arm of zzso 3A in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso at zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was mapped to an zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso on the long arm of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso donor of common zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are governed by two different zzso zzso on zzso zzso Based on map position, zzso of zzso and zzso were not detected in zzso zzso rice, and zzso indicating multiple genetic pathways for shattering in zzso The implications of the mapping results are discussed with regard to the evolution of zzso wheat and zzso of zzso
