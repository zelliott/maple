The zzso of infections with zzso zzso is increasing zzso zzso have been implicated in the recognition of pathogens and the initiation of an adequate innate immune zzso We here sought to determine the roles of zzso the common zzso protein involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in host defense against zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice demonstrated an impaired early response to zzso zzso zzso as reflected by higher bacterial loads in zzso fluid and liver accompanied by a markedly attenuated zzso influx into the abdominal zzso In zzso not only zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed a reduced responsiveness to zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso rendered human embryonic kidney zzso cells responsive to zzso zzso which was enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice showed higher bacterial loads in zzso fluid after in zzso infection with zzso zzso and a diminished influx of zzso whereas zzso zzso mice had an zzso host zzso zzso zzso zzso and killing were not affected by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not play a role in the immune response to zzso zzso in zzso or in zzso These data suggest that zzso contributes to the effective clearance of zzso zzso during zzso at least in part via zzso and by zzso zzso recruitment to the site of the zzso
