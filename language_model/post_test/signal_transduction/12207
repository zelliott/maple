The identification of the factors that allow better monitoring of stem cell renewal and differentiation is of paramount importance for the zzso of new zzso therapies, especially with regard to the nervous and zzso zzso In this article, we present new information on the function of zinc finger protein 191 zzso a factor isolated in zzso cell lines, within zzso of the central nervous system zzso zzso has been found to be principally expressed in zzso of the developing zzso of humans and zzso Such an overlap of the expression patterns in addition to the high zzso of the protein in zzso suggested that zzso exerts a zzso function within such zzso Indeed, zzso zzso in human neural zzso zzso proliferation and leads to the exit of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains zzso in cycle and exerts negative control on the zzso pathway, which prevents them from zzso The present data, together with the fact that the zzso of zzso leads to embryonic zzso confirm zzso as an essential factor acting for the promotion of the cell cycle and thus maintenance in the zzso zzso On the bases of expression data, such a function can be extended to zzso cells of other zzso such as the zzso system, which emphasizes the important issue of further understanding the molecular events controlled by zzso
