zzso cell responses during inflammation are zzso and key for selectivity in how zzso zzso in on specific sites and why vascular diseases are highly bed zzso However, mechanisms for this specificity remain zzso 

Here, we exposed human zzso cells isolated from 5 systemic zzso beds from 1 donor (to overcome zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso to zzso zzso and zzso and assessed acute zzso and zzso and chronic zzso zzso total and surface zzso signaling responses and assessed changes in surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso diversity in responses was evident by disparate changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso which varied up to zzso between different cells and in zzso and magnitude differences in zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso induction typically being observed by 4 hours, whereas zzso expression was increased further at 24 hours relative to 4 zzso zzso profiles both zzso and with stimulation were also bed specific, with zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in surface zzso expression tracked with dynamic zzso or zzso of zzso activity during zzso 

These results demonstrate a critical role for the vascular bed of origin in controlling zzso responses and function to inflammatory stimuli and suggest that zzso expression of zzso zzso may provide a signature for select zzso zzso
