The activity of the zzso zzso family of zzso B site binding proteins is regulated by I zzso B zzso The zzso repeat motif identified I zzso B family members, which include I zzso B alpha zzso I zzso B zzso and zzso directly associated with zzso B site binding zzso resulting in specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso We report that I zzso B zzso containing eight zzso repeats, mediates a zzso zzso of zzso complex but cannot zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso B alpha and zzso on the other hand, can zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso B alpha specifically zzso zzso or zzso complexes but requires the zzso 37 zzso acids in addition to the zzso repeat zzso Human zzso protein specifically zzso zzso zzso Because I zzso B alpha and zzso can zzso zzso zzso or zzso complexes, respectively, we propose that they can act as zzso or zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso
