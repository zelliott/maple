Nuclear zzso zzso a survival signal induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso contributes substantially to the resistance to zzso cell zzso Previous studies suggest that heat shock protein 90 zzso regulates the stability and function of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso the key components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we showed that the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was synergistic with zzso to induce zzso cell death in a panel of lung zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso caused degradation of zzso and zzso that, in turn, blocked zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The synergistic zzso was detected only when zzso treatment followed zzso zzso zzso the zzso of cell death was abolished in zzso cells that express a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso seen with zzso and zzso treatment results from blocking zzso zzso zzso The other components of the zzso zzso I signaling cascade were not altered, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A similar zzso for inducing zzso was also observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a key role in the resistance of lung cancer cells to zzso and TRAIL and that disabling this survival signal with zzso followed by zzso or TRAIL treatment could be an effective new therapeutic strategy for lung zzso
