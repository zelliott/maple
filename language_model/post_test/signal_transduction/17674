zzso tubes expand by tip growth and extend zzso toward the zzso to deliver zzso during zzso They provide an excellent model system for the study of cell polarity control and tip growth, because they grow into zzso shaped zzso cells in zzso zzso underlying tip growth are poorly understood in zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a central regulator of zzso tube tip zzso Recent studies in zzso from zzso and other species have revealed a zzso zzso network that is localized to the zzso PM region of zzso zzso The results provide evidence that the zzso of this zzso network establishes the site for tip growth and the localized zzso of this zzso network regulates the dynamics of tip zzso These results have shown that the zzso dynamics of tip zzso is a key cellular mechanism behind tip growth in zzso zzso Current understanding of the molecular basis for the regulation of the tip zzso dynamics will be zzso
