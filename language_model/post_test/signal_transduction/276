In zzso multiple signaling pathways zzso in the nucleus to regulate the expression of genes associated with long-term structural changes of zzso zzso Of pivotal importance for this type of zzso regulation is zzso zzso Several studies suggest that the nuclear transport of proteins from zzso is involved in this signaling process, including evidence that zzso contain proteins with nuclear zzso sequences and components of the nuclear import zzso Here, we review the evidence for zzso signaling by means of retrograde transport of proteins from zzso zzso We discuss the mechanisms involved in their zzso and their role in the control of nuclear gene zzso Finally, we zzso the current thinking regarding the functional implications of nuclear signaling and address open questions in this evolving area of zzso
