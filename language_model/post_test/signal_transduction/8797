Analysis of our own results and data published over the last two decades supports the zzso hypothesis of the zzso origin and zzso mechanism of appearance of zzso systems in higher zzso zzso of the zzso organization of these information systems and their component blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity, protein zzso zzso in bacteria and zzso revealed a whole series of similar characteristics pointing to evolutionary zzso This led to the conclusion that zzso signal systems have zzso zzso In terms of their architecture and functional properties, the signal zzso systems seen in zzso zzso represent a transitional stage in the evolution of zzso systems between zzso and higher zzso The propagation of zzso systems in three zzso - zzso zzso and zzso - occurred by horizontal transfer of bacterial genes and the zzso of the components of these zzso
