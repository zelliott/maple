zzso zzso C activity was detected in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso the particulate fraction contained a much smaller proportion of the zzso zzso zzso C activity was increased in the membrane fraction and decreased in the zzso after exposure of intact cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by a zzso concentration of zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso C zzso revealed that the protein zzso zzso zzso is expressed in rat zzso zzso Other zzso zzso were not zzso Further, zzso stimulation caused the zzso of protein zzso zzso from zzso to a membrane zzso zzso may promote zzso zzso cell activity, including zzso zzso by increasing the affinity of protein zzso zzso for the membrane zzso presumably via a rise in zzso and zzso derived from zzso zzso
