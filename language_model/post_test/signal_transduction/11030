In order to explore a new special and effective way to prevent graft versus host disease zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso the stem cell zzso zzso + early zzso cells zzso from zzso mouse zzso were introduced with zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso gene by the zzso gene transfer and expanded for one week, and then they were zzso with the zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso mouse zzso as one way mixed zzso reaction zzso The zzso of treated zzso mouse zzso against zzso zzso labeling zzso from zzso mouse was zzso The bone zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso mouse treated by the above methods were transplanted into zzso zzso zzso mice to observe the occurrence of zzso The results showed that the zzso from zzso mouse after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso mouse in a ratio of 1 to 5 exhibited an obvious zzso of the zzso against the zzso mouse zzso cells at different zzso ratios as compared to the control group zzso The grade I zzso or no zzso and the zzso survival rate at day 60 zzso were observed in the zzso mouse receiving zzso mouse zzso treated with similar way, while the grade II - III zzso and the zzso survival rate were noted in the control group zzso It is suggested that the zzso of zzso in zzso recipient could be successfully achieved through zzso zzso in an zzso zzso disparate mouse zzso
