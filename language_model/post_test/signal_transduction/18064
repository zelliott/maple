A member of the G zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the two other zzso hormone receptors are distinguished from the other members by the presence of a relatively large zzso zzso domain that is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 of zzso is zzso with an extended face containing only zzso side chains and another containing both zzso and polar side chains with potential hydrogen bond donor and zzso zzso Since several reports have shown the importance of this zzso in zzso zzso we have used Ala scanning zzso to study eight zzso acid zzso of rat zzso that are zzso in the three zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The wild type zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells for characterization by human zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso No differences were detected in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso production relative to zzso zzso but three categories of zzso zzso were distinguished from zzso zzso based upon their expression levels and responsiveness to zzso 1) comparable or higher expression but reduced zzso responsiveness zzso and zzso 2) reduced expression and zzso responsiveness zzso and zzso and 3) comparable expression and responsiveness zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were comparable to zzso zzso in zzso zzso To provide more information on zzso and zzso a total of 12 replacements were zzso Of considerable interest and potential significance was the finding that many of the replacements in zzso resulted in either loss of function zzso zzso zzso zzso or gain of function zzso and zzso this being the first evidence of a position in zzso that, depending upon the nature of the zzso acid zzso can result in zzso zzso and/or diminished responsiveness to zzso The results of molecular modeling and energy zzso of zzso 6 and 7, based on a zzso interaction between zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso zzso indicated that, while there is not a correlation between function and predicted energies of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of one or both zzso is responsible for the functional changes zzso zzso interactions of zzso 3 and 4 and of 5 and 6 were suggested by molecular zzso Ten zzso were prepared of two zzso acid zzso that are zzso in the zzso hormone receptors and have side chain hydrogen bond donor and zzso function, zzso in zzso 3 and zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso signaling were reduced in most of the zzso zzso but none of these exhibited zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is not critical for zzso function, while zzso appears to be particularly important in zzso folding and/or zzso The results reported zzso indicate an important role for zzso 7, and particularly zzso and zzso in the process of zzso zzso Moreover, these two zzso although in close proximity to each other in zzso 7, are quite distinct in function as evidenced by certain replacements that can lead to loss of function in one and gain of function in the zzso
