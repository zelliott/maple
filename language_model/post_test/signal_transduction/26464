zzso zzso T cells zzso contain virus infections through the release of zzso containing both zzso and zzso T cell zzso is a hallmark of chronic persistent viral infections including zzso The zzso regulatory zzso T cell zzso and zzso domain containing 3 zzso is induced on zzso T cells in chronic progressive zzso These zzso expressing T cells are dysfunctional in terms of their capacities to zzso or to produce zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso expression on the zzso capabilities of zzso T cells in the context of zzso zzso We investigated the zzso capacity of zzso expressing T cells by examining 1) the ability of zzso zzso T cells to make zzso and 2) the direct ability of zzso zzso T cells to kill zzso zzso infected zzso target zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso T cells maintain higher levels of zzso which was mainly in a zzso zzso zzso as well as express high levels of zzso However, these cells were also defective in their ability to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso capabilities of zzso specific zzso T cells from chronic zzso by zzso a) their zzso capacity, b) their ability to release zzso c) their ability to target activated zzso B to zzso zzso expressing zzso T cells and zzso their ability to suppress zzso infection of zzso T zzso In this latter effect, blocking the zzso zzso enhances the zzso of zzso T cells from chronic zzso to the level very close to that of T cells from viral zzso Thus, the zzso zzso in addition to acting as a zzso for zzso producing and zzso functions of zzso can also zzso the zzso T cell zzso function through zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
