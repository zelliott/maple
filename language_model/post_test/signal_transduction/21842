Administration of zzso to rats reproduces many features of Parkinson's disease, including zzso zzso zzso and provides a useful model to study the zzso of Parkinson's zzso However, the cell death mechanisms induced by zzso and potential zzso mechanisms against zzso are not well zzso Here we report that zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells is attenuated by zzso with several growth factors, most notably basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso activated both zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso protected against zzso whereas zzso of either zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso protein zzso death protein zzso by small interfering zzso rendered zzso cells resistant to zzso implicating BAD in zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso induced a long-lasting zzso of BAD at zzso zzso suggesting BAD zzso through the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, primary cultured zzso zzso from zzso were more sensitive to zzso cell death than zzso zzso in the same zzso The loss of zzso zzso was blocked by zzso an zzso dependent on zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso cell death requires BAD and identify zzso and its zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways as novel intervention strategies to block cell death in the zzso model of Parkinson's zzso
