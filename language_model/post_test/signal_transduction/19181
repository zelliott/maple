zzso is an evolutionary zzso zzso process involved in several zzso and pathological processes such as cancer and zzso zzso initiation signaling requires both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso core complex to generate zzso zzso zzso that transfer cellular contents to zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso complex is zzso to the zzso through an interaction between the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso light chains zzso When zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso releasing the zzso core complex from zzso Its subsequent zzso to the zzso zzso enables zzso zzso zzso zzso constitutes a direct regulatory link between zzso and zzso zzso which is required for core complex positioning and activity within the zzso Moreover, our results demonstrate that in addition to a function for zzso in zzso zzso zzso there is a strict and regulatory relationship between zzso dynamics and zzso zzso
