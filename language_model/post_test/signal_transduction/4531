T cell zzso and zzso domain zzso is a newly identified zzso expressed on T cells that binds to zzso on the zzso cell surface, driving them to a more zzso zzso Given that zzso contains an zzso motif in its zzso domain and considering the potential importance of the zzso zzso in human zzso disease, we investigated the specific role of zzso in human zzso T zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate a direct zzso effect on T cell proliferation with a decrease in expression of zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor 4, and zzso zzso orphan zzso c with zzso of zzso production, predominantly zzso zzso of zzso expression by short hairpin zzso resulted in an increase of both zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression with zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso could be overcome by blocking zzso zzso indicating that zzso exerts zzso effects by competing with zzso for the same zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso can inhibit T cell functions by competing with zzso and can also directly inhibit T cells in a T zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for a novel role of this alternative zzso zzso in regulating human T cell responses associated with zzso zzso
