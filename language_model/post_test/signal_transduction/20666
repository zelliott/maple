The zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso zzso plays a critical scaffolding role in T cell zzso zzso zzso As an zzso protein that contains multiple zzso zzso zzso interacts with many signaling molecules and links zzso zzso stimulation to downstream zzso The function of zzso in zzso signaling has been widely studied using the zzso human zzso T cell line through protein disruption or zzso zzso However, a zzso characterization of zzso zzso events is still zzso zzso profiling of over a hundred zzso zzso sites revealed new modes of regulation of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso while zzso previously established regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The absence of zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently a large number of zzso signaling zzso zzso our data suggests unique modes of regulation of positive and negative feedback pathways in T cells by zzso zzso its central role in the zzso
