While both zzso and zzso are essential to generating the full zzso of zzso signals emanating from the zzso complex, thus far, modeling the zzso and spatial involvement of zzso has been zzso The absence of a binding partner, analogous to the role of zzso in targeting zzso zzso of structure, common modes of zzso and overlapping zzso zzso support the conclusion that many aspects of their roles may be zzso Whether or how their functions are coordinated remains zzso Recent experiments incorporating membrane zzso towards resolving the distinct roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cellular zzso demonstrate that the membrane zzso termed zzso zzso function to segregate the two zzso in zzso primary cells, and offers resolution in modeling their zzso contributions to the zzso zzso zzso Their zzso while zzso is temporally and zzso zzso zzso zzso is upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso predicting the existence of distinct zzso specific regulatory mechanisms operating in zzso zzso Thus, more than merely vehicles supporting protein zzso these zzso provide an environment in which the regulation of zzso activities is coupled to and regulated by a zzso coordination of protein zzso subsequent to zzso zzso
