zzso promotes acute allergic asthma and is discussed to play a role in late zzso features such as zzso processes and airway zzso The contributions of zzso mechanisms to zzso events related to zzso are not yet zzso 

We investigated the impact of zzso on lung zzso cells as zzso zzso and on lung zzso as zzso of zzso gene zzso 

Using the two lung zzso cell lines zzso and zzso as well as primary lung zzso cells, we investigated the capability of zzso to induce zzso by both zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to increase the expression of zzso genes and to exert influence on the expression of its own zzso was investigated by real-time quantitative zzso measurement of zzso zzso collagen I, collagen III, basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain in human primary lung zzso The specificity of zzso cellular responses was confirmed by means of an zzso zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso cell lines as well as in primary lung zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increases the expression of zzso for zzso and collagen III, but not for zzso in human primary lung zzso The zzso of lung zzso to zzso zzso of zzso genes is associated with the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects could be inhibited by zzso blockade of the zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate a function of zzso as a zzso in zzso processes leading to loss of functional airway tissue in zzso They also highlight the therapeutic potential of specifically targeting the interaction between zzso and its zzso
