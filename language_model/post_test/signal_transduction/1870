zzso decline in survival and zzso with advancing age is caused by damage to zzso and zzso zzso is not a programmed process, in the sense that no genes are known to have evolved specifically to cause damage and zzso zzso of zzso might therefore not be expected to be as highly zzso between zzso related organisms as are mechanisms of development and zzso However, evidence is mounting that zzso of the rate of zzso are zzso over large evolutionary zzso As we discuss in this review, this conservation might stem from mechanisms that match zzso rate to zzso zzso
