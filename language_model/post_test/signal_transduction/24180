zzso among cell surface molecules capable of initiating zzso are members of the zzso necrosis factor zzso family of zzso and zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso family each contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso interaction motif critical for engaging downstream components of the signal zzso zzso Following zzso of these receptors by their zzso zzso a zzso zzso complex zzso is formed by recruitment of zzso zzso proteins to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso pairs are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A more recently identified member of the zzso zzso family is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso in a number of zzso cell lines, yet is relatively zzso to normal zzso zzso with its lack of zzso TRAIL is zzso expressed in many human zzso This raises the conundrum of why zzso cells are sensitive to zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso One possibility lies in the existence of a family of four zzso TRAIL receptors zzso which although able to bind zzso differ in their ability to zzso the death zzso Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged based on poor correlations between TRAIL zzso expression and TRAIL zzso This suggests that other factors, such as zzso zzso zzso or death zzso including zzso are involved in determining differential sensitivity to zzso We have investigated TRAIL sensitivity in primary zzso cells together with zzso zzso pathways in both sensitive and resistant cell zzso Our results and their implications for the potential use of TRAIL in cancer therapy are zzso
