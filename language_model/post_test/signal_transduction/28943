zzso stimulation is one of the many signals that can activate zzso and we have recently shown it to have a unique function in generating maximum primary zzso T cell zzso However, whether zzso signaling plays a role in memory zzso T cell responses is still not completely zzso In this study, we show that in the absence of zzso on all zzso or specifically on zzso cells, memory zzso T cells are generated but at significantly reduced zzso This reduction is due to a contribution of zzso at several different steps in the generation of zzso zzso In the initial T cell response, zzso contributes to maximizing not only the number of zzso cells that are generated but also the programming of ones that will differentiate into zzso zzso zzso is needed to maintain zzso numbers of the committed memory cells in a manner that is independent of the zzso zzso Finally, when memory zzso T cells are zzso there is a variable requirement for zzso depending on whether zzso or zzso zzso cells were present during the primary zzso zzso zzso signaling on zzso plays an important role in all zzso of a memory zzso T cell zzso
