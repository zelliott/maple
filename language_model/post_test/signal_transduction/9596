The vulnerability of some cancer cells to zzso signals is a therapeutic target for the rational design of new zzso zzso In addition to their well characterized effects on cell division, many zzso zzso agents can induce zzso stress by modulating levels of zzso oxygen species zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are particularly sensitive to zzso stress as they typically have persistently higher levels of zzso than normal cells due to the zzso of zzso balance that develops in cancer cells in response to increased zzso production of zzso or depletion of zzso zzso In addition, excess zzso levels potentially contribute to zzso by the mediation of zzso DNA zzso There are several zzso agents in development that target cellular zzso zzso The overall cellular zzso state is regulated by three systems that zzso cellular zzso status by zzso free zzso and zzso or by reversing the formation of zzso two of these are dependent on zzso and the third on zzso Drugs targeting zzso have direct zzso effects via cell zzso pathways and zzso of DNA repair, and have an impact on a wide range of zzso zzso Of these agents, zzso and zzso have been assessed in phase III trials, while a number of others are undergoing evaluation in early phase clinical zzso zzso agents including zzso zzso and zzso zzso are being developed to target zzso which is zzso in many human zzso and this zzso is associated with aggressive zzso growth and poorer clinical zzso Finally, zzso derivatives have demonstrated zzso activity including zzso and zzso effects on cancer cells by zzso mechanisms, and the induction of high levels of zzso stress and zzso by an as yet undefined zzso In this article we review zzso drugs currently in development that target cellular zzso activity to treat zzso
