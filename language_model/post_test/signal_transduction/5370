zzso zzso zzso is a chronic inflammatory skin zzso zzso 50% of adult zzso patients have zzso zzso zzso to the skin zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso skin barrier in zzso it is likely that zzso can come into contact with mast cells, which are known to be involved in zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso zzso can activate mast zzso Bone zzso mast cells zzso were generated from wild type, zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice and zzso with zzso zzso zzso We recorded that zzso zzso induced release of zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with three times higher levels in the latter type of zzso zzso zzso also responded by zzso as assessed by release of zzso increased zzso production through a zzso pathway, and activated zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and altered the zzso release zzso This zzso was independent of zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso production was dependent on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso extract can activate zzso and zzso mast cells to release inflammatory zzso to enhance the zzso zzso of mast cells, and to zzso zzso zzso and by signaling through the zzso zzso to modify the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso mast zzso zzso these findings indicate that zzso zzso can activate mast cells and might thus exacerbate the inflammatory response in zzso
