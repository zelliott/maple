zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in promoting differentiation in zzso zzso Our previous studies show that the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and differentiation via zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a protein complex with zzso A, zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso A, at the zzso junctions in response to elevated zzso zzso zzso A has the ability to interact directly with zzso zzso and zzso and mediate zzso signaling zzso 

This study was conducted to investigate the roles of zzso A and Trio in regulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso A and Trio in zzso was inhibited by zzso Its effects on zzso junction formation and zzso complex formation were evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and expression of zzso differentiation markers were also zzso The significance of the physical interactions of zzso A with Trio and zzso was assessed in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso A expression blocked the formation of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso A or Trio inhibited zzso membrane zzso and zzso of zzso A, formation of the zzso zzso complex, and zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso peptides disruptive to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions suppressed the formation of zzso zzso 

Through physical interactions with zzso Trio and zzso zzso A generates a scaffold for organizing a signaling complex that promotes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
