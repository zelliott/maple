This article describes the regulation of cell signaling by zzso zzso zzso zzso that control the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to their zzso zzso A structural model of the zzso that were previously called Type 2 zzso zzso is zzso zzso are characterized by having no zzso requirement and their zzso to zzso by zzso The zzso have six putative zzso zzso and three highly zzso zzso that define a zzso zzso The zzso zzso are juxtaposed to the proposed membrane spanning zzso such that they probably form the active sites of the zzso It is predicted that the active sites of the zzso are exposed at the cell surface or on the zzso surface of zzso zzso such as zzso or the zzso zzso depending where various zzso are zzso zzso could zzso cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In so doing, the zzso could generate alternative signals from zzso zzso and zzso The zzso might help to zzso cell signaling by the zzso D zzso For example, zzso generated within the cell by zzso D could be converted by an zzso to zzso This should change the relative balance of signaling by these two zzso Another possible function of the zzso relates to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by activated zzso and other zzso These zzso lipids activate zzso growth factor receptors on the surface of zzso zzso activities could zzso cell zzso by zzso and zzso zzso through their respective zzso
