The zzso and organization of zzso synaptic transmission require the coordinated interaction among zzso receptors and their synaptic zzso proteins closely assembled in the zzso density zzso Here we investigated the interaction between zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso in the integral regulation of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and gene expression in cultured rat zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso Interestingly, the synergistic increase in zzso zzso was dependent on the cross talk between zzso zzso synaptic zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso but not on the conventional zzso signaling derived from zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This was demonstrated by the findings that the synergistic zzso of zzso induced by zzso of zzso receptors and zzso was blocked by either a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso binding or small interfering zzso that selectively reduce cellular levels of zzso Furthermore, zzso activated through this zzso and zzso zzso was able to zzso the two key zzso factors zzso and zzso response zzso zzso which further leads to zzso of zzso zzso Together, we have identified a novel zzso signaling zzso to zzso by the synergistic interaction of zzso receptors and zzso via their zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso which zzso a zzso communication important for the zzso zzso
