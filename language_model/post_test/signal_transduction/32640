The activity of the zzso factor zzso can be modulated by members of the zzso family of small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bravo, zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) Genes zzso 11, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to the nucleus, triggering the zzso of the zzso promoter from the human zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso by zzso does not exclusively promote its nuclear zzso and binding to the specific zzso zzso zzso is also involved in the regulation of the zzso activity of the zzso serum response factor zzso since the zzso of a zzso promoter by zzso can be efficiently zzso by the double zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso We also present evidence that zzso and zzso zzso zzso cooperate with the zzso factor zzso in the zzso of the 4 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increases the levels of zzso zzso zzso the functional cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results strengthen the pivotal importance of the zzso family of small zzso in signal zzso pathways which zzso gene expression and reveal that zzso and zzso zzso factors are accessory proteins for the zzso regulation of the activity of the zzso
