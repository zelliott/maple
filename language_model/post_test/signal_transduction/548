Solar ultraviolet radiation zzso is the major zzso factor in skin zzso However, in zzso studies demonstrate that mice exposed to zzso and zzso exhibit significantly more tumors and zzso DNA damage than animals treated with either agent zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in the production of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso signaling may provide a basis for the enhanced zzso In this study zzso were zzso with zzso (3 zzso and then exposed to UVA (10 zzso We report that exposure to UVA after zzso zzso enhanced zzso production, zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of a zzso gene product, zzso zzso compared to either stimulus zzso zzso exposure resulted in rapid and transient zzso zzso zzso whereas the response to zzso was more pronounced and zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso production in zzso cells but had little impact on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were dependent upon zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate differences in the mechanisms of zzso production by zzso and UVA that may provide an underlying basis for the observed enhancement of zzso cellular responses upon combined UVA and zzso zzso
