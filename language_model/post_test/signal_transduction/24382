White zzso zzso zzso adapts to zzso zzso zzso by the development of short, densely clustered lateral roots called zzso (or zzso zzso In an effort to better understand the molecular events zzso these zzso responses, we have isolated and zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso from zzso libraries prepared with zzso isolated at different stages of zzso root zzso zzso of overlapping regions revealed zzso zzso zzso copy zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that compile to a total of zzso unique genes zzso zzso filter zzso with these zzso zzso from zzso roots were performed to evaluate global aspects of gene expression in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso roots compared with zzso and zzso normal roots include genes involved in carbon zzso secondary zzso P scavenging and zzso plant hormone zzso and signal zzso
