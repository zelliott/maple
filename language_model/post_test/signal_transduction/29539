zzso zzso zzso an zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties, has zzso effects on zzso metabolism in zzso zzso participating in overall zzso zzso These effects are exerted through specific receptors not associated with zzso an zzso zzso being a possible second zzso In rat zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso protein zzso C zzso and protein zzso 1 zzso has been shown to be involved in the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso We have investigated the role of zzso known or suggested to mediate the actions of insulin in the zzso increase in zzso zzso a activity in rat skeletal muscle zzso We first explored the effect of zzso compared with that of insulin, on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the action of specific zzso of these zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso The study showed that zzso like insulin, activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso (a zzso zzso reduced the zzso action of insulin on zzso zzso a activity and blocked that of zzso zzso (a zzso zzso did not affect the action of zzso but abolished that of insulin, zzso zzso zzso was ineffective on insulin but blocked the action of zzso zzso acid (a zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso (a zzso zzso were both ineffective on zzso but abolished the action of insulin, and zzso zzso (an inhibitor of some zzso zzso reduced the effect of zzso while completely preventing that of zzso It was concluded that zzso of zzso and zzso is required for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso a activity, while zzso although apparently zzso does not seem to play an essential zzso unlike in insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not seem to be needed in the action of zzso upon zzso zzso a activity in rat zzso
