zzso is known to be an important regulator of milk zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Here we examine the role of insulin signaling in zzso development in pregnancy using a mouse with a zzso insulin zzso zzso crossed with a mouse expressing zzso specifically in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso mice, expression of zzso is significantly diminished throughout zzso zzso from these mice had 50% fewer zzso at zzso zzso and zzso droplets were diminished by 60 and zzso respectively, indicating a role for zzso both in zzso development and zzso In an zzso preparation from zzso zzso cells zzso isolated from pregnant mice, insulin zzso zzso formation, zzso cell size, zzso size, zzso zzso content, and the formation of zzso droplets with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect at zzso below 50 zzso and a function blocking zzso to the zzso type 1 zzso did not alter the response to zzso We conclude that insulin interacting with zzso is essential for zzso differentiation during zzso zzso Using array analysis, we then examined the expression of genes zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso finding significant zzso of differentiation specific genes and zzso of cell cycle and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that insulin fosters differentiation and may inhibit cell proliferation in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
