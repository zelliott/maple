The zzso zzso zzso of response regulators is a critical element of many plant hormone signaling zzso We have recently shown that zzso signaling requires the zzso component of the related to zzso zzso protein modification zzso to promote the zzso degradation of the zzso response inhibitor zzso Here, we show that zzso also accumulates in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and leads to a marked resistance to zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso of feedback zzso such as zzso is essential for the maintenance of optimal zzso and plasticity in zzso zzso
