To test whether exposure to simulated zzso mobile phone signals zzso zzso 2 W zzso zzso influences the concentration of calcium or calcium zzso patterns in a human zzso cell zzso 

The zzso zzso energy was delivered via a zzso zzso to a zzso chamber where cells adherent to a thin glass zzso were zzso by laser scanning zzso zzso Cell calcium zzso estimated from zzso fluorescence, was monitored over two zzso periods; control followed by zzso with exposure status assigned in a blind and zzso zzso Both continuous wave zzso and zzso wave zzso zzso (on both zzso and zzso zzso were studied (with an equal number of sham zzso on 100 cells per category zzso 800 zzso 

No significant changes were noted for the zzso zzso slope of calcium zzso mean calcium zzso number of calcium zzso in each 10 zzso or mean height of these zzso The average frequency from zzso zzso of these periods showed significant zzso in one category zzso zzso exposure of activated zzso 

There is no clear indication that zzso emissions from mobile phones are associated with any changes in calcium levels or calcium zzso in zzso
