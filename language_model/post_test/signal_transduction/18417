zzso in zzso zzso transport and associated levels of cell surface zzso occur in rat zzso maintained in culture for 20 h under zzso and zzso zzso We have investigated whether this zzso is due to reduced zzso from the insulin zzso zzso expression or impaired zzso zzso The effects of chronic insulin treatment on zzso transport and zzso trafficking were ameliorated by inclusion of zzso in the culture zzso In comparison with the zzso insulin treatment attenuated changes in zzso processes leading to zzso zzso These included insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso activity, which were all reduced by zzso zzso of zzso in the culture medium prevented the effects of the chronic insulin treatment on these zzso zzso In comparison with cells maintained in culture without insulin, the total expression of zzso protein was not significantly altered by chronic insulin treatment, although the level of zzso expression was zzso zzso rate zzso for zzso zzso loss of zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso e zzso zzso In comparison with cells acutely treated with insulin, chronic insulin treatment resulted in a doubling of the rate zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso process is very sensitive to the zzso in zzso that occur under zzso and zzso conditions, and that the resulting zzso of zzso accounts for the reduced levels of net zzso zzso zzso
