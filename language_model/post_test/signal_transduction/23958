zzso is one of the major molecular zzso whose expression level increases by environmental zzso Even under normal conditions, zzso is a highly abundant zzso protein and is essential for cell zzso zzso is involved in the maintenance of appropriate folding and zzso of many cellular functional zzso These zzso client zzso are associated with zzso and they include a wide variety of zzso proteins that regulate cell growth and zzso such as protein zzso and steroid hormone zzso zzso functions in an zzso manner with other molecular zzso such as zzso and zzso An zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso pocket of zzso and specifically zzso the essential zzso activity of zzso Thus, treatment of cells with zzso results in zzso zzso and degradation of zzso client zzso Because zzso client proteins play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, cell survival, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of cultured cancer cells and shows zzso activity in experimental zzso Although the precise mechanism of the effect of zzso zzso on cancer cells remains to be zzso zzso zzso will be potential and effective cancer zzso drugs with a unique zzso In fact, a modified zzso with lower zzso zzso zzso has been examined in phase I clinic trials with encouraging zzso
