zzso stem cells zzso can differentiate toward various zzso including the zzso zzso and thus hold great potential for clinic zzso By using pharmacological zzso protein zzso C zzso signaling has been shown to either zzso or positively regulate differentiation of bone, however, due to the low zzso efficiency in zzso the role of individual zzso zzso is still not fully zzso In this study, we established a zzso zzso zzso system that efficiently delivered zzso proteins into zzso in a zzso zzso The increased zzso protein levels significantly promoted zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso cells and in primary zzso from both human and zzso as demonstrated by the enhanced activity of the zzso marker, alkaline zzso and the enhanced expression of the key zzso factor zzso zzso is an important functional indication for bone zzso Our results further showed that zzso promoted expression of the important zzso gene and the zzso of calcium zzso Taken together, this study provides direct evidence showing that zzso positively regulates zzso differentiation and demonstrates that the zzso zzso method enables functional study of specific zzso zzso in zzso without using viral zzso This may promote the application of zzso in therapeutic zzso
