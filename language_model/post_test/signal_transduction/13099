Similar to solid tumors, growth of zzso may also be zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso receptors specific to zzso cells are expressed on certain zzso of zzso We have previously demonstrated the existence of a zzso zzso loop on zzso cells that supports their growth and zzso Here, we demonstrate that in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as basic zzso growth factor and zzso zzso cells release increasing amounts of another vascular zzso growth factor zzso family member, zzso In turn, interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso promotes leukemia survival and zzso We demonstrate in 2 cell lines and 5 zzso zzso that zzso and a zzso form of the zzso that lacks the zzso motif induce zzso zzso leukemia zzso and increased survival, as determined by increased zzso zzso Moreover, zzso protected zzso cells from the zzso effects of 3 zzso zzso Because most zzso cells release zzso as well as zzso zzso our data suggest that the generation of a novel zzso zzso loop involving zzso and zzso may promote the survival of a subset of zzso and protect them from zzso zzso These results identify the zzso zzso as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso of acute zzso
