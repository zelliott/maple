In this review, we highlight recent literature concerning the signaling mechanisms underlying the development of two neural birth zzso zzso and zzso zzso the most common zzso zzso occurs when the cerebral zzso fail to separate and is typically associated with zzso of embryonic zzso zzso zzso results when the zzso zzso in the eye fails to zzso It is clear that Sonic zzso zzso signaling regulates both zzso and eye development, with defects in zzso or components of the zzso signaling cascade leading to the generation of both birth zzso In addition, other zzso signaling pathways are known factors in the zzso of zzso and zzso This review will outline recent advances in our understanding of zzso and eye embryonic pattern formation, with a focus on zzso studies of zzso and zzso acid zzso Given the clear overlap in the mechanisms that generate both diseases, we propose that zzso and zzso can represent mild and severe aspects of single zzso spectrum resulting from zzso zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso Models of Neurological zzso
