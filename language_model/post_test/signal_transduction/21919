zzso protein zzso is an attractive means to zzso cellular processes controlled by a variety of signaling zzso including zzso proteins such as Ras and zzso zzso The largest class of zzso proteins contain a so-called zzso motif at their zzso zzso and are subject to a maturation process initiated by the attachment of an zzso zzso by either protein zzso zzso or protein zzso type I zzso zzso of zzso termed zzso have been the subject of intensive development in the past decade and have shown efficacy in clinical zzso Although zzso zzso zzso have received less attention, accumulating evidence suggests zzso may augment therapies using zzso and could be useful to treat a myriad of additional disease zzso Here we describe the characterization of a selective, highly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso by zzso is competitive with the protein zzso and uncompetitive with the zzso zzso the Ki for the zzso is zzso zzso zzso is highly selective for zzso both in zzso and in living zzso Studies indicate zzso blocks zzso of a number of zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso breast cancer cells with zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso via a process that involves zzso of zzso proteins without significantly zzso parallel zzso of calcium via zzso These studies establish zzso as a prime tool for interrogating zzso associated with protein zzso and define a novel structure for this emerging class of experimental zzso
