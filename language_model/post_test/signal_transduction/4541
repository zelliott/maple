The strategy for the development of effective and safe zzso agents has great potential to reduce cerebral zzso injury and improve the functional outcome in stroke zzso Recently, zzso a zzso antibiotic, has been shown to have zzso efficiency in reduction of a variety of zzso injuries as well as zzso brain zzso We used the rat models of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and zzso to investigate the effects of treatments with zzso against the zzso barrier zzso leakage at 3, 12, 72, and zzso of zzso Male zzso rats were subjected to zzso for zzso followed by zzso for 3, 12, 72, and zzso and received either zzso zzso or zzso The results showed that the treatment of zzso significantly reduced the zzso leakage and cerebral zzso volume, which were proved by Evans blue zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso zzso verified that the administration of zzso significantly zzso the expression of tight junction zzso zzso and zzso from 3 to zzso after zzso The results of real-time zzso western zzso and gelatin zzso analyses revealed that the gene and protein expression and activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly elevated in a different zzso manner after zzso but significantly inhibited by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could also significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso and protein after zzso These results suggested that the protective effects of zzso against zzso damage induced by zzso might be related to the zzso of tight junction proteins and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
