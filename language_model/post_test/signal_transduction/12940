zzso interactions during lung development require zzso signaling factors that facilitate branching zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso originating in the zzso are necessary for zzso branching and zzso We found that the delayed lung maturation characterized by abnormal branching and poor zzso seen in mice deficient in zzso growth factor zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso expression of zzso By in zzso zzso the lungs from newborn zzso mice had low zzso activity compared with zzso zzso of zzso in developing lungs in zzso or in zzso severely retarded zzso zzso mice had low expression of zzso which is a potent zzso of zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso by tenfold in lung zzso from wild type, but not from zzso zzso zzso from lungs of zzso mice showed a tenfold reduction in active zzso but only a slight decrease in zzso by zzso At birth, zzso mice had a lung zzso characterized by abnormal lung zzso which zzso that of zzso mice, albeit somewhat less zzso We conclude that zzso mediates zzso interactions during lung zzso From the zzso of the zzso mice, we identify zzso as a major downstream target of zzso signaling in lung in zzso and in zzso zzso is, in turn, necessary for zzso of zzso a zzso zzso that is required for normal lung zzso
