Pulmonary zzso cells are continuously exposed to microbial challenges as a result of zzso It is recognized that immune zzso cells express zzso receptors zzso which play a major role in detecting microbes and initiating innate immune zzso In contrast, little is known concerning the expression of zzso in pulmonary zzso cells per se, their distribution within the cell, their function, and the signaling pathways zzso In this work, we demonstrated by reverse zzso and/or zzso that zzso and the accessory zzso zzso are zzso expressed in distinct human zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further characterized by flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in these zzso Despite this zzso zzso of zzso pulmonary zzso cells were responsive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso molecular zzso Using respiratory zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso and wild type mice, we demonstrated that zzso is the actual zzso zzso for zzso in these zzso zzso we showed that this cell response to zzso involves a signaling complex including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, using zzso expressing zzso forms of zzso and zzso we established that zzso zzso of respiratory zzso cells is largely dependent on zzso signaling zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso is a key element in the response of pulmonary zzso cells to molecules derived from zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in lung zzso is expected to play an important role in the prevention of the development of chronic inflammatory zzso
