zzso zzso play a critical role in liver repair after acute liver zzso zzso B4 zzso is a potent zzso for zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso type 1 zzso in liver repair during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso or their zzso counterparts zzso were subjected to partial zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso exhibited delayed liver repair and zzso proliferation accompanied by a zzso reduction in the recruitment of zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso expression of zzso growth factor zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso signaling also reduced the expression of zzso by zzso on recruited zzso expressing zzso in the injured zzso Treatment of zzso mice with an zzso zzso delayed liver repair and reduced zzso zzso compared with control zzso G zzso zzso signaling enhanced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in isolated zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling plays a role in liver repair after zzso zzso through enhanced expression of zzso in recruited zzso and that the development of a specific zzso for zzso could be useful for liver recovery from acute liver zzso
