The zzso is a zzso stage in zzso zzso that exhibits increased zzso stress resistance, zzso and altered metabolism compared with normal zzso We have used DNA zzso to profile gene expression differences during the transition from the zzso state to the zzso state and after feeding of starved zzso animals, and have identified 1984 genes that show significant expression zzso This analysis includes genes that zzso zzso factors and components of signaling pathways that could regulate the entry to and exit from the zzso state, and genes that zzso components of zzso pathways important for zzso survival and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes may be involved in the disease process in zzso zzso
