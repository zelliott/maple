zzso zzso studies in human prostate cancer as well as studies in zzso and in mouse models indicate that zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in prostate cancer zzso In this study, we used a probe compound for an zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and significantly zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to determine whether targeting zzso signaling from all four zzso will have in zzso activities consistent with zzso of tumor progression and will inhibit tumor progression in zzso 

zzso of zzso on zzso signaling and invasion were analyzed using immortalized normal prostate zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso or zzso The effect of zzso on invasion and proliferation in zzso was also evaluated in prostate cancer cell zzso Finally, the impact of zzso on tumor progression in zzso was evaluated using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso completely zzso zzso and significantly zzso zzso signaling at 100 zzso which is an achievable in zzso zzso This results in marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasion in zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso and all prostate cancer cell lines zzso Treatment in zzso completely inhibited zzso tumor growth and significantly inhibited zzso and proliferation and increased cell death in treated zzso This was associated with marked zzso of zzso zzso in treated zzso 

zzso zzso signaling is a promising new approach to treating aggressive prostate zzso
