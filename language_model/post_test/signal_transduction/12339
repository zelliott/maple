The frequency of delayed function of kidney transplants varies greatly and is associated with quality of zzso donor age and the duration of cold zzso zzso Furthermore, body weight differences between donor and recipient can affect primary graft function, but the underlying mechanism is poorly zzso We transplanted kidney zzso from commensurate body weight zzso or reduced body weight zzso donor rats into zzso or zzso zzso zzso hours zzso serum zzso levels in zzso recipients were significantly higher compared to zzso recipients indicating impaired primary graft zzso This was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso destruction in zzso from zzso zzso Using DNA zzso analysis, we detected decreased expression of genes associated with kidney function and an zzso of other genes such as zzso zzso and zzso A single application of zzso into zzso recipients is sufficient to impair primary graft function and cause zzso damage, whereas immediate zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso recipients rescued primary graft function with zzso kidney graft architecture and a zzso gene expression zzso These findings have strong clinical implication as zzso treatment of patients receiving zzso from zzso donors could be used to improve primary graft zzso
