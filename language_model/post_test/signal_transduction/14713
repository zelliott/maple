In an effort to understand the dynamic organization of the protein interaction network and its role in the regulation of cell behavior, positioning of proteins into specific network localities was studied with respect to their expression zzso First, we find that zzso expressed and zzso zzso proteins cluster in distinct functionally specialized network neighborhoods to form zzso and dynamic functional zzso zzso Then, we show that whereas dynamic zzso are mainly responsible for zzso regulation of cell behavior, zzso zzso provide zzso to the cell against genetic zzso or protein expression noise, and therefore may act as buffers of evolutionary as well as population variations in cell zzso Observations in this study refine the previously proposed model of dynamic zzso in the protein interaction network, and propose a link between the evolution of gene expression regulation and biological zzso
