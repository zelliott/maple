zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are related peptides that are potent zzso The zzso and AM receptors are zzso protein complexes comprised of a shared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a variable zzso activity zzso protein zzso zzso zzso enables zzso binding whereas zzso zzso AM zzso How zzso determine zzso selectivity is unclear and the zzso zzso are a topic of debate with evidence for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe bacterial production of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso fusion proteins and zzso characterization of their zzso binding zzso zzso the two zzso ensures complex stability and zzso defined zzso The zzso zzso fusion zzso as a zzso whereas the zzso zzso fusion zzso as a zzso Both proteins selectively bound their respective peptides with affinities in the low zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments were identified as the minimal zzso complex binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso group contributed to, but was not required for, zzso zzso whereas the AM zzso zzso group was essential for zzso zzso zzso experiments identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and AM zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as critical for zzso zzso Our results identify zzso and AM zzso for zzso zzso complex binding and suggest that the zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso In contrast, the AM zzso may function as a zzso zzso of zzso although our results cannot rule out zzso or zzso zzso
