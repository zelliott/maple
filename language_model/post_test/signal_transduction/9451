zzso is one of the downstream zzso mechanisms for elimination of zzso microbes following zzso of the zzso receptors zzso Although the detailed molecular mechanism for this cellular process is still zzso zzso 1, a key zzso for zzso has been suggested to play a zzso Heat shock protein 90 zzso is a molecular zzso that regulates the stability of signaling zzso zzso we show that zzso forms a complex with zzso 1 through an zzso zzso domain to maintain the stability of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso an zzso zzso effectively promoted zzso degradation of zzso 1 in a zzso zzso 100 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibitor I had no zzso zzso specifically zzso with zzso 1 but not with other adapter proteins in the zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso This further suggested a role of the zzso 1 in controlling zzso in response to microbial zzso Taken together, our data revealed that by maintaining the zzso of zzso 1, zzso plays a novel role in zzso zzso
