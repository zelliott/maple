The retinal zzso zzso zzso forms the outer zzso barrier zzso Most retinal diseases involve zzso breakdown, zzso zzso contained in serum directly contacts the zzso zzso is known to promote zzso stress fiber formation, an important zzso in eye diseases involving the zzso transition zzso and migration of zzso cells, such as zzso zzso We analyzed zzso effect on signaling pathways leading to zzso light chain zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber formation in primary cultures of rat zzso cells, in order to support a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso We showed that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso light chain zzso zzso ROCK increased zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso effect was abolished by the ROCK inhibitor zzso whereas zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso by zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso by zzso calcium zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating zzso involvement in the control of zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso stress fiber formation, since this effect was prevented by zzso the pathways leading to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber formation may be involved in zzso zzso cell transformation subsequent to zzso zzso
