The toxin sensitivity gene zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso a zzso toxin produced by the zzso fungus zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms associated with cell death in sensitive wheat zzso following zzso application are not well zzso To address this question, we used the zzso zzso Wheat Genome zzso to compare gene expression in a sensitive wheat zzso possessing the zzso gene with the insensitive wheat zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso This analysis was performed at early zzso after zzso with zzso zzso zzso to 12 h zzso zzso at this time, zzso is known to zzso into zzso cells without visible cell death zzso Gene expression also was monitored at later zzso (24 to 48 zzso when zzso causes extensive damage in cellular compartments and visible cell zzso At both early and late zzso numerous zzso genes were induced zzso to zzso zzso and included genes involved in the zzso pathway, zzso and the production of zzso oxygen species zzso Furthermore, a subset of host genes functioning in signal zzso zzso and as zzso factors was induced as a consequence of the zzso zzso Nine genes known to be involved in the host defense response and signaling pathways were selected for analysis by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, and the expression profiles of these genes confirmed the results obtained in zzso zzso zzso analyses of a sensitive wheat zzso showed that zzso was present in leaves undergoing cell death, indicating that zzso signaling is a major event involved in zzso cell zzso The results suggest that recognition of zzso via zzso triggers zzso zzso events similar to those reported for zzso gene zzso and that zzso genes play an important role in the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
