We have shown that zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased the risk of zzso transformation following cerebral zzso zzso we investigate the possible involvement of the zzso system and zzso zzso inhibitor underlying the zzso zzso zzso Mice were subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the right middle cerebral zzso zzso (5 zzso or vehicle was zzso injected upon zzso Brain zzso and zzso transformation were zzso zzso zzso damage was determined by Western zzso analysis for zzso zzso The activity and expression of zzso and zzso were determined by gelatin zzso in zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso In addition, the activities of tissue and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and tissue zzso of zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso induced increased zzso activity and expression at zzso zzso after zzso zzso Relative to controls, zzso animals had significantly decreased zzso activity and expression zzso in addition to reduced brain zzso and zzso transformation as well as improved zzso protein zzso This zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by reduced zzso activity zzso as well as increased zzso expression and zzso activity zzso zzso These results demonstrate the zzso zzso mechanisms for attenuating zzso zzso zzso and zzso damage, and further support it as an zzso to zzso therapy for zzso stroke zzso
