The zzso zzso system comprises three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso type A zzso and type B zzso zzso During zzso the zzso signaling is thought to regulate the zzso axis patterning of zzso arches via zzso zzso To further clarify the underlying zzso we have established mice in which gene zzso can be efficiently zzso into the zzso locus using zzso cassette exchange zzso based on the zzso zzso The first zzso zzso introducing zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso transformation of the lower jaw to an upper zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso targeted its expression to the zzso neural crest derivatives as well as in zzso head zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a complete rescue of zzso defects of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso could not rescue them except for the most zzso zzso zzso At early zzso the expression of zzso zzso and their downstream genes was zzso and zzso cells distributed zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso These results, together with similarity in zzso defects between zzso mice and zzso zzso mice, indicate that the zzso axis patterning of zzso arches is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso while the formation of the zzso zzso region is under the control of a zzso zzso which can be zzso by zzso This zzso zzso system can serve as a useful tool for studies on gene functions in zzso zzso
