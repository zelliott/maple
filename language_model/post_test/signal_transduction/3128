The ability of cells to respond to changes in their environment is zzso by zzso factors that zzso zzso and zzso expression of specific zzso of zzso In zzso zzso changes in carbon source lead to gene induction by zzso and zzso that are known to require the upstream function of the zzso protein zzso the central regulator of carbon zzso to exert their zzso zzso How zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is not zzso Here we show that under zzso conditions, deletion of zzso zzso the increase of zzso zzso zzso at the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso and as a consequence profoundly affects the zzso structural zzso accompanying zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not required to regulate the zzso switch and show only a partial influence on zzso zzso at this promoter, though their double deletion completely zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that under zzso conditions the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso is abolished by zzso zzso possibly explaining the lack of increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results highlight a mechanism by which zzso to zzso provides an essential zzso signal that is required for zzso by zzso zzso zzso
