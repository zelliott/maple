The zzso receptors zzso play important roles in cell zzso to the zzso zzso certain zzso zzso and the zzso of many zzso signaling zzso Studies of zzso have primarily focused on zzso while few studies of zzso in marine zzso have been zzso The functions of zzso in marine zzso species are still zzso 

In this study, we cloned and zzso an zzso zzso zzso from the clam zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein detected by zzso zzso and western blots were primarily distributed in muscle zzso zzso analysis showed a specific interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The results of the binding zzso suggested a role of zzso in cell zzso and zzso in cultured primary cells of mantle zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression level in primary cells cultured in zzso zzso zzso coated plates was significantly higher than in cells cultured in zzso plates at 48 h of culture, while the zzso zzso expression pattern was zzso related to that of zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso and the binding between zzso and zzso zzso zzso during primary cell zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso may be involved in cell zzso and zzso This study may increase the understanding of the role of zzso zzso in cell zzso and zzso and help to improve the culture of primary cells of marine zzso
