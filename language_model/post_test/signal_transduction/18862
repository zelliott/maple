zzso derivatives are the most commonly abused zzso These compounds have been known for many years to induce zzso However, recent findings have highlighted novel zzso produced by zzso in the central nervous system consisting of zzso inclusions and the involvement of proteins belonging to a zzso complex known as the zzso zzso These zzso and molecular changes are similar to those that occur during degenerative processes that affect the zzso zzso and in particular Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by zzso zzso inclusions in the zzso zzso This is recently confirmed by the occurrence of zzso zzso structures in the zzso zzso of humans abusing zzso In this article, we propose that the zzso of zzso and degenerative disorders share a number of steps in their mechanism of action involving the zzso zzso The fine tuning of this ubiquitous zzso zzso is now being zzso because zzso receptors and signaling proteins such as zzso regulate access to this zzso zzso The identification of the zzso zzso and zzso as molecular targets of zzso is expected to provide novel therapeutic strategies both for the treatment of drug addiction and the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
