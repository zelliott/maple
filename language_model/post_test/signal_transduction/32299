Studies were done on the analysis of biological processes in the same high expression zzso change zzso 2) zzso feedback negative zzso zzso gene zzso zzso network of human zzso zzso zzso compared with the corresponding low expression activated GO network of zzso zzso zzso zzso B virus zzso or zzso C virus zzso zzso We proposed zzso network that upstream included the regulation of zzso signal zzso resulting in induction of zzso signal zzso by zzso class zzso resulting in zzso of zzso class mediator, negative regulation of zzso zzso negative regulation of fatty acid zzso negative regulation of zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso induction of zzso and negative regulation of zzso zzso negative regulation of zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso induction of zzso and negative regulation of zzso as a result of zzso upstream negative regulation of fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso signal to downstream zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our hypothesis was verified by the different zzso feedback negative zzso zzso GO network of zzso compared with the corresponding inhibited GO network of zzso zzso zzso or the same compared with the corresponding inhibited GO network of zzso zzso zzso upstream negative regulation of fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso signal to downstream zzso zzso zzso network was constructed that upstream zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso data set using gene regulatory network zzso method and our zzso
