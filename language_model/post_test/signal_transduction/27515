To explore potential cellular mechanisms by which zzso of the zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance, we have evaluated insulin signaling in conscious zzso rats infused for 2-6 h with zzso insulin (18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or insulin and zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso infusion increased muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso over zzso or zzso animals, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso induced significant insulin resistance to zzso zzso both at the level of the whole body and in zzso zzso muscle, and it blunted the zzso increase in muscle zzso zzso At a cellular level, these zzso effects were paralleled by zzso of zzso insulin signaling critical for zzso transport and zzso storage, including a zzso reduction in zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso decrease in zzso association with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and a 51% reduction in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso These zzso in zzso insulin signaling were zzso and paralleled closely the progressive zzso of systemic zzso disposal from 2 to 6 h of zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso infusion results in zzso zzso modification of zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso may directly zzso early zzso insulin signal zzso perhaps via zzso modification of zzso zzso and thus contribute to the insulin resistance induced by chronic zzso
