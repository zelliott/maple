zzso functions as a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso and zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso and playing a crucial role in zzso cell zzso migration, zzso and zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso and extension cell movement during zzso zzso zzso exhibited broader and shorter body axis but cell fate zzso appeared zzso While zzso zzso expression robustly rescued zzso zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to rescue zzso zzso establishing zzso as a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso and upstream of zzso This is distinct from the related zzso protein that acts downstream of zzso zzso zzso resemble zzso double zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso delineate zzso and zzso zzso zzso
