zzso zzso is a crucial zzso in T cell signal zzso Although its expression on cell surface is zzso dynamic regulation of zzso level is probably the most important mechanism allowing T cells to zzso their response to different levels of zzso In our study we examined the role of two main T cell signal zzso pathways in controlling the surface level of zzso zzso one based on protein zzso C activity and the other dependent on zzso As an experimental model we used three clones derived from zzso cell line, expressing different levels of zzso zzso surface expression: zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The cells were zzso with zzso or zzso acting directly on zzso and zzso zzso Prior to the stimulation cells were incubated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso surface expression were measured by flow zzso Only zzso and zzso were able to change zzso expression suggesting important involvement of zzso in the regulation of its zzso To confirm these findings, zzso activity was estimated in zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso clones with different zzso expression showed also different zzso activities, so we conclude that zzso zzso is the main way of controlling zzso level on zzso zzso
