zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene cause zzso dominant zzso zzso expression studies have been reported for several zzso but have produced conflicting zzso Thus, the mechanism by which these zzso activate the zzso is zzso We describe here a new family with zzso dominant zzso The mother and three daughters experienced muscle spasms and/or zzso from early zzso They were treated with oral calcium and vitamin D zzso and all four patients developed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this family, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso region of the zzso The zzso zzso with zzso It was not present in 50 normal control zzso We used zzso zzso to introduce this zzso into the zzso zzso and then expressed the zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso In these cells, the zzso of zzso zzso was measured as a function of zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed a zzso in the zzso curve and an increase in the zzso response to high zzso zzso These effects did not appear to be zzso by changes in levels of zzso zzso as judged by zzso or by changes in zzso zzso as judged by Western zzso We conclude that this zzso zzso causes zzso by a dual increase in zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
