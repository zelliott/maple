The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of a zzso zzso zzso on zzso release in the central nervous zzso zzso zzso slices zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso solution were zzso zzso at a frequency of 1 zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso significantly increased both the zzso and zzso zzso release in a zzso zzso zzso applied zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly antagonized the capacity of the zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso The blockade of zzso receptors by a preferential zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso which interferes with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso proteins to zzso zzso significantly diminished the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso increased zzso release in rat zzso at least partially by interactions with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
