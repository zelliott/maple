zzso are by definition a combination of a biological zzso compound and a physical or zzso zzso zzso the zzso structure is a critical part of every zzso In the development of new and improved zzso layers the importance of the zzso structure is not restricted to the zzso to which biological structures have to be zzso A field of even greater importance is the use of zzso as zzso providing information on the structure and function of zzso zzso and their relation to a zzso zzso The aim of this paper is to give an overview on optical zzso principles and optical zzso zzso techniques relevant as part of zzso structures as well as zzso in the development and zzso of zzso zzso zzso discussed are basic optical effects, materials involved, surface chemistry, the principal and technological limits of spatial resolution, and zzso The intimate relation between the spatial resolution of a probe, the resulting size of interaction areas, and the feasibility of array structures is pointed zzso Two zzso methods are presented in principle, and their application to zzso and some results are discussed in zzso The necessity to zzso zzso layers to get detailed information about the interaction process is pointed zzso The close relationship between optimal zzso of layers by selection of adequate probe technologies and improvement of probe performance, and the development of new zzso layers is zzso Finally, an outlook is given for future aspects of improved spatial resolution and zzso zzso
