Human high affinity zzso receptors are expressed as two different zzso the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The alpha chain is the zzso binding zzso whereas the zzso and zzso chains are the signaling zzso Both zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso but the beta zzso differs from zzso zzso in two zzso the spacing between the two zzso zzso harbors a third zzso and it is one zzso acid shorter than in zzso zzso making it unfit to bind the tandem zzso of zzso We have shown that zzso functions as an amplifier of the zzso signaling zzso However, the molecular mechanism of this amplification remains zzso Here we show that zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the beta zzso essentially converts zzso an zzso complex in terms of Lyn zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso is the most critical zzso in this zzso In addition, a detailed analysis of the dynamics of calcium zzso suggests a possible zzso role for zzso which becomes apparent when zzso is zzso Thus, the signaling amplification function of zzso is mainly zzso in zzso and in its capacity to recruit zzso In turn, this zzso Lyn recruitment enhances gamma chain zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso The two other zzso appear to have a modulating function that remains to be fully zzso
