The zzso zzso a known inhibitor of fatty acid and zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity of mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso response upon zzso The zzso also inhibited the zzso response of human zzso upon exposure to various stimuli such as zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso delta zzso The loss of zzso response of both types of cells was observed only after incubation of the cells with zzso for certain zzso The results of radioactive precursor incorporation suggest that zzso metabolism blocked by zzso affected in turn signal zzso across the cell membrane and inhibited zzso production in these zzso
