zzso T helper zzso cells differentiate in response to zzso stimulation into either zzso or zzso zzso cells, which are characterized by the zzso of different set of zzso zzso zzso which is critical for allergic airway disease, is triggered by signals of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso generated during zzso particularly zzso We determine here the potential role of the signaling adapter zzso in zzso zzso We report using zzso mice and cells that zzso acts downstream zzso zzso and is important for zzso polarization and zzso playing a significant role in the control of the sustained zzso of zzso and late synthesis of zzso and zzso by participating in the zzso of the zzso zzso
