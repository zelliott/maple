The constitution and the control of the zzso reserve is of importance in zzso and zzso In particular, the number of primordial zzso at zzso is positively correlated with the number of growing zzso and their response to zzso zzso The size of this zzso reserve depends on genes involved in germ cell proliferation and zzso sexual zzso zzso germ cell zzso formation of primordial zzso and on a potential mechanism of zzso of germ stem zzso In this review, we present the state of the art of the knowledge of genes and factors involved in all these zzso We first focus on the almost 70 genes identified mainly by mouse zzso models, then we discuss the most plausible hypothesis concerning the possibility of the existence of germ cell zzso by zzso in animal species and human, with a special interest for the role of corresponding genes in evolutionary distinct model zzso All of the genes pointed out here are candidates susceptible to explain fertility defects such as the premature zzso failure in zzso
