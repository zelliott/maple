zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso primitive zzso zzso isolated from human zzso cells, expressed zzso zzso and produced transforming growth zzso zzso Culture of zzso in zzso conditions with zzso zzso zzso produced a substantial decrease in zzso zzso levels and a significant reduction of cloning and long-term zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly zzso in zzso zzso which generated an increased number of cells expressing zzso The described effects of zzso zzso were observed in the absence of any relevant effect on cell zzso number of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso cell zzso protein zzso A relevant increase in zzso protein levels was observed in zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso The present study on human zzso and previously reported data on zzso knockout mice suggest that, at the zzso level, the cell cycle inhibitor zzso plays an important role in regulating the survival and differentiation of primitive zzso zzso zzso by cell zzso zzso
