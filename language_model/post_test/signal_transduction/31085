Members of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso regulate a multitude of cellular processes as well as the expression of various proteins such as, zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso selectively degrade components of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso like growth factors and cell surface zzso zzso are activated during embryonic development, zzso and tissue zzso as well as in pathological conditions such as zzso wound healing and cancer zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso of cellular prion protein in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells is able to zzso zzso induced signal zzso leading to a synergistic increase of zzso zzso zzso This zzso with elevated zzso detachment of cells grown as an zzso zzso as well as interfering with zzso of cells cultured in a three-dimensional collagen type I zzso
