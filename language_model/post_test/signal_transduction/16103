zzso administration of zzso human zzso zzso can generate serious cardiovascular side effects such as zzso hypertension zzso in clinical and sport zzso It is hypothesized that zzso oxide zzso can protect from noxious cardiovascular effects induced by chronic administration of zzso On this base, we studied the cardiovascular effects of chronic administration of zzso in zzso rats treated with an inhibitor of NO synthesis zzso zzso were treated or not with zzso and/or zzso during zzso During the same period, rats were subjected to treadmill zzso The blood pressure was measured zzso zzso function of isolated zzso and small zzso arteries were studied and the zzso of the latter was zzso zzso induced hypertension zzso at the end of the zzso Exercise prevented the rise in blood pressure induced by zzso zzso However, zzso rats treated with both zzso and zzso developed severe hypertension zzso Furthermore, in these zzso rats treated with zzso the zzso relaxation was markedly impaired in isolated zzso zzso of zzso zzso and small zzso arteries zzso zzso hypertension induced an internal zzso of small zzso arteries that was not modified by exercise, zzso or zzso zzso zzso production was not increased in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso zzso rats died during the exercise or the recovery period zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the use of zzso in sport, in order to improve physical performance, represents a high and fatal risk factor, especially with pre-existing cardiovascular zzso
