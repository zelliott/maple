The plasma zzso of polarized zzso cells and zzso express distinct populations of zzso transport proteins in their differentiated plasma membrane zzso In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for this polarity it will be necessary to zzso the nature both of sorting signals and of the cellular machinery which recognizes and acts upon zzso In our efforts to study sorting signals we have taken advantage of two closely related families of zzso transport proteins whose members are concentrated in different zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso are closely related members of the zzso family of zzso transporting zzso Despite their high degree of structural and functional zzso they are concentrated on different surfaces of polarized zzso cells and pursue distinct routes to the cell surface in cells which manifest a regulated delivery zzso We have zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso derived from them, in a variety of zzso and zzso cell zzso Our observations suggest that these pumps zzso multiple sorting signals whose relative importance and functions may depend upon the cell type in which they are zzso Recent evidence suggests that the sorting mechanisms employed by zzso cells may be similar to those which operate in zzso We have examined this proposition by studying the zzso of zzso pumps and neurotransmitter zzso zzso expressed zzso and by zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso We find that one of the classes of proteins we studied obeys the correlation between zzso and zzso sorting while another does zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
