zzso produce various zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso are major zzso zzso proteins in cartilage zzso but the interactions between them are not zzso 

Recently, we succeeded in establishing a cell line zzso with zzso of zzso from a human zzso zzso of the zzso Using this cell line, cell zzso to zzso the effect of zzso on the cell zzso and expression of zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso immediately zzso to zzso and then zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso to zzso zzso whereas collagen did zzso The expression of both zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was detected 12 h after treatment with zzso but the expression of zzso zzso zzso had diminished by 24 h after zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso might zzso signal zzso from zzso by decreasing the expression of zzso zzso
