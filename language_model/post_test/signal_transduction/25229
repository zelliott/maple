zzso is known as an important hormone that plays the major role not only in the maintenance of normal physiology but also in the regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the proteins that are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso In this study we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso and we investigated the involved mechanisms in rat zzso zzso zzso After exposure to zzso zzso expression is positively regulated at the level of zzso This effect occurs via the zzso site zzso element in the zzso promoter as a consequence of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso but not of zzso On the other hand, after exposure to zzso plus zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso We found that this zzso effect of zzso also occurs via the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso activities of zzso were reduced by zzso Furthermore, our results showed that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso signaling is caused by zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism in which zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso
