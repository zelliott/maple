zzso interactions with vascular zzso during inflammation depend on zzso of zzso zzso engagement, particularly during zzso zzso zzso zzso rolling is also facilitated by members of the zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso rolling zzso during inflammation are significantly increased in zzso mice, with zzso expression required for optimal zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso mice significantly reduces zzso zzso Whether disrupted zzso rolling in zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice affects zzso entry into sites of inflammation in zzso was assessed in the current study by using experimental models of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration to the skin, zzso hypersensitivity responses, rejection of zzso skin zzso and septic zzso In many cases, the loss of both zzso and zzso expression dramatically reduced zzso migration into sites of inflammation beyond what was observed with loss of either zzso zzso In fact, the effects from loss of both zzso and zzso effectively eliminated multiple chronic inflammatory responses in zzso zzso By contrast, the combined loss of zzso and zzso expression had minimal effects on the generation of zzso T cell responses or zzso zzso Thus, members of the zzso and zzso families function zzso to mediate optimal zzso rolling and entry into zzso which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses in zzso
