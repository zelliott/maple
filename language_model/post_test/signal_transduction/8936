zzso zzso signaling is indispensable in embryonic development, and its zzso activity results in severe zzso disorders as shown by genetic models of naturally occurring zzso in animal and human zzso zzso signaling also functions in zzso development and adult tissue zzso and its zzso activity causes various human zzso Better understanding of molecular regulators of zzso signaling is of fundamental importance in finding new strategies for zzso zzso Here, we identify liver X receptors zzso members of the nuclear hormone zzso family, as previously zzso negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by specific pharmacological zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the responses of zzso bone zzso zzso cells and zzso organ cultures to sonic zzso resulting in the zzso of expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited sonic zzso differentiation of bone zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso target gene zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso responsiveness in mouse embryonic zzso that do not express zzso whereas introduction of zzso into these cells zzso the zzso zzso Daily oral administration of zzso to mice after 3 d significantly inhibited baseline zzso zzso expression in liver, zzso and zzso Given the importance of modulating zzso signaling in various zzso and pathological settings, our findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of zzso may be a novel strategy for zzso zzso zzso
