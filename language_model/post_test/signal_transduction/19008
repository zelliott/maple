zzso zzso zzso expression is required for maintenance of normal cardiac structure and function, though its role in cardiac cellular physiology is incompletely zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso signaling zzso focal zzso formation via zzso of a zzso zzso using adult rat zzso zzso in primary zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso Using zzso and pharmacological inhibitor strategies, we found that zzso zzso was zzso and zzso but independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the formation of a zzso complex between zzso zzso zzso and zzso within 30 zzso and induced zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso within zzso The extension of zzso resulted in restoration of zzso contact between isolated zzso allowing for zzso zzso These effects of zzso were prevented by a zzso inhibitor as well as an zzso to zzso These results suggest the potential role of zzso signaling in the maintenance and repair of electrical and mechanical zzso in zzso
