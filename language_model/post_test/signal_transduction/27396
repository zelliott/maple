zzso zzso II zzso zzso a variety of cellular responses through zzso of type 1 zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and type 2 zzso cell surface zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso receptors couple to zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso and generate zzso signals following recognition of zzso zzso but only zzso is targeted for the rapid zzso zzso zzso typical of many plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso proceeds through zzso pits and is independent of zzso zzso which predicts that the zzso zzso complex attains a zzso necessary for interaction with the zzso machinery, but separate from zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso zzso and the reason for the disparity between zzso and zzso zzso is not fully zzso but the latter probably reflects differences in the primary zzso acid sequence of these two zzso zzso zzso For many receptors that undergo zzso it has been established that zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso often incorporating crucial zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso regions of the zzso mediate the selective recruitment of activated receptors into zzso pits and zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso zzso aimed at identifying such zzso reveal that sites within the third zzso loop and the zzso zzso terminal region are important for zzso zzso zzso zzso
