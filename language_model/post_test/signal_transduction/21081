zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells accumulate in zzso in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that their zzso expansion is due, at least in part, to a delay in cell zzso However, the cellular or molecular factors responsible for a delay in zzso cell death are zzso zzso cells do express receptors for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of both has been shown to promote zzso survival in zzso by preventing zzso The zzso zzso zzso is another member of the zzso zzso family, but its zzso zzso has been reported to induce zzso in zzso zzso In the current study, we undertook a zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression on freshly isolated zzso cells and characterized the functional responsiveness of zzso binding to its zzso expressed zzso We show that zzso cells bind zzso with significant specificity and express between 47 and zzso zzso zzso sites per cell, with a zzso constant in the range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso of the zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells results in the zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso This pattern of zzso protein zzso is identical to zzso zzso zzso on normal cells and similar to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Further, in consecutive samples of fresh blood obtained from patients with zzso cells, the addition of zzso inhibited zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso but did not induce zzso Indeed, zzso like zzso was able to significantly reduce the amount of zzso cell death caused by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso which signal through the zzso family of zzso have comparable functional effects on zzso zzso
