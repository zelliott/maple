zzso is characterized zzso by zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso stem cells zzso are believed to play key roles in these zzso The major inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso differentiation of zzso via bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso has also been implicated in zzso differentiation of stem zzso We therefore examined the mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso in rat zzso in zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and protein were significantly zzso in zzso zzso measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso demonstrated that IGF-1 zzso occurred via a zzso zzso Furthermore, neither IGF-1 nor zzso alone was able to mediate zzso differentiation of zzso but IGF-1 together with zzso significantly increased zzso indicated by Oil Red O zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso IGF-1 and zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by IGF-1 and zzso respectively, were required for induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and for zzso zzso In conclusion, IGF-1 and zzso together mediate zzso zzso differentiation of zzso in zzso via a zzso and zzso zzso This improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for zzso may help the development of more effective zzso
