zzso has recently been implicated as a critical mechanism responsible for neurodegenerative zzso In this study, zzso zzso isolated from the sea horse zzso zzso zzso was studied as an agent to suppress zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results obtained showed that zzso significantly suppressed zzso induced release of zzso products such as zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the compound down regulated the protein and gene expression levels of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both cell zzso zzso signaling zzso studies showed that zzso inhibited the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the nucleus by blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso Moreover, it suppressed the zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both cell zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso blocked the zzso zzso inflammatory responses in zzso and zzso cells via modulating zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso could be a promising candidate to be used in zzso zzso
