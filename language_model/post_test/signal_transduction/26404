zzso relaxing factors play an important role in cardiovascular zzso Among them, zzso zzso factor zzso is important especially in zzso It has previously been demonstrated that zzso hydrogen zzso zzso is an zzso in animals and humans and that zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso plays diverse roles as a zzso oxide zzso generating system in zzso arteries and as an zzso generating system in zzso As compared with zzso responses, those by zzso are resistant to zzso contributing to the maintenance of cardiovascular zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the molecular mechanisms for enhanced zzso responses in zzso 

This study used male zzso mice and zzso mice zzso zzso In the zzso zzso was functionally suppressed in zzso arteries zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso for which zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved, as zzso responses were inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and in zzso mice, zzso In vascular smooth muscle, relaxation responses to zzso were enhanced through a protein zzso zzso zzso mechanism in zzso arteries compared with the zzso as they were inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are substantially involved in the mechanisms for the enhanced zzso responses in zzso in zzso
