Treatment with zzso a representative of a class of zzso compounds, zzso diabetic zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso compounds in animal models and humans does not cause clinical symptoms of zzso a common problem for diabetic patients with insulin zzso Gene zzso using zzso zzso was examined in muscle from zzso diabetic and normal rats in the presence or absence of oral zzso zzso zzso This treatment affected normal rats differently from diabetic rats, as demonstrated by zzso zzso of the full array zzso Diabetes altered the expression of 133 zzso and the expression of zzso of these genes zzso in diabetes was zzso by zzso zzso zzso For those zzso the ratio of expression in normal animals to the expression in diabetic animals showed a strong negative correlation with the ratio of expression in diabetic animals to the expression in diabetic animals treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes identified belong to six major zzso functional groups: zzso zzso zzso stress, muscle structure, protein breakdown and zzso the complement system, and signal zzso The identification of zzso stress zzso coupled with the known zzso chemistry of zzso implicates zzso oxygen species in the action of this class of zzso These results imply that early transition metals or compounds formed from their chemical interactions with other zzso may act as general zzso zzso a role not usually associated with this class of zzso
