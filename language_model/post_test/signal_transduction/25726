The zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso is carried by zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated with zzso pneumonia together with poor prognosis of infected zzso Although the zzso properties of zzso have previously been zzso the pulmonary immune response to zzso is largely zzso Using an unbiased zzso profiling approach, we show that zzso zzso only 29 genes in mouse zzso zzso which are associated with zzso zzso Further studies indicate that zzso directly binds to zzso and zzso immune responses via zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso factor zzso zzso zzso inflammation is independent of pore formation but strongly depends on the zzso zzso and is suppressed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso or zzso induced a robust inflammatory response in zzso which was diminished in zzso zzso These results highlight the zzso properties of zzso and identify zzso as an essential zzso complex for zzso lung zzso
