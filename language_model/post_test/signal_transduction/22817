The effects of zzso zzso zzso on the parameters for proliferation and differentiation were studied in zzso zzso cells isolated from rats of various zzso In cells not treated with zzso it was found that zzso bone zzso zzso formation, alkaline zzso zzso activity, and the incorporation rate of zzso into the cells sharply decreased with the age of the cell donor at zzso weeks and then remained at a relatively constant level up to 120 zzso Before studying the effects of zzso on these zzso we determined the change in the levels of zzso produced by the zzso cells during the culture period and found that the zzso zzso reached a maximum on the 4th day of the culture, regardless of the cell donor age, followed by a sharp zzso The zzso production was blocked by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the generation of zzso through a zzso zzso The area of zzso was effectively suppressed by zzso in the cells from zzso to zzso rats, whereas it was enhanced in the cells from zzso to zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso increased the zzso formation and the zzso activity in the cells from zzso to zzso rats zzso as young zzso By contrast, zzso decreased zzso incorporation into the cells from young zzso The area of zzso and the zzso activity decreased significantly, whereas zzso incorporation into the cells increased by zzso in the cells of zzso to zzso rats zzso as aged zzso The zzso effects on the cell differentiation and the zzso effect on the proliferation in the cells from young rats was zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso while an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the differentiation and enhanced the proliferation regardless of the cell donor zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Generation of zzso 1, zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso or zzso but not by zzso or zzso increased zzso production in the cells from young zzso By contrast, zzso zzso little effect on zzso zzso in aged zzso From the overall results, we concluded that zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects on differentiation through the zzso zzso and zzso pathway, respectively, in the cells from young zzso The zzso zzso seems to be inactive in the cells from aged zzso
