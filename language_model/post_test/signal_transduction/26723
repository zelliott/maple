Several lines of evidence suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso axis is required for viability of zzso cells and is a predictor of zzso in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso Moreover, many zzso agents induce zzso nuclear zzso and zzso of its target zzso which counteract cellular resistance to zzso zzso zzso the design and the study of zzso drugs is crucial to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and to prevent cancer zzso Here, we report the zzso effects induced by zzso (a highly selective zzso zzso in three zzso zzso cell lines and in zzso primary cells from pediatric zzso zzso induced zzso and an zzso of cells in the G zzso phase of the cell cycle via zzso of zzso zzso We also report that zzso cells treated with zzso displayed nuclear zzso of zzso and restoration of its functions, including control of zzso expression zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso speculating that in zzso the loss of zzso tumor zzso function could be due to deregulation of zzso as has been previously demonstrated in other cancer zzso It is well known that, differently from zzso zzso zzso have not yet been found in human tumors, which makes zzso zzso zzso more appealing than zzso For these features, zzso could be used alone or in combination with traditional therapies in the treatment of zzso
