zzso analgesics elicit their effects via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a G zzso zzso known to interact with zzso G zzso Work in zzso has suggested that zzso couples zzso to the abundant brain zzso zzso zzso However, studies in zzso evaluating zzso zzso have not supported these zzso The aim of the present work was to evaluate the contribution of zzso to zzso signaling by measuring both zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso transgenic mouse zzso Male zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were tested for zzso zzso in the hot plate test or the warm-water tail withdrawal test as measures of zzso or spinal zzso zzso Reduction in zzso levels attenuated the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso with the magnitude of suppression dependent on zzso zzso This was explained by a reduction in both zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso G protein zzso in whole brain zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, compared with zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso spinal zzso was not different between zzso zzso and zzso mice and zzso zzso expression was unchanged in spinal zzso zzso However, the action of the partial zzso zzso was compromised, showing that reduction in zzso protein does decrease spinal zzso but suggesting a higher zzso protein zzso These results provide the first in zzso evidence that zzso contributes to zzso efficient zzso signaling and zzso
