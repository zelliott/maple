zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates calcium zzso and zzso zzso in adrenal zzso and zzso zzso The zzso type 1 zzso in these cells couples to both zzso zzso and zzso C zzso but although zzso C has been implicated in the response to zzso the role of zzso zzso is zzso In this study, we show that zzso stimulates zzso influx in zzso cells by zzso a zzso current that depends upon the dual zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways but does not involve protein zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso has to overcome an zzso effect of zzso Thus, in cells expressing a dominant negative form of Ras zzso zzso induced larger, more rapidly zzso zzso This effect of Ras could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it was zzso by zzso of downstream G zzso Ras may also inhibit the current through a G zzso zzso because zzso zzso activated the current in zzso cells, provided zzso was present, but not in zzso cells expressing wild type zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso to both zzso zzso and zzso C is required to activate zzso influx in zzso cells and that zzso zzso by Ras delays and limits the zzso
