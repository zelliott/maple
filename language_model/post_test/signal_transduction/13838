Taking as a basis of discussion zzso spontaneous and evoked zzso activities recorded at the whole plant level, we put the challenging questions: do these zzso variations, together with zzso events, reflect zzso properties and complex behavior in zzso Does it reflect common perceptive systems in animal and plant zzso Is the ability of plants to treat short-term variations and information transfer without nervous system zzso Is a zzso construction of the world by lower organisms possible? More generally, the aim of this paper is to zzso the probably underestimated role of plant surface zzso in the plant relation life, carefully comparing the zzso of both animal and plant organisms in the era of plant zzso Knowing that surface zzso participate at least to zzso cell to cell zzso long distance transmission and zzso of zzso some hypothesis are given indicating that plants have to be studied as environmental zzso and non linear dynamic systems able to detect transitional states between perception and response to zzso This study is conducted in the frame of the zzso zzso which gives a theoretical model of evolutionary processes and suggests some hypothesis about the nature of complexity, information and zzso
