It has been shown that following peripheral nerve injury zzso zzso factor zzso released by activated zzso contributes to zzso pain, but whether zzso affects the function of zzso is still zzso In the present work we found that spinal application of zzso which induced long-term zzso zzso of zzso evoked field zzso activated spinal zzso in zzso animals, while zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso In addition, following zzso induction by zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were zzso only in spinal zzso but not in zzso and zzso whilst spinal application of zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso and suppressed zzso zzso As spinal zzso at zzso zzso is considered to zzso zzso pain, we subsequently examined whether zzso may contribute to mechanical hypersensitivity by zzso of spinal zzso using spared nerve injury zzso zzso Following zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso mainly in zzso horn zzso and in activated zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were increased exclusively in zzso zzso injection of zzso scavenger zzso starting before zzso which prevented the behavioral sign of zzso pain, suppressed both zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso Thus, the increased zzso signaling in spinal zzso horn may contribute to zzso pain by zzso of zzso following peripheral nerve injury and zzso of zzso or zzso zzso may selectively inhibit zzso in spinal zzso zzso
