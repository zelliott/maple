zzso germ cell zzso zzso is the most common zzso in young zzso Although most zzso are sensitive to zzso chemotherapy, significant numbers of zzso patients still zzso and die each year because of the development of resistance to zzso Previously, we first reported that a key regulator of the zzso checkpoint, zzso arrest zzso zzso was a zzso of zzso sensitivity in human cancer zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso played a role in cellular sensitivity to zzso in zzso cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms zzso Using 10 zzso cell lines, we found that increased zzso expression was correlated with cellular sensitivity to zzso which was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Treatment of cells expressing high levels of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso led to cellular protection against zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso a zzso construct in zzso cells with high levels of zzso resulted in the suppression of zzso zzso and resistance to zzso cell zzso These results support previous suggestion on the involvement of zzso checkpoint in DNA damage response in human cancer cells and demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism responsible for the zzso sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso of zzso may be an indicator for identification of zzso cancer cells that are potentially resistant to zzso zzso
