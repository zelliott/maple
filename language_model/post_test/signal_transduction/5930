To clarify the possible role of a zzso zzso regulatory protein in the signal zzso system activated by zzso zzso the actions of zzso on rat pancreatic zzso were compared with those of zzso which is a well-known zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso reduced the binding of zzso zzso to zzso cell zzso with the rank order of potency being zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso zzso analysis of labeled zzso binding revealed that the decrease in zzso binding caused by zzso was due to the decrease in an affinity constant of zzso for its receptors with no significant change in the zzso binding zzso When zzso were incubated with increasing zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso stimulation of zzso release occurred at 100 zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso caused its zzso zzso Further, zzso and zzso similarly zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso and the release of zzso from the zzso zzso store into the zzso although there was a lag period prior to any zzso stimulation by zzso The doses of zzso necessary for zzso zzso and zzso zzso generation were nearly the same, with a zzso stimulation at 20 zzso zzso zzso at zzso up to 20 zzso a zzso concentration for zzso release, produced no significant change in the cellular zzso zzso zzso In addition, 10 zzso zzso zzso the zzso release zzso by zzso a well-known zzso which functions via zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso are independent of cellular zzso zzso zzso also activated the zzso of zzso in a zzso pancreatic zzso cell membrane preparation, with a zzso and a zzso stimulation at 1 zzso and 10 zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso were markedly zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso which alone was zzso These results, therefore, strongly suggest that pancreatic zzso receptors may be coupled to the zzso of zzso breakdown by a zzso zzso regulatory zzso
