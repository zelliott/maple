zzso zzso is the primary regulator of zzso stimulating growth, preventing zzso and promoting differentiation of red blood cell zzso The EPO zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso Although the primary role of EPO is the regulation of red blood cell production, EPO and its zzso have been localized to several zzso zzso and cells, including the central nervous system zzso zzso cells, solid tumors, the liver, and the zzso The presence of EPO receptors and the possibility of EPO signaling in these zzso and cells have led to numerous studies of the effects of EPO at these zzso In particular, expression of EPO and the EPO zzso in cancer cells has generated much interest because of concern that administration of zzso human zzso zzso to patients with breast and other cancer cells expressing the EPO zzso may promote tumor growth via the induction of cell proliferation or zzso However, evidence supporting a zzso effect has been zzso Moreover, several zzso studies have shown a beneficial effect of EPO on delaying tumor zzso Further, it is conceivable that increased expression of EPO could reduce tumor zzso and zzso the deleterious effects of zzso on tumor growth, zzso and treatment zzso On the other hand, EPO has also been shown to produce an zzso effect in vascular zzso cells in zzso However, there is no evidence that these effects occur in zzso to promote tumor zzso EPO and EPO receptors are expressed in neural zzso and they are zzso there by zzso Animal studies have shown that administration of zzso zzso (an zzso reduces tissue injury due to zzso stroke, blunt zzso and experimental zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may provide a therapeutic benefit in patients with stroke, zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Clearly, further study of EPO and the EPO zzso in zzso tissue is warranted to determine the potential therapeutic usefulness of zzso as well as to determine the signaling zzso responsible for its effect in zzso
