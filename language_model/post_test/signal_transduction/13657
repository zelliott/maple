The zzso trafficking machinery contributes to the spatial and zzso control of signaling by zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary role in this process is played by zzso trafficking, which regulates the zzso of zzso and their downstream zzso as well as the duration and the extent of their zzso The key regulatory points along the zzso zzso are zzso of zzso from the plasma zzso their sorting to degradation or recycling, and their residence in various zzso zzso Here I will review factors and mechanisms that zzso zzso signaling by zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso regulating the balance between degradation and recycling of zzso and zzso zzso of signals in zzso and other zzso zzso these mechanisms illustrate a multilayered control of zzso signaling exerted by the trafficking zzso
