In this study, we show that proliferation of breast cancer cells is suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso breast cancer cells remains zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso regulate signal zzso pathways activated by cell surface receptors including zzso Moreover, zzso transcript and protein levels are increased in zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in breast cancer zzso To further clarify the role of zzso in tumor growth, we correlated the proliferation rates of breast zzso cells with zzso expression and zzso zzso We show that proliferation of zzso or zzso breast zzso cells is zzso regulated by zzso and show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells used as experimental zzso In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso expression resulting in suppression of cell zzso we reveal for the first time that in zzso or zzso breast cancer zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso expression through the binding of zzso and zzso zzso factors to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, we show for the first time that zzso proliferation of breast zzso cells is zzso regulated by zzso through zzso of zzso
