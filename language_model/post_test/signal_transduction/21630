B cells zzso along zzso zzso or zzso 2' pathways under the influence of polarizing zzso can, in turn, influence the direction of an immune zzso Here, we compare the capacity of human B cells residing within zzso and memory compartments to participate in type 1 polarizing zzso zzso zzso zzso engagement provided the main signal for zzso zzso expression in the two zzso this was zzso by zzso together with zzso zzso but inhibited by zzso zzso could be induced on a minority of B cells by the same signals, and also by zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso was expressed in both zzso with no evidence for its regulation by the signals zzso While neither subset was capable of zzso much zzso zzso memory B cells could produce a small amount of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Memory B cells also, exclusively, expressed zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso products of appropriately zzso zzso not zzso cells were shown to promote the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The data indicate an equal capacity for zzso and memory B cells to respond within a type 1 polarizing zzso Although poorly equipped for initiating type 1 responses, B zzso virtue of the memory zzso a capacity for their maintenance and amplification following zzso zzso
