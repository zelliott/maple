zzso deprivation zzso zzso stress and zzso in diverse cell zzso Liver tissue shows high tolerance to nutritional stress, however regulation of survival in normal zzso subjected to zzso restriction is zzso We assessed the survival response of cultured zzso subjected to zzso deprivation and analyzed the putative participation of protein zzso A zzso in this zzso Six hours zzso deprivation induced a zzso dependent zzso of zzso in cultured zzso without having an impact on non zzso zzso zzso zzso associated to zzso restriction was secondary to an imbalance in cellular zzso oxygen species zzso In this condition, zzso zzso led to an early prevention in zzso zzso production and a late increase in scavenging zzso transcript zzso These results supported the hypothesis that zzso could zzso zzso deprivation induced zzso zzso by conditioning zzso zzso production during zzso zzso We presented additional evidence sustaining this model: First, zzso withdrawal led to a zzso increase in zzso zzso levels in cultured zzso second, zzso of zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, whereas zzso zzso zzso the opposite zzso zzso zzso zzso previously proposed as an zzso zzso adjusting zzso rate, emerges as a mechanism of controlling cell survival during zzso zzso
