zzso zzso is one of the key zzso modifications that occur in zzso zzso Since its discovery more than 30 years ago, zzso zzso has come to be understood as a fundamentally important mechanism of signal zzso and regulation in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso response by zzso early zzso signals triggered by zzso zzso zzso zzso These signals result in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso motifs present within the zzso tails of the zzso zzso zzso that, once zzso serve as scaffolds for the assembly of a large zzso zzso complex responsible for zzso zzso The existence of membrane zzso or zzso or zzso as specialized platforms for protein transport and cell zzso has been zzso The present review discusses the signals that target zzso to membrane zzso and the importance of these specialized zzso in the transport of zzso to the plasma zzso the regulation of zzso activity and the zzso of the zzso
