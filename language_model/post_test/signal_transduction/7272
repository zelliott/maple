zzso Heart Disease zzso is one of the most common birth zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying normal cardiac development is an important step towards early identification of abnormalities during the zzso program and towards the creation of early intervention zzso We developed a novel zzso strategy for leveraging zzso data sets, including a large selection of zzso data associated with mouse cardiac development, mouse zzso zzso zzso data of selected mouse zzso factors and zzso data of mouse zzso zzso to zzso the active zzso regulatory network of mouse cardiac zzso We identified zzso expression activity for zzso overlapping gene zzso zzso that were defined for obtained cardiac lineage zzso zzso For each zzso zzso we identified the phase of cardiac development where gene expression for that module was higher than other zzso zzso zzso were found to be consistent with biological zzso knowledge in zzso and met expectations for enrichment of pathways involved in heart lineage zzso Over zzso zzso zzso relationships were zzso by analyzing the promoter sequences within each gene module for overrepresentation against the zzso database of zzso Factor zzso Site zzso zzso The provisional regulatory network will provide a framework of studying the genetic basis of zzso
