The study was aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso and the cell zzso changes were observed with zzso and zzso zzso The cell cycle distribution was determined by flow zzso and the expression of cell signaling proteins were detected by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and zzso manners, after 2 zzso zzso exposure for 12 - 48 hours, the cell cycle was arrested at zzso phase and zzso cell death was confirmed by either defined zzso bodies stained by zzso Western zzso showed zzso which represents the zzso of zzso zzso The Western zzso analysis indicated the zzso of two important survival signal pathways after zzso treatment, the zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso were remarkable zzso whereas the zzso of zzso and its downstream molecular zzso were not zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso of zzso cells is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso
