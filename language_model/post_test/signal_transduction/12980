The potential involvement of membrane zzso binding sites in the induction of zzso zzso activity as well as in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso level under zzso zzso stimulation was zzso Our approach relied upon the use of two zzso zzso zzso serum zzso solutions zzso and zzso The absence of zzso free zzso in these solutions was zzso Both zzso zzso led to a transient zzso stimulation of the expression of zzso zzso reporter gene in zzso cells zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso reporter zzso a property not recorded with free zzso which maintained enhanced zzso activity during the whole zzso A very low concentration of zzso (10 zzso zzso acted with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity induced by these zzso appeared to result from their known interactions with membrane zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which antagonize zzso zzso responses, zzso the zzso activity induced by zzso zzso confirming a potential relationship between zzso signals and zzso zzso Moreover, induction of zzso was recorded when the cells were exposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting the implication of the latter in the signal zzso zzso leading to the expression of the reporter zzso Growth factors zzso zzso and zzso also slightly zzso zzso and zzso acted with 10 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso in agreement with the concept of a zzso between steroids and peptides acting on the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and all investigated growth factors failed to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, indicating the need for a direct zzso interaction of the zzso with the zzso to regulate its zzso zzso elimination was, however, found in the presence of zzso media zzso prepared from cells zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that they may produce zzso zzso that may enhance zzso zzso when released within the zzso
