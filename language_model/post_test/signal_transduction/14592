The zzso zzso zzso regulate cellular zzso networks that are involved in processes linked to the survival, growth, zzso metabolism and specialized differentiated functions of zzso The zzso of this network is common in cancer and has also been linked to disorders of zzso The zzso of the zzso function of zzso has come from pharmacological studies, which use the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and from zzso genetic knockout models of the effects of loss of zzso zzso Several reports have shown that zzso is not exclusively selective for the zzso and could in fact act on other zzso zzso and additional apparently unrelated zzso Since this inhibitor still remains a drug of choice in numerous zzso studies (over 500 in the last year), it is important to establish the precise specificity of this zzso We report here the use of a chemical zzso strategy in which an analogue of zzso zzso was immobilized onto zzso zzso zzso This affinity material was then used as a bait to zzso potential protein targets from cellular zzso zzso with high affinity for immobilized zzso were separated by one-dimensional gel zzso and identified by liquid zzso zzso The present study reveals that zzso not only binds to class I zzso and other zzso zzso but also to novel targets seemingly unrelated to the zzso zzso
