Cellular zzso which can be induced by various zzso is a stress response that zzso as irreversible cell cycle zzso Recent studies have revealed that cellular zzso can serve as a critical barrier for cancer zzso zzso of cellular zzso by zzso zzso such as Ras zzso or by zzso of zzso tumor zzso triggers an zzso zzso effect which can significantly restrict cancer zzso Given the important role of the zzso zzso in cellular zzso and tumor suppression, drugs that stabilize zzso expression have been developed and tested in clinical zzso However, a major hurdle for zzso targeting in cancer treatment arises from the frequent zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso in human zzso which, in turn, profoundly compromises their zzso zzso Recent discoveries of novel regulators involved in zzso cellular zzso not only reveal novel zzso for cellular zzso but also provide alternative approaches for cancer zzso
