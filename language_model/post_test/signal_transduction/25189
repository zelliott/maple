This paper summarizes the structure, biological activities, zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso exist both soluble and particulate zzso zzso of the soluble zzso was classified into three groups: triple zzso single zzso and random zzso zzso zzso exhibit a variety of biological and zzso activities, and the significance of these activities is dependent on the structure, such as zzso in water, molecular weight, degree of zzso and zzso Many of the activities, such as nitrogen oxide synthesis of zzso and zzso factor G zzso were dependent on the zzso but some of the others were independent, such as zzso and colony stimulating factor zzso These activities are beneficial and zzso useful, while some strongly related to allergic and inflammatory adverse zzso It should be noted that the zzso once administered into the body, remain mainly in the liver and zzso for a very long period of zzso The activity, at least in part, is maintained during these zzso The zzso mechanisms of the zzso especially in soluble form, zzso biological activity was still not clearly zzso
