Although zzso of protein degradation pathways contributes to the development of muscle weakness in response to muscle injury and inflammation in the adult zzso less is known about the zzso zzso Muscle development during the zzso and early zzso periods normally results in net zzso However, the structural and functional zzso of the zzso zzso may zzso it to injury and inflammation induced by adverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso protein degradation pathways in early life is essential to recognize altered signaling pathways under zzso conditions in zzso zzso We assessed the relative role of the major zzso pathways and zzso capacity during muscle maturation in zzso fetuses and zzso from 75 days to 200 days zzso zzso Gene expression and protein content of zzso and zzso 3 exhibited a similar profile with advancing zzso increasing from 75 days to 100 zzso days and subsequently decreasing gradually toward the end of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso genes did not change during zzso All zzso genes examined (except zzso were zzso rapidly after delivery, with a similar zzso trend observed in zzso II protein content as well as zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso gene expression demonstrated a steady increase from 75 days gestation to 24 zzso after birth, followed by a significant reduction at 7 weeks of zzso age zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling and zzso capacity patterns reflect the zzso process to zzso change and muscle maturity with zzso
