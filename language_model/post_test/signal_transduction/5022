zzso zzso is a major zzso linking inflammation and zzso in pathological vascular zzso such as zzso and tumor zzso However, signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso processes in zzso cells zzso have barely been zzso zzso zzso the present study investigated zzso zzso signaling in zzso 

zzso zzso induced tube formation and migration of zzso This was associated with and dependent on zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 zzso as determined by pharmacological zzso and gene zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso protein tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso zzso short hairpin zzso inhibited these zzso zzso Moreover, zzso promoted zzso of zzso to zzso cellular zzso zzso membrane zzso and interaction of zzso with zzso zzso cellular cholesterol depletion zzso and zzso of zzso zzso interfering zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso tube formation and zzso Finally, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso rings ex zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso in mice in zzso zzso plug zzso 

zzso assembles a zzso signaling module consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso representing a potential target to intervene into zzso processes and zzso
