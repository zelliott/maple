The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced into zzso Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso cell line) in order to study its zzso to zzso zzso systems and to compare the zzso properties of zzso to those of other growth zzso Independent clones expressing different levels of zzso receptors were isolated and zzso zzso increased zzso incorporation in zzso cells and zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso As already observed for other growth factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone did not trigger zzso zzso formation, but slightly enhanced the activity of zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by its zzso was evidenced by the rapid zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso pH zzso within minutes after zzso Whereas zzso toxin does not affect the action of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso cells, it partially inhibited both DNA synthesis zzso and zzso of zzso exchange by zzso indicating that the zzso zzso can communicate with a zzso zzso binding zzso A zzso form of the zzso gene product, in which zzso zzso a zzso zzso modulating signal zzso had been replaced with zzso zzso zzso did not generate responses significantly different from those obtained with the zzso zzso gene zzso In the absence of zzso cells expressing either zzso or zzso zzso showed a considerably higher zzso level of zzso incorporation and decreased zzso dependence compared with parental zzso zzso zzso zzso that interfere with signal zzso by the human zzso zzso inhibited both zzso zzso incorporation and soft zzso colony formation, indicating that relaxation of growth control was dependent on zzso zzso zzso
