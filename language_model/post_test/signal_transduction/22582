zzso zzso mice develop a novel form of muscular zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso zzso causes an zzso of the zzso protein zzso 2 zzso signal zzso zzso in muscle zzso The observed zzso of zzso zzso is a specific effect, because the zzso zzso zzso does not cause unspecific stress as determined by measurement of the zzso level and activity of the zzso zzso Because an increased level of activated zzso was found in muscle of zzso zzso mice, the zzso of zzso zzso is triggered most likely by an zzso zzso In accordance with this, in the zzso zzso mice, part of the zzso zzso zzso in muscle is replaced by the zzso zzso which permits the zzso zzso A recent report describes that zzso activity can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso peptides in skeletal muscle of rabbits causes zzso of muscle zzso zzso we conclude that in zzso zzso mice, the continuous zzso of zzso zzso causes a permanent reduction of zzso activity diminishing zzso zzso interactions and thereby contributing to the development of the zzso zzso
