We found previously that neural responses to ethanol and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involve both zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso protein zzso A zzso However, little is known about the mechanism underlying zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and the relationship to zzso zzso In the present study, we used a new zzso zzso zzso that selectively recognized active zzso when not bound to its zzso protein zzso zzso for activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso to measure zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show here that ethanol and zzso activated zzso and induced zzso of both zzso and its zzso zzso zzso to a new zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso activated zzso but did not cause zzso of the zzso complex to the zzso These data suggest a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso after zzso or ethanol treatment, where zzso first zzso and binds to its zzso and subsequently the zzso complex zzso to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to cause zzso zzso to the zzso compartment in a process that is dependent on zzso zzso and requires zzso zzso These data demonstrate a novel zzso mechanism between zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso signaling have been implicated in alcohol rewarding properties in the zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso may zzso some of the behaviors associated with zzso
