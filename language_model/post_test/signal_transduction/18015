zzso zzso receptors zzso signals that control complex cell functions which require the regulation of gene zzso such as zzso differentiation and zzso Their zzso domain has no zzso function, indicating that interaction with other zzso molecules is crucial for zzso zzso Here we have identified a protein that interacts with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This protein is zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1), a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is present both in the nucleus and in the zzso of cells and that a fraction of zzso zzso with zzso at the cell zzso zzso engagement is followed by an increase of the nuclear pool of zzso paralleled by enhanced binding of zzso zzso complexes to their DNA consensus site and increased zzso of an zzso zzso We suggest that zzso through the zzso zzso may affect zzso zzso by regulating zzso nuclear zzso This represents a new zzso for zzso zzso of gene zzso
