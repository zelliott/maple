zzso zzso has shown zzso activity through induction of a zzso heat shock protein zzso Although zzso is reported to regulate zzso the effects of zzso on zzso synthesis in zzso have not been previously zzso zzso this study investigated the effects of zzso on zzso and the related signaling zzso 

zzso content and zzso activities were measured in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways were investigated by western zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso significantly decreased zzso content in a zzso zzso Similarly, zzso reduced zzso activity zzso but it did not directly inhibit zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso protein zzso whereas it increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso Furthermore, a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso reduction and then prevented zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso However, a specific zzso zzso zzso only slightly restored zzso of zzso production by zzso indicating that zzso signaling is not a key mechanism regulating the zzso of zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso reduces zzso synthesis in zzso cells through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
