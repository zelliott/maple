Human zzso protein zzso activates innate immune cells and hence requires no additional zzso to render bound peptides zzso Here we tested the assumption that zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso signal zzso similar to zzso and zzso molecular zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters in zzso and that this is controlled by zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso causes zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells do not respond to zzso with zzso zzso zzso Using the system of genetic zzso with zzso receptors zzso we found that zzso and zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso in zzso zzso The expanding list of zzso zzso able to activate the ancient zzso zzso signal zzso is in line with the zzso zzso proposing that the innate immune system senses danger signals even if they originate from zzso
