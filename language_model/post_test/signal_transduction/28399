The zzso protein zzso zzso has a central role in cell signaling zzso by a wide range of protein zzso zzso including intrinsic membrane zzso such as the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso To zzso potential zzso signaling mechanisms, we used DNA array technology to investigate novel zzso targets expressed in the zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso transcripts were among the most abundant found in this zzso Because zzso expression has not been characterized in brain, we evaluated its expression pattern using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso monkey prefrontal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso band in zzso from the zzso consistent with the known size for zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was expressed in all layers of the zzso and in all zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso concentrated in zzso zzso of cortical layers zzso and throughout zzso horn and in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expression was also identified in zzso cells of cerebral blood zzso These expression patterns are very similar to those of the IGF-1 zzso and suggest that zzso could be among the downstream targets of zzso signaling in areas of the zzso brain involved in learning and zzso
