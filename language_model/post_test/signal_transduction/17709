Signaling networks are complex both in terms of the chemical and zzso events that zzso them, and in the sheer number of zzso Computer models are powerful tools to deal with both aspects of complexity, but their utility goes beyond simply replicating signaling events in zzso Their great advantage is as a tool to zzso The zzso of the description demanded by computer models highlights gaps in zzso The quantitative description in models zzso a mapping between different kinds of analysis methods for complex zzso Systems analysis methods can highlight stable states of signaling networks and describe the transitions between zzso Modeling also reveals functional similarities between signaling network properties and other zzso systems such as electronic devices and neural zzso These suggest various metaphors as a tool to zzso Based on such descriptions, it is possible to regard signaling networks as systems that decode complex zzso in time, space and chemistry into zzso output patterns of signaling zzso This would provide a natural interface to the zzso input patterns required by genetic zzso Thus, a combination of computer modeling methods to capture the complexity and details, and useful zzso revealed by these models, is necessary to achieve both rigorous description as well as human zzso
