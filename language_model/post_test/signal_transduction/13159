Multiple zzso including zzso can affect T cell proliferation and zzso However, zzso can lead to zzso as well as zzso making unclear whether zzso zzso zzso signals ultimately have a predominantly positive or negative zzso To address this issue, we examined the effect of enhancing zzso signals in zzso T cells after zzso stimulation by engineering a transgenic zzso mouse strain with zzso T cells capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling after target recognition by means of expression of a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso zzso T cells can bind the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso but the zzso binding results in delivery of an zzso zzso After zzso stimulation in zzso the zzso T cells demonstrated marked increases in the initial zzso response and cell expansion and displayed continued increases in cell expansion after repeated zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso role of zzso signals delivered to responding zzso T cells is to set the size of the initial response to zzso by promoting T cell proliferation and survival and not cell zzso
