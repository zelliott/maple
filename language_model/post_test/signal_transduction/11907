zzso zzso the zzso constituent of green tea, has been demonstrated to be zzso against stroke in zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso responsible for zzso activity remains unclear and no established treatment for decreasing the resulting neurological damage of stroke zzso The present study was designed to investigate the zzso mechanism of zzso on transient focal cerebral zzso in zzso zzso when applied immediately following zzso significantly decreased the expression of zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and zzso zzso following zzso zzso treatment also significantly reduced zzso volumes and increased neurological scores which was correlated with elevated levels of zzso and zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso activity, and decreased zzso zzso breakdown product zzso zzso When zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity was specifically zzso the zzso effect of zzso was attenuated and a correlated decrease in zzso activity was zzso In conclusion, the results clearly demonstrated that zzso injection of zzso immediately following zzso zzso zzso and improves the neurological status of rats that have undergone middle cerebral artery zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
