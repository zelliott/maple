The zzso surface membrane possesses three zzso receptors activated by zzso zzso zzso one member of the zzso zzso family zzso and two members of the zzso zzso family zzso and zzso zzso and zzso receptors have firmly established roles in zzso zzso during zzso and zzso whereas the importance of the zzso zzso has been more zzso However, recent studies have demonstrated that zzso receptors can generate significant functional zzso responses alone and in zzso with other zzso zzso In addition, studies in transgenic animals indicate an important role for zzso receptors in zzso zzso particularly under conditions of zzso stress and thus during zzso zzso This review discusses the background behind discovery of zzso receptors in zzso and their precursor cell, the zzso and how zzso via these zzso channels may participate in zzso zzso
