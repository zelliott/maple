The zzso 1 zzso zzso is a highly zzso G zzso zzso which is known to zzso pigmentation and zzso In the current study, we investigated the pharmacological effects of select zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso After transient expression of zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso signaling and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were assessed by using zzso reporter gene zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso All zzso zzso showed decreased zzso zzso zzso With the zzso and zzso zzso the decrease in zzso activity was zzso at least in part, to a reduction in surface zzso The zzso zzso also displayed a significant reduction in potency for both the zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso signaling zzso the zzso zzso showed decreased zzso zzso zzso levels after stimulation with either zzso or zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso displayed a selective loss of zzso zzso zzso whereas responsiveness to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Further assessment of zzso zzso in zzso cells, an in zzso model of zzso revealed an enhanced inflammatory response resulting from expression of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso This zzso in function was restored by treatment with zzso Overall, these studies illustrate novel signaling profiles linked to distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, our investigations highlight the potential for zzso drugs to rescue the function of zzso zzso that show reduced zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso
