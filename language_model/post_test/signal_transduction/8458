The task of developing and simulating zzso models of signaling networks for zzso zzso confronts the zzso with several challenges: zzso The stimuli that initiate the cellular responses one wishes to study are provided by zzso concentration zzso This means that the zzso model must have a zzso resolved representation of zzso molecular zzso zzso The zzso responses consist of the generation of zzso zzso and/or zzso of signaling zzso requiring zzso resolved zzso representations of the simulated zzso zzso The signaling networks responsible for zzso zzso comprise a multitude of components acting as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso types used by others for membrane zzso Models of such signaling networks may become quite complicated, unless one wishes to rely on abstract functional zzso with certain zzso characteristics as modeling zzso replacing zzso of biological signaling zzso In this chapter, we describe how zzso can use a modeling tool zzso developed to facilitate the design and simulation of detailed zzso models of signaling pathways (for zzso zzso zzso thereby avoiding the technical difficulties typically associated with building and simulating such quantitative zzso
