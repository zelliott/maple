Although tumor necrosis zzso zzso is elevated in zzso tissue in obesity and may contribute to the cardiovascular and zzso risks associated with this condition, the mechanisms leading to elevated zzso remain zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso contributes to the maintenance of elevated zzso in zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso or injection of zzso into zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso male but not female mice lacking zzso receptors showed significantly lower levels of zzso zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the lack of zzso zzso signaling reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso male zzso Additionally, zzso zzso this zzso zzso response in zzso zzso and in zzso in a synergistic and zzso zzso Studies in which zzso was injected into lean mice lacking individual zzso receptors indicated that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso primarily via the zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso appeared to augment this zzso Finally, zzso zzso in zzso occurred via the protein zzso C signaling zzso and the zzso factor nuclear zzso Thus, zzso can positively zzso its own zzso in zzso zzso contributing to the maintenance of elevated zzso in zzso
