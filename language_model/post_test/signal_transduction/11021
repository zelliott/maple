Early development of the lens and zzso depends upon zzso zzso interactions between the embryonic surface zzso and the underlying zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in this signal zzso The zzso protein zzso is a major zzso of zzso signaling by providing a link between zzso receptors zzso and a variety of zzso signaling zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso recruits four molecules of the zzso protein zzso and two molecules of the protein zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso In this report, we explore the role of signaling pathways downstream of zzso in eye development by analyzing the zzso of mice that carry point zzso in either the zzso or the zzso sites zzso of zzso Although zzso mice exhibited normal early eye development, all zzso zzso were defective in eye development and showed zzso or zzso zzso with the critical role of zzso in zzso zzso the level of activated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was significantly lower than that observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso and zzso molecular markers for lens zzso were decreased in the zzso zzso lens zzso Similarly, the expression of zzso and zzso genes required for retinal precursor proliferation and for lens development, respectively, was also decreased in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso signals that depend on specific zzso zzso in zzso lie upstream of gene products critical for induction of lens and zzso
