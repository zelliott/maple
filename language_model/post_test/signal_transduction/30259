zzso zzso regulates zzso synaptic transmission at several zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso of group zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission in the zzso zzso gray zzso a region involved in organizing behavioral responses to threat, stress, and zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso transmission in the zzso Using zzso recordings from rat zzso zzso we found that evoked zzso were reduced by the zzso zzso transport zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid, but not by the zzso zzso blocker zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on evoked zzso when zzso zzso into the zzso zzso was selectively zzso zzso increased the zzso ratio of evoked zzso and reduced the rate but not the zzso of spontaneous miniature zzso The effect of zzso on evoked zzso was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of both zzso and zzso were reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, although zzso and zzso had no effect on single evoked zzso they increased evoked zzso during repetitive zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso limit zzso zzso and zzso zzso but may be overwhelmed during conditions of elevated zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso play a key role in regulating zzso cross talk between zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso
