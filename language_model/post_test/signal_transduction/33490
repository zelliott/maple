zzso is the most universal second zzso in cells from the very first moment of zzso In all animal species, zzso eggs exhibit massive zzso of zzso zzso to orchestrate the initial events of zzso zzso eggs have been an excellent model system for studying zzso and the cell cycle due to their large size and zzso In preparation for zzso the cell zzso zzso must undergo zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso have shown that zzso signaling is intimately involved in this zzso Our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of zzso maturation and zzso has expanded greatly in the past two decades due to the discovery of cell zzso zzso and zzso second zzso However, the molecular details of their actions await zzso of other cellular elements that assist in the creation and zzso of zzso zzso In this regard, the zzso zzso the receptors for second zzso and the zzso proteins also require more zzso This article reviews the zzso significance and the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso during maturation and zzso
