Abstract The dualistic activities of the zzso beta zzso zzso as a zzso and ubiquitous constituent of zzso deposits in Alzheimer's disease plaques and as an zzso of zzso zzso function has been suggested but the mechanisms are far from being zzso In this report we measure several zzso stress parameters and signaling zzso in brains of fetal rats subjected to global zzso in order to evaluate the putative zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso injection of 6 zzso zzso into zzso rat fetuses zzso 3 g body zzso resulted after 24 h in the appearance of the zzso in various fetal zzso including brain where it enhanced the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the levels of zzso signaling activities such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso reversed the consequences of a transient zzso zzso stress by restoring zzso levels via its recycling zzso and by lowering the production of zzso zzso presumably by zzso the aforementioned zzso signaling zzso It also caused a reduction in the number of zzso zzso cells and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso to zzso stimulates fetal tolerance to zzso via regulation of zzso metabolism and as such may be considered as zzso
