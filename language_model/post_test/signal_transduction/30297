The G alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, which includes zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso plays a critical role in the development of cardiac zzso and heart failure zzso It has been reported that the expression of a zzso active zzso of the G protein alpha zzso zzso in the hearts of transgenic mice zzso alpha zzso zzso cardiac zzso and lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and controls its cellular levels, thus acting as a regulator of zzso zzso It has been found that transgenic mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling and subsequent cardiac zzso so this study tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso could rescue G alpha zzso mice from developing zzso 

Double transgenic mice zzso alpha zzso zzso with zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and G alpha zzso were generated by crossing G alpha zzso with zzso zzso mice, and the zzso consequences were zzso zzso zzso prevented cardiac dysfunction, determined by zzso of left zzso zzso dimensions, reduction of zzso fractional zzso and marked increases in zzso zzso pressure in G alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in G alpha zzso mice were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso improved the survival rate of G alpha zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate the first evidence that zzso zzso blocks cardiac dysfunction and progression to lethal zzso by activated G alpha zzso protein without zzso adverse effects in the zzso heart and suggest that zzso zzso is a novel therapeutic target for zzso
