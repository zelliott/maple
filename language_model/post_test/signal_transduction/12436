Previous reports of zzso between zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso have pointed to the existence of zzso regulation between the sympathetic nervous system and the zzso system at the zzso zzso This regulation may have an important role in the control of blood pressure and may be modified in different cardiovascular zzso Aging is considered to be an independent cardiovascular risk zzso Nevertheless, neither the variation in zzso action or interaction of signal zzso between these two receptors as a result of aging has been zzso To clarify these aspects, the interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso 

The zzso response of zzso to zzso was assessed in the presence and absence of zzso II using the left zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso adult, middle aged, elderly and aged, zzso male zzso zzso In the four age groups of rat hearts, the activities of zzso zzso were measured when just the zzso zzso was zzso or when both zzso and zzso were zzso The activities of zzso zzso zzso and the levels of zzso zzso were investigated when just the zzso zzso was zzso or when both zzso and zzso were zzso 

No effect was found on the cumulative zzso curve for zzso when zzso was activated in zzso or zzso zzso However, in zzso and zzso rats, the maximum positive zzso response and the negative zzso of the effective 50% concentration increased zzso No effect was found on the cumulative concentration response curve induced by zzso when zzso was zzso The activities of zzso zzso increased significantly in zzso and zzso rats, but there was no difference in zzso and zzso rats when zzso and zzso were both activated compared with when just zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso levels decreased significantly when both zzso and zzso were activated compared with when just zzso was zzso 

In the isolated left zzso of elderly and aged rats, the zzso of zzso enhanced the positive zzso response induced by the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso had no effect on the positive zzso response induced by the zzso of zzso The action of zzso increased the signal zzso of zzso in zzso and middle-aged rat hearts but had no effect in elderly and aged zzso The action of zzso had no effect on zzso signal zzso
