Despite the importance of blood vessels and zzso vessels during development and disease, the zzso pathways underpinning vessel construction remain poorly zzso zzso mouse zzso cells have traditionally proven difficult to culture and as a consequence, few zzso have been developed to dissect gene function and signal zzso pathways in these cells ex zzso Having established methodology for the zzso short-term culture and zzso of primary blood zzso and zzso zzso vascular zzso cells isolated from embryonic mouse skin, we sought to zzso robust zzso able to measure embryonic zzso zzso migration and three-dimensional tube forming ability in zzso In the course of developing these zzso using the zzso growth factors zzso and zzso we identified previously zzso roles for zzso zzso in zzso The small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso promotes proliferation directly via zzso receptors and independently of zzso receptors in primary embryonic zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso was by far the zzso zzso zzso expressed by primary embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso promoted zzso proliferation and migration, three zzso tube formation zzso revealed that zzso primarily promoted zzso zzso and zzso illustrating that zzso and zzso play zzso cooperative roles in zzso vascular zzso These zzso therefore provide useful tools able to dissect gene function in cellular events important for zzso and zzso zzso as a key player in zzso zzso in zzso
