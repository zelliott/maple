zzso is a newly identified gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso and associated with tumor invasion and poor zzso We aim to examine the biological function of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso expressions were examined in human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cells to silence zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on zzso cell proliferation in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso were zzso zzso zzso profiling was used to detect the presence of zzso in zzso zzso cells and to differentiate cell cycle zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso reporter zzso to examine the activities of nuclear zzso zzso signaling pathways in response to tumor necrosis factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression level was abundance in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso cells, whilst zzso exhibited a zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso cell proliferation and colony zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in an increased zzso and cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso zzso also exhibited an zzso effect in zzso which zzso as tumor zzso growth zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the responsiveness of zzso signaling zzso to the stimulation with zzso in zzso Moreover, the similar zzso effects of zzso silence on zzso cells were also zzso 

zzso contributes to zzso progression by reducing cell zzso and overcoming cell cycle zzso The zzso and zzso effects of zzso may be zzso by zzso signaling zzso
