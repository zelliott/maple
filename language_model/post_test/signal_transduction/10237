The zzso reactions after spinal zzso injury are accompanied by local synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso exerts its effects by binding to zzso acid receptors zzso which zzso with zzso X receptors zzso and then act as zzso zzso zzso To identify possible cellular targets of zzso we investigated protein levels and cellular distribution of zzso receptors in the rat spinal zzso at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days after a zzso zzso In the zzso spinal cord, zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso was localized in the zzso of zzso that of zzso and zzso in zzso and that of zzso zzso and zzso in some zzso After zzso injury zzso and all zzso appeared in the cell zzso of zzso zzso and zzso This nuclear zzso began at 4 days, was most prominent at 7 and 14 days and had decreased at 21 days after zzso A similar nuclear zzso was also observed for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso situated around the border of the zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso as a signal for the zzso responses of zzso and zzso after zzso zzso
