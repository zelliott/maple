zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso by forming small zzso zzso pores and zzso cellular signaling by delivering into host cells an zzso zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso Both zzso delivery and pore formation were previously shown to involve a predicted zzso zzso containing a pair of zzso charged zzso and zzso zzso Another predicted zzso zzso comprises a zzso and zzso zzso We examined the roles of these zzso in the activity of zzso zzso of zzso increased specific zzso activity of zzso by two different molecular zzso Replacement of zzso by positively charged zzso zzso zzso increased the propensity of zzso to form zzso whereas zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso extended the lifetime of open single pore zzso All three zzso also caused a drop of pore selectivity for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso or positively charged zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also the specific zzso activity of zzso In contrast, the zzso substitution enhanced the zzso activity of zzso 4 times, increasing both the frequency of formation and lifetime of toxin zzso zzso charge at position zzso but not at position zzso was found to be essential for zzso selectivity of the zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso filtering inside or close to pore zzso The pairs of zzso zzso in the predicted zzso segments of zzso thus appear to play a key functional role in membrane zzso and zzso activities of zzso
