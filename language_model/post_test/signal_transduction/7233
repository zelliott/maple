zzso is an zzso zzso with protective effects against a cluster of zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso The zzso exerts its zzso effects by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso as well as by direct zzso with insulin signaling zzso zzso and insulin signaling pathways zzso at the zzso protein zzso On the one hand, zzso interacts with zzso receptors and mediates both zzso and vascular actions of zzso through zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso both the actions and zzso of insulin by zzso the zzso activity in multiple insulin target zzso In obese animals, reduced zzso expression contributes to both insulin resistance and defective insulin zzso This review summarizes recent advances on the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso insulin actions, and discusses the roles of zzso in regulating both zzso and insulin signaling zzso
