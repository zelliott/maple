The process of zzso is most readily studied in species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The closure of zzso mouse ear zzso zzso holes provides a zzso model of unusual wound zzso in which a zzso structure closes the ear hole and cartilage and hair zzso are zzso Recent studies, based on a broad level of DNA damage and a cell cycle pattern of zzso zzso showed that zzso was missing from the zzso mouse ear and that a zzso mouse could close its ear zzso Given the zzso axis of control of DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, zzso and zzso we tested the role of zzso in the ear hole zzso zzso Using zzso mice, we found that loss of zzso in zzso mice did not show reduced zzso Furthermore, cross sections of zzso zzso mouse ears at 6 weeks zzso showed an increased level of zzso and zzso in the region of healing whereas zzso or zzso mice showed zzso alone in this same region, though at later time zzso In addition, we also investigated other cell zzso zzso mice to determine how zzso was being zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso mice show little healing zzso Interestingly, a partial healing zzso in mice with a dual zzso knockout zzso was zzso These data demonstrate an independence of zzso signaling for mouse zzso zzso and suggest that the role of zzso in this process is possibly through the zzso of the zzso zzso
