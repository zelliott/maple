zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso is zzso primarily in the zzso compartment of the human prostate and may regulate zzso as well as zzso cell growth and zzso The primary zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown recently to be zzso by zzso coupled receptors zzso through regulated zzso zzso of the zzso precursor form of zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that human prostate zzso especially tissue from benign zzso zzso zzso has high zzso converting zzso activity, and a high density of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso II signals through zzso we tested the possibility that zzso II could zzso zzso in human prostate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and early passage zzso cells were used as an in zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso or zzso II and total cell zzso were harvested for zzso and Western zzso Cell growth was measured by zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso II receptors zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors were activated by zzso Furthermore, zzso II was able to zzso both zzso and zzso and this zzso activity could be abolished by zzso with zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso with its zzso activity, zzso II modestly promoted zzso cell growth and this effect was abolished by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 

These experiments suggest a regulatory role for zzso II in the prostate zzso and zzso the zzso zzso growth factor zzso as a zzso of zzso II signaling in the zzso
