zzso of zzso zzso zzso triggers signaling pathways regulating various cellular events that contribute to tissue development and zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributes to tumor progression as well as therapeutic resistance in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a focal zzso zzso that is a member of the zzso zzso Its expression is zzso by zzso and elevated zzso mediates zzso cell zzso In the presence of zzso we found that zzso treatment elevated the level of zzso protein but not zzso The extended zzso of activated zzso sustained its signaling zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso degradation by binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreasing the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso is not only required for binding to the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso but is also essential for the zzso observed in the presence of zzso Public database analyses indicated that zzso zzso levels are elevated in breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not correlated with zzso zzso levels in these zzso In contrast, zzso analyses of lung cancer specimens showed that zzso and zzso protein levels were positively zzso in support of our finding that zzso regulates zzso protein levels through a zzso zzso Overall, this work defines a function for zzso in zzso signaling from zzso by reducing its zzso zzso
