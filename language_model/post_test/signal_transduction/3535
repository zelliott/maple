zzso acid receptors zzso which are involved in zzso acid signal zzso are essential for maintaining the differentiated state of zzso zzso zzso zzso are skin zzso whose development is initiated through continuous zzso interactions between the zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso progress has been made in zzso the molecular basis of these interactions in zzso zzso formation in mouse zzso including the network of initiating signals zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso positioning and the zzso factors, zzso and zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso acid signaling may also be involved in zzso zzso zzso We documented the expression of zzso zzso that produce zzso acid zzso and zzso that degrade it zzso zzso We also analyzed the expression of zzso a direct zzso target of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso mouse zzso in zzso adjacent to the flank region where zzso buds 2, 3 and 4 zzso These expression patterns overlapped with that of zzso which is known to be required for zzso zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in the zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso protein was expressed in the zzso zzso and developing fat zzso zzso acid levels in organ cultures of zzso mouse zzso zzso were manipulated by adding either zzso acid or zzso a zzso acid synthesis zzso zzso zzso acid synthesis altered the expression of genes involved in zzso acid zzso and also demonstrated that zzso acid signaling is required for zzso zzso whereas high levels of zzso acid signaling inhibited zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso The results of the experiments using zzso against zzso and zzso suggested feedback interactions that regulate zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso We produced a molecular model for zzso zzso initiation that incorporated zzso acid zzso
