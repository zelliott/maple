We previously demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso may contribute to the development of acquired resistance in zzso zzso In this study, we determine whether the sensitivities of parental and its zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso were dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso cells was found to be significantly higher than that of its parental zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity in zzso cells while showing no effect on its parental cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso zzso analysis, we showed that zzso zzso cells were more resistant than control cells to zzso zzso In particular, the expression of the gene zzso which has been known to act as an inhibitor on zzso zzso was zzso after the treatment with zzso zzso zzso also revealed that zzso of zzso was associated with altered zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein zzso cells were more susceptible to zzso treatment than control zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the enhancement of zzso zzso activity by zzso of zzso is associated with high sensitivity to zzso
