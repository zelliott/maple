The small heat shock zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are known to be more prone to retinal zzso than the wild type mice in Experimental zzso zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that intravenous administration of zzso preserves retinal architecture and prevents zzso damage in zzso Interestingly, only zzso and not zzso zzso a closely related small heat shock protein works, pointing to molecular specificity in the observed retinal zzso The possible involvement of zzso in retinal protection through immune zzso is zzso by zzso transfer experiments, zzso zzso and wild type mice with zzso as donors and zzso as the recipient zzso which indicate that zzso protects against the zzso challenge by modulating the systemic B and T cell zzso We show that zzso administration causes marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both in the zzso and in the zzso notably, zzso was only reduced in the zzso suggesting local zzso zzso expression of zzso receptors and their associated zzso is also inhibited suggesting that zzso protection, against zzso loss in zzso is associated with systemic suppression of both the zzso and innate immune zzso
