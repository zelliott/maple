zzso evidence suggests that dysfunction of T cells zzso the zzso of systemic lupus zzso zzso We revealed that zzso T cells produced an zzso excessive amount of zzso zzso upon stimulation through zzso and the expression level of zzso zzso was significantly zzso The production of zzso by zzso T cells was zzso correlated with the expression level of zzso zzso This correlation was abolished when the cells were zzso with zzso and zzso which bypass zzso and introduce signals directly into the cells, but the production of zzso by zzso T cells remained zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that regulatory mechanisms not only for the expression of zzso zzso but also for the production of zzso were impaired in zzso T zzso These zzso may be responsible for the zzso responses of zzso T cells and partly involved in the development of zzso
