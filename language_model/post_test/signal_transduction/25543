The purpose of the current study is to examine the surface expression of zzso receptors and the zzso toward the respective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells isolated from the blood and the zzso fluid zzso of a multiple sclerosis zzso zzso Four clones were selected, two isolated from the peripheral blood and two from the zzso zzso and zzso were expressed on all four zzso Both zzso clones also expressed zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso Similarly, one zzso clone expressed zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were either expressed on few cells or were not expressed at all on all four clones zzso The expression of zzso receptors was zzso with the ability of the cells to respond zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso expression and zzso were reduced upon zzso with zzso and zzso The shared expression of zzso receptors and the migration patterns suggest that zzso cells have migrated from the blood into the zzso and that local zzso within the inflamed zzso may zzso the expression of zzso receptors and hence impede their migration zzso The results may also explain the beneficial synergistic effects of combining zzso drugs with zzso in zzso zzso
