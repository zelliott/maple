zzso of zzso signaling has led to significant tumor shrinkage as well as recovery from several traumatic and zzso injury models indicating its potential clinical zzso We have tested both an zzso and zzso of zzso signaling to study the effects of zzso zzso on spinal zzso vascular pathology following traumatic zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso showed their respective zzso in zzso Mice were treated with either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immediately following a zzso zzso injury through an initial jugular zzso and tail vein injections for 3 days zzso After 14 days, zzso zzso signaling decreased the overall vascular density within the zzso gray matter compared to controls while maintaining the density of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling did not change the density or zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso Furthermore, neither zzso nor zzso of zzso signaling significantly altered zzso zzso and zzso volume in the epicenter and zzso zzso neither treatment changed locomotor zzso In zzso retinal vascular zzso administration of zzso and zzso zzso increased and decreased both tip cell numbers and branch points in each treatment, zzso However, these agents did not zzso primary zzso zzso proliferation in zzso in spite of sufficient zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso while an important part of zzso zzso may play a lesser role in zzso vascular recovery following traumatic injury to the zzso
