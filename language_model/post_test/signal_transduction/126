Human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso have recently shown the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell lineages in all three embryonic germ zzso The zzso differentiation of zzso in zzso culture has been reported, while the differentiation in three-dimensional zzso has not yet been reported for zzso zzso Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using zzso for bone tissue zzso zzso were cultured in zzso zzso zzso scaffolds in zzso medium zzso for 3 weeks, after which the scaffolds were exposed to several different media, including the zzso a zzso medium zzso and the zzso with either 10 or 100 zzso zzso growth factor zzso The zzso differentiation was confirmed by the zzso of zzso and zzso calcium zzso and bone zzso Switching from the zzso to the zzso promoted collagen synthesis and calcium content per cell, while continuing in the zzso retained more cells in the zzso and promoted higher zzso gene zzso The addition of IGF-1 into the zzso had no effect on cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso show significant potential for bone tissue engineering and zzso in the zzso throughout the entire period is beneficial for zzso differentiation of these zzso
