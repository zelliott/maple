Nuclear calcium zzso regulates a number of important cellular zzso including gene transcription, growth, and zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso signaling is regulated differently in the nucleus and zzso To investigate this possibility, we examined zzso mechanisms of zzso release in the zzso liver cell zzso The type II zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed to a similar extent in the zzso zzso and nucleus, whereas the type III zzso was concentrated in the zzso zzso and the type I zzso was not zzso zzso signals induced by low zzso zzso started earlier or were larger in the nucleus than in the zzso indicating higher sensitivity of nuclear zzso stores for zzso Nuclear zzso channels were active at lower zzso zzso than zzso from zzso Enriched expression of type II zzso in the nucleus results in greater sensitivity of the nucleus to zzso thus providing a mechanism for independent regulation of zzso processes in this cellular zzso
