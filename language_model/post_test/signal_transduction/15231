Most zzso express multiple proteins containing zzso zzso repeats accounting for a large zzso of related but unique zzso of zzso zzso Recently, select members of this novel family of zzso proteins have drawn considerable attention for their potential roles in modulating zzso signaling networks during viral zzso The zzso zzso zzso virus zzso encodes four unique zzso repeat zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which include a zzso zzso domain which closely resembles a cellular protein motif called the zzso zzso Here, we show that each zzso zzso repeat zzso including zzso interacts directly with the zzso component of the host zzso zzso zzso complex, and that the binding of zzso to zzso 1 is indirect via binding to zzso in the host zzso zzso To understand the significance of these zzso protein zzso the various binding zzso of zzso were zzso The zzso zzso repeats I and II were identified as being important for interaction with zzso whereas the zzso zzso domain was essential for binding to zzso We also report that zzso can bind zzso and the host zzso complex (via zzso simultaneously in zzso zzso Finally, we report that zzso specifically mediates the zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso during infection with the zzso zzso but not the zzso knockout version of the zzso These results indicate that zzso proteins play a critical role in zzso disparate cellular signaling zzso to establish a new cellular environment more favorable for virus zzso
