zzso Swiss zzso cells can be induced to re-enter the cell cycle by stimulation of a variety of growth zzso signal zzso zzso We have zzso this cell system to investigate the point of convergence of zzso zzso by zzso the changes that distinct zzso induce in the components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery (the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso In the presence of insulin, zzso of zzso protein zzso caused a dramatic zzso zzso of zzso an increase in zzso D3 but had little effect on zzso D1 levels, whilst zzso of protein zzso C had a more modest effect on zzso D3 and zzso but caused a striking zzso in the expression of zzso zzso The zzso zzso when combined with insulin, caused increased expression of zzso D1 and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Thus each combination of zzso agents had different effects on the components responsible for regulating the orderly progression of the cell zzso This outcome is incompatible with a single route to zzso and demonstrates that different zzso remain distinct in the zzso responses they zzso only zzso at the levels of the expression of the zzso zzso and the inhibitor zzso
