zzso fusion is a critical process for the terminal differentiation of skeletal zzso To zzso the zzso mechanisms regulating zzso fusion, we studied the roles of signaling through the small zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso fusion of mouse zzso zzso We found that zzso activity, which was high in zzso zzso decreased during zzso zzso of a zzso active form of zzso blocked zzso fusion, but not the earlier steps of zzso zzso ROCK activity was also decreased in zzso zzso cells, and an active ROCK zzso prevented their zzso Furthermore, zzso of ROCK by the specific inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso fusion, even in cells expressing the active zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso We also found that zzso signaling was required for retaining zzso a zzso factor implicated in zzso fusion, in the zzso and that zzso of ROCK was essential for the nuclear zzso of zzso that took place just before the onset of zzso zzso Moreover, ROCK directly zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso signaling is a prerequisite for zzso nuclear zzso and zzso fusion in zzso cells, providing evidence for a novel regulatory role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
