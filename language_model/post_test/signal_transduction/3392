The developing limb is one of the first systems where it was proposed that a zzso zzso is involved in pattern zzso This zzso for specifying zzso information across the zzso axis is based on Sonic zzso zzso from the polarizing zzso Recent evidence suggests that Sonic zzso zzso also specifies zzso information across the zzso axis by a timing mechanism acting in parallel with graded zzso The progress zone model for specifying zzso pattern, involving timing to provide cells with zzso information, continues to be challenged, and there is further evidence that graded zzso by zzso acid specifies the zzso part of the zzso Other recent papers present the first evidence that zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso govern cell zzso involved in outgrowth and zzso of the developing zzso
