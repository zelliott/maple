The zzso zzso zzso complex, which consists of a zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is known to regulate early zzso zzso The zzso complex contains zzso zzso as a zzso zzso but the exact zzso composition of the fully assembled zzso complex remains to be zzso In particular, the association of the zzso zzso with the zzso is zzso In the present study, we have generated a zzso zzso against the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and zzso a zzso composition of the zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso is physically associated with the zzso in immature T zzso Thus, the result strongly supports the previous findings that zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
