We wish to implement a zzso approach to pick and identify the proteins associated with zzso enhancing efficacy of zzso inducing zzso of zzso cancer zzso cells, and further explore their zzso mechanism by zzso 

A zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso treated by zzso combined with zzso in different ways respectively was used as our comparative zzso zzso spots were analyzed through zzso The location and function of differential protein spots were analyzed through zzso zzso zzso interactions were examined through String zzso 

A total of 54 protein spots zzso expressed with zzso difference were zzso 11 of which were zzso They mainly were involved in zzso calcium zzso cellular respiratory chain zzso and zzso zzso reaction pathways of zzso zzso According to the function of various protein points, combining with varying zzso of protein points in each treatment groups, we selected five interesting protein spots, 4 of which exists zzso zzso and they were close to the formation and reduction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We selected preliminary but comprehensive data about differential expression protein spots of zzso zzso Among these, the five interesting differential expression protein spots identified in this study may provide new insight into zzso cell therapeutic zzso zzso may suppress zzso expression to enhance the lethal effect of zzso on zzso cells, and maybe their combination via the affection of zzso and zzso to disturb the formation and reduction of zzso results in inducing zzso of zzso zzso
