The first complete zzso sequences of two zzso zzso zzso double stranded DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso Both are small zzso zzso with short, zzso tails and a zzso zzso Based on their zzso their zzso size, the similarity of the zzso gene products, the type of infection and on the possession of a type B DNA zzso zzso and zzso are allocated to the order zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso differs from that of zzso by a deletion spanning zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the terminal DNA fragments of zzso DNA and zzso DNA protein complex suggested the presence of a terminal protein at either DNA zzso In contrast to the zzso cassette of the zzso zzso which is located at the end of the late zzso the zzso cassette of zzso and zzso is located within the structural zzso
