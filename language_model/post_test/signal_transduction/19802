zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a dual zzso zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso cell zzso migration, and tumor zzso We have uncovered a previously zzso role for zzso in regulating zzso entry through transient zzso potential zzso channel 6 zzso that does not require zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso permit zzso to associate with zzso The inflammatory zzso zzso promotes this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso cell surface expression and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso activity, did not alter zzso zzso zzso failed to increase zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells, zzso the zzso zzso zzso Paradoxically, we also show that zzso failed to induce zzso cell migration and tube formation in cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso through zzso zzso serves as a scaffold for zzso enabling cell surface expression of the zzso zzso entry through zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso and directly promotes zzso Thus, zzso is indicated to play a role beyond suppressing zzso zzso
