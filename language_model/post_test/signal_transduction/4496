In this study, we describe that the zzso protein zzso is a crucial element for the generation of signaling asymmetry during the cellular response to polarized zzso zzso We analyze the role of zzso in the control of asymmetry in two independent models of T cell zzso migratory response to zzso and the establishment of zzso interactions between T cells and zzso cells zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso approaches demonstrate that zzso is vital for the generation of polarized zzso structures such as the leading edge and the contact zone with zzso We found that the mechanism by which zzso controls zzso zzso relies on its mandatory role for zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso controls zzso through a specific association with the zzso zzso zzso interacting protein zzso which occurs in response to zzso of zzso by zzso at zzso Our data indicate the key role of zzso in the generation of functional asymmetry in T cells and provide a novel zzso link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso
