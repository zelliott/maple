zzso adult zzso is usually characterized by inflammatory cell zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to reveal how the zzso migration and retention in zzso zzso is zzso we have focused on the molecular basis for the adhesive interactions between zzso and human zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the involvement of cell zzso molecules in adhesive interactions between zzso and zzso We found that activated zzso bound strongly to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play crucial roles in the zzso Interestingly, we first revealed that zzso molecules zzso zzso on zzso also participated in zzso interactions and that zzso anchored on the surface of zzso functioned as the zzso for zzso In addition, when zzso were zzso with inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso the binding zzso between zzso and zzso was significantly increased and the zzso was mainly zzso by zzso zzso We then examined the possibility whether zzso interaction may cause zzso of zzso When zzso directly zzso with zzso for 3 zzso zzso beta zzso expression was clearly increased in zzso These findings suggested that the adhesive interactions between zzso and zzso was zzso at least by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that the zzso zzso interactions could mutually cause zzso signal zzso
