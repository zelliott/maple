zzso of zzso zzso T zzso cells with the zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso T cell responses, a property that has been used to enhance the efficacy of zzso zzso Using zzso mice, we now show that the zzso properties of zzso cells require that zzso triggering and zzso presentation to zzso T cells occur on the same zzso We demonstrate that injection of zzso triggers zzso expression on zzso T cell zone zzso cells and that this is dependent on zzso zzso zzso we show that blocking the interaction between zzso and zzso its zzso zzso on T cells, abrogates the ability of zzso cells to promote a zzso T cell response and zzso the efficacy of zzso as an zzso for zzso zzso These results define a key role for zzso in linking the innate response of zzso cells to the zzso of zzso T zzso
