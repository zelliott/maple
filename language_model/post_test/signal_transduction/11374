The influence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the growth processes of roots of zzso old wheat zzso was zzso It was shown that the zzso of the root growth increased with the increase of zzso concentration and zzso zzso The membrane potential of root cells was lower and the loss of zzso by cells was greater when roots were treated with 5 zzso zzso compared with the zzso The growth zzso by zzso was decreased by zzso zzso partially by zzso at the beginning of growth and completely by sodium throughout the experimental zzso The zzso zzso calcium and zzso decreased the zzso zzso of root growth by reducing the rate of zzso zzso by zzso zzso controlled by zzso zzso reversed the zzso root growth zzso in zzso old zzso but did not prevent the zzso during subsequent zzso It can be concluded that zzso effects on wheat root growth are zzso by a partial zzso of signal zzso for proliferation (via the zzso zzso because of calcium zzso and caused by modification of zzso transporting systems of the zzso and by zzso of zzso zzso primarily zzso and zzso
