We propose an abstraction method for zzso zzso networks, based on hybrid zzso systems with continuous zzso zzso This abstraction method follows naturally from the notion of zzso zzso rate laws with continuous zzso linear functions and can be easily zzso An efficient zzso zzso is possible for the resulting class of hybrid zzso An efficient zzso zzso is possible for the resulting class of hybrid zzso An approximation for an ordinary differential equation model of the zzso zzso is constructed, and it is shown that the abstraction passes the same experimental tests as were used to validate the original zzso The well studied biological system exhibits zzso and switching zzso arising from positive feedback in the expression mechanism of the zzso zzso The switching property of the zzso system is an example of the major qualitative features that are the building blocks of higher level, more zzso zzso The present approach is useful in helping to correctly identify such properties and in connecting them to the underlying molecular zzso zzso zzso analysis together with the knowledge of the zzso structure are used to identify ranges of zzso values for which the system maintains the zzso switching zzso
