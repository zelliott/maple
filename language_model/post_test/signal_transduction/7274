Pulmonary zzso zzso is a progressing lung injury initiated by pulmonary inflammation zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso of zzso through early zzso and extensive zzso zzso zzso This study is aimed to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and if so, the benefits of zzso resulted from zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso male mice were zzso administered zzso (4 zzso at day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SIM (5 zzso Plus zzso zzso zzso + SIM zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso were orally and daily administered for 7 and 28 days, respectively, to mice, sacrificed at zzso and zzso to isolate the lung zzso for examining the inflammatory and zzso signaling and measuring the cell population and zzso activity in zzso zzso fluid zzso 

zzso and zzso significantly decreased zzso counts in zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso assessed by zzso and zzso zzso stain and treated with zzso and zzso Lung zzso were determined the contents of collagen and the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso These changes zzso by zzso and inhibited by various zzso zzso and zzso predominantly prevented zzso expression at zzso and reduced zzso zzso and zzso at zzso 

zzso and zzso restore zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso collagen disposition and reduce zzso inflammatory cells, potentially useful for the treatment of zzso zzso
