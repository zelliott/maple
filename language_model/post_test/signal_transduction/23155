zzso is used frequently in both transplantation and zzso Although historically thought to have little zzso effect, there is growing evidence of zzso zzso This Review draws evidence for zzso toxicity from clinical studies of zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso as an zzso agent, as well as from experimental zzso Together, these studies provide evidence that zzso has significant zzso effects on zzso function and survival and peripheral insulin zzso The mechanism of action of zzso is via zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso This Review describes the complex zzso signaling zzso which control vital cellular functions including zzso translation, cell zzso cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso and examines molecular mechanisms for zzso toxicity in zzso These mechanisms include reductions in zzso size, mass, proliferation and insulin zzso alongside increases in zzso zzso and peripheral insulin zzso These data bring into question the use of zzso as an zzso in zzso transplantation and as a zzso agent in other transplant recipients developing zzso diabetes after transplantation with zzso zzso It also highlights the importance of close monitoring of blood zzso levels in patients taking zzso as an zzso treatment, particularly those with zzso zzso zzso
