Numerous proteins involved in diverse aspects of cell biology undergo a process of zzso modification termed zzso The zzso zzso consists of three zzso steps, the final of which is zzso of the zzso zzso formed in the first two steps by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the prevalence of zzso proteins in cancer biology, and the findings that several of the proteins are involved in processes controlling cell migration and zzso we sought to examine the role of zzso - zzso zzso on cell behavior associated with zzso We found that zzso of zzso reduces migration of the highly zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso In addition, cell zzso and cell spreading were also impaired by zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso of zzso significantly decreased the zzso of both zzso and zzso which are both zzso zzso The data obtained were consistent with the decreased zzso being due to an increase in zzso zzso inhibitor zzso binding by both proteins in the absence of their zzso zzso the addition of zzso zzso or zzso to cells in which zzso was inhibited was able to zzso but zzso rescue directed and random migration, zzso These results establish a role for zzso zzso in cell migration, and point to specific zzso proteins involved in this zzso The zzso zzso has been targeted for zzso therapies, but the role of zzso in cell zzso had been largely unexplored until zzso The finding that zzso of zzso family members impacts on a specific component of their function provides an additional avenue through which to interrogate the biology of this important class of regulatory zzso
