zzso information about immune zzso complexes is important for understanding signal zzso zzso We have used the zzso zzso cell zzso system for identification of zzso bonds within and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso element of the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 113 and 135 of zzso and zzso respectively, form the zzso zzso bridge stabilizing the zzso zzso in both zzso cells and the B cell line zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso cells, two putative zzso zzso bonds in the zzso domain of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso form the zzso zzso fold zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso also bind zzso Individual zzso to zzso zzso in zzso had no influence on zzso zzso zzso expression on the surface of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression on the surface of B cells expressing zzso was reduced, indicating that this zzso bond is prerequisite for efficient zzso zzso Our data also suggest that the zzso zzso can assemble into zzso
