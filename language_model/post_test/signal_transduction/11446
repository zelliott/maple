To determine which zzso pathways mediate the survival effects of zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso on zzso we studied the zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso At shorter time points, zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso inhibitor suppressed zzso and muscle zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso a zzso zzso was not able to prevent zzso survival, demonstrating that zzso is not zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso prevented the zzso effects of zzso When zzso of zzso zzso activity were performed at later stages following zzso treatment a significant increase was observed compared to control zzso This delayed increase of activity could be completely prevented by treatment with protein synthesis or zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso induce zzso survival through a zzso zzso zzso requiring de zzso protein synthesis dependent on zzso zzso
