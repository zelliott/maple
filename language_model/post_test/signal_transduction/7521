zzso is a benign zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by the zzso of zzso with abundant production of zzso debris in the middle zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso is one of the most important pathways in regulating cell survival and zzso We hypothesized that the zzso signaling zzso may be activated and involved in the cellular zzso mechanism in acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso protein was performed in 40 zzso samples and 20 samples of normal external auditory canal zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was significantly increased when compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a significant positive association was observed between zzso and zzso expression and between the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso No significant relationships were observed between the levels of investigated proteins and the degree of bone destruction zzso zzso zzso The increased protein expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their associations in zzso zzso suggest that the zzso survival signaling zzso is active and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of cellular zzso in zzso zzso
