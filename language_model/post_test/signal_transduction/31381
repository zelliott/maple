Recently, we have found that some zzso complexes are potent zzso compounds for treating both type I and type II diabetic zzso However, the functional mechanism of zzso complexes is not fully zzso In this report, we have shown that zzso complexes such as zzso zzso and zzso act on the insulin signaling zzso in zzso zzso Among them, zzso was found to be the highest potent zzso in inducing not only the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso but also the zzso of downstream zzso in the insulin zzso such as zzso and zzso which in turn zzso the zzso zzso to the plasma zzso Then, we examined whether or not zzso exhibit the zzso activity in zzso diabetic mice, and found that zzso is more effective than the others in improving the zzso of the zzso Our present data indicate that both zzso of insulin signaling pathway, which follows the zzso zzso to the plasma zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso complexes cause the zzso effect in diabetic zzso
