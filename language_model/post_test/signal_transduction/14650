zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso and second zzso implicated in the regulation of a variety of biological processes in diverse zzso In zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso regulate zzso and zzso gene zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is important for the transition of zzso zzso from the environment to the zzso However, the mechanism behind this regulation remains zzso Recently, it was proposed that the zzso protein domain represents a zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso proteins bind zzso specifically and are involved in the regulation of zzso formation, zzso and zzso These findings confirm a role for zzso proteins as zzso proteins within the zzso signaling zzso
