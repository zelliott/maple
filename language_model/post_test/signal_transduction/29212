Many studies in the zzso zzso have characterized the differentiation of zzso cells as a zzso class of zzso but little is known about the genes and factors that regulate the development of distinct types of zzso zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to characterize the development of the zzso zzso cells and identify factors that influence their zzso zzso zzso cells in the embryonic chick zzso were identified by using zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

We found that as zzso cells differentiate they expressed the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso As differentiation zzso zzso zzso cells, displaced to the zzso cell layer, zzso expressed high levels of cellular zzso acid binding protein zzso and zzso while zzso cells in the inner nuclear layer did zzso Although there is a zzso ratio of zzso to zzso cells in zzso in zzso cell cultures the zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso the zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The relative abundance of zzso to zzso cells was not influenced by Sonic zzso zzso but was affected by compounds that act at zzso zzso zzso In addition, the abundance and mosaic patterning of zzso zzso zzso cells is disrupted by interfering with zzso zzso 

We conclude that: zzso during development zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are not zzso zzso the zzso differences between these zzso of cells is controlled by the local zzso and zzso appropriate levels of zzso signaling between the zzso zzso cells are required for proper mosaic zzso
