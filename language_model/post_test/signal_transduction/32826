Low temperature is an important environmental factor influencing plant growth and zzso In this study, we report the characterization of a genetic zzso zzso which is defined by three zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso result in enhanced expression of zzso and other stress genes under low temperature zzso Gene expression in response to zzso stress or zzso is not affected in the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso are zzso and in a nuclear zzso Compared with the zzso plants, the zzso zzso plants are less capable of developing freezing tolerance when treated with low zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso does not impair the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a negative regulator of low temperature signal zzso important for plant cold zzso
