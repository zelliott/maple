zzso are cell surface receptors found on zzso that facilitate zzso to both cellular and zzso zzso These zzso are thought to be involved in the selective gene induction observed after zzso zzso to various zzso zzso To investigate this hypothesis, we zzso zzso with zzso zzso to different zzso receptors to specifically mimic the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the common beta chain of the beta 1 zzso of zzso resulted in expression of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso inflammatory gene 6 zzso whereas engagement of the common beta chain of the beta 2 family did zzso Furthermore, to characterize zzso gene zzso we examined the ability of zzso to the alpha chain of zzso receptors to regulate gene zzso zzso of the very late zzso 4 zzso zzso resulted in induction of all the zzso zzso zzso zzso was required because individual zzso fragments were unable to stimulate gene induction whereas the zzso zzso zzso and the whole zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 beta zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso Some zzso required a second signal and, for others, direct engagement was sufficient for protein zzso In conclusion, engagement of zzso receptors regulated the production of both inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso recognition and adherence may provide the key signals for initiation of the inflammatory response during zzso zzso
