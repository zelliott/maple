Evidence has been mounting for an involvement of the prion protein zzso in a molecular zzso assumed to play a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso A currently popular model sees zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides bind directly to zzso to zzso a signal that causes zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential player in a cascade of events that ultimately leads to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The model does not zzso however, how zzso binding of zzso to zzso is communicated across the plasma membrane barrier to affect zzso of zzso A scenario zzso zzso may adapt a zzso zzso to affect zzso zzso in the absence of additional partners is currently not supported by zzso A survey of known candidate zzso zzso leads to a small number of molecules that are known to acquire a zzso zzso and understood to contribute to zzso zzso Because multiple signaling pathways zzso onto zzso a realistic model needs to take into account a reality of zzso acting as a hub that zzso signals from multiple zzso and zzso zzso To clarify the role of zzso in zzso zzso future studies may need to incorporate experimental designs that can probe the contributions of zzso zzso pathways and rely on analogous zzso rather than threshold effects, known to zzso zzso zzso
