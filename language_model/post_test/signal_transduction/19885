zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prevents the recruitment of zzso into zzso and subsequent development of experimental zzso zzso Following zzso zzso of zzso zzso the agent of zzso disease, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in the zzso of zzso mice and is likely to play an important role in the recruitment of zzso to the site of zzso To test this hypothesis, we infected zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso and followed the development of arthritis and zzso zzso swelling was significantly attenuated during the peak of arthritis in the zzso zzso Arthritis severity scores were significantly lower in the zzso mice on days 11 and 21 zzso with fewer zzso present in the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso were also significantly decreased in zzso mice at day 21 zzso There were, however, no differences between zzso zzso and zzso mice in zzso clearance from zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not increased to compensate for the loss of zzso and the production of several innate zzso was zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays a critical zzso role in the development of experimental zzso arthritis and zzso via zzso recruitment of zzso into the site of zzso
