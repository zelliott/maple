This review summarizes emerging information regarding the zzso zzso signaling zzso during zzso transformation in the gastrointestinal zzso Although there is a role for the well-established zzso zzso in which zzso zzso interact with their zzso zzso there is sufficient evidence that downstream components of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso are hijacked by zzso signaling pathways to promote the conversion of the zzso to zzso and zzso We review the zzso zzso and involvement of primary zzso and then focus on current evidence for zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso as well as accessory zzso zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that targeting the zzso zzso with small zzso zzso and other mechanisms will likely require a combination of zzso that target zzso zzso factors in addition to zzso zzso such as zzso
