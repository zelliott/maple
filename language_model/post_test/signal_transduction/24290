In previous studies we have demonstrated release of zzso oxide zzso in human zzso following exposure to zzso We now designed experiments to determine whether zzso is present in the neural tissue of zzso zzso a marine zzso and whether, as in zzso it stimulates zzso NO zzso zzso After zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso we confirmed the presence of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso We further found that when either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was added to pedal zzso there was immediate zzso NO zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso to zzso also zzso NO release, suggesting mediation by a membrane surface zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso inhibited the action of both zzso and zzso zzso to zzso further supporting the presence of an zzso zzso In addition, by Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso we observed a zzso protein in both the membrane and zzso zzso in pedal zzso as well as in human zzso zzso have been previously shown to express zzso In zzso our results suggest that a zzso dose of zzso acutely stimulates NO release within pedal zzso via an zzso cell surface zzso
