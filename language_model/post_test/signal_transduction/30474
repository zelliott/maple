zzso zzso participate in hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suffer zzso zzso due to the zzso of its zzso zzso to zzso acid, a modification which can be zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to allow zzso zzso to act as zzso permitting high levels of zzso to trigger signal zzso To test this hypothesis, we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso which acts as a zzso scavenger during zzso metabolism and also zzso in zzso signal zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso we describe the characterization of a zzso zzso which lacks a zzso extension present only in zzso zzso This zzso protein is not zzso by high doses of zzso Exclusive expression of this truncated version of zzso is deleterious for zzso growth, but zzso signal zzso is not impaired in this zzso Instead, the ability of zzso to detect and zzso zzso is zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso by excess zzso is not required for zzso signaling towards the zzso pathway, as expected from the zzso model, and that the zzso extension of zzso zzso improves zzso scavenging and increases zzso to zzso
