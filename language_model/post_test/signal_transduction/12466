The pattern of the zzso eggshell is determined by the establishment of a complex and stereotyped pattern of cell fates in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is essential for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in time and space determines distinct fates at their appropriate locations, but the details of how zzso signaling is regulated and how the profile of zzso activity zzso to cell fate remain zzso Here we analyze the effect of loss of various zzso regulators and targets on zzso cell zzso using a marker for zzso cell fate, and on the mature eggshell zzso using a novel eggshell zzso We show, contrary to current patterning models, that feedback regulation of zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso and the inhibitor zzso is not necessary for zzso Given the zzso nature of the zzso zzso we observed, we propose instead that the pattern of cell fates is generated by spatial information derived directly from the zzso zzso zzso without a requirement for subsequent patterning by zzso zzso regulators in the zzso zzso
