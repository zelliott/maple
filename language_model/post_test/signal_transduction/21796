We have examined the effects of acute or chronic zzso and zzso withdrawal on mouse brain zzso cell zzso The associated changes in the expression of zzso regulatory proteins were also zzso After a single dose of zzso no zzso cells were detected by zzso or active zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and Bad was detected in cortical zzso On the other hand, the brains of zzso mice and zzso mice exhibited scattered zzso zzso and zzso throughout the zzso This zzso effect was accompanied by zzso of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and Bad and the active fragments of zzso and zzso in cortical and zzso zzso zzso mice also displayed a reduced expression of the zzso protein zzso No changes on zzso expression were detected under any experimental zzso These results suggest a zzso effect exerted by zzso but not zzso zzso and its withdrawal by zzso both the intrinsic and the zzso zzso zzso The possible clinical implications of our findings are zzso
