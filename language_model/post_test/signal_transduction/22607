zzso and zzso interactions play important regulatory roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso promotes the zzso of resting and activated T zzso In this work, we show that zzso of zzso T cells on zzso coated with zzso or zzso peptides is zzso by beta 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso peptides zzso zzso Ras zzso and zzso zzso of several T cell zzso The signals from zzso and its derived peptides zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso to induce zzso of zzso for zzso of T cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of full-length zzso was transient and dependent on a beta 1 zzso zzso Interestingly, peptides derived from the type 1 repeats of zzso and a zzso zzso from the zzso domain of zzso also zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso signals to the nucleus, detected by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by both zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso providing a functional link between zzso zzso interaction and nuclear zzso events via the zzso zzso zzso These findings have implications for the role of zzso zzso and zzso fragments in the regulation of T cell function during zzso wound repair, and other inflammatory zzso
