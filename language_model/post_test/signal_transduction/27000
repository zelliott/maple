We have tested the role of zzso zzso with particular emphasis on zzso in zzso immune complex zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to trigger zzso zzso release and zzso production by normal zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso When zzso normal zzso were zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso rose from approximately 100 zzso to approximately 230 zzso However, when zzso zzso were tested, a small rise in zzso zzso was zzso Because previous studies have shown that certain zzso inhibit zzso gamma zzso zzso we tested a panel of zzso to determine their ability to influence zzso zzso zzso zzso When normal zzso were exposed to zzso M zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso response to zzso was significantly zzso However, addition of zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not significantly affect the zzso response, suggesting that the response was specific for certain zzso To test the zzso consequences of these zzso signals, we have examined the ability of zzso to influence zzso production by normal zzso and the ability of zzso zzso to produce zzso upon triggering by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso generated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso production was inhibited by 0 to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso or zzso 50% by zzso and zzso zzso zzso which display diminished zzso signals, were found to produce zzso at 47 zzso zzso of control zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that they zzso block zzso
