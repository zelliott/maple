zzso interacting protein zzso is product of a candidate gene related to liver cancer development and zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso could inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells through colony formation zzso and the zzso ability of zzso to zzso cells was notably stronger than to zzso zzso Using zzso as zzso a human zzso zzso library was screened using zzso zzso system and a middle zzso of the zzso essential zzso zzso was obtained as a novel important zzso interacting protein fragment, which contained zzso zzso acid sequence from the 120 to 347 zzso Then the full coding sequence of zzso was amplified from zzso zzso Marathon zzso library and zzso mating zzso verified the interaction of zzso and full length zzso in zzso zzso pull-down zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso bound to zzso specifically and zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso with zzso and suggested that zzso could be involved in zzso signaling pathway, which is helpful to clarify the zzso function of zzso to cancer cell zzso
