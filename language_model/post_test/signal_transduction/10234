zzso zzso zzso plays critical roles in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene from which seven types of zzso zzso with a common protein zzso zzso but different zzso regions, may be zzso We previously showed that type zzso was the zzso form of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso cells, and that it could be induced by zzso zzso through the zzso response element zzso located in zzso promoter 5 zzso Here, we report zzso factors binding to zzso zzso and the involved signaling zzso zzso gel shift zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells, and that after exposure to zzso zzso binding complexes contained nuclear factor zzso zzso factor zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Using reporter zzso and specific zzso we found that zzso induction of rat zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not protein zzso C or zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear content of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells was partially blocked by zzso of either zzso or zzso and completely blocked by simultaneous zzso of both zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through altered zzso zzso factor binding zzso by both zzso and zzso
