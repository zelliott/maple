The bacterial zzso zzso was reconstructed to eliminate the zzso domain, thus connecting the recognition domain directly to the zzso zzso The resulting soluble zzso folded correctly and was no longer an integral membrane zzso Upon zzso zzso this soluble zzso was stabilized to a similar extent as that of the native zzso Of interest, this soluble zzso retained the ability to signal from the recognition to the zzso zzso This result defines more clearly the role of the membrane and zzso zzso in signal zzso and suggests that some zzso motions in zzso proteins do not require the membrane or zzso domain for information zzso
