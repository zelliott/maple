This study examines the interactions of zzso and zzso in the regulation of cell zzso Human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells that express zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and their attachment and migration to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso An zzso blocking zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso migration toward zzso but not attachment to zzso This function was zzso since zzso zzso and zzso blocking zzso did not produce this zzso zzso introduced into the zzso zzso zzso to dissect this phenomenon revealed the zzso zzso of the zzso binding domain by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished migration toward both zzso and zzso and attachment to zzso but not to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso domain or its zzso zzso abolished binding to zzso but not to zzso zzso of migration toward zzso was inhibited in these cells by zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso was, however, abolished by zzso of the zzso domain zzso These findings demonstrate zzso regulation of zzso cell migration and suggest that the zzso zzso domain is essential for this zzso
