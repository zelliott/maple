Recent evidence has shown that humans metabolize zzso more efficiently at environmental air zzso than at zzso zzso 1 zzso This led us to speculate that an unidentified zzso zzso was mainly responsible for zzso metabolism at ambient zzso 

We statistically tested whether human metabolism of zzso is better fitted by a kinetic model having two pathways rather than zzso 

We fit zzso models to levels of urinary zzso zzso and the corresponding air zzso for 263 zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from less than zzso zzso to 299 zzso with 10th and 90th zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Using values of zzso information criterion obtained under the two models, we found strong statistical evidence favoring two zzso zzso with respective affinities zzso air zzso analogous to zzso zzso of 301 zzso for the zzso zzso (probably dominated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso level predicted by our zzso model at zzso zzso was 184 zzso of zzso a value close to an independent estimate of zzso zzso for a typical zzso Chinese zzso Our results indicate that a zzso woman would metabolize about three times more zzso from the ambient environment under the zzso model zzso zzso than under the zzso model zzso zzso In fact, zzso of the ambient zzso dose would be zzso via the unidentified zzso zzso 

Because regulatory risk assessments have assumed zzso metabolism of zzso in persons exposed to air zzso well above 10 zzso our findings suggest that the true leukemia risks could be substantially greater than currently thought at ambient levels of zzso zzso higher among zzso females in the general zzso
