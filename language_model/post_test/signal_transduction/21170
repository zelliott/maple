zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is considered critical in the zzso of zzso T zzso In patients with zzso arthritis and infrequently in normal individuals, zzso T cells lacking zzso expression are expanded and contain zzso zzso To analyze whether these cells are independent of zzso requirements or whether they use zzso signals distinct from the zzso pathway, we have compared zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cell clones isolated from zzso arthritis zzso zzso cells supported the induction of zzso expression as well as of zzso responses after zzso zzso and prevented the induction of zzso in zzso zzso T cell zzso In contrast to zzso T cells, the presence of accessory cells did not enhance the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso signals did not involve zzso zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso T cells could not be blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso interactions cannot provide zzso independent zzso Our data suggest that zzso T cells require zzso signals for optimal induction of cell growth and zzso expression as well as for the prevention of zzso The zzso zzso interaction is independent of the zzso zzso and may be involved in the zzso expansion of the zzso zzso T cell subset in zzso zzso
