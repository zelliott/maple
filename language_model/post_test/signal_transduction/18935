Although most commonly associated with actions at zzso zzso receptors on the zzso surface of the plasma zzso the zzso zzso zzso is also transported into the cell, by the putative zzso membrane zzso zzso and activates the zzso zzso 1 zzso at an zzso zzso zzso is then zzso by fatty acid zzso zzso zzso As systemic administration of zzso zzso reduces locomotor activity in normal zzso we zzso that zzso of zzso by zzso could play a role in the control of voluntary movement and that such actions could be regulated by zzso and zzso Motor activity was assessed in normal, in zzso and in zzso rats treated with zzso In normal rats, the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso caused a significant reduction in movement in both the horizontal zzso and vertical zzso planes zzso and zzso respectively with zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso There was no effect of zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso on motor activity in zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso rats zzso high levels of motor activity in both the horizontal and vertical zzso zzso activity was attenuated by zzso (1 zzso zzso but not by zzso (10 zzso or zzso (5 zzso zzso activity was attenuated by zzso (1 zzso zzso and by zzso (10 zzso zzso but not by zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso system can suppress spontaneous locomotion in normal animals and zzso several zzso zzso in zzso zzso
