zzso Two novel selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated and compared to the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to increase the magnitude of zzso zzso responses, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in order to yield zzso active zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso % over zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (23) induced zzso formation at the rat zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso responses were more potent and enhanced to zzso zzso % over zzso 250 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was zzso blocked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and not affected by the zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso yielded partial antagonism of the zzso response in the absence of zzso whereas antagonism was either completely absent zzso or attenuated zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso activity of these zzso zzso zzso at a zzso active human zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells indicated similar efficacy zzso % over zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso inverse zzso zzso The use of either zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso enhances the resolution for monitoring the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are potent partial zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to act as inverse zzso
