zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is a key component in the regulation of energy production and zzso in zzso zzso Recent work has identified zzso as a strong zzso of the orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso implicating zzso as a potential zzso of zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso in zzso zzso a parallel approach of zzso screening and zzso analysis was used to identify zzso zzso regulators and target zzso We report here the identification of a potent and selective zzso inverse zzso that interferes effectively with zzso zzso This inverse zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Also, we demonstrate that zzso zzso B is an zzso target gene whose expression is regulated by zzso and zzso and inhibited by the zzso inverse zzso The discovery of potent and selective zzso zzso and their effect on zzso signaling provides zzso insight into gene regulation by zzso These findings validate zzso as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of zzso disorders, including diabetes and zzso
