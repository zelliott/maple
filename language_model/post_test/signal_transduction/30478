zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso of both zzso and contraction, which are regarded as critical processes that zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso is believed to drive zzso zzso This study was conducted to determine the relationship between zzso of human lens zzso cells and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to investigate gene expression of zzso markers in the human lens cell line zzso 124 and native lens zzso zzso was assessed with a zzso zzso zzso all areas covered by cells were measured with imaging techniques after fixation and cell zzso with zzso zzso In addition, total protein content, determined by dye zzso was used to give an estimate of total cell zzso To prevent zzso zzso interaction 100 zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis showed 10 zzso zzso or zzso significantly increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 124 cells and human lens zzso zzso maintained in zzso and zzso showed a marked increase in the rate of contraction relative to zzso zzso zzso alone did not differ significantly from the zzso zzso zzso and Western blots showed reduced levels of message and zzso protein when zzso with zzso zzso zzso did not prevent zzso zzso 

A targeted zzso approach demonstrated that key elements associated with zzso are not critical for zzso zzso zzso
