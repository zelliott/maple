We have shown previously that zzso of human internal zzso arteries activates protein zzso C and enhances zzso zzso zzso We now present evidence that in human zzso veins zzso zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso zzso signaling pathways and enhanced zzso 

zzso were investigated in zzso either zzso within zzso after removal or after storage at zzso degrees C in a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso 

zzso diminished responses to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso by up to zzso whereas responses to zzso were attenuated by about zzso zzso zzso for zzso on zzso and zzso zzso revealed similar zzso activities of both blocking zzso derivatives zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was 10 times less effective at enhancing zzso to zzso when tested after zzso These functional effects were reflected by changes in zzso as demonstrated by zzso of zzso loaded zzso The diminished activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was reversed partially when the zzso channel opener zzso (1 zzso was present during the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso proved to be significantly more effective at attenuating zzso responses to both zzso and zzso after zzso 

Data suggested that zzso modified zzso of zzso smooth muscle cells zzso through zzso changes in zzso influx and zzso through zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso
