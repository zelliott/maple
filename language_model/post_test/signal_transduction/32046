zzso signaling is essential for coordination of plant development and environmental zzso We originally isolated a tiny zzso named zzso zzso which has defects in shoot and root zzso The zzso roots zzso a mobile signal zzso zzso that arrests both root and shoot zzso Our recent study demonstrated that all three zzso gene family members prevent zzso synthesis of the same zzso zzso multiple zzso show progressively more severe zzso zzso An zzso analysis revealed abnormal cell divisions in all zzso lineages of zzso triple zzso These defects appear to be zzso independent, and arise prior to changes in zzso and zzso zzso
