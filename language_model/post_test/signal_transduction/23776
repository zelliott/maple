zzso is the main store of readily energy in skeletal muscle and plays a key role in muscle function, demonstrated by the inability to sustain prolonged high-intensity exercise upon depletion of these zzso zzso With prolonged exercise, zzso depletion occurs and zzso protein zzso zzso a potent regulator of muscle metabolism and gene zzso is activated promoting molecular zzso that increases zzso zzso by muscular skeletal zzso The aim of this study was primarily to determine the effect of zzso exercise on muscle zzso reserves and zzso to verify the influence of this type of exercise on zzso protein zzso zzso male zzso rats, 60 days old, were divided into four experimental groups: zzso sedentary exhausted zzso endurance trained zzso and endurance trained exhausted zzso The animals ran for 10 to 90 zzso 5 zzso for 12 weeks to attain trained zzso zzso were killed immediately after the exhaustion zzso which consisted of running on a treadmill (at approximately zzso zzso until zzso zzso density of periodic zzso was detected and zzso depletion observed predominantly in type I muscle zzso of the TE group and in both type I and II muscle zzso in the zzso zzso Plasma zzso decreased only in the TE zzso zzso zzso was increased in T group and significantly depleted in TE zzso zzso protein expression was significantly elevated in TE and T zzso In conclusion, acute exhaustive zzso exercise promoted muscle zzso zzso It seems that total zzso protein and gene expression is more influenced by status zzso
