The mechanisms of paradoxical zzso response in human zzso zzso cells were investigated using zzso calcium measurement and zzso incubation zzso zzso calcium measurement revealed that zzso zzso a zzso response: a transient increase followed by a sustained zzso The transient phase was due to the calcium release from zzso zzso calcium store and the subsequent sustained phase was due to the calcium influx through the zzso calcium zzso The signal zzso mechanism of the calcium plateau involved protein zzso zzso These calcium responses, especially the second phase, was responsible for the zzso zzso zzso
