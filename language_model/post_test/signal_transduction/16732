A zzso deleted zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was cloned by zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso involved six putative open reading frames zzso the zzso was inserted into zzso zzso complementary test indicated that the zzso zzso was required for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso had zzso of identity with the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso by zzso contained a zzso signal receiver domain that can receive the signal from the sensor partner of the bacterial zzso zzso It was suggested that the protein zzso by zzso may take part in the signal zzso relating to zzso of zzso
