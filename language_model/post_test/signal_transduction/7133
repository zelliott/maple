The zzso zzso zzso zzso are crucial innate immune signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins inhibit zzso zzso zzso signaling through molecular zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso signaling through interaction with host zzso proteins zzso and zzso To characterize the microbial mimicry of host zzso we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of the zzso zzso from the zzso protein zzso and the host zzso protein zzso We have further characterized zzso interactions of zzso using zzso exchange mass zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interaction by zzso and zzso reporter zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain reveals the zzso site encompassing the zzso loop as well as a symmetrical zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso interface is validated by zzso mapping through zzso exchange mass zzso The human zzso zzso domain crystal structure reveals a unique zzso zzso domain fold containing a zzso bond formed by zzso and zzso A comparison between the zzso and zzso crystal structures reveals substantial zzso differences in the region that encompasses the zzso zzso These findings underscore the similarities and differences in the molecular features found in the microbial and host zzso zzso which suggests mechanisms of bacterial mimicry of host signaling zzso zzso such as zzso
