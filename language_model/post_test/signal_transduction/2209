The involvement of protein zzso in the signal zzso pathways controlling adrenal zzso is well established, and the zzso of zzso by zzso protein zzso is a major mechanism in zzso zzso However, the possibility that protein zzso zzso might also be involved in this process has not been zzso The aim of this study was, therefore, to measure the function, expression and zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue from the rat adrenal zzso zzso analysis using specific zzso demonstrated the presence in whole zzso and capsules of zzso type 1 zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 37 zzso and zzso type 2A zzso zzso with apparent molecular masses of 38 and 31 zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused a reduction in zzso activity in zzso at doses between 1 zzso and 1 zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso resulted in a significant reduction in zzso zzso The effects of CA and zzso on steroid zzso by zzso and zzso cells were also zzso Neither CA nor zzso had any effect on zzso steroid zzso or on yields of steroid obtained from zzso at doses between 1 and 100 zzso However, both zzso and CA (10 and 100 zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso and zzso production by zzso and zzso zzso CA and zzso (10 and 100 zzso zzso also reduced steroid zzso by cells zzso by zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the zzso mechanisms through which zzso zzso is zzso acting at a point after zzso generation and action, but zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso
