The inability of the human heart to effectively repair itself after acute zzso injury has driven the search for zzso means of promoting cardiac zzso zzso Central to this has been the emergence of zzso strategies to stimulate and augment both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell transplantation of a variety of adult zzso cells has been taken forward in clinical trials and, in zzso investigators have begun to focus on the zzso of resident cardiac cell populations as a means to stimulate zzso zzso The latter approach depends on characterizing native zzso with zzso zzso zzso and arguably an analogous zzso zzso Recently, we have focused on adult zzso zzso zzso zzso which, when induced by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are able to zzso to their embryonic zzso and give rise to zzso cells and vascular smooth muscle cells ex zzso Studies are ongoing to determine whether activated adult zzso can contribute to bona fide zzso in the injured adult zzso heart proper, as a therapeutic means to support surviving cardiac muscle cells and sustain zzso zzso
