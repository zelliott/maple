The zzso zzso zzso factors are supposed to be a regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied here whether or not three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, are controlled by the zzso clock and/or by blue light signaling in the moss zzso zzso Among the three zzso zzso only zzso was clearly controlled by the zzso zzso In contrast to the differential regulation on a daily zzso a pulse of blue light induced the expression of all the three zzso zzso This induction was significantly reduced in a knockout zzso that lacked the blue light zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso and/or zzso mediate the blue light signal that zzso the expression of the zzso zzso In a daily cycle of zzso blue zzso dark, the timing of peak expression of zzso and a zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso II, advanced in the zzso zzso relative to those in the wild type, suggesting the presence of regulatory interactions among the expression of zzso and zzso the zzso clock, and the blue light signaling zzso by the zzso
