The zzso family of zzso are zzso zzso hormone receptors that share a common zzso organization and are the subject of a wide variety of alternative zzso All zzso contain a central seven zzso domain responsible for zzso signals from the outside of the cell as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso family have a relatively large zzso and a variety of lines of evidence support a common mode of zzso binding and a common zzso binding zzso These receptors are best characterized as zzso to zzso zzso pathways via zzso and zzso but are also reported to couple to a multitude of other zzso zzso The zzso zzso are implicated in regulating the interaction between the zzso and zzso G protein zzso Alternative zzso of zzso zzso both the zzso zzso domain as well as the zzso zzso of some family members has been reported and as expected these zzso zzso display altered zzso affinity as well as differential zzso by zzso zzso Various forms of alternative zzso have also been reported to alter zzso zzso 1 and 3 as well as the zzso and as one might expect these display differences in zzso bias towards downstream zzso These diverse zzso require that the zzso role of these zzso zzso be addressed but should provide unique opportunities for drug design and zzso
