zzso factors from the zzso protein zzso family play important roles in zzso cell zzso zzso is a zzso differentiation marker and is strongly zzso during zzso cell zzso Here, we report the direct binding of zzso to the zzso promoter of zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso family members significantly activate the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is directly involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso When zzso zzso cells are treated with vitamin zzso and zzso they differentiate toward zzso zzso Using specific zzso against different zzso family members in zzso mobility shift zzso and Western zzso zzso we have identified a specific increase in the DNA binding and the expression of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso cell zzso and we found zzso and zzso bind to the promoter in zzso Furthermore, with zzso zzso cell lines, we demonstrate that the zzso binding site in the zzso promoter plays a critical role for zzso zzso signaling in the synergistic zzso of zzso expression by vitamin zzso and zzso during zzso zzso This may indicate that zzso have important functions in the process of zzso signal zzso during zzso zzso
