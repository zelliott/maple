The clarification of zzso zzso cell subset and the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso with protein zzso as in the development of zzso zzso is a crucial zzso 

Because zzso is highly expressed in the vicinity of zzso cells zzso we sought to clarify our hypothesis that zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso with protein zzso through zzso zzso 

By using zzso toxin zzso zzso mice and human zzso toxin zzso mice, we prepared mice deficient in zzso We also prepared mice deficient in zzso receptors in zzso by using zzso zzso mice with bone zzso zzso zzso We applied these mice to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Upon the zzso application of zzso conditional zzso depletion attenuated the development of clinical manifestations as well as serum zzso zzso increase, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the draining zzso zzso zzso even in the steady state, permanent zzso depletion resulted in decreased serum zzso levels, suggesting that zzso mediate the zzso local zzso In addition, mice deficient in zzso receptors on zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso levels upon zzso zzso zzso 

zzso initiate zzso zzso with protein zzso and induce zzso immune responses via zzso zzso
