The recent identification of zzso zzso in zzso in the majority of zzso acute zzso zzso zzso has brought major interest toward targeting the zzso signaling zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which block a critical zzso step required for zzso zzso can effectively block the activity of zzso zzso zzso However, the clinical development of zzso has been hampered by their low zzso against human zzso and the development of significant gastrointestinal toxicity derived from the zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso understanding of the zzso mechanisms of zzso and the effects of zzso zzso in zzso cells and the zzso zzso are required for the design of effective zzso therapies in zzso
