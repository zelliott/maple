zzso zzso zzso zzso generate specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso that are critical for second zzso signaling and cellular membrane zzso zzso have 19 zzso zzso spread across three major families: the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso have fewer yet varying zzso zzso zzso are also an important, emerging class of drug targets for many therapeutic areas including cancer, inflammatory and zzso diseases and zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and evolutionary relationships or zzso of all three zzso families across major zzso groups and suggest potential ramifications for drug zzso 

Our analyses reveal four core zzso zzso which are type III zzso and zzso and at least one zzso each from zzso zzso zzso as the zzso and zzso zzso We also applied evolutionary analyses to zzso disease zzso and drug zzso zzso zzso are known to be zzso and several zzso are in zzso clinical zzso We found conservation of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso suggesting specific functional constraints on these zzso By mapping published compound zzso data zzso onto a zzso of zzso type II zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we also show that compound zzso zzso to zzso evolutionary zzso Finally, we extended the rationale for drugs targeting zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by identifying those zzso highly divergent from human zzso 

Our zzso analysis of zzso provides new insights into the evolution of second zzso zzso We zzso two waves of zzso diversification, the first in zzso with a subsequent expansion in cold-blooded zzso that was zzso of zzso but prior to the appearance of zzso Reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships among these zzso zzso also adds to our understanding of their roles in various diseases and assists in their development as potential drug zzso
