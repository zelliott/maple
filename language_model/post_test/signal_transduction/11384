To study the function of human zzso zzso zzso and the interaction between human zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso expression zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells with intrinsic zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso zzso with exclusive specificity for zzso or zzso were constructed, expressed in zzso in E coli, and then zzso zzso zzso was determined by crystal violet zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso in zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso and indirect zzso and was zzso by binding of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso could markedly increase the zzso of zzso cells to zzso 

zzso could not only partially mediate zzso zzso independently but also fulfill an accessory role in enhancing or zzso zzso zzso It played a dual function in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
