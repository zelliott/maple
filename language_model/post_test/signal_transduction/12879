The mechanisms of innate immunity in zzso show certain overall zzso to immune mechanisms of zzso Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain these zzso zzso According to the evolutionary continuity hypothesis, innate immune mechanisms evolved in the common zzso of zzso and insects and have been zzso since that zzso zzso In the zzso hypothesis, the mechanisms of innate immunity in zzso evolved independently from zzso immune zzso zzso analysis of five gene families zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose members are involved in zzso signaling in zzso and insects were used to decide between these zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso families strongly supported independent evolution of immune functions in zzso and zzso and, except for a possible case in the zzso family, zzso molecules having immune functions in both zzso and zzso were not zzso The results suggest that zzso represents an zzso generalized signaling system that has been zzso for immune system roles independently in zzso and insect zzso
