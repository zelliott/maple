The zzso zzso zzso family plays an zzso role in innate immune responses against microbial zzso as well as the subsequent induction of zzso immune zzso zzso recognize specific molecular patterns found in a broad range of microbial pathogens such as bacteria and zzso triggering inflammatory and zzso responses and zzso cell zzso which result in the zzso of invading zzso Individual zzso interact with different combinations of adapter proteins and activate various zzso factors such as nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factors, driving a specific immune zzso This review outlines the recent advances in our understanding of zzso pathways and their roles in immune zzso Further, we also discuss a new concept of zzso mechanisms for recognition of microbial zzso
