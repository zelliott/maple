zzso stem cell zzso transplantation for zzso stroke is expected to repair the zzso injury and replace the lost zzso through zzso cross talk between injured zzso and the transplanted zzso Here, we set up an in zzso zzso system of zzso deprivation zzso injured zzso and zzso to investigate the zzso repairing effect and effects on zzso zzso We focused on the zzso zzso as a possible zzso of these zzso zzso zzso induced increased zzso of zzso in zzso zzso through the zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso genes zzso When the zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso lower zzso differentiation was detected and the zzso effect was also zzso As shown by the novel zzso system, the zzso zzso with zzso injured zzso were induced to differentiate through the zzso zzso zzso and these induced zzso showed greater potential to support both the repair of injured zzso and form new zzso
