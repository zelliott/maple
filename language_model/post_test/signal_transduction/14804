Natural killer zzso cells are important zzso cells in the control of zzso The cellular and molecular signals required for zzso cell zzso in zzso remain poorly zzso By using a mouse model for the zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso we showed that the in zzso zzso of zzso cell responses to viral and bacterial pathogens required the presence of zzso zzso After peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were recruited to local zzso zzso and their interaction with zzso resulted in the emergence of zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso cell zzso was dependent on the recognition of type I zzso signals by zzso and the subsequent production and zzso of zzso by zzso to resting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient for the zzso of zzso zzso Our data define a unique in zzso role of zzso for the zzso of zzso cells, revealing a striking and previously unappreciated zzso to T zzso of the zzso immune zzso
