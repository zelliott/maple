zzso zzso has been observed during zzso stress conditions generating a variety of zzso capable of modulating cellular zzso This concept has grown as a result of studies with zzso of zzso zzso fatty acids containing a zzso group zzso zzso This review focuses on the interactions of zzso acids with members of the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso These nuclear receptors belong to a zzso of zzso zzso factors, which serve as sensors of zzso molecules and regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso Here we discuss how zzso acids bind and activate zzso including the current knowledge of the molecular interactions and cell signaling events involved as well as their therapeutic potential associated with chronic inflammation and zzso zzso
