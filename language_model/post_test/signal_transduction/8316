zzso of zzso zzso zzso acts as a negative feedback regulator of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso factors signaling zzso and plays an important role in the development and progression of various zzso To better understand the role of zzso in prostate cancer, zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells by consecutive zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression as measured by quantitative reverse zzso and Western zzso respectively, were decreased by approximately zzso to zzso compared with zzso We observed a significant decrease in cell proliferation and viability in all zzso cell lines but not in the parental zzso cell line, which is zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso of zzso leads to an increased cell death in prostate cancer cell zzso We found a considerable increase in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression was observed in all zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso could rescue cells with decreased zzso levels from going into zzso zzso zzso data prove that zzso is highly expressed in zzso tumor zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso is an important protein in the survival machinery in prostate cancer and is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso results in an increase of cell death via zzso of the zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso
