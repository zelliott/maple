The mechanisms that determine whether a tumor cell that has zzso to a secondary site will resume growth immediately, die or enter a state of dormancy are poorly zzso Although tumor dormancy represents a common clinical finding, studying the mechanisms behind this stage of tumor progression has been zzso Furthermore, it is thought that dormant tumor cells are zzso to chemotherapy due to their lack of zzso However, whether this is the only reason for their zzso remains to be zzso In this review we zzso recent findings that provide a zzso explanation about how stress signaling through the zzso zzso and zzso signaling may coordinate the induction of growth arrest and zzso in a model of zzso zzso zzso We further discuss how dormant tumor cells may enter this stage to adapt to zzso conditions that do not favor immediate growth after zzso Finally, we propose that this response may zzso an zzso zzso program of zzso extension through adaptation and tolerance to zzso
