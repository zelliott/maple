zzso of zzso markedly zzso the zzso visual system during a subsequent period of dark zzso Previous studies have indicated an origin of zzso zzso in the visual zzso itself, but have not identified the mechanism of zzso A candidate for the site at which zzso is initially expressed is the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso on the rod disk zzso this reaction directly involves zzso in its zzso zzso form and mediates initial amplification of the visual signal zzso in zzso zzso We have zzso the effect of zzso on the sensitivity of a zzso zzso signal known to monitor the zzso amplifier, and which has been established as specifically monitoring zzso zzso We have recorded this signal from functioning retinal rods in zzso zzso zzso and find that zzso inducing a zzso sustained loss in rod zzso sensitivity do not alter the sensitivity of the zzso response after correction for reduced quantum zzso Our results indicate that the zzso gain of the zzso zzso stage remains unchanged in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso a subsequent reaction as the first to show a zzso zzso gain zzso
