zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso is increased in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of a series of zzso SCC tumors revealed positive zzso zzso zzso accompanied by weak zzso zzso in zzso tumors, suggesting an zzso role for zzso in SCC zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso was investigated in a zzso SCC cell line using zzso short hairpin zzso sequences enabling stable zzso zzso We show that, although zzso zzso has no effect on cell zzso it zzso cells to zzso zzso through increased zzso of the zzso protein zzso a change in the zzso of zzso and zzso release of zzso c into the zzso and zzso of zzso These events are accompanied by faster zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and correlate with the degree of zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso partially rescued cells from zzso zzso but did not affect Bid zzso or zzso c release, suggesting that cells die via the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso resistance of SCC cells to zzso and displays potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso
