zzso zzso is an ornamental tall tree found in India, Pakistan, Nepal, zzso zzso Thailand and zzso We have isolated four known distinct zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the four isolated zzso the two zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the most potent zzso agent with zzso of zzso in human leukemia zzso zzso We are reporting first time the zzso and zzso potential of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation and induce zzso as measured by several biological zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso bodies formation, enhanced zzso binding of the cells, increased zzso cell zzso loss of zzso membrane potential zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso also increase the expression of zzso death zzso zzso with zzso of zzso protein zzso All the above parameters revealed that these two zzso induce zzso through both zzso and intrinsic zzso pathways in zzso zzso In spite of zzso these two zzso significantly inhibit nuclear zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling pathway, which are highly expressed in zzso The present study provide an insight of molecular mechanism of cell death induced by zzso and zzso in zzso cells which may be useful in managing and treating zzso
