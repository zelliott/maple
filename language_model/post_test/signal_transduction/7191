zzso smoke is a major cause of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso are the first defense cells against cigarette smoke and these cells are an important source of zzso zzso These zzso play a role in progressive zzso limitation and chronic airways zzso Furthermore, the chronic colonization of airways by zzso bacteria, contributes to the persistent airways inflammation and progression of zzso The current study addressed the effects of cigarette smoke along with zzso zzso in airway zzso cells as a representative in zzso model of COPD zzso Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in this experimental zzso zzso cells were zzso with cigarette smoke extract zzso alone zzso to zzso or in combination with a low concentration of zzso zzso zzso for 2 h or 24 h for measurement of zzso protein and zzso and zzso zzso for protein zzso zzso were also zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso before the addition of zzso zzso of zzso was determined by zzso and protein zzso by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not induce production of zzso and zzso from zzso cells, but increase production of zzso However the combination of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso induced an important production of these zzso that appears to be dependent of zzso and zzso pathways but did not require zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso associated with zzso reduced zzso zzso release, which can happen by occur through of zzso and zzso zzso We report here an in zzso model that can reflect what happen in airway zzso cells in COPD zzso We also showed a new zzso where zzso can induce zzso release from zzso cells, which is reduced by zzso
