In zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of tissue patterning in the developing zzso We have identified a group of proteins that act downstream of zzso zzso in zzso root and vascular development in the zzso Combined zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso give rise to zzso zzso double zzso zzso that closely zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso with an absence of roots and defective development of the zzso We show that, in contrast to the situation in zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso show zzso zzso at the root pole and in the zzso region, and that the zzso pathway, which translates zzso zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso Although we focus on the impact of zzso zzso on aspects of zzso development, the effect of such zzso on a broad range of zzso gene expression and the tissue expression patterns of zzso genes in zzso suggest that zzso proteins have a wider role to play in growth and zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso most likely control the zzso of genes required for zzso responses through the action of their zzso finger zzso
