Similar amounts of zzso and zzso the prototypes of type I and type II zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, in the initial phase of zzso zzso cells zzso more rapidly than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso and spread in a similar manner on zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso cells were more zzso and dispersed than zzso zzso zzso zzso cells established transient contacts with their neighbors which were stabilized if zzso interactions were zzso In contrast, zzso cells remained in close contact when they migrated on zzso Both zzso and zzso were more rapidly zzso in zzso than in zzso cells treated with zzso suggesting a higher turnover rate for zzso zzso contacts than for those zzso by zzso The extent of zzso focal zzso zzso zzso was much lower if the cells had initiated zzso rather than zzso cell zzso before zzso On zzso into the zzso zzso cells did not migrate and remained at or close to the graft site, even after 48 zzso whereas grafted zzso cells dispersed efficiently into embryonic zzso Thus, the adhesive zzso of zzso cells is regulated by the nature of the zzso zzso environment which also controls the migratory behavior of the zzso In addition, zzso zzso by different zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso The transient contacts specifically observed in zzso zzso cells may also be important in the control of cell zzso
