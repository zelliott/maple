zzso signaling is critical for T cell function during zzso and inflammation and directs T cell polarity and migration through the zzso of specific zzso zzso Here, we uncovered a previously zzso role for the zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of T zzso inflammatory responses and showed that the zzso family zzso were required for zzso T cell polarization and zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso and zzso were activated downstream of zzso receptors and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso of zzso 1 zzso an zzso protein that is required for the activity of the zzso zzso zzso which mediates cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso family zzso and zzso of zzso were required for zzso T cell zzso Mouse T cells that lacked zzso and zzso exhibited defective zzso to zzso zzso and impaired migration to sites of zzso These findings suggest that zzso family zzso are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of T zzso immune disorders that are characterized by zzso zzso
