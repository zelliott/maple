zzso zzso stress zzso induced by flowing blood, plays a key role in determining vascular health by modulating zzso zzso and vascular zzso In systemic zzso many of the beneficial effects of chronic zzso are zzso through the zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso but little is known regarding the role of chronic zzso in the zzso zzso We demonstrate that exposure of zzso zzso cells to chronic zzso zzso of 10 zzso increases zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and increases expression of zzso leading to increased expression of the downstream molecules zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the proportion of zzso which was zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso We demonstrated dependence of these effects on the zzso zzso by using the inhibitor zzso We found high levels of zzso expression in human zzso confirming the relevance of our in zzso observations and, as zzso is specifically induced by chronic zzso suggesting the zzso importance of zzso stress in the zzso zzso medium from zzso zzso cells under chronic zzso decreased zzso zzso resistance and increased zzso of zzso zzso The latter effect was more pronounced using a novel zzso direct zzso system in which zzso cells were exposed to chronic zzso These data provide the first direct evidence of zzso zzso cell to zzso zzso
