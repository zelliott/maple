zzso binding factor zzso is a zzso family of zzso factors and plays a crucial role in freeze zzso In the present work, two groups of zzso element binding factor zzso genes were isolated from zzso zzso named Group I and Group zzso The two groups of genes were both induced by low temperature, but the expression of Group I preceded that of Group zzso The Group I zzso could specifically bind with the zzso zzso element and activate the expression of downstream zzso but Group II factors were zzso although they still had the ability to bind with zzso which was confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso indicated that the zzso binding ability of the two groups was zzso zzso of Group II could zzso the zzso activity of Group I zzso in a zzso zzso These results strongly suggested that the zzso Group I zzso were expressed at the early stage of cold stress to open the zzso signaling zzso in cold stress, whereas the zzso Group II zzso were expressed at the later stage to close the signal zzso in a competitive zzso The results zzso provide a new insight into the regulation mechanisms of the zzso signaling zzso in response to cold zzso
