The zzso gene is a critical component of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling and subsequent zzso of zzso is related to enhancing cell proliferation and developing colon zzso and colon zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso zzso on the growth and survival of the human colon cancer cell line zzso was investigated in zzso The effect of zzso of zzso on cell proliferation was investigated by zzso zzso and colony zzso The cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow zzso zzso was measured by nuclear zzso and flow zzso The change of zzso and related proteins were determined by western zzso and zzso The results showed that small interfering zzso directed against zzso markedly inhibited the expression and nuclear zzso of zzso and decreased the expression of known target genes such as zzso D1 and zzso zzso cell proliferation was inhibited as indicated by growth reduction, cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, and induction of zzso and the zzso of cell growth may be associated with switching off zzso D1 and zzso expression by small interfering zzso targeted against zzso in colon cancer zzso zzso
