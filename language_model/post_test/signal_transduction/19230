Research on asthma zzso over the past decade has expanded the complex repertoire involved in the zzso of asthma to include zzso immune and structural cells, as well as a wide range of zzso Studies have identified a role for zzso and other zzso zzso involved in airway zzso Recent findings have implicated the innate immune response in asthma and have revealed interesting patterns of interaction between the innate and zzso immune response and the associated complex chronic inflammatory zzso New immune cell populations have also been added to this repertoire, including zzso natural killer T cells and zzso zzso The role of the zzso a prominent pathological feature in most asthma zzso has also been expanding to include roles such as tissue zzso and immune regulators via a number of fascinating and zzso unexplored zzso zzso In addition, new and significant roles have been proposed for airway smooth muscle cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is now considered an integral element of asthma zzso Finally, an intricate network of zzso released from both immune and inflammatory cells, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have added to the complex milieu of asthma immunity and zzso These findings have implications for therapy and the search for novel strategies towards better disease zzso Sadly, and perhaps due to the complex nature of zzso advances in therapeutic discoveries and developments have been zzso Thus, understanding the precise roles played by the numerous zzso zzso in this zzso both individually and collectively within the context of asthma zzso continues to pose new zzso It is clear that the next stage in this saga is to embark on studies that transcend zzso approaches to involve system analysis of the complex and multiple variables involved in zzso including the need to narrow down the zzso of this condition based on careful analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso and other factors involved in zzso zzso
