zzso zzso is associated with zzso in Barrett's zzso but the zzso of this tumor is rising, despite widespread use of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso material other than acid might contribute to zzso We looked for potentially zzso effects of two zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso on Barrett's zzso cells in zzso and in zzso We exposed Barrett's zzso cells to zzso or zzso and studied the generation of zzso zzso species zzso expression of zzso zzso (a marker of DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso During zzso in patients, we took biopsy specimens of Barrett's zzso before and after zzso zzso with zzso or zzso and assessed DNA damage and zzso zzso Exposure to zzso but not zzso resulted in zzso production, DNA damage, and zzso zzso but did not increase the rate of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso (a zzso zzso prevented DNA damage after zzso exposure, and zzso did induce zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso DNA damage and zzso zzso were detected in biopsy specimens of Barrett's zzso taken after zzso zzso with zzso but not zzso These data show that, in Barrett's zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso production, which causes zzso injury, and simultaneously zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, which enables cells with DNA damage to resist zzso We have demonstrated molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso might contribute to zzso in Barrett's zzso
