To study the role of zzso as a third signal for zzso zzso and differentiation in zzso direct zzso signaling to zzso T cells was analyzed in bacterial and viral infections using the zzso zzso adoptive transfer model with zzso T cells that lack the zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso T cells deficient in zzso signaling were impaired in zzso expansion after zzso zzso infection but not after infection with zzso zzso virus, zzso virus or zzso zzso zzso Although limited in zzso expansion after zzso infection, zzso T cells deficient in zzso signaling exhibited normal zzso activity, zzso functions, and zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso T cells lacking zzso signaling failed to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso in the context of zzso but not viral zzso Thus, direct zzso signaling to zzso T cells determines the cell fate decision between short-lived zzso cells and memory precursor zzso cells, which is dependent on zzso local zzso zzso
