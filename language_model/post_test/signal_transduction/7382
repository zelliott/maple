To investigate whether zzso signaling in zzso regulates zzso thereby contributing to zzso bone growth and bone zzso 

Mice with conditional knockout zzso or conditional zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso Changes in bone mass, zzso numbers, and zzso activity were zzso The mechanisms by which zzso signaling in zzso regulates zzso formation were zzso 

The zzso zzso mice developed localized bone loss, whereas zzso mice developed a high bone mass zzso zzso findings suggested that these zzso were caused primarily by impaired zzso formation, rather than impaired bone zzso Further molecular signaling analyses revealed that zzso signaling controlled this process by regulating the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso suppressed zzso gene zzso through a zzso zzso zzso The severe bone loss zzso observed in zzso zzso mice was largely restored by treatment with human zzso zzso or transgenic zzso of zzso in zzso 

zzso signaling in zzso plays a key role in zzso bone growth and bone zzso through its regulation of zzso zzso
