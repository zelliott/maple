Increased zzso resistance to portal blood flow is the primary factor leading to portal hypertension in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso liver might be a potential target to zzso portal zzso 

To verify the effect of zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso on portal hypertension and the mechanisms behind zzso 

zzso liver model of rat was established by zzso injection of zzso zzso 36 rats were randomly assigned to control, zzso and zzso zzso zzso pressures were measured by introduction of zzso into portal zzso zzso zzso was assessed by the visible zzso zzso areas and zzso for collagen III and zzso The zzso was determined by zzso vascular areas, vascular casts and zzso zzso Expressions of zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and related signal molecules were zzso 

Compared with zzso group, the portal pressure in zzso group was significantly decreased by zzso zzso zzso treatment greatly reduced the tortuous zzso portal zzso The data of zzso areas, zzso zzso levels of zzso and collagen III in zzso group were much lower than those in zzso group, zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso was significantly inhibited after zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso after zzso zzso 

Long term administration of zzso can efficiently zzso portal hypertension in zzso rat model by its dual zzso effects on the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso effect afforded by zzso may attribute to its zzso on zzso through the zzso of integrated signal pathways involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
