Several zzso disease models depend on an imbalance in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso regulatory T zzso zzso Here we compare the requirement for signals through the zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso zzso a model for inflammatory zzso zzso We used a colitis model in which zzso zzso T cells alone or in combination with zzso T cells from either zzso or zzso donors were transferred into T zzso animals, half of which were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso cells zzso development of zzso whereas blocking zzso or zzso alone had little to no effect on disease zzso In contrast to zzso cells, regulatory T cell functioning depended mostly on zzso signaling with only a minor contribution for zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso collaborate to development of zzso colitis by zzso zzso cells, and that zzso is required for zzso cells, which should caution against the use of zzso zzso in inflammatory zzso zzso
