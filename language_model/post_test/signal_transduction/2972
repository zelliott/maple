During insect zzso zzso networks undergo extensive zzso by restructuring their connectivity and recruiting newborn zzso from zzso zzso The zzso network that directs the essential behavior, zzso generates a distinct behavioral sequence at each zzso zzso zzso zzso replaces the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and expands the head and zzso to their adult zzso However, the network changes that support these differences are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso hormones they zzso are critical for zzso their targeted zzso alters zzso zzso progression and results in a failure of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso network is remodeled immediately before zzso zzso by the emergence of 12 late zzso zzso All 12 are zzso zzso that exit the central nervous zzso zzso these late zzso zzso were found to be entirely sufficient for zzso zzso zzso even after targeted zzso of all other 42 zzso zzso Our evidence indicates that late zzso zzso are derived from early, likely zzso zzso However, they do not differentiate to express their zzso hormone battery, nor do they project an zzso via lateral nerve trunks until zzso both of which are believed to be critical for the function of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Further analysis implicated zzso signaling via zzso receptors zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso as the differentiation zzso These results demonstrate the utility of temporally tuned zzso differentiation as a hard-wired zzso mechanism to zzso a zzso network to generate a scheduled change in zzso
