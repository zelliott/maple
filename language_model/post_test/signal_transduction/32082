zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso increased tumor zzso Although zzso therapies have improved patient outcome, resistance ultimately zzso zzso zzso target zzso zzso zzso tumors, such as the zzso breast and zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso breast zzso are susceptible to zzso zzso independent of an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso negative breast cancer cells was sufficient to render cells susceptible to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso but not zzso negative breast cancer zzso This corresponded with a reduction in zzso zzso and total zzso levels, with a zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cellular sensitivity to zzso whereas zzso zzso reduced cell viability to a similar extent as zzso zzso zzso of zzso breast cancer cells to zzso zzso may be because of zzso of zzso signaling driven by zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso may be a novel therapeutic strategy for sporadic zzso breast cancer zzso
