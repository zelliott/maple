Resistance zzso zzso pathways are well known to participate in defense against a variety of microbial zzso zzso acid zzso and its associated zzso signaling zzso including enhanced disease zzso 1 zzso zzso disease resistance 1 zzso zzso deficient 4 zzso zzso associated gene 101 zzso and zzso have been identified as components of resistance derived from many R zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso fulfill redundant functions in defense signaling zzso by R zzso which were thought to function independent of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso compromised hypersensitive response and/or resistance zzso by R proteins that contain coiled zzso zzso at their zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of R genes and the associated defense signaling induced in response to a reduction in the level of zzso acid were also suppressed by compromising zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso with zzso was specific to zzso zzso presented here redefine our understanding of the roles of zzso and zzso in plant zzso
