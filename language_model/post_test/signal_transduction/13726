The zzso zzso factor zzso cell missing 1 zzso and its target gene zzso are involved in zzso zzso fusion for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is inhibited by zzso whereas zzso stability is decreased by zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso through the zzso signaling cascade and zzso is known to zzso class zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we study whether the zzso signaling cascade regulates zzso activity and zzso cell fusion through class zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were characterized by zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso expression by zzso was studied by transient zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso interference and zzso were used to examine the zzso of zzso activity, zzso expression and zzso fusion by zzso signaling cascade in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso active zzso and zzso We demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso layer of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppresses its zzso zzso In contrast, zzso stimulates zzso zzso on zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso manner leading to nuclear export of zzso and thereby zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso expression and zzso fusion in zzso cells, which is zzso by zzso and zzso Our results reveal a new layer of regulation of zzso activity and zzso cell fusion through the zzso signaling cascade by restraining zzso from interacting with and zzso zzso zzso
