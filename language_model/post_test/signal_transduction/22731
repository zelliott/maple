zzso cells contribute to efficient zzso zzso after peripheral nerve injury and, when grafted to the central nervous system zzso also support a modest degree of central zzso zzso This study examined zzso whether zzso cells grafted to the zzso exhibit normal patterns of differentiation and association with spinal zzso and what signals zzso zzso these zzso and zzso whether zzso cells zzso zzso factors enhance zzso zzso Thus, primary zzso cells were zzso to zzso human nerve growth factor zzso and were grafted to spinal zzso injury sites in adult zzso Comparisons were made to zzso zzso zzso From 3 days to 6 months later, grafted zzso cells exhibited a zzso and zzso course of differentiation that matched patterns normally observed after peripheral nerve zzso zzso cells spontaneously aligned into regular spatial zzso within the cord, appropriately zzso zzso zzso that zzso into zzso and appropriately zzso but did not zzso sensory zzso extending into zzso zzso expression of the cell zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso correlated with establishment of appropriate patterns of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso robustly increased zzso growth but did not otherwise alter the nature of interactions with growing zzso These findings suggest that signals expressed on zzso cells that zzso peripheral zzso zzso and zzso are also recognized in the zzso and that the modification of zzso cells to zzso growth factors significantly zzso their capacity to support extensive zzso growth in models of zzso zzso
