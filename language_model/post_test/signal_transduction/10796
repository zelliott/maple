During the development of human oral zzso communities, the spatial arrangement of the bacteria is thought to be driven by zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two early colonizing members of the dental plaque zzso have been zzso to participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carbohydrates to form zzso acid, which is a preferred zzso zzso for zzso zzso We found that, during zzso zzso of these organisms, a signaling event occurs that results in increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso scanning laser zzso of zzso zzso zzso using human saliva as the sole zzso showed that zzso zzso caused zzso zzso to increase expression of a zzso zzso fusion in a zzso resolved zzso In this open system, only those zzso in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso expressed zzso nearby zzso zzso colonies that lacked zzso zzso did not express zzso In a closed system containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso containing the zzso reporter zzso exhibited mean zzso levels zzso higher than did zzso zzso that had not been incubated with zzso zzso Thus, in a closed system where a zzso signal can accumulate above a required zzso zzso signaling mediates a change in gene zzso We provide evidence that, in open systems like those that predominate in natural zzso zzso signals between species are designed to function over short zzso on the order of 1 zzso
