zzso therapies targeting the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso have yielded more modest clinical benefit to patients with zzso lung cancer zzso than initially zzso Clinical data suggest a distinct zzso role of the zzso zzso in the different zzso zzso of lung zzso To clarify the influence of zzso differentiation in the zzso relevance of zzso signaling in zzso we performed a zzso analysis of the expression of three key elements of the zzso zzso in the earliest stages of the following two principal zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We evaluated tumor cell expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso using automatic zzso in a series of zzso patients with zzso zzso recruited as part of the zzso European Early Lung Cancer zzso Group zzso A score measuring the zzso signaling zzso was calculated by adding the tumor cell expression value of zzso and its two zzso The results were validated in two additional independent zzso of patients with zzso 

The combination of high zzso zzso and zzso protein expression was associated with lower risk of disease progression in early SCC zzso analysis, P zzso zzso zzso analysis, hazard ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso The results were validated in two independent patient zzso confirming the favorable zzso value of high zzso signaling score in early lung zzso 

Our results clearly indicate that the combination of high expression of the three key elements in the zzso zzso is associated with a good prognosis in patients with early SCC but not in patients with zzso
