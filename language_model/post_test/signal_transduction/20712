zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on the T cell surface that defines an alternative zzso signal for human T zzso zzso of zzso via zzso zzso triggers proliferation and zzso in zzso T zzso In this study, we used highly specific competitive and irreversible zzso of zzso IV to study the role of the zzso activity in zzso of zzso T cells as well as of zzso normal human T cell zzso These zzso at zzso that blocked up to zzso of the zzso activity, did not specifically inhibit T cell zzso neither via zzso nor via zzso zzso This demonstrates that the zzso activity of zzso is not required for its T cell zzso zzso
