B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso is an zzso disease of slowly zzso zzso B zzso that develops in the aging zzso Whereas some patients with zzso have an zzso course and die after many years from unrelated causes, others progress very rapidly and succumb within a few years from this currently incurable zzso Over the past decade studies of the structure and function of the B cell zzso zzso zzso used by these zzso cells have helped redefine the nature of this zzso In this review we zzso and zzso several aspects of these zzso studies and how they might relate to the zzso In particular, we address the ability of zzso to select out and drive B cell clones from the normal state to overt zzso cells by binding to zzso that are relatively unique and characteristic of zzso zzso The differential capacity of some zzso cases to continue to zzso signals through the zzso during the zzso phase and the consequences for the in zzso biology of the zzso clone is also zzso Finally, we discuss current and emerging views of the cellular origin of zzso cells and the differentiation pathways down which we believe these cells zzso
