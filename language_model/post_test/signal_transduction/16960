zzso brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease zzso have been well zzso However, significant methods for the treatment of the progression of zzso are unavailable zzso Heat shock protein 70 zzso plays important roles in neural protection from stress by assisting cellular protein zzso In this study, we investigated the effect and the molecular mechanism of zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in differentiated zzso zzso The results of this study showed that zzso (10 zzso significantly increased zzso protein production in a pattern that was consistent with the increase in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and induced differentiated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the cell death induced by zzso In addition, zzso zzso 10 zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso expression and decreased the formation of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso (10 zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso in differentiated zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was significantly attenuated by an zzso inhibitor zzso 50 zzso or in zzso cells zzso with an zzso small interfering zzso However, zzso of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso did not affect the zzso effect of zzso against zzso in differentiated zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso effect of zzso against zzso toxicity is mainly zzso by the induction of zzso Thus, zzso is a potential agent against zzso
