The understanding of the anatomy and development of fetal and adult hair zzso and the molecular study of the major embryonic pathways that regulate the hair zzso have led to exciting discoveries concerning the development of zzso cell zzso zzso These studies have shed light on the major roles of Sonic zzso zzso signaling and its interactions with the zzso growth factor zzso axis in zzso zzso New work, for example, explores a link between zzso signaling and zzso binding zzso zzso in the hair zzso as it zzso into zzso zzso was zzso in specific hair zzso cells of mice with zzso activated zzso signaling zzso 14 zzso patched zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion resulted in both an expansion of the stem cell niche and zzso of cell zzso In transformed hair zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso cell zzso Evidence also indicated that zzso is expressed in human zzso
