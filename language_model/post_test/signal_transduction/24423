The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its constituent chains zzso 3, beta 3, gamma 2) are normally not zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells but the zzso gamma 2 chain can be detected in cancer cells at the invasive front of a subset of colon zzso These cells are subjected to zzso such as transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) and zzso growth factor zzso produced by the zzso cells or by the surrounding zzso zzso The purpose of the present work was to investigate whether zzso 1 and zzso known to stimulate the zzso gene zzso the zzso gamma 2 chain, might zzso to activate the zzso promoter, and to identify the promoter elements zzso We find evidence for zzso between zzso and zzso with respect to zzso gamma 2 chain expression and promoter zzso and demonstrate that this requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso element of the promoter and an additional upstream element which is also responsive to zzso of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso The transcripts zzso the other zzso chains are not zzso activated by zzso and zzso Thus the synergistic zzso of the zzso gene is zzso via different zzso and results in an overproduction of the zzso gamma 2 chain relative to the other zzso constituent zzso This difference may explain why zzso gamma 2 chains accumulate in the cells at the invasive front of colon zzso
