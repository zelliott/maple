With respect to the beta zzso and beta zzso receptors zzso the beta zzso zzso specific zzso effects in a few target zzso and exhibits zzso pharmacological properties that distinguish it zzso from its zzso zzso the beta zzso represents a suitable model to study the molecular mechanism responsible for zzso zzso selectivity and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso newly characterized in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the beta zzso were also evaluated in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing beta zzso and beta zzso and were classified into three groups according to their pharmacological zzso Among the beta zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit beta 3 selectivity in stimulating zzso zzso among the beta zzso 2 zzso displaying beta 3 zzso effects zzso zzso exhibits beta zzso binding zzso whereas among the beta zzso zzso 3 zzso class zzso is the most efficient (but not zzso beta zzso zzso The structures of these zzso were simulated and compared using computer-generated molecular zzso zzso relationship analysis indicates that potent or selective beta zzso compounds, in addition to possessing a zzso common to all zzso zzso contain a long and bulky zzso zzso zzso which is able to adopt and exchange extended and stacked zzso zzso three-dimensional models of the beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso binding sites show that more bulky zzso acid side chains point inside the groove of the beta 1 and beta 2 sites, compared with the beta 3 site, in a region implicated in signal zzso The long zzso chain of compounds behaving as beta zzso 2 zzso and beta 3 zzso may thus adopt either a stacked zzso in the zzso beta zzso and beta zzso sites, leading to zzso effects, or an extended zzso in the less zzso beta 3 site, thus interacting with specific zzso implicated in signal zzso
