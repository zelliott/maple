zzso responsive factors zzso are important zzso zzso factors, some of which have been demonstrated to interact with the zzso zzso box and the zzso element zzso however, data on the roles of zzso proteins in connection with various signaling pathways are zzso In this research, we used the zzso box, an essential zzso element responsive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso as bait in a zzso zzso system to isolate zzso factors from tomato zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso which was designated zzso and zzso Response Factor 1 zzso encodes an zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso motif and functioning as a zzso zzso in zzso through targeting to the nucleus in onion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso bound not only to the zzso box but also to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in tomato was induced by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and salt treatment, indicating that zzso might act as a zzso among different signal zzso zzso Further research with transgenic zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso plants indicated that zzso zzso activated expression of zzso zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso under normal growth conditions, and subsequently resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt stress, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso tolerance by zzso of downstream gene expression through interaction with the zzso box or zzso
