The zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play central roles in reproduction and zzso zzso Their actions are zzso via binding to zzso zzso zzso highly expressed in brown zzso tissue zzso yet their impact on zzso function and metabolism remains zzso 

zzso knockout zzso newborn mice were zzso characterized in terms of zzso and their BAT differentiation zzso for gene expression zzso zzso brown zzso cell lines were established to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso signaling on BAT zzso Here, we report that newborn mice lacking zzso have zzso BAT zzso that express low levels of zzso nuclear zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and the zzso zzso reducing mouse viability during cold zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to undergo differentiation into mature zzso a zzso reversed by zzso of zzso That the effects of the zzso in BAT are at least partly zzso by zzso Growth zzso zzso is supported zzso zzso a striking reduction in BAT zzso expression in zzso zzso mice and in zzso zzso zzso induction of cellular zzso expression by zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversal of defective differentiation in zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that the zzso act in concert with zzso to control brown zzso differentiation and zzso Given the prominent role of brown zzso tissue during the zzso period, our results identified zzso zzso signaling as a major player and a potential therapeutic target in protecting newborn zzso against zzso
