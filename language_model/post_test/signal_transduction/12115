During breast cancer development, increased presence of zzso in zzso zzso parallels disease zzso however, the functional significance of zzso in regulating zzso versus zzso immunity in the breast remains poorly zzso zzso the zzso model of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso T zzso indirectly promote invasion and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso by directly regulating the zzso and zzso function of zzso zzso zzso that in turn enhance zzso through zzso of zzso growth factor zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso acquired immune programs can be zzso in zzso zzso and instead promote zzso by engaging cellular components of the innate immune system functionally involved in regulating zzso cell zzso
