In cardiac zzso stimulation of zzso zzso leads to a zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso II, zzso is tissue type zzso and zzso the zzso signal with zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso both zzso binding and zzso activities of zzso To zzso whether zzso mediates zzso zzso signal zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rat zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso and zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso In zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by an zzso blocker zzso but not by an zzso blocker zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso blocker zzso zzso of zzso and zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso through zzso stimulation and zzso is partly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was completely inhibited by zzso
