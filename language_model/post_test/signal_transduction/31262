zzso signaling increases zzso stem cell zzso and is activated in both zzso and zzso zzso indicating involvement in both normal and zzso zzso We report here activated zzso zzso signaling in the zzso system through conditional expression of a stable form of zzso This enforced expression led to zzso failure associated with loss of zzso lineage commitment at the zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso and loss of zzso stem cell zzso Loss of zzso stem cell function was associated with decreased expression of zzso zzso the cell cycle inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso and altered zzso expression in zzso cells, whereas zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling therefore causes zzso differentiation block and compromised zzso stem cell zzso
