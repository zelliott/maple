Using zzso ethanol as a zzso agent, 20 zzso zzso to prevent zzso and 1 zzso zzso to affect zzso zzso in zzso we examined the zzso and function of zzso zzso employing the zzso of zzso and the zzso swimming behavior as indicators for zzso zzso As a function of zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso and zzso with a short-lived zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicated zzso and formation of zzso zzso the reported zzso zzso inward current in the zzso membrane is coupled to zzso generation of zzso This is comparable to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inward current and zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso yet zzso control cells did not respond to a zzso with backward swimming or formation of zzso Both responses recovered with similar zzso A persistent effect of an ethanol exposure on the zzso apparatus or on zzso zzso activity of zzso control cells was excluded using zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Further, in the presence of 20 zzso zzso zzso cells only recovered the zzso avoiding reaction whereas the formation of zzso remained depressed, zzso the drug dissected both zzso Similarly, ethanol exposure of zzso did not affect the fast swimming response towards the zzso agent zzso whereas the zzso formation was zzso and recovered over a period of 7 zzso zzso zzso dissected the zzso behavioral response from the zzso zzso zzso The data demonstrate that in zzso zzso and zzso behavioral responses and zzso formation are not zzso The behavioral changes are triggered by smaller zzso inward currents than the formation of zzso zzso
