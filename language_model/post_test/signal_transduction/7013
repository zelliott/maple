Although the genes involved in metal zzso have been investigated over the past few decades, many genes related to metal zzso remain zzso and a comprehensive analysis of the expression of these genes is zzso In the present study, we investigated the spatial gene expression profile of iron zzso and cadmium zzso zzso zzso zzso using laser zzso and zzso zzso Roots of zzso and zzso rice were separated into the vascular zzso cortex, and zzso plus zzso In addition, vascular zzso from new and old leaves at the lowest zzso which are important for metal distribution, were analyzed zzso The spatial expression patterns were distinct in each tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress also had significant effects on the zzso although these were less pronounced than the spatial zzso Genes zzso zzso involved in metal zzso proteins associated with heavy metal detoxification, and zzso proteins were zzso zzso Additionally, zzso motifs involved in the regulation of these diverse expression changes in various tissue types were zzso The spatial zzso presented here provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of metal zzso
