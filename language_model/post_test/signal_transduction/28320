Nerve growth factor zzso activates zzso to trigger signaling events that promote the survival, differentiation and maintenance of zzso The zzso that controls the retrograde transport of the zzso signal from zzso terminals to zzso cell bodies is not zzso The zzso zzso hypothesis stipulates that zzso zzso and signaling proteins are zzso transported on zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence for the existence of signaling zzso Following zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso contain zzso bound to zzso together with activated signaling proteins of the zzso zzso zzso signals from isolated zzso through the zzso zzso Early zzso appear to represent a second type of signaling zzso We found that zzso induced a sustained zzso of zzso a small zzso zzso protein of the Ras family, and that this zzso occurred in early zzso that contain key elements of zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that the failure of retrograde zzso signaling in a mouse model of Down syndrome zzso may be due to the failure to retrograde transport signaling zzso It is important to define further the significance of signaling zzso in the biology of both normal and zzso zzso
