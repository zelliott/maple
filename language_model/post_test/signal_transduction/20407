A rapid and efficient method to stimulate bone zzso would be useful in zzso stem cell zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso 4 zzso which mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso enhances osteogenesis induced by bone zzso protein 2 zzso in zzso However, there is little data on the precise zzso by which the zzso inhibitor regulates zzso gene zzso In this study, we investigated the combined ability of zzso and zzso a second-generation zzso zzso to enhance the zzso differentiation of zzso stem cells zzso The alkaline zzso zzso activity of zzso treated with zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso and/or zzso was compared with the zzso activity of zzso differentiated only by zzso medium zzso Moreover, expression of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso using real-time zzso chain reaction zzso It was found that zzso enhances the zzso differentiation of zzso equally well as zzso in primary cultured zzso Moreover, according to the zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso was found to be an important signal zzso zzso in zzso the zzso effect of zzso and this effect is intensified by an increase in zzso levels induced by zzso zzso
