zzso cells, derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso of the zzso for zzso were zzso with expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The differentiation response to zzso and zzso was analyzed in the resulting cell zzso zzso differentiation in response to zzso was not affected by any of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso differentiation was inhibited by zzso and zzso and slightly delayed by zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso causes strong zzso zzso of zzso whereas the response to zzso is zzso The expression of the zzso proteins had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso and zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso but did not abolish zzso It appears, therefore, that zzso zzso and zzso and zzso do not inhibit zzso zzso activity involved in zzso zzso cell zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso zzso activity required for zzso zzso
