The zzso signaling zzso is known to be involved in various stress responses in plants, but little is known specifically on the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso fatty acid zzso zzso genes in response to low zzso To uncover this problem, the expression level of three zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso and the content of zzso acid zzso in both wild type zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso plants disrupted in the zzso zzso were analyzed under normal conditions and the chilling treatment zzso zzso As compared with zzso plants, zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso genes significantly changed when the zzso zzso was blocked or zzso and presented either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso increases in the content of zzso found in zzso plants, obviously reduced in both leaves and roots, and even turned to a decrease in stems when the zzso zzso was zzso Overall, the zzso of zzso zzso genes and the proportion of zzso in the whole plant both of zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso plants under chilling stress were evidently lower than those of zzso plants, except the expression of zzso gene in zzso All these findings indicate that the zzso zzso does participate in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes in zzso
