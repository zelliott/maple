The capacity for perpetual zzso is one of the main characteristics of stem zzso Little is known about the effect of embryonic neural stem cell zzso factors on auditory cell proliferation in zzso In the present work, two auditory cell types were cultured in the presence of zzso molecules and were evaluated in zzso Our results demonstrated that both cell viability and cell proliferation were significantly enhanced upon treatment with zzso zzso zzso which contains significantly elevated levels of leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso medium not only activated the expression of leukemia zzso factor zzso in House zzso zzso of zzso 1 cells but also zzso the zzso downstream signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso either the zzso signaling zzso with zzso zzso or the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of cell zzso suggesting that zzso molecules promote auditory cell survival via the regulatory zzso signaling zzso
