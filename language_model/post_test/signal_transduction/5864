In current models of transforming growth zzso zzso family zzso type II receptors activate specific zzso zzso zzso zzso type I zzso These zzso zzso activate zzso zzso regulated zzso by zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso expression levels affected the zzso and zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso active type I and type II receptors in zzso cells resulted in the zzso of both zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This was verified using in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso melanoma cells, zzso and zzso induced zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the inhibitor of differentiation zzso zzso which is usually regulated by zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso Except for zzso and zzso levels of type I and type II zzso zzso were higher in zzso cells than in zzso and zzso cells, in which zzso and zzso induced zzso of only the expected zzso These results help to explain the diverse effects of this zzso zzso
