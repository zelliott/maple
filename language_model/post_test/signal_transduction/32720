The resolution of immune responses is characterized by extensive zzso of activated T zzso However, to generate and maintain zzso memory, some zzso T cells must survive and zzso to a resting zzso zzso zzso that bind to the common gamma chain of the zzso zzso promote the survival of T cell zzso but also induce zzso In contrast, soluble factors zzso by zzso cells induce zzso survival in a resting zzso zzso We now report that zzso is the principal zzso of zzso zzso zzso rescue from zzso zzso and zzso promote the zzso of blast zzso to a resting zzso zzso with all the characteristic features of zzso cell zzso such as high zzso expression and low zzso Type I zzso and zzso cells stimulate apparently identical signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso We also show that this mechanism may play a fundamental role in the persistence of T cells at sites of chronic zzso suggesting that chronic inflammation is an zzso consequence of zzso zzso
