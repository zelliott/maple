BAY zzso a novel, engineered form of zzso zzso is a selective zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the proliferation of activated human T cells with potency similar to zzso zzso zzso but has reduced zzso activity on natural killer cells and is associated with a diminished secondary zzso zzso In the current study, the zzso profiles of human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso with BAY zzso and zzso were compared using zzso zzso technology in combination with zzso zzso Analysis zzso to determine whether there are quantitative or qualitative differences in the molecular networks activated by these zzso zzso A total of 299 genes were zzso expressed in response to the two zzso zzso with an increase in the number of differences over zzso zzso with the fact that BAY zzso interacts with fewer forms of the zzso zzso than zzso to activate fewer cell types, 169 genes were expressed at lower levels in zzso cultured with BAY zzso compared with zzso These genes were mainly zzso as zzso and zzso and were used to build multiple molecular interaction networks, the most significant of which centered around a zzso of zzso which is known to play a pivotal role in zzso and was associated with cell zzso Of the genes induced in response to BAY zzso only zzso were expressed at lower levels than those induced by zzso Moreover, despite its more selective zzso targeting compared with zzso BAY zzso caused higher levels of expression of 130 zzso which predominantly fell into categories associated with metabolism and zzso We interpret these results as consistent with the expected zzso profile of a zzso engineered and demonstrated to have diminished inflammatory effects yet fully retain selected features of zzso zzso In addition to demonstrating that the responses to BAY zzso are characterized by differential expression of genes known to be induced by zzso we report for the first time the induction of a significant number of genes not previously reported in the context of zzso zzso
