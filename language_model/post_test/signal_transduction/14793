The onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases superimposed on a declining nervous system could exacerbate the motor and cognitive behavioral deficits that normally occur in zzso It is likely that, in cases of severe deficits in memory or motor function, hospitalization and/or zzso care would be a likely zzso This means that unless some way is found to reduce these age-related zzso in zzso function, zzso costs will continue to rise zzso Thus, it is extremely important to explore methods to zzso or reverse the age-related zzso deficits as well as their zzso behavioral zzso zzso molecular biological approaches to slow aging in the human condition may be years zzso So it is important to determine what methods can be used today to increase healthy aging, zzso the onset of these diseases, and create conditions favorable to obtaining a zzso zzso in both financial and human zzso In this regard, zzso studies indicate that consumption of diets rich in antioxidants and zzso compounds, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, may lower the risk of developing age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases zzso and zzso Research suggests that the zzso compounds found in zzso such as zzso may exert their beneficial effects by altering stress signaling and zzso communication, suggesting that interventions may exert protection against age-related deficits in cognitive and motor zzso The purpose of this article is to discuss the benefits of these interventions in zzso models and to describe the putative molecular mechanisms involved in their zzso
