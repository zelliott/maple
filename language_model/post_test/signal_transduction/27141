One of the zzso zzso signal zzso mechanisms is based on zzso zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso G protein zzso leading to stimulation of zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso is then thought to mediate its effects zzso if not entirely, by zzso of protein zzso A and the subsequent zzso of zzso which in turn control diverse cellular zzso In this report we zzso by two different methods, that reduction or elimination of protein zzso A activity had no effect on zzso generated by zzso of zzso alpha pathways in zzso wing zzso zzso These genetic studies show that the zzso alpha zzso mediates its primary effects by a novel zzso in zzso wing zzso zzso This novel zzso may in part be responsible for some of the complex, zzso responses observed following zzso of this zzso in different cell zzso
