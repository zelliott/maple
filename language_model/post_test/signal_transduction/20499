zzso alcohol exposure causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders zzso the most common, preventable cause of zzso zzso The developing zzso is particularly vulnerable to the effects of zzso We reported that ethanol zzso the stimulation of zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso an active motif of zzso zzso protein zzso by blocking zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream signaling zzso the scaffolding protein zzso Here, we asked whether ethanol zzso the stimulation of zzso outgrowth by diverse zzso guidance molecules through a common action on the zzso family zzso zzso We first demonstrated that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso and neural cell zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso outgrowth in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso blocked the stimulation of zzso outgrowth and the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by each of these zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and activated zzso without first zzso zzso or zzso zzso relevant zzso of ethanol inhibited zzso outgrowth and the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso but did not disrupt zzso zzso outgrowth or zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso but not zzso is a primary target for ethanol zzso of zzso zzso The ability of ethanol to block the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso could contribute significantly to the zzso of zzso
