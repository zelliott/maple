This review addresses the control exerted by insulin through its zzso on the general metabolism and gene expression in chicken liver and zzso Compared with zzso chickens have similar zzso of circulating insulin, but still maintain high plasma zzso zzso This may be a consequence of the low sensitivity of the chicken to zzso zzso In order to determine whether this low sensitivity is the result of differences in insulin zzso signaling between zzso and birds, insulin receptors have been characterized in several chicken zzso and two insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been described in liver and zzso Compared with zzso current knowledge of insulin signaling in birds is zzso This is particularly evident when considering the number of zzso of the components involved in the insulin cascade zzso zzso zzso and others) many of which may have not been characterized in the zzso Despite these shortfalls in available data, it appears that insulin signaling in chicken liver is similar to that in zzso but is unlike that in zzso in zzso In leg muscle, chickens differ from zzso in the early steps of the insulin signaling cascade zzso zzso and zzso where zzso activity is about zzso greater in the chicken than in the zzso This zzso zzso of zzso in chicken muscle may zzso a feedback zzso zzso described in zzso thereby desensitizing chicken muscle to zzso
