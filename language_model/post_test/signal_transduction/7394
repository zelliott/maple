zzso can be induced by inflammatory zzso such as zzso and zzso This study investigated whether zzso regulates zzso given that zzso zzso signaling of these two zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in human lung zzso zzso cells carrying wild type zzso a zzso factor reported for zzso but not in zzso zzso cells carrying zzso zzso However, zzso also induced zzso in zzso cells with short hairpin zzso zzso No changes in zzso zzso expression were observed in zzso cells, but zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 was markedly zzso In zzso cells, increased levels of zzso oxygen species induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso while zzso was essential for zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso resistance, and the manipulation of the zzso zzso altered zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso target of zzso zzso contributed to both zzso resistance and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso also modulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of human zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso and zzso induced zzso expression through a common zzso that was regulated by zzso but not zzso
