In order to zzso the zzso at specific sites of inflammation or zzso zzso circulating zzso must rapidly translate specific adhesive and zzso signals into firm zzso zzso arrest is nearly exclusively zzso by zzso zzso Recent in zzso and in zzso evidence suggests that specialized zzso support zzso zzso that slow down zzso rolling of zzso prior to their zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso signaling can take place within zzso of seconds, resulting either in zzso zzso zzso or immediate arrest on the vascular zzso The ability of zzso zzso to rapidly respond to these in zzso zzso zzso appears to depend on zzso affinity and zzso states, which are internally regulated by zzso constraints on zzso zzso and zzso We discuss potential regulatory mechanisms by which a given set of zzso receptors and zzso may interact to rapidly generate high zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest on vascular zzso
