zzso zzso zzso are essential to innate immunity in humans and contribute significantly to zzso Although progress has been made, the molecular basis for termination of inflammation in humans is incompletely zzso We used human zzso zzso to identify genes zzso inflammatory zzso that were zzso regulated during the induction of zzso One hundred zzso of 212 zzso expressed genes zzso zzso factors, signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and other proteins that facilitate the inflammatory response were zzso during the induction of zzso following zzso zzso Among these, 42 genes zzso proteins critical to the inflammatory response, including receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Many of these genes were similarly zzso during zzso or zzso zzso We used flow zzso to confirm that zzso beta zzso and zzso alpha were significantly zzso during zzso zzso We also discovered that 23 genes zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso which comprise complex pathways essential to the inflammatory response of host cells, were zzso regulated during zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso capacity at the level of gene expression during induction of zzso These findings provide new insight into the molecular events that resolve inflammation following zzso zzso in zzso
