Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso of zzso factors nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are modulated by the zzso and promote resistance to cell zzso zzso show variable sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso and patient tumors in zzso and the mechanisms are not well zzso To address this question, the sensitivities of nine zzso cell lines to zzso were determined using zzso zzso zzso and the potential relationship between the sensitivity and zzso effects on biological processes was examined in zzso lines of differential zzso zzso The most sensitive cell line zzso underwent cell death at zzso zzso in zzso and tumor zzso at a zzso tolerated dose of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The differential sensitivity between zzso and zzso cells corresponded to differences in the extent of suppression of zzso activity, zzso protein degradation, and zzso and zzso zzso Lower zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso and sustained zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso reporter activity and cell density of zzso were suppressed when zzso was combined with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways zzso Thus, the differential sensitivities to zzso corresponded to dissimilar effects on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways blocked zzso activity and enhanced the zzso zzso These findings revealed molecular mechanisms of zzso sensitivity and resistance, which are under development as zzso for clinical trials in patients with zzso
