A substantial body of evidence implicates the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in regulation of zzso differentiation and zzso In this study we wished to determine if zzso also plays a role in the regulation of zzso 

Mice zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an activated zzso of zzso zzso were used to explore the in zzso biological role of zzso zzso in these mice was assessed by zzso analysis, lineage marker analysis, bone-marrow colony zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso mice displayed reductions in peripheral red cell zzso However, there was an zzso of immature zzso zzso which displayed increased zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso were both detected in early zzso zzso and in mature red zzso zzso was also activated in response to zzso zzso and stem cell factor zzso two critical factors in zzso zzso In addition, increased zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso was observed in zzso primary zzso cells in response to EPO or zzso zzso 

These data support a role for zzso in regulating the survival and differentiation of zzso cells through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways induced by EPO and zzso The increased numbers and survival of zzso zzso from zzso mice, and their differential responsiveness to zzso and EPO, implicates zzso in the commitment of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The anemic zzso in zzso mice suggests that zzso of zzso activity might be required for terminal zzso zzso
