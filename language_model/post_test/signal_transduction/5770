zzso regulatory T cells zzso play a key role in the maintenance of the gut immune zzso and an intact transforming growth factor zzso signaling is required for their zzso In inflammatory zzso disease zzso the zzso signaling is impaired because of high expression of the zzso zzso zzso Although no intrinsic defects in zzso function have been shown in zzso it is still unknown whether zzso T cells are susceptible to zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated whether zzso zzso zzso T cells are resistant to zzso and whether zzso is involved in this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured with or without zzso and proliferation was assessed by flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also evaluated after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso proliferation and zzso zzso expression was investigated in zzso zzso transgenic zzso In zzso the zzso resistance of zzso zzso T cells to zzso was studied in the adoptive transfer model of zzso 

zzso zzso were resistant to zzso suppression, and this phenomenon was reverted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells isolated from zzso transgenic mice showed high zzso produced considerable amount of inflammatory zzso following zzso and induced a severe colitis when transferred in zzso zzso knockout mice even in the presence of zzso zzso 

zzso makes zzso T cells resistant to zzso suppression thus zzso their zzso zzso
