zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso serving a central role in cell growth zzso zzso function in two zzso zzso complexes, zzso complex 1 zzso and zzso the mechanisms underlying their actions and regulation are not fully zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulates cell integrity and zzso zzso Two classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso that we previously identified display cell integrity and zzso zzso yet one is suppressed by zzso while the other is suppressed by zzso or zzso defining two zzso downstream signaling mechanisms, one zzso by zzso and the other by zzso zzso these zzso we explored zzso functions in zzso structure and zzso By observing zzso protein interactions using zzso we discovered that the composition of zzso and its recruitment of the downstream zzso zzso and zzso were zzso affected in different zzso zzso These molecular defects can be corrected only by expressing zzso not by expressing zzso highlighting the role of zzso as a structural and signaling scaffold for zzso zzso modifications of zzso zzso by deletion of individual zzso proteins indicate that two zzso downstream signaling branches zzso on zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso links to zzso zzso specifically through the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso
