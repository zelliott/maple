Although zzso zzso cells zzso play a pivotal role in the zzso repair following zzso injury and zzso stress has a beneficial effect on zzso however, the molecular mechanism underlying the influence of zzso on the zzso integrity and the regulation of zzso stress on the zzso signaling remained to be zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso stress on the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling and its relation to in zzso zzso capacity of human early zzso The human early zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso stress in a zzso manner increased zzso zzso zzso adhesive and zzso activities of zzso zzso of zzso treated by zzso stress facilitated in zzso zzso in nude mouse model of carotid artery zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in response to zzso stress was significantly zzso With treatment of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso of zzso was markedly zzso After zzso signaling was zzso the effects of zzso stress on in zzso function and in zzso zzso capacity of zzso were significantly zzso The present findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso signaling zzso is, at least in part, involved in the zzso zzso after zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling contributes to enhanced in zzso zzso capacity of human zzso
