The zzso zzso is a major zzso regulator that acts at short and long range to direct cell fate decisions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the only known zzso protein to possess a zzso linked cholesterol zzso Although the role of the cholesterol group of zzso remains zzso it has been suggested to be zzso for the its long-range activity in zzso Here, we provide data in three different zzso - zzso and zzso embryonic zzso and zzso zzso disc tissue - showing that cholesterol modification is in fact necessary for the controlled long-range activity of zzso zzso We provide an explanation for the zzso between our results and previous reports by showing that unmodified zzso can act at long range, albeit in an uncontrolled manner, only when expressed in zzso zzso Our data show that cholesterol modification controls long-range zzso activity at multiple zzso First, cholesterol increases the affinity of zzso for the plasma zzso and consequently enhances its apparent intrinsic activity, both in zzso and in zzso In addition, zzso of active zzso requires the presence of zzso These zzso are correlated with the assembly of zzso into zzso located, large zzso structures present in active zzso zzso in zzso By comparing the activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, we show that zzso cells provide the machinery necessary for the controlled zzso movement of zzso thereby preventing the unrestricted spreading of the protein within the three-dimensional space of the zzso We conclude that, as in zzso cholesterol modification is essential for controlled long-range zzso zzso in zzso
