zzso zzso of protein interactions provides a means of simulating large biological zzso The zzso zzso Extension Algorithm via zzso zzso zzso method, in which the force zzso of a zzso elastic network model are calculated from the zzso zzso obtained from zzso molecular dynamics zzso zzso involves direct mapping between scales without the need for zzso zzso Here, the zzso of the zzso force field is examined between protein molecules of different structural zzso As test cases, zzso (all zzso zzso (all zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso The force zzso derived are found to be closely similar in all three zzso An MD version of zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso MD simulations of the three proteins are compared with zzso MD zzso The zzso fluctuations of the zzso MD are well reproduced by the zzso Model functions for the zzso zzso derived by averaging over the three zzso are also shown to produce fluctuations in good agreement with the zzso zzso The results indicate that, similarly to the use of zzso force fields, it is now possible to use a single, generic zzso force field for all protein studies, without having first to derive parameters from zzso MD simulation for each individual system zzso The zzso method is thus likely to be a reliable way of determining zzso motion of a variety of proteins without the need for expensive zzso of long zzso MD zzso
