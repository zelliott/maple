Bone zzso zzso zzso cells are under investigation for cardiovascular repair but may be altered by zzso Our aim was to identify differences in gene expression in zzso cells of patients with coronary artery disease zzso and healthy controls, and determine whether exercise zzso gene zzso 

zzso cells were zzso from 10 zzso patients and four controls, and total zzso was isolated for zzso gene expression zzso Genes that were found to be zzso regulated in patients were analyzed further to investigate whether exercise had any zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso patients following 3 months of an exercise zzso 

Improvement in effort tolerance and increases in the number of zzso cells were observed in zzso patients after 3 months of zzso Gene expression analysis of the zzso cells identified 82 zzso expressed genes zzso zzso zzso zzso rate and % present zzso in patients compared with controls, of which 59 were found to be zzso and 23 zzso These genes were found to be involved in zzso zzso cell cycle, cellular development and zzso and molecular zzso Following completion of the exercise program, gene expression patterns resembled those of controls in seven of 10 zzso 

zzso in gene expression of zzso zzso zzso cells were found in zzso patients, which in part may be zzso by zzso
