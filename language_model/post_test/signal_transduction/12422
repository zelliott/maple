The mechanisms involved in sensing zzso zzso zzso such as zzso in plant and animal cells are not completely zzso In the present study, we tested the zzso that zzso of Met zzso to zzso zzso zzso can couple zzso signals to changes in protein zzso We demonstrate that when a Met zzso functions as a zzso recognition element within a zzso zzso its zzso can strongly inhibit zzso zzso in zzso This is shown to occur with zzso soybean zzso zzso protein zzso and human zzso zzso protein zzso To determine whether this effect may occur in zzso we monitored the zzso status of zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso on zzso using zzso zzso zzso was a candidate protein for this mechanism because zzso located at the zzso position, serves as a zzso recognition element for zzso of zzso and its zzso substantially zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Two lines of evidence suggest that Met zzso may inhibit zzso of zzso in zzso First, zzso of zzso at the zzso site was sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in normal darkened leaves was increased by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with the notion that zzso of zzso Met zzso in zzso zzso zzso such as zzso can inhibit the zzso of nearby sites and thereby couple zzso signals to changes in protein zzso
