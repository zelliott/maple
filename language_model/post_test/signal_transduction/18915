zzso B4 zzso is a potent zzso and zzso for zzso and is implicated in several inflammatory zzso The actions of zzso are zzso by two cell surface zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in peripheral blood zzso and zzso which is expressed more zzso Recently, zzso expression and zzso zzso have been reported in immature mast cells zzso We now show the first evidence for zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso in zzso bone zzso zzso zzso and in a human zzso line zzso zzso expression of zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso in zzso cells and shown to be predominantly zzso Both zzso cells and zzso migrated to zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso to zzso could be inhibited by either a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso also was observed to zzso acid, a zzso zzso demonstrating functional zzso activity in these zzso zzso of zzso with zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also was observed in response to zzso acid, indicating signaling downstream of zzso zzso of zzso with stem cell factor significantly zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited their migration to zzso This study demonstrates expression of functional zzso zzso both zzso and zzso in zzso and human zzso and a regulatory role for stem cell factor in their zzso These receptors may mediate recruitment and zzso of zzso in response to zzso production in areas of zzso
