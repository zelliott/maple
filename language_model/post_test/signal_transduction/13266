zzso and zzso are two canine zzso of zzso virus 5 zzso zzso was originally isolated from the zzso fluid of a dog with temporary zzso paralysis and zzso was recovered at 12 days zzso from the brain tissue of a dog zzso infected with zzso We have previously shown that the V protein of zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso by targeting zzso for zzso Here we report that whilst zzso targets zzso for degradation, zzso fails to and as a consequence, zzso blocks zzso zzso but zzso does zzso Three zzso acid differences in the zzso zzso common domain of the V protein are responsible for the observed difference in the abilities of zzso and zzso to block zzso zzso In cells persistently infected with zzso the virus may become zzso in response to zzso under which circumstances virus zzso are lost from the surface of infected cells and virus zzso proteins accumulate in zzso inclusion zzso We suggest that in zzso cells infected with zzso viruses (in which there would be continuous virus protein zzso may be more susceptible to killing by zzso T cells than cells infected with zzso viruses (in which virus protein synthesis was zzso and a model of virus persistence is put forward in which there is alternating selection of zzso and zzso viruses depending upon the state of the zzso immune zzso
