The activity of the zzso zzso factor, zzso is induced by the zzso zzso of zzso or unfolded zzso The inner membrane protein zzso is the central regulatory zzso in this signal zzso cascade and acts as a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity is primarily determined by the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso is rapidly zzso in response to zzso stress, leading to an increase in the free pool of zzso and initiation of the stress zzso We present evidence that the putative inner membrane zzso zzso zzso is responsible for this regulated degradation of zzso
