zzso of G protein signaling 2 zzso is a zzso protein for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is linked to hypertension in mice and humans, although zzso mechanisms are not zzso Because zzso dysfunction and increased peripheral resistance are hallmarks of hypertension, determining whether zzso regulates zzso zzso may reveal mechanisms relevant to cardiovascular zzso Here we have determined the effects of systemic versus zzso or vascular smooth zzso deletion of zzso on zzso contraction and zzso zzso and relaxation of zzso resistance arteries were analyzed in response to zzso sodium zzso or zzso with or without zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso or zzso channels that mediate zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The results showed that deleting zzso in vascular smooth muscle had minor zzso zzso or zzso deletion of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso had little effect on zzso relaxation but markedly impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso in zzso did not affect blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso was rescued by blocking zzso zzso with zzso zzso These findings indicated that systemic or zzso zzso zzso causes zzso dysfunction resulting in impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso enables zzso zzso activity to inhibit zzso relaxation, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso in hypertension patients therefore may contribute to zzso dysfunction and defective zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling might improve zzso function in such zzso
