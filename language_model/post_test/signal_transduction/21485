Progressive disease in the zzso model of visceral zzso caused by zzso zzso in contrast to infection in mice, mimics the progressive disease observed in zzso zzso During progressive infection in zzso there was a vigorous type 1 cellular immune response, which is typically associated with control of infection, suggesting that there was ineffective zzso zzso zzso Indeed, at the site of infection, zzso did not express NO zzso 2 zzso which is the primary mechanism for control of infection in zzso Furthermore, in striking contrast to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso did not did not express zzso nor generate zzso and were unable to restrict the replication of zzso zzso zzso The absent zzso zzso expression was not the result of zzso gene deletion and the zzso zzso had an intact open reading zzso Furthermore, the impaired zzso of zzso zzso was selective and not due to global impairment of zzso signaling zzso of the zzso zzso were expressed and functional and zzso zzso several primary and secondary response zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoter, like the human zzso had zzso less zzso and zzso activity than the corresponding mouse zzso Thus, reduced zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso unit, which is unique to this small animal and similar to the human counterpart, accompanies the inability of the animal to control an zzso zzso
