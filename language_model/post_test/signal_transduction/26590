We identified a new zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso a crucial zzso required for maintenance of cell zzso zzso becomes activated with zzso from the zzso to the nuclear zzso resulting in increased membrane zzso zzso zzso nuclear import is zzso by binding of its zzso to zzso zzso a regulator of nuclear zzso Here zzso zzso zzso within this zzso that signals association of zzso with zzso zzso to initiate zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso a sequence that displays similarities to a zzso nuclear export signal zzso that also binds zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso in cells results in zzso retained zzso zzso 1 was required for zzso nuclear export, and its zzso in cells was partially sufficient to trigger zzso nuclear export despite calcium zzso An isolated zzso zzso remained in the nucleus in the presence of zzso B but was able to target to the zzso with zzso Thus zzso zzso with zzso 1 for access to a zzso and assembly of a zzso zzso complex is a key zzso mechanism that drives nuclear zzso zzso
