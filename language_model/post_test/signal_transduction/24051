The zzso tumor zzso a zzso zzso binds to zzso to induce zzso cell cycle zzso zzso also prevents the proliferation of cells lacking zzso and zzso albeit less zzso We show that zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso and zzso zzso These effects correlate with but do not strictly depend upon zzso of zzso zzso or cell cycle arrest, are not zzso by zzso and require neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso acid zzso 2-14 do not block zzso synthesis and processing or inhibit cell zzso Evolution may have linked a primordial zzso zzso function to zzso and zzso creating a more efficient zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso
