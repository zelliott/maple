zzso are cellular components of wound repair, zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor recruit zzso to sites of zzso via stimulation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso to zzso is attenuated in individuals with diabetes zzso zzso This zzso resistance zzso with impaired collateral zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the molecular basis of zzso resistance and impaired zzso response in zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso could be zzso with either zzso growth zzso or zzso in zzso from zzso but not zzso zzso In contrast, zzso caused a comparable zzso of these molecules in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly elevated in zzso from zzso compared with zzso zzso Of note, zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso ex zzso zzso zzso zzso had stronger zzso modifications in zzso from zzso than from zzso individuals, which reflects functional protein zzso zzso zzso similar to that seen after zzso zzso Overall, protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso activity were reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed higher expression of the zzso for advanced zzso end zzso zzso with advanced zzso end products zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The elevated baseline zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso likely causes the resistance to further stimulation with specific stimuli such as zzso revealing a molecular explanation of the zzso signal zzso zzso 

We propose that elevated advanced zzso end products expression and increased zzso stress in diabetic zzso lead to zzso of zzso signaling pathways and to zzso of zzso zzso These data establish zzso resistance as a novel molecular concept for zzso cellular zzso
