zzso zzso is a zzso protein hormone that binds to a zzso membrane zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso and exerts its action via several interacting signaling zzso zzso is a zzso hormone that affects multiple zzso and zzso functions and is also involved in zzso In addition to being a classical zzso hormone, zzso in humans is produced by many zzso throughout the body where it acts as a zzso The objective of this review is to compare and contrast multiple aspects of zzso from structure to regulation, and from physiology to pathology in rats, mice, and zzso At each zzso questions are raised whether, or to what extent, data from zzso are relevant to zzso zzso in zzso Most current knowledge on zzso has been obtained from studies with rats and, more recently, from the use of transgenic zzso Although this information is indispensable for understanding zzso in human health and disease, there is sufficient disparity in the control of the production, distribution, and zzso functions of zzso among these species to warrant careful and judicial zzso to zzso
