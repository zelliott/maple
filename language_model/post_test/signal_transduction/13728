zzso are equipped with a zzso signaling network called the DNA damage response zzso This signaling network recognizes DNA zzso and zzso various downstream pathways to coordinate a cell cycle arrest with the repair of the damaged zzso zzso the zzso can mediate clearance of affected cells that are beyond repair through zzso or zzso The zzso can be activated in response to DNA damage throughout the cell cycle, although the extent of zzso signaling is different in each cell cycle zzso Especially in response to DNA double strand breaks, only a very marginal response was observed during zzso Early on it was recognized that cells which are zzso during zzso continued division without repairing broken zzso Although these initial observations indicated diminished DNA repair and lack of an acute DNA zzso cell cycle arrest, insight into the zzso zzso of zzso signaling during zzso was only recently zzso Different mechanisms appear to be at play to zzso specific signaling axes of the zzso network in zzso zzso zzso cells not simply zzso the entire zzso but appear to mark their DNA damage for repair after zzso zzso Since the treatment of cancer frequently involves agents that induce DNA damage as well as agents that block zzso zzso it is clinically relevant to obtain a better understanding of how cancer cells deal with DNA damage during zzso versus zzso In this review, the molecular details concerning zzso signaling during zzso as well as the consequences of encountering DNA damage during zzso for cellular fate are zzso
