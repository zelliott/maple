zzso acid zzso is an zzso zzso fatty acid that has beneficial protective effects against various vascular zzso In this study, we sought to determine whether zzso could induce zzso or zzso protective effects against simulated zzso and zzso cerebral zzso cell zzso injury by zzso the zzso zzso zzso are currently considered to be an important target for zzso zzso Mouse brain zzso cells zzso and primary cultures of zzso were subjected to zzso of oxygen zzso deprivation zzso followed by zzso of simulated zzso either alone or together with zzso administration before zzso or immediately after zzso zzso We found that zzso administration of zzso reduced the zzso and simulated zzso zzso zzso zzso release in zzso cells in a zzso manner and that zzso zzso zzso and zzso provided protection in both zzso cells and primary cultures of zzso However, zzso an zzso zzso was able to thoroughly abolish the protective effects of zzso Western zzso showed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso cells and primary zzso However, after zzso with zzso the level of zzso zzso was decreased in primary cultures of zzso but could still be restored by zzso whereas the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly decreased and could not be zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso provide protective effects against simulated zzso and zzso zzso injury by promoting the zzso zzso and that zzso is required for zzso zzso
