zzso and zzso zzso receptors can be activated by several different classes of zzso including cannabinoids such as zzso and zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso relationship studies have identified potential zzso elements for binding to zzso receptors by both cannabinoids and zzso zzso models have hypothesized zzso zzso and zzso distance requirements based upon zzso binding data zzso overlap of zzso elements of the two classes disclose a low energy zzso of zzso that can occupy the same zzso space as zzso zzso To test this model, we have developed a novel class of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, we predicted a spatial zzso for these compounds in a molecular model based on the zzso and structural requirements for binding to the zzso zzso zzso
