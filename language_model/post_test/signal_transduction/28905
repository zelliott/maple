zzso zzso is regulated by zzso hormonal cues and external environmental stimuli such as water, low temperature, and zzso After zzso the young zzso must rapidly establish its root system and the zzso capability appropriate to its surrounding zzso Light and the zzso zzso acid zzso both regulate seed zzso and zzso development, although how light and zzso signals are integrated at the molecular level is not zzso Here, we found that the previously described zzso component zzso also mediates zzso response in seed zzso early zzso growth, and root development in zzso zzso binds to the promoter of the zzso factor zzso gene with high affinity and is required for the expression of zzso and zzso late zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso also indicated that the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter is significantly enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso restores zzso sensitivity in zzso and results in enhanced light responses and shorter zzso in the wild zzso Our studies identified an unexpected mode of light and zzso signal integration that may help young zzso better adapt to environmental zzso
