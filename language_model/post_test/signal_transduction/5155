zzso zzso play a major role in memory and zzso The dysfunction and death of these zzso especially in the zzso are thought to contribute to the zzso of memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso studying the zzso properties and cell survival may help in treating this zzso We investigated the possible effects of zzso on zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express essential zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso for zzso showed an increase in zzso production zzso These features were partly recovered by zzso Treating zzso zzso cells with zzso markedly increased the expression of zzso and zzso an effect similar to that of zzso zzso factor zzso Furthermore, zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso B, attenuated the effects of both zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso protects zzso by increasing zzso and zzso expression through a zzso increase and thus may be useful for treating neurodegenerative zzso
