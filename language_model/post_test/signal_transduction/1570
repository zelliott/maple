zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso We assessed the ability of primary baby mouse kidney zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice to be transformed by zzso alone or in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso Although zzso alone transformed zzso cells from zzso mice, zzso alone did not transform zzso cells from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Thus, the loss of both zzso and zzso was not sufficient to relieve zzso suppression of transformation in zzso zzso To test the requirement for zzso and zzso in other death signaling zzso stable zzso plus zzso zzso cell lines were derived from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice and characterized for their response to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso The loss of both zzso and zzso severely impaired zzso zzso but the presence of either zzso or zzso alone was sufficient for cell zzso zzso c was released from zzso and zzso was activated in zzso or zzso cells in response to zzso but not in cells deficient in zzso Thus, either zzso or zzso is required for death signaling through zzso in response to zzso but both are zzso for zzso transformation zzso
