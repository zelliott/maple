The zzso output of zzso is key for rhythm generation in the zzso However, what controls zzso firing remains incompletely zzso Here we combine dynamic clamp experiments with neural network simulations to understand how zzso zzso zzso regulates the firing pattern of zzso zzso In baseline conditions, zzso zzso zzso these cells, thus exerting an zzso action while also reducing the zzso zzso potential zzso zzso through zzso As a result, the emergence of weak zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso firing pattern driven by individual zzso into a more regular zzso mode determined by the cell intrinsic zzso The increased zzso of zzso parallels stronger synchronization of the local zzso With further increases in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso starts to dominate over zzso actions and thus moderates zzso zzso The remaining spikes tend to follow the timing of zzso zzso and thus become less regular zzso The latter parallels a weakening in network zzso Thus, our observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso can zzso control brain rhythms through changes in the zzso of zzso and in the zzso structure of their firing zzso
