We hypothesized that induction of differentiation with zzso could increase sensitivity to zzso drug zzso zzso for zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of cells with 1 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso for 7 days induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and also down regulated zzso expression and activity, thereby increased sensitivity to zzso for zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso triggered production of zzso oxygen species zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activated zzso zzso for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The events of zzso included increase in expression of zzso down regulation of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso repeat containing zzso zzso zzso release of zzso c and zzso into the zzso increase in zzso free zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Increased activity of zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to release and zzso zzso to the nucleus for DNA zzso zzso of stress signaling zzso and zzso activities of zzso and zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso cells with specific zzso Taken together, our results suggested that zzso zzso or zzso induced zzso differentiation with down regulation of zzso activity to increase sensitivity to zzso to enhance zzso in zzso zzso Thus, combination of zzso and zzso could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling the growth of zzso
