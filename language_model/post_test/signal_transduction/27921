The insulin zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso I zzso have different functions in cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso Although some of these differences may be explained by the relative level of zzso expression and zzso structure zzso and beta zzso they may also be attributed to differences in zzso signals generated by insulin and zzso The presence of hybrid receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso making up the zzso has added a new dimension to our understanding of the functional roles of these zzso However, to date the results of efforts to understand the differences between these two closely related receptors have indicated mostly zzso For example, both receptors zzso zzso and zzso as immediate downstream zzso leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have used the zzso two hybrid system to identify proteins which bind to the activated zzso but not to the zzso The zzso domain of the zzso was used to screen a human fetal brain library and two zzso of the zzso family were zzso zzso proteins are a highly zzso family of proteins which have recently been shown to interact with other components of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also identified human zzso an zzso protein with zzso domain associated with the zzso beta zzso Smith's laboratory showed that zzso zzso binds to the zzso in intact zzso Using the interaction trap screen zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were also zzso However, zzso and zzso also interact with the zzso in the zzso two hybrid zzso These studies raise the possibility that zzso and zzso may play a role in insulin and zzso signal zzso and may zzso the observed zzso
