zzso zzso is an adapter protein that plays a key role in cell proliferation and zzso We reported here that zzso is expressed in various regions of rat central nervous system and is most abundant in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso upon zzso spinal zzso zzso implicates that zzso may participate in the regulation of zzso zzso To investigate zzso function in the regulation of zzso zzso the rat zzso and zzso form of zzso was individually and zzso expressed in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth zzso with a decrease in the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso To unveil the molecular mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso we found that zzso activity was zzso in zzso stable lines whereas the zzso and zzso signaling was not zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso outgrowth was reversed by the zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso implicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, this study defines a role of zzso in the control of zzso plasticity and demonstrates for the first time that zzso is a negative regulator in zzso zzso zzso
