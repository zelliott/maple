In zzso a primordial zzso forms in zzso and zzso zzso that develops into a zzso or an zzso depending on expression of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso including proliferation of zzso precursors and migration of zzso zzso and vascular cells from the zzso These events result in increased zzso size and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation normally prohibits germ cells from entering zzso zzso fate is initiated in the absence of zzso and has been proposed to be dependent upon the presence of zzso germ cells in the zzso We have shown that a zzso window exists during which zzso development can be zzso induced in zzso zzso This window closes just prior to the time that germ cells enter zzso Based on our work and much work that has preceded it, we suggest that the autonomous entry of germ cells into zzso zzso the zzso zzso and blocks zzso zzso zzso opposes this zzso by initiating zzso zzso formation prior to zzso which sequesters germ cells inside cords and arrests them in zzso Current experiments in the lab address the hypothesis that zzso formation and germ cell entry into zzso are competing pathways in zzso zzso
