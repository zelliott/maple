Plant zzso clock controls a wide variety of zzso and zzso events, which include the zzso zzso promotion of the zzso of zzso during zzso and also the zzso of zzso during zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso a zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor plays crucial roles in this zzso control of plant zzso According to the proposed external coincidence model, the zzso gene is transcribed zzso at the end of night specifically in zzso under which conditions the protein product is zzso zzso while zzso is expressed exclusively during the daytime in long days zzso under which conditions the protein product is zzso by the zzso zzso and also the residual proteins are zzso by the zzso family of zzso A number of previous reports provided solid evidence to support this coincidence model mainly at the zzso level of the zzso 4 and zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso which were zzso to be dependent on zzso and ambient temperature, have not yet been zzso Here we present such crucial evidence on zzso protein level to further support the external coincidence model underlying the zzso zzso control of plant growth in zzso zzso
