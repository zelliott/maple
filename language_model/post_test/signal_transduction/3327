Recent advances in our understanding of the zzso axis signaling zzso have led to the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome the state of zzso zzso in prostate zzso In this review, we examine the mechanisms of zzso resistance, as well as recently reported and ongoing clinical studies, which will further identify therapeutic opportunities for novel zzso targeting the zzso axis in advanced prostate zzso 

As evidenced by recently reported positive phase III clinical trials, secondary hormonal agents such as zzso and zzso may still be very effective in the treatment of zzso prostate cancer, even after the use of zzso zzso 

Novel agents targeting this zzso have demonstrated a proof of principle that overcoming zzso resistance is possible, leading to significant changes in the landscape of treatment in this zzso The optimal zzso zzso and pattern of use in these novel therapies will be the focus of clinical research in the near zzso
