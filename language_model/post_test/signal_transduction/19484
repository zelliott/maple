As known from zzso the zzso zzso or zzso associate with a zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso providing zzso sites for a 70 zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso important for zzso zzso The sequences of a zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and the relative expression pattern was explored in several zzso of Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso Important structural features, as a signal zzso two zzso zzso followed by a connecting zzso a zzso region, and a zzso motif within the zzso tail were zzso within the predicted zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso protein sequence was found to be composed of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 domain, required for membrane attachment and zzso zzso zzso and zzso adapter zzso and a zzso domain followed by a regulatory zzso tail zzso zzso zzso important in zzso zzso were zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso features of zzso as tandem zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain were predicted within the zzso zzso zzso having the highest level of conservation within these zzso Several important zzso sites found to play a critical role in zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso were zzso The overall expression pattern of the three genes was highly similar, showing the highest zzso level of all three genes in zzso Some expression was seen in zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as seen for other zzso zzso zzso This study will enable further experiments on zzso zzso signaling and zzso and enhance understanding about the development of zzso memory zzso of zzso
