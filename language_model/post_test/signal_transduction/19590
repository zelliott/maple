zzso gain control and information storage in neural networks are zzso by zzso in synaptic transmission, such as in long-term zzso zzso Here, we show using both in zzso and in zzso recordings from the rat zzso that zzso protocols for the induction of zzso at parallel fiber zzso cell zzso can also evoke increases in intrinsic zzso This form of intrinsic plasticity shares with zzso a requirement for the zzso of protein zzso 1, zzso and zzso for zzso zzso cell intrinsic plasticity resembles zzso zzso zzso cell intrinsic plasticity in that it requires activity of protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso and is zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso K zzso In addition, zzso cell intrinsic plasticity similarly results in enhanced spine calcium zzso However, there are fundamental zzso first, while in the zzso increases in zzso result in a higher probability for zzso zzso intrinsic plasticity in zzso cells lowers the probability for subsequent zzso zzso Second, intrinsic plasticity raises the spontaneous spike frequency of zzso zzso The latter effect does not impair zzso spike firing in the target zzso of zzso zzso cell projections in the deep zzso zzso but lowers the zzso cell zzso ratio, thus reducing the zzso zzso These observations suggest that intrinsic plasticity accompanies zzso of active zzso zzso while it reduces at weaker, zzso zzso the probability for subsequent zzso and lowers the impact on the zzso cell zzso
