We have cloned three putative zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequences of both zzso and zzso contain zzso signal peptides and a zzso core domain that zzso them into zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the deduced zzso sequence of zzso consists of a signal zzso a zzso core domain, and a zzso zzso binding module belonging to zzso zzso zzso Although most zzso family 12 zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso that was prepared by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso such as barley zzso and zzso The specific activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was about 20 times higher than that prepared from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso prepared by zzso in zzso zzso also revealed preferential zzso of zzso with limited zzso on zzso In comparison with zzso the activity of zzso was more stable under alkaline zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso high during infection and spore zzso The zzso and disruption of the zzso gene did not affect zzso zzso formation, or invasion zzso however, zzso zzso zzso zzso produced larger numbers of spores than the wild type or a zzso in which the zzso gene was zzso These results suggest that zzso functions in part to zzso zzso during infection and spore zzso
