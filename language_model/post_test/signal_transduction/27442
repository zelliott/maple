zzso in many plant species is accelerated by a long period of cold temperature, known as a zzso zzso This research investigates how this cold temperature signal is perceived by plant cells and the mechanism by which it influences the transition to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has yielded five independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an altered zzso zzso zzso tests showed that these zzso fall into at least three zzso groups defining three zzso named zzso 1, 2 and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso did not affect the zzso response as judged by expression of zzso transcripts and freezing tolerance zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso response of zzso zzso and reduced the zzso response of other zzso zzso zzso The acceleration of flowering by zzso was not affected by zzso The zzso 1 locus was mapped to zzso zzso
