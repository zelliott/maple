Human zzso a cellular reverse zzso specifically activated in most zzso tumors and usually inactive in normal zzso cells, plays an important role in zzso and zzso Early reports have indicated that terminal differentiation of various cells is associated with a rapid zzso of zzso activity, preceded by a zzso of zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have shown that zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso independently of terminal maturation during long-term zzso treatment of the zzso zzso leukemia cell line zzso leading to zzso of zzso and cell death, events overcome by zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso of zzso cells zzso which zzso this death step, because of a zzso zzso despite the continuous presence of zzso While unresponsive to a long-term maturation independent regulation of zzso by zzso these cells retain a functional zzso of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso These findings reinforce the notion that two distinct pathways of zzso regulation by zzso co-exist in zzso zzso zzso we show that the slow developing zzso that causes death of zzso cells, is subjected to a new type of zzso as yet not zzso
