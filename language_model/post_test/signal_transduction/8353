zzso of zzso and growth factor signaling pathways through zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of cell zzso However, the mechanism of integration of these two signals in zzso zzso is largely zzso Moreover, the nutritional input involving zzso acids is yet to be zzso Excess zzso acid conditions, such as in obesity and protein-rich zzso are known to regulate insulin signaling through zzso zzso resulting in insulin zzso Here, we develop a dynamic model to identify the regulatory role of zzso acids in zzso zzso and to study its effect on insulin signaling in relation to multiple feedback zzso present in the insulin signaling zzso The analysis revealed that zzso acids bring about multiple effects in the regulation of zzso that might be represented by a single zzso zzso signaling was demonstrated to operate between two extreme conditions involving tumor growth and insulin resistance, with multiple feedback zzso tightly controlling and maintaining a robust insulin zzso The state of insulin resistance was characterized by a decrease in the time lag or an increase in the magnitude of the negative feedback loop facilitated through zzso such as excess input of zzso zzso Such a condition zzso the delicate balance between positive and negative feedback zzso to yield an zzso zzso
