zzso zzso combined with induction of cancer cell terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells identified melanoma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso that display potent zzso zzso These genes are not zzso expressed in cancer cells and forced expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso promotes zzso cell zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein in a panel of different cancer cells, leading to cell death, without harming corresponding normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso 1/2 signaling in pancreatic cancer cells reverses the zzso block of zzso and zzso zzso expression and cell zzso Using zzso approaches, we demonstrate that zzso expression is necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso effects by promoting its own zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso loop, culminating in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso after binding to its zzso receptors zzso or zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso of zzso zzso leading to zzso of a family of growth arrest and DNA damage zzso zzso zzso culminating in zzso zzso of zzso zzso fails to induce zzso following zzso zzso These findings reveal the significance of the zzso axis in zzso killing and provide a potential strategy for treating both local and zzso zzso
