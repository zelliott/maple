zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso which, in association with factors zzso and zzso activates factor IX and X, thereby zzso the zzso zzso zzso In response to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and express zzso on their zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso in human zzso is zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 12, 13 zzso zzso were both potent zzso of zzso in human zzso whereas 4 zzso 13 zzso (4 zzso had no such zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso activity were zzso in a concentration dependent manner, by three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso determination confirmed that zzso zzso zzso protein levels decreased in parallel to zzso functional activity under zzso zzso Moreover, Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from zzso or zzso zzso showed a zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels in response to zzso and zzso The zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso evaluated after the arrest of zzso by zzso D was not affected by the addition of zzso suggesting that its zzso effect occurred at a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso production of zzso and its zzso by human zzso are dependent on zzso zzso
