The zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in regulating numerous cellular processes including growth zzso of zzso surface zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cancer is zzso to the zzso functions of zzso and yet zzso zzso zzso or zzso transition zzso in advanced zzso zzso How zzso plays a certain role in one cell but a different role in its zzso counterpart is not fully zzso 

The role of zzso signaling both in normal zzso cells and zzso cancer as well as how zzso of this signaling zzso leads to zzso zzso of its downstream targets in zzso zzso are zzso The therapeutic implication of this signaling zzso in zzso therapy of zzso cancer are also zzso 

The reader will gain insight on how zzso of zzso signaling alters promoter zzso and zzso modifications of zzso downstream targets in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling leads to zzso zzso of its target genes zzso through zzso modifications but permanently by promoter zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso may be a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso zzso
