We have characterized the function of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso females lay eggs with fused zzso zzso a zzso associated with torpedo zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By constructing double zzso females for both zzso and top, we have found that zzso is required for determining the zzso polarity of the zzso zzso However, zzso from mature zzso eggs develop a zzso zzso which can be zzso rescued if a zzso zzso zzso the zzso This is the first instance of a zzso gene required for determination of zzso zzso cell fates that is not required for determination of embryonic zzso cell zzso The zzso period for zzso zzso patterning begins at the inception of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is also required for at least two earlier zzso cell activities which are necessary to establish the zzso zzso zzso cells fail to migrate between each zzso cell complex, resulting in zzso with multiple sets of zzso and nurse zzso zzso and zzso function is also required for establishing and/or maintaining a continuous zzso zzso around each zzso cell zzso These zzso functions as well as the zzso requirement for determination of zzso polarity appear to be genetically zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso mosaic experiments show that zzso is required in the zzso during these processes whereas the zzso is required in the zzso zzso We propose that zzso may be part of a zzso signaling zzso zzso regulating successive zzso zzso cell activities of migration, division and/or zzso and determination during zzso These experiments indicate that zzso is required in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Moreover, the functions of zzso in zzso are distinct from those of zzso and zzso two other zzso zzso that are known to be required for zzso zzso
