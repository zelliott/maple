zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso by zzso causes altered gene expression and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling through a proposed mechanism involving competition with zzso for zzso with zzso nuclear zzso zzso and binding to zzso zzso elements zzso We sought to delineate the relative roles of competition for zzso and zzso in the mechanism of zzso In transient zzso in which zzso zzso was zzso by zzso or zzso increasing zzso expression failed to reverse the repression, suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso signaling does not occur through zzso of zzso An zzso point zzso zzso that could not bind to zzso but that retained its nuclear zzso was only slightly reduced in its ability to repress zzso demonstrating that zzso repression does not occur solely through competition for zzso When both proposed mechanisms were blocked zzso plus excess zzso zzso remained zzso zzso neither blocked zzso nuclear zzso nor reduced the levels of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso deletion zzso showed that zzso acids zzso to 550 are zzso for zzso These results demonstrate that repression of zzso zzso by zzso involves the zzso portion of zzso does not involve competition for zzso and does not require binding to zzso although zzso binding can contribute to the zzso We propose a mechanism of zzso action involving zzso of zzso signaling through zzso interactions rather than by zzso of the formation or DNA binding of the zzso zzso
