To investigate the signal zzso mechanism of zzso in zzso the proliferation of bovine lens zzso cell zzso induced by zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 

There were three groups in this experiment, which were normal control group, zzso group and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was measured with zzso by zzso The contents of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso 

The zzso in zzso was obviously increased in the zzso group as compared with that in the normal control group zzso and the zzso in zzso in the zzso group was highest among three groups zzso The content of zzso zzso in zzso was decreased while the content of zzso zzso was obviously increased in the zzso group as compared with those in the normal control group zzso The content of zzso zzso in zzso was higher in the zzso group than that in the zzso group, while the content of zzso zzso was lower than that in the zzso group zzso 

The zzso effects of zzso on zzso may relate to the regulations of multiple processes of signal zzso
