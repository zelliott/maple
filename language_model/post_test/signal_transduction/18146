The paper reviews recently described zzso mechanisms by which zzso cells exposed to peak levels of zzso activate zzso zzso zzso cells react to zzso with a prompt zzso raise which zzso through gap junctions in a few minutes also into the zzso where a local amplification system spreads the signal all over the zzso Few h later, still as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso cells undergo zzso zzso of their plasma membrane zzso Due to the electric zzso with these cells the zzso zzso too and this open specific zzso gated zzso channels responsible for a second wider and more sustained zzso zzso zzso As a result of changes throughout maturation with a zzso modification of the size and charge of the molecules that can diffuse from one cell compartment to the zzso This cell to cell interaction is further modified with zzso expansion that leads to a progressive zzso of outer zzso cells while the inner cell layer, zzso zzso remains in zzso maturation by addressing to the zzso nutrients and instructions in a zzso zzso The identification of these mechanisms are a fundamental prerequisite for the development of in zzso systems suitable to produce zzso matured in zzso with normal zzso zzso
