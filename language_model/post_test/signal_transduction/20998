Many integral membrane proteins use the same zzso machinery for membrane zzso as zzso proteins use to get across the zzso This requires that zzso segments can be zzso from other parts of the protein during membrane zzso and further requires that the zzso segments can be moved zzso out of the zzso channel into the surrounding zzso The molecular basis for this remarkable zzso sorting event is a major focus of current studies of membrane protein zzso
