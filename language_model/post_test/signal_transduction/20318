zzso zzso zzso factor zzso which has a tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso domain in its zzso zzso was identified zzso zzso It was a signal zzso for zzso signal zzso and other zzso To zzso the expression and roles of zzso in nervous system zzso and repair, we performed an acute spinal zzso injury zzso model in adult rats and studied the dynamic changes of zzso expression in spinal zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso was present in normal spinal zzso It gradually increased, reached a peak at 5 days after zzso and then declined during the following zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso after injury, zzso expression was increased predominantly in zzso which highly expressed zzso a marker for zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first description of zzso expression in spinal zzso Our data suggested that zzso might play important roles in zzso zzso after zzso
