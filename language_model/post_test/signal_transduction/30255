The zzso zzso zzso regulates cell behavior by influencing cell zzso survival, shape, migration and zzso Far from being a zzso structure, the zzso is constantly undergoing zzso assembly and zzso during the normal processes of development, differentiation and wound zzso When zzso this can contribute to zzso zzso assembly is regulated by the zzso environment and the cellular tension that is transmitted through zzso zzso is controlled by complex zzso zzso and zzso of these results in zzso damage that is a common component of many zzso zzso engineering strives to replace damaged zzso with stem cells seeded on synthetic structures designed to mimic the zzso and thus restore the normal control of cell zzso Stem cell zzso and differentiation is influenced by the zzso environment within the stem cell zzso For zzso strategies to be successful, the intimate dynamic relationship between cells and the zzso must be understood to ensure appropriate cell zzso
