The regulation of zzso differentiation is poorly zzso Using zzso cells, which can partly zzso the process in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso gene expression profiling to identify genes that play significant roles in zzso Here, we describe the function of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced in zzso treated zzso cells in a sustained manner and forms an active zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with specific zzso inhibited the induction of zzso a specific cell surface marker of zzso We also show that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is required for induction of zzso and zzso Finally, we zzso the zzso data in conjunction with gene function zzso data to identify additional target genes of zzso We define 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso as regulatory targets of zzso and show that zzso in particular, is a direct target of zzso
