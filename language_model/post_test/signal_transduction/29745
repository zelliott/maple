The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso These zzso zzso factors usually contain two zzso functions, a zzso zzso function zzso in the divergent zzso domain and a zzso zzso in the more zzso zzso zzso zzso To promote zzso from target zzso zzso nuclear receptors recruit zzso proteins that promote zzso by zzso zzso within zzso resulting in altered zzso of zzso to allow access of the zzso zzso machinery, or zzso the zzso zzso It is well known that most zzso interact with zzso of many nuclear receptors via zzso zzso zzso motifs (where L is zzso and zzso is any zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is very weak, but we were able to demonstrate that its intrinsic zzso activity is zzso by steroid zzso zzso zzso and that this region interacts with zzso via zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso with no functional zzso motifs was still able to zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso can also be recruited to (and increase activity zzso zzso of the zzso via a zzso zzso zzso Point zzso within this region abolish zzso interaction with zzso and also abolish or severely impair its ability to zzso zzso activity on all promoters zzso Thus the zzso interacts with zzso via two different regions and the zzso interaction is functionally the more important, although the contribution of the two interactions varies in a zzso zzso zzso then zzso zzso activity via recruitment of zzso a zzso zzso This is important in the context of prostate cancer as zzso and other zzso including zzso are zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso cells of the zzso where over zzso of prostate zzso zzso There is a need for effective zzso prostate cancer therapy aimed at blocking the zzso zzso when zzso therapy has zzso Since there is growing evidence that nuclear zzso zzso may be implicated in the progression of zzso zzso to zzso states, novel targets could include the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso interaction would be a more specific and effective target in the case of prostate cancer than the zzso zzso
