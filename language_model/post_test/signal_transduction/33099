zzso 2, a member of the class III zzso family, is expressed initially at zzso transition zzso and during zzso in the entire marginal zone zzso including zzso zzso (the zzso To identify potential targets of zzso 2, the interaction of zzso 2 with other genes zzso in the zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso into the lineage of cells that contributes to the zzso head zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 suppresses the expression of a number of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso As a consequence of the suppression of zzso zzso gene zzso bone zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso is activated in the zzso zzso is a potential target of zzso zzso zzso 2 is capable of binding a class III zzso protein binding site zzso that is located within the zzso promoter, in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 2 suppresses the zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso At the zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures are zzso zzso displayed zzso and the loss of the first zzso arch, as detected by the expression of zzso zzso and zzso By examining events downstream from the zzso and zzso zzso we determined that zzso 2, when zzso acts specifically in the zzso downstream from zzso of the zzso zzso and upstream from zzso The interference in zzso events caused by zzso 2 was rescued by zzso Thus, in addition to its direct zzso ability, in a different context, zzso 2 has the potential to antagonize zzso events in the zzso
