zzso receptors zzso recognize various microbial components and induce immune zzso zzso in zzso may influence their recognition of zzso zzso zzso zzso are predicted to be associated with responses to infectious diseases such as zzso In this study, we searched for single zzso zzso zzso in the coding sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in 96 pigs from 11 breeds and zzso 21, 11, 7, 13, and 11 zzso respectively, which caused zzso acid zzso in the respective zzso Distribution of these zzso zzso was zzso many were located in the zzso repeats, particularly in zzso These data demonstrated that the zzso of zzso genes was preserved in various zzso breeds despite intensive breeding that was carried out for livestock zzso It suggests that the zzso in zzso genes is advantageous in increasing the possibility of survival in zzso zzso
