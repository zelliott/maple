The use of zzso zzso an zzso used in zzso treatments, is limited by a zzso zzso against which acute exercise is zzso However, the zzso mechanisms of this protection remain zzso Therefore the present study aimed to determine the effects of an acute endurance exercise bout performed 24 h before zzso treatment on heart and liver zzso zzso A total of 20 adult male zzso rats were divided into groups as zzso zzso with saline zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso exercised with saline zzso + zzso and exercised zzso zzso + zzso The animals performed a 60 zzso exercise bout on a treadmill or remained sedentary 24 h before receiving either a zzso zzso (20 zzso of body zzso or zzso Heart and liver zzso function zzso consumption, membrane potential zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso zzso were zzso The activities of the respiratory complex, zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and 9, as well as the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Acute exercise prevented the decreased cardiac zzso function zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso generated both with complex zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Exercise also prevented the zzso decreased activity of cardiac zzso chain complexes I and zzso and increased zzso 3 and 9 zzso zzso administration and exercise caused increased cardiac zzso zzso zzso Exercise ameliorated liver zzso complex zzso No zzso were observed in the measured zzso and zzso proteins in heart and liver zzso The results demonstrate that acute exercise protects against cardiac zzso dysfunction, preserving zzso zzso capacity and attenuating zzso decreased tolerance to zzso zzso
