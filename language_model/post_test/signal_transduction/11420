Although zzso responses in bacteria and plants have been well studied and zzso conditions are used in clinical treatments, there has been little investigation of zzso responses in human cells, and there has been no report on the involvement of signal zzso zzso in the zzso response in human zzso We therefore investigated zzso in the expression of genes involved in the signal zzso system and the mechanisms of zzso increases in the expression of genes in human zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso expression array method, we found that a transcript zzso a regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was increased in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the amount of zzso zzso protein was increased by cold treatment, while that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The protein level of zzso zzso was increased in cells treated with low zzso of zzso D, whereas that of zzso C was not, zzso that the increase was caused by the suppression of zzso at low zzso In addition, degradation of the zzso zzso protein was not zzso by cold treatment, unlike that of the zzso C zzso The results suggest that signal zzso through zzso also zzso in zzso responses in human cells and that multiple mechanisms are involved in the increase in the level of the zzso zzso zzso
