Although the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in breast cancer zzso its in zzso dynamics and zzso involvement in zzso zzso have not been zzso Here we engineered a zzso model system with a conditional control of the zzso signaling zzso and a zzso reporter system for tracing both zzso burden and zzso signaling activity in zzso Strong zzso signaling in zzso bone zzso is suppressed directly by genetic and pharmacological disruption of the zzso zzso and indirectly by zzso of zzso function with zzso zzso disruption of zzso signaling early in zzso can substantially reduce zzso burden but becomes less effective when bone zzso are well zzso Our in zzso system for real-time manipulation and detection of zzso signaling provides a proof of principle for using similar strategies to analyze the in zzso dynamics of other zzso signaling pathways and will zzso the development and characterization of therapeutic zzso
