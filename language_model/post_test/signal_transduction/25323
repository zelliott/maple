This annual review focuses on zzso model organisms, which continue to yield fundamental new insights into mechanisms of zzso This year, the budding zzso has been used to understand how zzso zzso of cellular constituents at cell division can produce a rejuvenated offspring from an aging zzso zzso of sensation of carbon dioxide is shown to extend fly lifespan and to mediate the zzso effect of sensory exposure to zzso zzso A new study of zzso the key zzso zzso factor that mediates extension of lifespan by zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrates that expression of zzso zzso with different patterns of response to upstream zzso mediates the highly zzso effects of the zzso on lifespan and other zzso A new approach to manipulating zzso activity in zzso by introducing the zzso zzso zzso shows promise for understanding the role of zzso zzso oxygen species in zzso An exciting new study of zzso and zzso cells implicates deterioration of the nuclear zzso and zzso leakage of zzso components into the nucleus, as an important cause of aging in zzso zzso Loss of, or damage to, zzso zzso is also implicated in the determination of lifespan in zzso worms and fruit zzso The relationship between functional aging, zzso to zzso disease and lifespan itself are explored in two studies in zzso the first examining the role of dietary restriction and reduced insulin zzso in cognitive decline and the second profiling zzso of the zzso during zzso The zzso continue to be a power house of discovery for future work in zzso
