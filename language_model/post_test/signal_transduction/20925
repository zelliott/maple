The zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso contributes to the zzso activity of zzso in primary, human B zzso zzso is targeted to the plasma zzso where it influences signaling pathways of infected zzso zzso has been found to associate with members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso family of zzso As with zzso the zzso molecules have been shown to participate in cell signaling zzso We have characterized and mapped in detail a region of zzso that associates with zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone associates with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso whereas all three zzso molecules associate with zzso under various conditions when they are zzso in extracts of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to associate independently with zzso but bind an overlapping target zzso zzso associates with zzso most avidly and can compete with zzso and zzso for binding to zzso zzso associates with truncated derivatives of the zzso zzso of zzso more efficiently than with the intact zzso indicating that zzso zzso may regulate its association with zzso Finally, point zzso that decrease zzso association with the three zzso molecules to 3 to zzso of zzso levels do not zzso affect otherwise intact zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso these associations are not necessary for the majority of intact zzso induction of this signaling zzso
