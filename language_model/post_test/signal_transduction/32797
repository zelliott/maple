zzso zzso zzso zzso participate in cellular responses to zzso stimuli and environmental zzso We investigated whether and how zzso which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells, regulates zzso activity in primary cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso cells measured by in zzso zzso zzso A low concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity but at a higher dose zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity without any change of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was also observed in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso suggesting a zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso activity through a zzso zzso zzso We next zzso the signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso by examining the involvement of four distinct zzso signal zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso The stimulation of zzso by zzso was blocked by two zzso zzso and suppressed by zzso or zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso activity zzso in human zzso cells through an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso
