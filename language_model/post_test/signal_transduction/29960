A fluid stream induced by a concentration clamp system evokes in zzso zzso a deformation of the membrane which results in transient zzso currents of high zzso zzso inward zzso zzso during zzso zzso current zzso The involvement of zzso elements and of components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso on the generation of the zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso agents exerted no effects on generation of the zzso suggesting that the zzso is not zzso by these zzso The fluid stream induced an zzso of the zzso calcium zzso as measured by an increase of zzso zzso after the zzso zzso the zzso calcium concentration by injection of calcium zzso or depleting zzso zzso zzso calcium stores by zzso of the calcium pumps suppressed the generation of the zzso in most zzso Furthermore, the zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso blocked the zzso The results suggest that the fluid stream leads to a membrane stretch which zzso directly or indirectly the activity of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso C zzso zzso the zzso zzso in turn releasing calcium from zzso internal calcium stores, thus evoking an enhanced zzso zzso zzso
