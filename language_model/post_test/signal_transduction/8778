In earlier studies, we had suggested that the zzso signal zzso zzso orphan nuclear zzso expression in zzso The detailed zzso however, remain zzso In this study, we found that zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso signals, could induce zzso gene expression that in turn zzso zzso zzso dissection by in zzso studies in zzso demonstrated that zzso might trigger zzso alpha and beta binding to the selective zzso response element, which is located at the zzso promoter, thus inducing zzso zzso We also demonstrated that the binding activity of zzso to the zzso promoter is increased in response to zzso zzso Together, our data identified a new signaling zzso from the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and suggested that zzso could be an important regulator to control zzso zzso The identification of zzso or zzso of zzso may provide us an alternative way to control zzso
