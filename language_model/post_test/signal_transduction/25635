zzso is an integral component of the immune response to zzso zzso Although evidence exists that zzso zzso can directly zzso the zzso pathway, the zzso zzso involved are zzso We determined that type II strains of zzso zzso activate more zzso than type I or type III zzso and using forward zzso we found that this difference is a result of the zzso protein zzso a novel dense zzso protein which zzso zzso zzso into the host cell upon zzso A zzso type II strain has a severe zzso in both zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, human cells expressing type II zzso also activate zzso demonstrating that zzso alone is sufficient for zzso zzso Along with the zzso protein zzso zzso is responsible for a large part of the strain differences in the induction of zzso zzso by infected mouse zzso In zzso zzso imaging showed that a zzso type II strain grows faster compared with zzso most likely through its reduced induction of zzso These results show for the first time that a dense zzso protein can zzso host signaling zzso and dense zzso proteins can therefore join zzso proteins in zzso zzso host zzso zzso
