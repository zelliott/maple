zzso interest in zzso has been shown recently due to its dual nature of being a potent toxin and a drug for treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso because of its ability to trigger zzso zzso Here, we found that sodium zzso zzso also triggers the signal for zzso of zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso Such zzso zzso was zzso completely by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and greatly by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also was inhibited by zzso membrane cholesterol with beta zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso reduced zzso zzso production, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is membrane raft dependent and zzso zzso We also found that a combination of a low concentration (1 zzso of zzso and zzso triggers the signal for zzso zzso whereas neither of these elements alone did zzso These results suggested that selective blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can promote the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and this may open a new study area for wider applications of zzso as a drug for treating various kinds of zzso
