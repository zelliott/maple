The effect of zzso zzso on the signaling properties of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dramatically enhanced subsequent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found clear indications that the zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso signaling is caused by the development of zzso zzso zzso the potency of zzso was increased by zzso after 24 h zzso zzso and the potency of the zzso was significantly decreased in zzso zzso The kinetic profile of the zzso enhancement showed that the zzso increase in zzso zzso was already reached after zzso zzso suggesting that de zzso zzso synthesis is not involved in the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased up to 24 h after zzso zzso Although it seemed likely that the zzso zzso could zzso after zzso by zzso present zzso removal of zzso from the zzso medium with zzso resulted in a much smaller enhancement of zzso zzso Moreover, the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso was much larger than the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso is not merely the result of a blockade of zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso doubled the amount of receptors at the cell zzso Our findings are the first lines of evidence that prolonged zzso treatment can zzso the zzso zzso In view of the potential therapeutic application of zzso zzso antagonists, it will be important to know whether these phenomena occur in zzso
