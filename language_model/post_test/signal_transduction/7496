zzso pathogens directly alter host cells in order to replicate and zzso While zzso changes in host zzso can be readily zzso zzso zzso are more difficult to zzso We applied the global protein stability zzso platform, which zzso protein stability based on relative changes in an adjoining fluorescent tag, to identify changes in the host zzso following infection with the zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso profoundly zzso the host zzso independently of changes in zzso Additionally, zzso replication depends on a subset of altered zzso such as zzso and zzso that regulate the host zzso factor zzso controlling host zzso stress, and cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is activated during infection and required for efficient zzso zzso In zzso this experimental approach revealed that zzso broadly zzso proteins and can be applied to examine zzso interactions and develop zzso zzso
