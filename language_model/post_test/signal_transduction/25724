zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling has a major impact on the cardiovascular system, resulting in hypertension and vascular zzso zzso induce zzso dysfunction, decreasing zzso in response to zzso and increasing the response to zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is thought to mediate the vascular effects of zzso but this has yet to be demonstrated in zzso In this study, we analyzed the molecular and functional vascular consequences of zzso challenge in the waved 2 zzso a genetic model with a partial loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is associated with global zzso stress and zzso zzso A decrease in zzso activity did not affect the zzso wall zzso process induced by zzso By contrast, normal zzso activity was required for the zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this in zzso study demonstrates that zzso plays a key role in zzso vascular zzso
