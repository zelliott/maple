Human zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso in signal zzso pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth and zzso In this study, we demonstrate the nature of zzso receptors involved in zzso zzso expression of zzso protein in the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso We used a zzso zzso cell line, zzso in which zzso zzso function has been zzso by a zzso negative zzso We introduced the normal zzso acid receptors zzso zzso and zzso or zzso X zzso zzso into zzso cells by zzso zzso gene zzso Based on experiments using these cell lines and zzso synthetic zzso that zzso bind to one of the zzso or zzso we conclude that zzso is involved in zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Further evidence included our demonstration that blocking of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso completely suppressed the zzso expression of zzso zzso transcript and the production of zzso protein in zzso zzso Various zzso from transgenic mice that expressed an zzso construct of zzso lacked or produced very low levels of zzso As expected, the zzso from transgenic mice contained 50% to zzso reduced levels of zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso is under the direct control of zzso zzso zzso
