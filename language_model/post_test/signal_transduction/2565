Growth factor signal zzso pathways have recently been shown to affect zzso zzso channel zzso In this study we report that insulin can zzso the activity of a zzso zzso channel, the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso brief insulin exposure rapidly zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses 2-3 fold and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso responses was significantly blocked by zzso suggesting zzso involvement in insulin zzso zzso zzso of native zzso receptors is suggested by the observation that insulin zzso the zzso zzso synaptic component in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by growth factors may account for previous observations of growth factor zzso of central nervous system zzso
