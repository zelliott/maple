The zzso activities of tumor necrosis factor zzso and its zzso zzso have been well documented in experimental animal models of arthritis, and in transgenic mice expressing zzso or zzso zzso human zzso proteins in their zzso In this study we show that chronic inflammatory arthritis also develops in transgenic mice made to zzso a zzso zzso from of the zzso zzso protein zzso delta zzso which is known to zzso efficiently both the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso into a zzso knockout background did not alter development of zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso mice or ex zzso zzso cultures demonstrated that the zzso delta zzso protein accumulates on the cell surface and is not processed to zzso soluble zzso indicating that zzso zzso is by itself sufficient to mediate zzso of zzso Furthermore, using zzso knockout mice, it is shown that development of zzso zzso arthritis requires the presence of the zzso but is significantly delayed in the absence of the zzso suggesting a positive cooperation between the two zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate that blocking the activities of both soluble and zzso zzso may be required to effectively neutralize the zzso potential of this zzso in zzso
