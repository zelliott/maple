zzso recruitment by zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso arthritis zzso zzso and H zzso are blood group zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that both soluble zzso and a zzso analog of zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso via induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that soluble zzso plays an important role in zzso recruitment in zzso 

We examined the role of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso We used an zzso zzso tissue zzso mouse zzso model to evaluate the role of zzso in zzso recruitment in zzso We used Western blots to examine signaling molecules activated by zzso in zzso 

zzso induced human zzso migration in zzso which was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso since zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso migration zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso into an zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso recruitment into the zzso zzso mouse zzso Additionally, zzso induced marked zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be downstream targets of zzso since an inhibitor of zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

These data suggest that zzso may be a novel zzso of zzso recruitment in chronic inflammatory diseases like zzso
