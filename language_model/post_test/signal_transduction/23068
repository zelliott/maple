The common zzso zzso zzso has been shown to signal in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso including induction of neural zzso and zzso of zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso zzso these zzso signal zzso pathways are zzso Here we report interactions between zzso and the six members of zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso family zzso The binding of different zzso proteins to zzso was mapped to distinct regions in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions modulated zzso cell death and zzso zzso with contrasting zzso zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced cell death, whereas zzso of zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso the ability of zzso to prevent the induction of zzso normally zzso by zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso response, whereas zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso family proteins interact with zzso and zzso zzso its zzso zzso and cell death zzso
