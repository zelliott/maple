zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso are the scaffold of zzso nucleation that allows zzso cell zzso This process was dissected into elementary stages by monitoring cell zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of various zzso zzso structures are stabilized by contact with the adhesive plots and subsequently converted into zzso extensions starting at the zzso zzso This mechanism progressively leads to full cell zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso this change in membrane extension mode and stops cell spreading on zzso zzso Similar expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell spreading on zzso and structured zzso suggesting that zzso extension is a prerequisite for cell spreading in this zzso The differential polarity of the nucleation of zzso structures by zzso on zzso and structured surfaces starting from the cell body and of zzso tip, respectively, suggested that this process is triggered by areas that are in contact with zzso zzso proteins for longer zzso zzso with this view, zzso cells cannot spread on zzso made of function blocking or neutral zzso 1 zzso zzso However, stable expression of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso the cell ability to spread on these zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleation by zzso requires zzso occupancy by zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso
