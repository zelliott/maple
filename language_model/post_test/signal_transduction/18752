The induction of type I zzso zzso and the development of the innate zzso response are zzso by the zzso of zzso regulatory factor zzso and zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The initial sensing of infection by zzso viruses is zzso by the zzso zzso acid zzso gene I zzso via a zzso zzso zzso independent signaling zzso In the present study, we identify key zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Based on the identification of an extended sequence zzso to both zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso infection, zzso expression or zzso of different signaling zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso all zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the newly identified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was able to induce zzso and zzso dependent promoter activity as efficiently as the zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso C virus however blocked zzso gene zzso in a dose dependent zzso These studies link zzso sensing of viral zzso to downstream zzso signaling and zzso of zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso
