zzso of the zzso family exert their diverse biological effects by formation of stable high affinity zzso zzso complexes that are characterized by the presence of the shared zzso zzso zzso zzso Different zzso zzso form zzso complexes that vary in both composition and zzso Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of selected zzso and zzso elements indicates that zzso display three zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso that interact with complementary zzso recognition zzso The composition of the zzso complex and downstream biological responses is defined by the relative affinity of different zzso components for these zzso The detailed structure of zzso recognition zzso indicates that the generation of small zzso zzso zzso may be a feasible zzso
