The patterned branching in the zzso zzso system is triggered by the zzso zzso zzso that activates a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A single fusion cell at the tip of each fusion branch expresses the zzso gene escargot, leads branch migration in a stereotypical pattern and contacts with another fusion cell to mediate fusion of the zzso A high level of zzso zzso zzso is also limited to the tip of the zzso zzso of such cell specialization events to the tip is essential for zzso zzso Here we show that zzso signaling plays crucial roles in the singling out process of the fusion zzso We found that zzso is activated in zzso cells by zzso signaling through stimulation of zzso expression at the tip of zzso branches and that activated zzso zzso the fate of the fusion zzso In addition, zzso is required to restrict zzso of zzso zzso to the tip of the zzso in part through the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso in sending and receiving cells is thus essential to restrict the zzso influence of zzso on the zzso zzso
