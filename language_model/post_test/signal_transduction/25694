zzso in red wine are supposed to improve zzso zzso We investigated whether daily red wine consumption improves zzso vascular function by reducing zzso zzso Additional pathways zzso this effect were studied using zzso coronary arteries zzso 

zzso young healthy women drank red wine daily for 3 zzso zzso function was evaluated by determining zzso blood flow zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were suspended in organ baths and exposed to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso oxide zzso donor zzso zzso and/or red wine extract zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso increases were equally enhanced after 3 weeks of red wine consumption, but an immediate enhancement zzso after drinking the first zzso was not zzso Vice versa, plasma zzso levels were not decreased after 3 weeks, but we observed an acute drop after drinking one glass of zzso RWE relaxed zzso zzso in an zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Short RWE exposure reduced the response to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso This effect disappeared upon prolonged RWE zzso 

The enhanced zzso response following 3 weeks of red wine consumption, but not after one glass, reflects a change in smooth muscle zzso zzso in zzso zzso rather than changes in zzso appear to zzso this zzso
