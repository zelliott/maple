zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso signals into multiple cellular zzso In the developing zzso eye, zzso activity triggers cell zzso Here we focus on three additional cell autonomous aspects of zzso function and their coordination with zzso zzso withdrawal from the cell cycle, zzso and cell zzso We find that, whereas differentiation requires intense zzso dependent on multiple reinforcing zzso lesser zzso activity maintains cell cycle arrest, promotes zzso and protects against cell zzso Each response requires the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and survival responses also involve zzso zzso perhaps explaining how survival and zzso can occur zzso Our results suggest that, rather than triggering all or none responses, zzso coordinates partially independent processes as the eye zzso
