Despite the zzso of data on the genetic and molecular understanding of zzso there is little information on the regulation of zzso at the zzso zzso In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of zzso zzso zzso content and expression profiling of the zzso metabolism and signaling genes to investigate the possible relationship between zzso signaling and zzso for zzso development in rice zzso zzso The materials used were an incomplete zzso set of 3 zzso 3 crosses and the six zzso In the growing shoots of the zzso at 20 d after zzso significant positive correlations between the contents of some zzso species and performance and zzso based on shoot dry mass were zzso zzso analyses of zzso genes by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction revealed that 13 out of the 16 zzso genes examined exhibited significant differential expression among the F1 hybrid and its parents, acting predominantly in the modes of zzso and positive zzso zzso levels of nine genes in the hybrids displayed significant positive correlations with the zzso of shoot dry zzso These results imply that zzso play a positive role in the regulation of zzso for rice zzso zzso In shoots plus root axes of zzso zzso seeds that had undergone the zzso mimicking normal zzso in soil, the axis dry mass was positively correlated with the content of zzso but zzso correlated with that of zzso Our findings provide supporting evidence for zzso playing an important regulatory role in zzso for rice zzso zzso
