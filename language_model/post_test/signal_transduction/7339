zzso and type 1 zzso zzso immunity function as important zzso control mechanisms that maintain cellular zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso that links innate immunity with type 1 zzso zzso zzso We recently observed in zzso that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso exerts zzso action to suppress zzso zzso The objective of this retrospective study was three zzso 1) to determine whether a gene signature associated with type 1 zzso zzso immunity was correlated with overall survival, 2) to determine whether zzso expression is increased in invasive breast cancer, and 3) to determine whether a gene signature consistent with zzso of zzso signaling zzso with zzso zzso Clinical information and zzso expression for genes associated with zzso immunity were obtained from the invasive breast cancer arm of the Cancer Genome zzso zzso Patient zzso were identified using zzso zzso The immune signatures associated with the patient zzso were interpreted using zzso zzso of immune zzso zzso phase protein zzso tissue zzso and quantitative flow zzso in breast cancer cell lines were used to validate observed differences in gene zzso We found that type 1 zzso zzso immunity was correlated with increased survival in patients with invasive breast cancer, especially in patients with invasive triple negative breast zzso zzso transformation in invasive breast cancer was associated with an increase in zzso The gene expression signature in invasive breast cancer was consistent with zzso as a zzso inhibitor of type 1 zzso immunity through zzso zzso signaling and promoting type 2 zzso Moreover, zzso zzso helped identify appropriate immune signatures that can be used as design constraints in genetically engineering better zzso models of breast zzso
