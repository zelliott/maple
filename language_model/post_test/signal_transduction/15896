A genetic dissection approach was employed to determine whether the zzso zzso complex zzso comprised of zzso zzso and zzso chains is required for the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infections in zzso mice failed to cure with zzso remaining elevated for zzso 50 days indicating the zzso through which all members of the zzso family of zzso signal has an essential role in protective immunity against zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the curing of zzso in zzso mice, deficient in both zzso and zzso zzso was significantly delayed but did occur, indicating that neither zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso Moreover, the observation that the time course of zzso in zzso mice was nearly identical to that seen in controls suggests that the zzso role of stimulating through the zzso chain is zzso to zzso zzso and not a redundant function of zzso
