zzso The zzso properties of the rapidly adapting stretch zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were studied using a zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso The impulse response to zzso extensions of the zzso muscle typically consisted of a high frequency burst followed by zzso of impulses within a relatively short time depending on the zzso of zzso The type of adaptation was consistent with earlier zzso The zzso relationship for the impulse frequency was zzso and had a slope in a zzso plot of zzso zzso When impulse generation was blocked by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso potential was extension dependent and similar to that found in the slowly adapting zzso For small extensions there was an initial peak followed by a fall to a steady potential zzso For large extensions the potential response during the ramp phase consisted of a peak followed by a constant potential level lasting to the end of the zzso When the extension changed to the hold phase the potential fell towards a steady zzso The relation between extension and zzso of zzso potential was zzso and saturated at zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zero zzso zzso zzso When zzso channels were blocked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5 zzso (and zzso channels blocked by zzso the shape of the generator potential become less complex with an increased zzso for large zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was zzso clamped at the resting potential, extension of the zzso muscle produced an inwardly directed zzso zzso the zzso current zzso The response consisted of a fast transient phase which decayed towards a steady zzso The zzso peak zzso was dependent on extension in a zzso fashion and saturated at 190 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The slope of the zzso part of the zzso relation (between 10 and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The peak zzso of the zzso increased with increasing extension speed zzso zzso the relation between the slope of the ramp and current zzso being a first order zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso current was zzso dependent and had a reversal potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso From the reversal potential the zzso ratio, zzso of the zzso zzso system was calculated to be zzso The zzso curve of zzso was zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
