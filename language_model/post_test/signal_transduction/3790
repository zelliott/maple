The zzso acid zzso signaling zzso was investigated by transient zzso of a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene construct containing the zzso response element zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene into zzso primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso medium zzso zzso zzso exhibited a strong zzso of the zzso after exposure of the cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso could, however, also be achieved by shifting zzso zzso zzso to zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso raise also led to the induction of both cellular zzso zzso protein I zzso and cellular zzso protein II zzso whereas expression of cellular zzso protein I zzso was not zzso Moreover, induction of in zzso differentiation also activated the zzso converting zzso system in zzso These findings suggest the following sequence of events involved in the high zzso zzso of zzso First, high zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso which binds zzso released from zzso zzso stores and makes it accessible to the zzso converting zzso zzso zzso generated zzso is taken over by zzso and transported to the nucleus, where it acts as zzso for nuclear zzso which complex with zzso to activate the reporter zzso This hypothetical cascade of zzso signaling was supported by our findings that zzso of the zzso converting zzso system by zzso abolished the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a nontoxic zzso Studies in transformed zzso cell lines revealed that zzso zzso of zzso was essentially maintained in zzso zzso cells, although all parameters of the zzso zzso zzso cascade were induced to a much lower zzso In contrast, strong zzso activity was already observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also expressed high levels of both zzso and zzso and possessed a highly active zzso converting zzso zzso Again, zzso of the zzso by zzso abolished zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso differentiation in cultured zzso zzso zzso a series of events that ultimately lead to the zzso of zzso zzso These properties are maintained in transformed zzso zzso However, with increasing zzso potential of the cells, the respective signaling zzso becomes independent from a differentiation stimulus and leads to zzso zzso of zzso zzso
