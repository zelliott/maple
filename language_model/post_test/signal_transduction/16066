Bone zzso proteins zzso play a crucial role in programmed cell death zzso a biological process required for the zzso of the embryonic zzso However, it is unknown if zzso signaling directly promotes cell death, or if it zzso a molecular cascade that culminates in cell zzso Given that zzso which encodes one component of zzso zzso is expressed during the zzso of zzso tissue and responds to zzso we presumed that it may be expressed in other cell death areas during chick limb development such as the anterior and zzso zzso zones zzso and zzso The present study found that the zzso expression pattern in the anterior zzso of the zzso is very similar to that observed in limbs stained to detect cell zzso Also, zzso and zzso acid, which act as zzso factors, induced expression of zzso before the onset of cell death, while sonic zzso zzso acting as a survival factor, inhibited zzso expression in the zzso However, although there was correlation between zzso expression patterns and zzso in the zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso in dying zzso Interestingly, a short pulse of zzso was sufficient to trigger cell zzso On the other hand, most dying cells were located in the avascular region, while many cells expressing zzso were located in the vascular region of the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso signaling activate a molecular cascade that culminates in zzso
