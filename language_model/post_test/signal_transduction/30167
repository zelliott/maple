zzso zzso zzso zzso causes lethal T zzso diseases in the susceptible species and zzso T zzso to continuous growth in zzso zzso zzso transformation of T cells is becoming an important experimental tool of biomedical zzso Two proteins of zzso zzso zzso C, Tip and zzso are essential for T cell transformation by this zzso It has been shown previously that zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and binds to tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism of its action remains insufficiently zzso This study further characterized the effect of zzso on zzso First, zzso activates zzso via the consensus zzso involving zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso and degradation of zzso in both T zzso and zzso zzso Second, triggering of this zzso by zzso in both T zzso and zzso cells is dependent on the presence of functional zzso zzso zzso Third, zzso physically interacts with zzso in zzso cells, and the effect of zzso on zzso activity in these cells requires the presence of functional zzso Finally the effect of zzso is completely independent of zzso a well described stimulus of zzso zzso zzso it appears that zzso zzso stimulation of zzso activity from zzso zzso zzso these results argue that the effect of zzso on zzso is similar to the effects of other viral zzso zzso the zzso zzso pathway, and reinforce the notion that the role of zzso in cell transformation by zzso zzso may be zzso by signaling that results in zzso zzso
