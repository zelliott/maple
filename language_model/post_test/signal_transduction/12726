A central question in zzso zzso signaling is how zzso zzso components of the zzso might use the primary zzso in zzso but not zzso We focus on zzso of fused zzso a major zzso regulator in zzso and reveal that zzso controls protein levels of full-length zzso zzso factors, thus affecting the production of zzso zzso and zzso essential for graded zzso zzso Surprisingly, despite zzso zzso of most zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso protein levels by zzso is zzso We propose that zzso processes in zzso signaling are zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso regulates zzso protein levels by zzso the activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of zzso or fly zzso restores zzso protein function in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, fly zzso is unable to zzso to the primary zzso and activate the zzso zzso zzso We also uncover a novel positive role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso resulting from its control of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these studies delineate important aspects of zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso and provide significant zzso insight into zzso signaling in diverse zzso
