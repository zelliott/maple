A decrease in environmental temperature leads to the synthesis of zzso fatty acids in zzso zzso by the fatty acid zzso zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso system zzso To understand the mechanism of cold signal perception and zzso by the membrane domain and the zzso domain of zzso we expressed the zzso domain of zzso in trans under the control of a zzso promoter without the membrane zzso We performed growth experiments and a Northern zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso function of the zzso domain of zzso is zzso leading to a zzso expression of the des zzso These findings support the conclusion that the membrane domain of zzso is the zzso element of the zzso zzso
