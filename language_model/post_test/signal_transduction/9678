During zzso formation, activated zzso come into close and increasingly stable contact with each zzso This produces a zzso in which soluble zzso can zzso and proteins on the surface of adjacent zzso can directly interact with each other, potentially modulating subsequent zzso growth and zzso In some ways, this zzso resembles the zzso that support signal propagation between zzso and the exchange of information between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Drawing on this zzso this brief review discusses the role of zzso and their receptors in zzso two protein families that have previously been defined by their role at zzso zzso in both the developing nervous system and zzso zzso
