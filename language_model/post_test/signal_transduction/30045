zzso couple the recognition of invading pathogens with the triggering of potent zzso mechanisms for pathogen zzso Different zzso classes trigger different zzso mechanisms through interaction of zzso zzso regions with specific zzso receptors zzso on immune zzso Here, we review the structural information that is emerging on three human zzso classes and their zzso New insights are zzso including an understanding of the zzso zzso adjustments that are required to bring zzso cell and target cell zzso sufficiently close for efficient killing and signal zzso to zzso The results might also open up new possibilities for the design of therapeutic zzso
