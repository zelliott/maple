The zzso zzso of zzso regulated by zzso zzso which is also called zzso is associated with the risk of several kinds of cancer, and loss of zzso expression is frequently detected in aggressive and zzso zzso However, the functional role of zzso in lung zzso remains zzso We have shown that loss of zzso expression zzso zzso transition zzso which is zzso by repression of zzso and zzso of zzso in lung zzso cell lines and in clinical lung zzso zzso Using a human lung zzso model, we observed that knocking down zzso zzso in human zzso cells leads to the development of multiple zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso functions as a critical protein in regulating zzso by modulating the zzso signaling zzso These results demonstrate the mechanism of zzso function in zzso and suggest that assessment of zzso may serve as a zzso zzso and potential therapeutic target for lung zzso zzso
