zzso of zzso zzso by insulin depends on the maintenance of normal zzso mass and zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso has been implicated in zzso development and differentiated function, but the factors controlling this process are poorly zzso zzso zzso produce zzso and zzso which bind to specific receptors on zzso zzso has been shown to influence zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso increase zzso zzso zzso does so in a manner additive with zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso When mice deficient for the zzso zzso zzso are bred with mice lacking insulin zzso zzso 2 zzso the resulting compound knockout mice show a reduction in mass of zzso similar to that observed in zzso of zzso mice zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in growth of zzso It is possible, however, that the effects in these mice occur secondary to changes in vascular zzso or in the pancreatic zzso cells, or because of a decrease in the effects of other hormones implicated in zzso zzso To directly define the role of zzso we have created a mouse with a zzso knockout of zzso zzso These mice show normal growth and development of zzso but have reduced expression of zzso (also known as zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso which results in defective zzso insulin zzso and impaired zzso zzso Thus, zzso is not crucial for zzso zzso development, but zzso in control of differentiated zzso
