In higher plants, environmental cues such as light signals are integrated with zzso clock signals to control precisely the daily rhythms observed for many biological zzso We have used a fusion of the promoter of a zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to monitor the detailed zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso in zzso Using this marker in zzso and zzso zzso we studied how signals from zzso and the zzso clock are integrated for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso from these zzso studies demonstrate that similar expression features, zzso the acute and zzso responses, are present in both zzso and green zzso and that the acute and zzso responses are genetically zzso We also demonstrate that persistent zzso signaling occurs in red zzso zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso clock zzso zzso signal zzso Based on these genetic studies, we propose a model for the regulation of zzso zzso in which individual zzso and zzso components have been assigned to specific pathways for the regulation of discrete kinetic components of the zzso expression zzso
