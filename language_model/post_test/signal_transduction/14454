zzso is a zzso and a drug widely abused by zzso zzso elicits its effects primarily by blocking the activity of the zzso zzso zzso leading to elevated levels of zzso zzso in areas receiving zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso however, also zzso other neurotransmitter levels, leading to a general zzso of interconnected brain zzso Studies aimed at unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of cocaine have shown a leading role of zzso D1 receptors in the cascade of cellular events zzso by this zzso In this study, we have analyzed the acute response to cocaine in animals deleted for the expression of zzso zzso receptors zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso we show that although D1 zzso functions are preserved and even enhanced in zzso zzso the behavioral response to acute cocaine administration is severely zzso In addition, zzso response to acute cocaine administration, in contrast to zzso mice, is absent in zzso zzso Our findings show that the absence of zzso very likely through a zzso zzso zzso an zzso signaling zzso normally masked by the activity of this zzso on brain zzso engaged by abused zzso
