A zzso principle of the zzso zzso was discovered in 1921, and bovine growth hormone zzso was isolated in zzso Since then, the structure of zzso as it relates to its biological activities has been an exciting research zzso Equally fascinating is the relationship between zzso structure and its zzso zzso In attempts to define some of these activities, several investigators have used zzso transgenic mice as zzso In this review we zzso what is known about the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso We then describe some of the zzso transgenic models and point out potential targets for nutrition zzso
