zzso zzso is an essential zzso and a signal that has profound impacts on plant growth and zzso In order to cope with changing N regimes in the soil, plants have developed complex regulatory mechanisms that involve short-range and long-range signaling zzso These pathways act at the cellular and whole plant scale to coordinate plant N zzso growth and development according to external and internal N zzso Although molecular components of local and systemic N signaling have been identified and zzso an integrated view of how plants coordinate and organize the N response is still zzso In this review, we discuss recent advances toward understanding the mechanisms of local and systemic N responses and provide an integrated model for how these responses are zzso
