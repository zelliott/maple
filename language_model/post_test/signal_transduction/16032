Exposure to the zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to cause zzso both in zzso and in zzso However, the molecular pathways leading to zzso zzso have not been zzso To identify these zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso and zzso increase zzso in DNA zzso an indicator of zzso Data demonstrate that the initiation of DNA fragmentation resulted from interaction of zzso with zzso channels and zzso calcium influx, as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso completely prevented zzso DNA fragmentation was accompanied by increased zzso and zzso activities and was abolished by specific zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not increase zzso zzso c levels, indicating that the zzso zzso was likely not zzso Additional studies demonstrated that zzso exposure activated zzso activity and that pharmacological zzso and zzso zzso of zzso prevented zzso DNA zzso thus indicating a role for the zzso zzso zzso stress zzso This was confirmed by the observation that zzso of zzso abolished zzso DNA zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso causes zzso through its interaction with zzso channels, leading to calcium overload and zzso of the zzso stress zzso Because zzso stress and the subsequent unfolded protein response have been observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, these data provide zzso information by which high-level exposure to zzso may contribute to zzso
