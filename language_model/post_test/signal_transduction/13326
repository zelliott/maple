zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed by human zzso tissue and prostate cancer cell lines, and positively influences primary prostate tumor growth in zzso The human prostate cancer cell line zzso which expresses functional zzso zzso was used as a model to study the effects of zzso on prostate cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased cell number and zzso zzso these effects were reversed by zzso zzso This zzso also decreased zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines also showed enhanced cell growth and zzso incorporation and were enriched in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, suggesting an effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso with the nuclear zzso sequence zzso deletion partially reversed the zzso zzso The growth rate of these cells was midway between that of zzso zzso and control cells, presumably because zzso zzso is still zzso and acts through the cell surface zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso protein showed preferential nuclear zzso These results suggest that the zzso effects of zzso in zzso cells are zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso and that controlling zzso production in prostate cancer may be zzso zzso
