zzso zzso 2 zzso is known as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso We aimed to determine the roles of zzso on the development of vascular zzso 

Using two zzso different models of vascular diseases, zzso zzso in zzso E knockout zzso mice and mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, we examined whether zzso zzso could affect formation of the vascular zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly larger vascular zzso in both zzso zzso plaques and zzso zzso formation, compared with zzso zzso These zzso vascular zzso exhibited enhanced zzso of zzso into the zzso and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso accompanied with increased zzso zzso levels and enhanced expression of vascular zzso zzso including vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso mice also displayed enhanced zzso responsiveness such as zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso to stimulation with zzso necrosis zzso and zzso The similar zzso was shown in human zzso and zzso zzso that were zzso with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by pharmacological blockade with zzso or genetic zzso with zzso zzso significantly attenuated their zzso zzso 

zzso zzso promotes the development of vascular diseases associated with zzso vascular inflammation and zzso of the zzso zzso leading to the notion that zzso potentially zzso protection against vascular zzso
