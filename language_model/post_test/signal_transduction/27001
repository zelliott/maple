We have previously shown that in zzso classical zzso signaling consisting of increased zzso and zzso of zzso was not essential for zzso zzso by more than one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This work deals with the role of this zzso signaling in zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso only by receptors for zzso zzso gamma zzso The zzso of zzso was associated with an increase in zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso acid, via zzso of zzso C, D and zzso Related to the same number of particles zzso the respiratory burst and the zzso signaling during zzso of zzso were much smaller than during zzso of zzso In zzso zzso where the increase in zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso the zzso of zzso was depressed by about zzso the respiratory burst was also depressed due to the decrease of zzso and of stimulation of zzso zzso by residual zzso zzso toxin zzso did not inhibit the zzso of zzso but depressed by about zzso the stimulation of zzso zzso signaling and the respiratory burst in normal zzso In zzso zzso the toxin was without effect on zzso and respiratory zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso of zzso in normal and zzso zzso but depressed by zzso the respiratory burst in normal and not in zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso of zzso but depressed by zzso the respiratory burst both in normal and zzso zzso These results demonstrate the following findings in human zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso by more than one zzso zzso zzso A, zzso the zzso signaling involving increase in zzso and zzso of zzso plays a role in the zzso and respiratory burst zzso by zzso gamma zzso zzso Thus, different signal zzso pathways can be involved in zzso and associated respiratory burst depending on the zzso or combination of receptors zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso alone promote zzso with two signaling pathways independent of and dependent on zzso changes and zzso zzso and insensitive to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The signaling pathways promoting zzso triggered by zzso gamma zzso alone are in some way, or at some step, different from those that activate the respiratory zzso
