The variable efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in protecting humans against tuberculosis has prompted a search for the mechanisms through which zzso zzso zzso In this study, our experiments were designed to determine the role of the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso and zzso calcium in the production of zzso zzso a main zzso factor, by zzso zzso cell line zzso and by a human zzso zzso cell line infected with zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso in culture zzso of zzso cells or zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso of zzso activity, and we used zzso zzso acid to zzso zzso zzso or used the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso stores of zzso in order to investigate the mechanisms through which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in our zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso protein zzso was elevated in zzso zzso cell zzso This effect was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso When calcium influx was suppressed in zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso was zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells or zzso zzso 

zzso these results indicate that zzso of zzso is an important signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, the results showed that calcium influx had a direct effect on zzso zzso in zzso cells or zzso cells infected with zzso zzso
