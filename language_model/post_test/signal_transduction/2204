The zzso zzso is zzso expressed and associated with zzso on B zzso and with zzso and zzso on T zzso Analysis of mice with disrupted zzso gene reveals normal T cells but a distinct zzso in B cells consisting of decreased expression of zzso and severe reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells responded normally to surface zzso zzso but had severely impaired calcium influx following zzso zzso zzso mice had increased serum zzso and zzso and an exaggerated zzso response to the type II T independent zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is important for zzso signaling and B cell zzso
