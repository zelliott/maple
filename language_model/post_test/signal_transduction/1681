zzso of cereal grains is one of the most important renewable resources for food, feed, and industrial raw zzso It consists of four zzso cell types, zzso zzso starchy zzso transfer cells, and cells of the zzso surrounding zzso In zzso the zzso layer is one cell layer thick and covers most of the perimeter of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell fate is proposed to occur through zzso of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso A second zzso gene essential for zzso cell development is defective kernel 1 zzso Here we show that zzso shares high zzso with animal zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein has 21 zzso regions, an zzso loop, and a zzso zzso domain that shares high zzso with domain II of zzso from zzso We propose that zzso functions to maintain and restrict the zzso cell fate imposed by zzso through zzso of its zzso zzso by contact with the outer zzso zzso zzso seems to be the only member of the zzso zzso in plants, zzso zzso sharing zzso overall identity with zzso zzso The expression of zzso in most plant zzso in zzso and zzso as well as its presence in a variety of higher plants, including zzso and zzso suggests that zzso plays a zzso role in plant signal zzso
