The zzso hormone zzso zzso is a class B G zzso zzso zzso that mediates the zzso and zzso effects of zzso hormone and related peptides through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso signaling zzso It is currently not clear how specificity among these downstream signaling pathways is zzso A possible mechanism involves zzso proteins that affect zzso zzso In a zzso screen with the zzso C zzso we identified zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso for zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The core zzso of zzso bound to the zzso zzso of the zzso independent of zzso zzso In addition, zzso specifically zzso with activated zzso but not with zzso zzso and it zzso with zzso for zzso to zzso zzso with its specific interaction with zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso generation but not zzso zzso zzso This zzso of zzso signaling was specific for zzso zzso compared with other zzso zzso Moreover, the benefit for zzso zzso zzso generation in the absence of zzso required the zzso binding domain of zzso regulatory factor zzso Our results show that a zzso zzso can specifically interact with a zzso and zzso its G protein signaling zzso
