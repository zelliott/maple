zzso calcium signals are responsible for initiating a spectrum of zzso zzso The zzso proteins zzso represent zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso display a restricted pattern of expression in zzso zzso suggesting a specialized role in zzso signaling in these cell zzso Recently, it was reported that a zzso zzso of zzso functionally interacts with zzso zzso zzso receptors to elicit channel zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso These data indicate a new mode of zzso zzso zzso and hence control of zzso zzso concentration zzso in zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso of the long form zzso zzso of zzso zzso and show that, in zzso a zzso form of the protein is able to bind zzso with high affinity and undergo a zzso zzso We also describe the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the model neuroendocrine zzso cell system, where it was associated with the plasma membrane and zzso complex in a zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso is able to substantially suppress rises in zzso in response to zzso zzso acting on zzso receptors and that this zzso is due in large part to blockade of release from zzso zzso zzso The related protein zzso calcium zzso was without effect on the zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso is able to specifically regulate zzso zzso zzso in zzso during zzso zzso
