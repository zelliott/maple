The zzso zzso plays a central role in regulating cell survival, proliferation and zzso and is one of the most commonly activated pathways in human zzso A role for zzso in zzso zzso however, has not been zzso We previously reported that mice lacking zzso but not zzso exhibit a pronounced zzso zzso during late pregnancy and zzso that results from a failure to zzso zzso as well as several zzso synthetic zzso Despite this zzso zzso however, both zzso and zzso mice exhibit normal zzso zzso differentiation and zzso zzso 

In light of the overlapping functions of zzso family members, we considered the possibility that zzso may play an essential role in regulating zzso zzso development that is not evident in zzso mice due to compensation by other zzso zzso To address this possibility, we zzso mice bearing targeted deletions in zzso and zzso and determined the effect on zzso differentiation during pregnancy and zzso 

zzso of one zzso of zzso in zzso mice resulted in a severe zzso in zzso zzso during late pregnancy that was accompanied by a global failure of terminal zzso zzso cell zzso as zzso by the near-complete loss in production of the three principal components of zzso zzso zzso and milk zzso This zzso was due, in part, to a failure of pregnant zzso mice to zzso the positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso or to zzso the negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Our findings demonstrate an unexpected requirement for zzso in zzso signaling and establish zzso as an essential central regulator of zzso zzso differentiation and zzso
