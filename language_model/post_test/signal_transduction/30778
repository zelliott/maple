In the adult brain, zzso zzso influx through zzso receptors is an important mechanism of synaptic zzso However, under a variety of circumstances, including acquired zzso zzso pain, after trains of action zzso or zzso and during normal early brain development, zzso zzso zzso excites zzso by gating zzso zzso because the zzso zzso concentration zzso is zzso These findings require an zzso active mechanism of zzso zzso We used zzso patch recordings to characterize zzso transport via zzso the principal zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was required to maintain elevated zzso such that zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso transport characterized by a large maximum zzso zzso and high affinity zzso so that zzso transport was limited only by the net zzso driving force for zzso zzso and zzso At the zzso zzso zzso was at zzso zzso and there was no evidence of net zzso zzso zzso of action zzso that have been previously shown to induce persistent changes in zzso zzso zzso potential for zzso did not alter zzso or zzso of zzso Rather, action zzso shifted the zzso set point, the zzso zzso at which there was no net zzso zzso zzso The persistent increase in zzso required intact zzso zzso activity, indicating that trains of action zzso reset the zzso equilibrium for zzso transport by lowering zzso zzso changes in zzso activity comprise a novel mechanism for persistent zzso in synaptic signaling zzso by zzso
