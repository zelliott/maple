The zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso is comprised of a family of proteins that are implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions, including the control of cell zzso cell survival, and cellular zzso Although zzso is activated in response to inflammatory signals or cellular stress, in the skin zzso is also implicated to play a role in normal zzso zzso Often the cellular consequences of zzso zzso are dependent on the specific triggering zzso Thus, we have compared the zzso mechanism and the function of zzso following two common stimuli of normal human zzso inflammatory zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso and cellular stress zzso light B zzso zzso These experiments indicate that although both zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso activity in normal human zzso the mechanisms of zzso zzso by each stimulus is zzso In contrast to the zzso response following zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression following zzso or zzso treatment demonstrate that each of these zzso signals results in a specific subset of genes that are activated or zzso These studies provide further evidence of the stimuli and zzso specific nature of zzso zzso
