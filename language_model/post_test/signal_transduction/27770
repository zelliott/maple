The neural factor zzso zzso the zzso of zzso receptors zzso and other synaptic molecules on cultured zzso This zzso activity can be zzso by experimental zzso that include treatment with zzso or elevated zzso We report evidence that zzso and calcium act through the zzso signal zzso zzso The effects of zzso and calcium on zzso zzso are additive with that of zzso at low zzso and zzso at high zzso In addition, like zzso both zzso and calcium cause rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our results argue that all three agents act directly on components of the same signal zzso zzso We suggest that zzso acids on components of the complex inhibit interactions necessary for signal zzso and that zzso can result in zzso In such a model, zzso could activate signal zzso by zzso or by zzso the zzso
