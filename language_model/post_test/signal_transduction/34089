In this study we analyzed transcript abundance and promoters of genes zzso zzso proteins to identify signaling pathways that regulate zzso gene zzso We used zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso external zzso zzso zzso and two additional highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso As a starting point, the promoter region of zzso was analyzed and functional analysis identified 10 zzso regulatory elements zzso which played a role in response to treatment with zzso zzso or zzso Six of these elements were also functional in the zzso zzso The promoter region of zzso previously defined as a hallmark of zzso stress, shared two functional zzso with zzso and was responsive to treatment with zzso but not zzso zzso analysis further supported that signaling pathways induced by zzso and zzso are not zzso The promoter of zzso was not responsive to zzso or zzso but highly responsive to salicylic acid zzso whereas the promoters of zzso and zzso were unresponsive to zzso Analysis of transcript abundance of these genes in a variety of defense signaling zzso confirmed that zzso expression is regulated in a different manner compared to zzso zzso and zzso These zzso also revealed a zzso associated with programmed cell death that regulated zzso in a manner distinct from the other zzso Thus, at least three distinctive pathways regulate zzso stress response at a zzso level, an zzso zzso represented by zzso a second zzso that represents a convergence point for signals generated by zzso and zzso on multiple zzso some of which are shared between responsive zzso and a third zzso that acts via zzso and zzso regulating only zzso Furthermore, zzso regulation accounts for changes in transcript abundance by zzso treatment for some zzso
