We previously suggested that zzso T cells promoted resolution of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso at least in part through regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso To directly evaluate the role of the zzso zzso in zzso resolution, zzso and zzso mice on the zzso background were used as recipients of activated zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso donor zzso were activated and transferred to zzso recipients, zzso zzso reached zzso severity on day 20 and resolved on day zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and many zzso inflammatory cells were detected in recipient zzso on day zzso zzso was predominantly expressed by inflammatory cells, and zzso and zzso were mainly expressed by zzso zzso zzso After depletion of zzso T cells, zzso resolution was delayed, zzso and zzso were predominantly expressed by inflammatory cells, and few inflammatory cells were zzso When zzso donor zzso were transferred to zzso recipients, disease severity on day 20 was similar to that in zzso recipients, but resolution was zzso As in zzso zzso recipients, there were few zzso inflammatory cells, and zzso and zzso were expressed primarily by inflammatory zzso These results indicated that the expression of functional zzso in recipient mice was critical for zzso zzso zzso cells induced minimal disease in zzso zzso This was presumably because donor cells were eliminated by the increased zzso on zzso recipient cells, because donor cells were not zzso and the mice developed zzso if zzso recipients were given zzso zzso
