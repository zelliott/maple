An increase in zzso is a major stimulus for increased ventilation and is sensed by specialized brain stem zzso called central zzso zzso These zzso appear to be spread among numerous brain stem regions, and zzso from different regions have different levels of zzso Early studies implicated changes of pH as playing a role in zzso zzso most likely by zzso a zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso and thereby increasing their firing zzso zzso progress has been made over the past decade in understanding the cellular mechanisms of zzso signaling using reduced zzso Recent evidence has pointed to an important role of changes of zzso pH in the response of central zzso zzso to increased zzso zzso The signaling mechanisms for zzso may also involve changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso gap zzso zzso stress, zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso The normal target for these signals is generally believed to be a zzso channel, although it is likely that many zzso channels as well as zzso channels are involved as targets of zzso zzso The results of studies of cellular signaling in central zzso zzso are compared with results in other zzso and/or zzso cells, including peripheral zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso central zzso avian zzso zzso zzso taste zzso cells on the zzso and zzso zzso A multiple factors model is proposed for central zzso zzso in which multiple signals that affect multiple zzso channel targets result in the final zzso response to changes in zzso
