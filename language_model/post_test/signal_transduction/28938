The zzso zzso of complement component zzso has been shown to enhance immune responses to zzso that lack zzso zzso such as bacterial zzso zzso binds to the zzso complement zzso 2 zzso or zzso this binding serves as a zzso signal to the B cell when the zzso zzso portion binds simultaneously to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Bringing together zzso signal zzso molecules zzso and zzso respectively, results in a lower threshold of zzso Paradoxically, zzso has also been shown to enhance zzso zzso in the zzso knockout zzso mouse model as well as increase zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that that an auxiliary zzso zzso of immune zzso may zzso We hypothesized that in addition to its molecular zzso property that enhances signal 1 during zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso also contains zzso zzso that are able to stimulate zzso zzso zzso helper T cells which we term zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso algorithm, we identified 11 putative zzso zzso in zzso a very high zzso density for a zzso zzso zzso Eight of these zzso candidates were zzso and shown to bind a variety of class II zzso molecules of different zzso and to stimulate zzso zzso T cells to zzso zzso zzso in zzso Further, we demonstrate a zzso specific increase in zzso zzso zzso T cells in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso exposed to zzso peptides in zzso We believe that the discovery of these zzso T cells zzso for zzso provides evidence supporting the zzso 2' hypothesis and may offer a novel explanation of the zzso zzso zzso
