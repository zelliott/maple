zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reported to play an important role in tissue zzso and wound zzso When zzso populate wound sites, they zzso biologically active zzso including zzso The zzso factor zzso is important in zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso Thus, a zzso cell line, zzso was used to study the molecular mechanism of zzso action on zzso and zzso zzso After 24 h incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso media zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an increase in zzso activity in response to zzso in zzso and no significant change in zzso expression was zzso zzso analysis also revealed an increase in zzso in CM from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso activity was elevated in zzso cells treated with zzso for 10 zzso and reached a peak at 30 zzso The zzso DNA complex was zzso using zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso Increased expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso with zzso (90 zzso reduced zzso expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Using a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited nuclear binding of zzso zzso to zzso suppressed zzso activity and protein levels in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that zzso tissue zzso through increasing zzso expression is dependent on zzso zzso
