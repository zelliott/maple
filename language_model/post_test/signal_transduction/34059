Human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso are expected to be a potential source of cells for zzso Although recent reports have shown that isolated zzso can differentiate into zzso the efficiency of differentiation is insufficient for therapeutic zzso To circumvent this problem, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, is essential for liver zzso In the present study, we established a zzso zzso expression system for zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression significantly enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The differentiated cells showed zzso functions including zzso production and zzso zzso During treatment with the zzso system for 8 days, over zzso of zzso cells turned out to express zzso Furthermore, the combination of zzso with basic zzso growth factor zzso efficiently induced the genes such as zzso and zzso which are associated with maturity of zzso however, it suppressed genes such as zzso and zzso which are associated with zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso expression zzso zzso to zzso zzso Finally, the results of the present study suggest that zzso of zzso signals caused by zzso of zzso to zzso membrane is associated with zzso differentiation of human zzso
