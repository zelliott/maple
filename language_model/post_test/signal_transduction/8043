The zzso regulation of neurotransmitter zzso involves proteins that interact with their zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we identified several proteins that interact with the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These included zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein recruited by the zzso zzso binding motif of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso cells decreased zzso cell surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects were absent in cells zzso with zzso zzso in its zzso motif to prevent physical association with zzso and zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into brain zzso was increased in both zzso and zzso mice zzso injected with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso C zzso which disrupted interaction between zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso reduces zzso activity in zzso Furthermore, treating cultured zzso zzso with the zzso zzso similarly increased zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso stimulates zzso activity, NO production was enhanced on exposure of cells zzso with zzso and zzso to zzso This effect was abolished by zzso zzso zzso and absent in cells expressing zzso zzso in its zzso zzso In conclusion, physical association between zzso and zzso provides a molecular zzso for their zzso functional zzso In addition to showing that zzso controls cell surface zzso of zzso these findings provide evidence for regulation of cellular signaling zzso zzso by a zzso zzso
