zzso zzso plays an important role in T cell development and mature T cell zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in a mouse model of respiratory zzso virus zzso allergic airway zzso During zzso zzso in zzso zzso of a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased airway zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso zzso Fringe zzso a zzso that enhances zzso zzso by zzso was increased during zzso zzso zzso loss of function in zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso in T cells in zzso mice showed reduced zzso response and disease pathology during zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso zzso regulatory element zzso as a critical driver of zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso response via zzso and is critical for amplifying viral zzso during allergic airway zzso
