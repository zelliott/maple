zzso is the first identified integral protein for the tight junction zzso and its long zzso domain is considered to have functions in receiving and zzso cell survival zzso Loss of zzso zzso such as zzso has been correlated with tumor progression in zzso however, the precise molecular mechanisms explaining its loss of expression and whether zzso expression has any effects on cancer zzso remain to be zzso Here, we show that forced expression of zzso in cancer cells exhibits enhanced sensitivity to differently acting zzso factors, and thus zzso the zzso of transformed cells, via zzso of unique sets of zzso zzso In addition, studies using deletion zzso of zzso zzso show that 44 zzso acids at the zzso end play a critical role in zzso the cellular zzso Interestingly, zzso decreases cellular zzso and zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso of cancer zzso We also found that zzso expression is silenced by zzso island zzso on its promoter zzso zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso that stimulate zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso which is sufficient for zzso zzso Our results show the functional diversity of zzso and suggest that zzso zzso of zzso provides enhanced zzso zzso and zzso properties of cancer cells, identifying zzso as a likely candidate for a zzso gene in certain types of zzso
