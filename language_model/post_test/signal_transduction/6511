zzso pathogens such as zzso zzso undergo major zzso changes when they zzso their zzso requiring the coordinated regulation of gene expression in response to the stresses zzso Several environmental factors modify the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso This report shows that the expression of spa zzso gene zzso the zzso protein zzso is zzso by high zzso (1 M zzso 1 M zzso or 1 M zzso in the zzso strain and zzso by zzso (a DNA zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to a double zzso in the B zzso of DNA zzso relaxed DNA and consequently induced spa zzso confirming that spa expression is regulated by DNA zzso Furthermore, in the presence of zzso plus 1 M zzso a good correlation was observed between DNA zzso and spa zzso The zzso zzso system is involved in the expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso of an zzso deletion decreased the effect of DNA zzso zzso on spa zzso suggesting that active zzso proteins are necessary for the full effect of DNA zzso zzso and high zzso on spa zzso Indeed, evidence is provided for a relationship between the zzso deletion and zzso changes in zzso zzso
