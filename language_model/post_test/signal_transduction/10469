We demonstrate that successive zzso events involving regulated zzso zzso zzso occur as a function of time during the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a polar factor that recruits proteins required for polar zzso zzso to the correct cell pole at a defined time in the cell zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso sequence by zzso zzso to a form with altered activity zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by a signal zzso system that activates cell zzso zzso programs and conversion of zzso to zzso in response to the completion of zzso zzso zzso to the progeny zzso cell, is subsequently released from the polar membrane by the membrane zzso zzso for degradation during the zzso cell zzso This sequence of zzso events contributes to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the appropriate cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and spatial restriction of the polar zzso zzso zzso control the cell zzso onset of zzso
