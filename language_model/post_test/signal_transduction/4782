zzso zzso zzso zzso which is an extract derived from zzso zzso zzso has been used for the treatment of zzso arthritis and other immune diseases in zzso However, its potential zzso has not been completely zzso 

The aim of the study was to determine the zzso of zzso in zzso rats and to investigate the underlying cellular mechanism further by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso at 60, 100 and zzso were administered by oral zzso for zzso toxicity in zzso zzso Changes in the zzso gene expression were identified with zzso zzso at the zzso dose level to study the zzso mechanism of zzso 

A number of changes in the body weight and food consumption, absolute and relative liver weight, zzso analysis and zzso were observed after the zzso exposure to zzso and a zzso zzso was zzso A total of zzso genes were found to be significantly altered zzso zzso including 582 zzso genes and 730 zzso zzso According to our biological zzso analysis, the zzso resulted in zzso gene expression in zzso pathways and the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso analyses of several genes verified these zzso zzso our gene expression zzso study will be useful for future zzso zzso zzso
