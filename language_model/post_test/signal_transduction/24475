We have studied the effects of two new synthetic zzso zzso acid zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso on transforming growth factor zzso zzso These agents, at zzso zzso increase the expression of zzso zzso such as those for zzso zzso inhibitor 1 and the type II zzso zzso and they zzso with zzso in this zzso They prolong the zzso of zzso induced by zzso and markedly enhance the ability of zzso to activate a zzso binding element, zzso In zzso zzso they reverse the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso also enhance zzso signaling in the pathways of two other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso Finally, these zzso induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso with zzso in this zzso These are the first studies to report enhancement of zzso signaling by synthetic zzso and should further their optimal use for applications in prevention or treatment of diseases in which there is zzso function of zzso
