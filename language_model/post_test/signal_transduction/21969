There is substantial evidence that zzso between the proliferation and zzso pathways plays a critical role in the regulation of normal zzso functions as well as in the zzso of a variety of abnormal zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso is mobilized through zzso zzso sensitive zzso channels zzso expressed on the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso a point of convergence for signals from zzso growth factors, nutrients and cellular energy levels, zzso the zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso decreased zzso zzso release in zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso release in zzso zzso zzso We also showed that IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso release in zzso cells, an effect that was prevented by zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso release in zzso zzso cells in which zzso and zzso had been knocked zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the activity of zzso by a zzso zzso This conclusion supports the concept of zzso between zzso signaling and proliferation pathways and thus provides another way by which zzso zzso signals are finely zzso
