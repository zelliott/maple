Links between genes involved in development, proliferation and zzso have been difficult to zzso In the zzso wing disc, the vestigial zzso and the zzso zzso gene products zzso to form a functional zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in other zzso discs zzso outgrowth and wing tissue zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso in proliferation and showed that zzso zzso the effect of zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso drives cell cycle progression and in zzso cultured cells, the zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation per zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and its targets zzso and zzso In addition zzso but not zzso interacts with and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a decrease in zzso or addition of zzso a specific zzso zzso shift the zzso boundary cells of the disc to a cell death sensitive state that is correlated with zzso induction and zzso zzso This indicates that zzso in interaction with zzso and zzso is a critical player for both cell proliferation and cell survival in the zzso wing margin zzso
