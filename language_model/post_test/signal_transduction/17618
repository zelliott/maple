Our earlier work demonstrated that certain populations of brain zzso which do not zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso will, when grown in culture with zzso differentiation factor zzso unexpectedly express the gene for the CA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we sought to determine whether zzso could also regulate zzso expression in those zzso which normally zzso CA zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso from the zzso zzso with zzso elevated the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso to zzso higher than that measured in control zzso zzso zzso were unaffected by a similar zzso zzso Unlike the zzso critical period for zzso in zzso zzso CA zzso remained susceptible to zzso influence over an extended zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be important for zzso gene regulation in brain CA zzso even differentiation is zzso Because of these unique properties, zzso may provide a unique opportunity to explore ways in which the zzso gene might be directly manipulated in these cell populations in order to correct the CA imbalances that occur in certain neurological diseases and zzso
