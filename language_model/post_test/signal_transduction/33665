zzso enhances zzso release from zzso zzso receptors zzso However, the three zzso of zzso are reported to respond to zzso with differing zzso zzso release through zzso is positively regulated at lower zzso zzso than zzso and zzso has been reported to be insensitive to zzso zzso We have zzso these differences by studying the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso expressed in isolation on a zzso background in zzso zzso knockout zzso We report that the zzso activity as well as the single channel open probability of zzso was enhanced by zzso but only at zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso was more sensitive to zzso zzso than zzso under similar experimental zzso zzso in the zzso sites of zzso and zzso were generated, and the functional consequences of these zzso were zzso Surprisingly, zzso of the zzso site in zzso had no effect on zzso zzso suggesting an additional locus for the effects of zzso on this zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso site of zzso eliminated the enhancing effects of zzso Furthermore, this zzso had profound effects on the patterns of zzso calcium signals, providing evidence for the zzso significance of zzso binding to zzso
