A single bout of exercise results in a zzso zzso zzso that is accompanied by a reduced zzso zzso Based on the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in controlling sympathetic nerve activity zzso and blood pressure, the role of zzso acid zzso in controlling zzso zzso activity, and the reduced zzso relationship during zzso we determined zzso 1) zzso zzso activity is decreased during zzso 2) zzso mechanisms mediate the decrease, and 3) zzso control of zzso activity is zzso zzso zzso rats zzso were subjected to 40 zzso of treadmill or sham exercise zzso zzso zzso lasted 10 h in conscious and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso did not affect the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity having a cardiac and sympathetic rhythm, zzso zzso and blood pressure were recorded at rest and during zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was lower and was increased to a greater extent by zzso antagonism in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso activity operated with a reduced gain zzso zzso zzso Thus increased zzso signaling at zzso zzso may contribute to zzso
