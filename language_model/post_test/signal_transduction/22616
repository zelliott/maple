We investigated the effects of transforming growth factor alpha zzso on DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat zzso and examined the influence of alpha and beta zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso of DNA synthesis during 3 h of culture and a zzso increase in the nucleus number zzso during 4 h of culture at a cell density of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA synthesis and proliferation were zzso at zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis and proliferation induced by zzso zzso zzso did not reduce even at higher initial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced the zzso effects of zzso whereas those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso were not affected significantly by a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and were almost completely blocked by specific zzso of signal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso These results suggest that among the elements that link signals of cell surface zzso to the nucleus, the zzso action of zzso is zzso at least, by zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso protein zzso C, zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso
