zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso which is responsible for a zzso zzso system, is regulated in response to a change in the medium zzso We present the first in zzso evidence that the putative zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso We then isolated the intact form of zzso from the zzso membrane with a mild zzso zzso zzso zzso as a soluble zzso The zzso zzso itself did not exhibit the ability to zzso the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso into zzso however, zzso exhibited its zzso zzso Thus, using this partially zzso form of zzso we succeeded in zzso zzso zzso that are fully functional in terms of their ability to zzso the zzso positive regulator, zzso By adopting this in zzso method, some in zzso conditions were zzso in order to address the molecular mechanism underlying signal zzso zzso by zzso Some zzso properties of zzso in zzso are also zzso
