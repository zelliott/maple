The zzso guidance zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso guide zzso cell and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso larvae, zzso zzso are away from zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso larvae, zzso zzso are towards the zzso zzso indicating a response to other guidance cues that directs the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso expression zzso to the zzso cell body would be predicted to cause zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso larvae, in fact, more zzso are directed zzso suggesting that zzso is not always zzso from the zzso source of zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to moderate both the response to zzso and to the other zzso Our results show that zzso responds to multiple guidance cues and they suggest that, besides zzso other factors influence whether an zzso responsive cell zzso toward or away from an zzso source in zzso We propose that multiple signals zzso by the guidance cues are integrated and interpreted by zzso and that the response to zzso can change depending on the combination of cues encountered during zzso These responses determine the final zzso position of the zzso cell and zzso
