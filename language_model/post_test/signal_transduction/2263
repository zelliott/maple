zzso zzso factor 2 zzso is a zzso protein associated with the zzso zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that during signal zzso zzso must be released from zzso in order for it to interact with downstream signaling zzso We found that zzso and zzso were zzso associated with each other in a human B cell zzso Following stimulation with an zzso zzso a decrease in the amount of zzso zzso was observed that could not be explained by a change in total level of either of the zzso These results, as well as similar findings obtained with zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso suggested that zzso signals inhibited the zzso zzso We then conducted binding studies using zzso zzso domain fusion proteins and zzso derived from either control or zzso cell zzso These in zzso studies also indicated that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso domain was inhibited by zzso zzso The results of these experiments, as well as differences between the in zzso and in zzso findings, indicated that multiple mechanisms were involved in the zzso of the zzso interaction by zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso are discussed based on mapping of the zzso binding site on the zzso zzso zzso
