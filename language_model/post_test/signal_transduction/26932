zzso protein zzso zzso are activated in response to a variety of stimuli through a protein zzso cascade that results in their zzso on zzso and zzso zzso The molecular nature of this cascade is just beginning to zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso gene zzso a functional analog of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso (for zzso zzso The zzso gene was isolated as a zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso associated with deletion of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is also predicted to zzso a protein zzso which has been proposed to function downstream of the protein zzso C zzso zzso by zzso The zzso gene possesses a zzso uninterrupted open reading frame predicted to zzso a zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein zzso shares 48 to 50% sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso mating zzso response zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso cell zzso zzso that was virtually indistinguishable from that resulting from deletion of zzso suggesting that the protein zzso zzso by these genes function in a common zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso associated with loss of zzso but not the zzso defects associated with loss of zzso or zzso indicating functional conservation between the former two protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso individually to zzso and zzso respectively, severely impaired zzso zzso Additional zzso experiments, and the overall architectural similarity between the zzso zzso and the zzso response pathway, suggest that zzso regulates a protein zzso cascade in which zzso activates a pair of protein zzso designated zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso which in turn activate zzso
