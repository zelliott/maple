A potential mechanism by which green tea may prevent cancer development is through the zzso of zzso We have shown previously that the green tea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell tube formation through the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can suppress zzso production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso To further zzso the zzso mechanisms of zzso we investigated its regulation of other molecular processes in zzso signaling in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso We show that zzso at zzso doses zzso zzso markedly zzso the formation of a vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 complex formed upon the binding of its zzso zzso This disruption results in a significant and zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso decreased the zzso zzso zzso and zzso ability of zzso likely acting through decreasing zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso production at the zzso zzso time zzso and protein levels zzso are also suppressed with zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism for green zzso zzso effects where zzso can abrogate zzso signaling by interfering with the formation of a zzso complex, resulting in attenuated zzso and zzso zzso
