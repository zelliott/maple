In much of Africa, the zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso of human malaria, a devastating infectious disease caused by zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact at multiple stages and locations, and the nature and effectiveness of this zzso interaction determines the success of zzso Many of the interactions engage the zzso innate zzso a primitive but very effective defense zzso In some cases, the zzso kills the zzso thus blocking the transmission zzso However, not all interactions are zzso some represent immune zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso revealed numerous potential components of the innate immune system, and it established that they evolve zzso as summarized in the present zzso Their rapid evolution by gene family expansion diversification as well as the prevalence of zzso zzso in the zzso families may reflect selective adaptation of the immune system to the zzso of multiple immune challenges in a variety of zzso zzso As a follow-up to the comparative zzso analysis, the development of functional zzso zzso has provided novel opportunities for understanding the immune system and the nature of its interactions with the zzso In this context, identification of both zzso zzso and protectors in the zzso represents a significant conceptual zzso In addition to providing fundamental understanding of primitive immune systems, studies of zzso interactions with the zzso open unprecedented opportunities for novel interventions against malaria zzso The generation of transgenic mosquitoes that resist malaria infection in the wild and the development of zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso interactions that are protective of the zzso or reinforcing others that are zzso represent technical challenges but also immense opportunities for improvement of global zzso
