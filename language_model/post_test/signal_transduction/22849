To examine the signals that regulate zzso zzso we analyzed the effects of zzso of two major signal zzso the protein zzso A zzso zzso and the protein zzso C zzso pathway, on the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in marked induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was inhibited by zzso C, an inhibitor of zzso On the other hand, stimulation of zzso by zzso had a weak zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was followed by enhancement of expression of the zzso zzso one of the target genes of zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso 1, an important zzso in the cellular zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso expression is zzso at least in part, by the zzso zzso and not by the zzso zzso
