Since the discovery of zzso in 1975, the zzso zzso has earned a prominent place in biomedical research as the zzso zzso system of the zzso zzso with zzso chains plays an important role in normal protein turnover and also in removing damaged or zzso zzso More recently, the zzso of zzso of protein zzso has shown additional important roles for zzso in zzso such as zzso regulation, viral zzso and zzso zzso zzso this voyage of discovery is now repeating itself with a new generation of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The functional consequences of zzso and zzso modification are thus beginning to be zzso A less known member of this zzso family is zzso 15, a modifier zzso by an zzso zzso Recent publications have ascribed important functions for this zzso in various biological pathways from pregnancy to innate immune zzso Furthermore, zzso 15 has been found to modify several important molecules and affect type I zzso signal zzso Here, we review zzso zzso work and highlight important biological questions which need to be posed in order to further zzso the biological consequences of zzso and zzso zzso
