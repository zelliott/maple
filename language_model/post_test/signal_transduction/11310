zzso signaling controls germ layer formation, zzso zzso and patterning of the brain in the zzso zzso Cellular responses to zzso signals are complex and include changes in gene zzso cell zzso and migratory zzso Only little is known about the genes regulated by zzso zzso We designed a zzso screening strategy by using a zzso active zzso zzso to identify putative target genes of zzso signals in the early zzso of zzso zzso By quantitative analysis of zzso zzso 132 genes corresponding to zzso of genes on the entire zzso were identified, which were enriched in the zzso probe zzso These genes zzso components of signal zzso zzso zzso regulators, proteins involved in protein metabolism but also zzso components and zzso zzso suggesting dramatic changes of cell physiology in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso
