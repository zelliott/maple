This review deals with the fascinating complexity of zzso zzso terminals that are characterized by a high degree of functional zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can take off not only from the zzso zzso but also from zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso display zzso for instance alternating with zzso zzso during survival zzso In zzso zzso have been recorded in the peripheral and central nervous systems in time relationship with zzso or pathological zzso zzso In motor or sensory zzso zzso generation may be the cause of motor zzso or sensory perceptions and pain zzso zzso is associated with rhythmic zzso of the zzso zzso membrane of primary zzso which are ridden by robust zzso zzso In central zzso lying within an zzso tissue zzso zzso coinciding with zzso zzso waves, get longer as zzso zzso get shorter during seizure zzso Once invaded by an zzso burst, an zzso zzso locus can display an zzso after zzso Such zzso can also fire during zzso or the zzso zzso period of the parent zzso but not during their zzso zzso zzso are thus endowed with zzso intrinsic properties making possible the alternate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fire while the parent zzso stop zzso further suggesting that zzso terminal networks are unique and individual functional zzso The functional importance of zzso in the nervous systems is, however, not yet well zzso zzso generated zzso zzso zzso backwards and forwards along the zzso thus acting as a retrograde and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated zzso cannot have the same effect on the zzso zzso As suggested by studies related to the zzso root zzso zzso may not only be implied in the zzso zzso of zzso release but also contribute significantly during their zzso to a powerful control zzso zzso of incoming zzso From experimental data related to zzso activities it is proposed that zzso once zzso conducted, might zzso zzso zzso spread or maintain zzso cellular zzso For instance, zzso zzso of zzso would zzso like a zzso a powerful zzso synaptic drive upon a large number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have proposed that, once zzso zzso are likewise capable of initiating (and zzso threshold and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso can zzso the zzso of the parent zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
