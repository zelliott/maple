This study aimed to examine the expression and function of zzso receptors of the rat tail and zzso arteries during maturation and zzso zzso 6 and 12 weeks, 8 and 24 zzso zzso studies and zzso expression by zzso revealed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso depending on artery zzso The zzso component of zzso responses in the tail artery was greater in younger zzso similarly responses to zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso receptors decreased with zzso zzso responses to zzso decreased with age, and were absent at 8 and 24 zzso zzso zzso expression followed this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression also decreased with zzso The zzso artery contracted to zzso responses at 4 and 6 weeks were larger than at other ages although zzso zzso expression did not significantly differ with zzso zzso induced relaxation of the zzso artery, responses being greatest at 6 weeks and decreased thereafter, which was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso We speculate that the dramatic changes in expression of zzso receptors in the rat tail artery, compared to the zzso artery, during development and zzso are related to the role of the tail artery in temperature zzso
