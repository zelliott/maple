zzso zzso regulates transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso exerts its zzso effects in part by promoting the tissue zzso of zzso zzso 

A zzso model of pulmonary zzso in which an zzso zzso form of the human zzso gene is zzso in the lung was zzso Fibrosis and zzso were evaluated in zzso mice in which the zzso zzso locus had been zzso The effect of replacement or deletion of zzso zzso on bone zzso cells was zzso using bone zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso The zzso of these findings to zzso zzso in humans was examined in patients with zzso zzso lung disease zzso 

The appearance of zzso in the lungs of zzso mice required zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso on bone zzso cells restored lung zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced pulmonary zzso and zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso from patients with zzso zzso showed increased levels of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and its zzso with zzso zzso located on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blood zzso outgrowth was enhanced in these zzso zzso of normal human zzso with zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso these effects were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that interventions that reduce zzso zzso expression or prevent the zzso zzso zzso interaction may zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
