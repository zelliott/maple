The Sonic zzso zzso cascade is crucial for the patterning of the early lung zzso in mice, but its role in the developing human lung remains to be zzso In the present study, the expression patterns of zzso signaling zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by in zzso zzso and zzso and compared with the equivalent patterns in zzso Our results showed that, as in mice, zzso was expressed in the zzso of the developing human zzso However, zzso receptors zzso and zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso were strongly detected in the human lung zzso but zzso in the zzso slightly different from their expressions in zzso Furthermore, the expression levels of zzso signaling zzso genes in human zzso but not that of zzso were subsequently zzso at the zzso stage evaluated by real-time zzso zzso with a decline in the developing zzso zzso In conclusion, in spite of slight differences, the considerable similarities of gene expression in human and mice suggest that zzso molecular networks regulate zzso lung zzso
