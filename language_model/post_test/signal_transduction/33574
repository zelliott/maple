The important zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso have triggered extensive investigations over the years to understand the signals that control such responses in normal and zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso pathways and various ancillary zzso has led to the definition and establishment of models by which early signals at the zzso zzso level ultimately induce zzso of zzso genes to generate zzso and zzso zzso An important outstanding issue in the field has been the identification of the mechanisms responsible for regulation of zzso translation of zzso zzso There is emerging evidence suggesting that zzso and its zzso play key and essential roles in the generation of such zzso Moreover, recent studies point towards zzso as a common and central zzso for such responses in Type I and II zzso zzso via its regulatory effects on zzso Here, we review the accumulating evidence on the importance of zzso in zzso with particular emphasis on its role in zzso translation of zzso zzso The implications of such studies on the overall perception of the zzso zzso are also zzso
