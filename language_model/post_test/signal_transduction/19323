zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso in potato zzso was found to possess zzso properties, such as zzso proliferation and inducing zzso of tumor zzso However, the effect of zzso on cancer zzso remains zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso Data demonstrated that zzso inhibited proliferation of human melanoma cell line zzso in a zzso zzso When treated with zzso doses of zzso cell migration and invasion were markedly zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in the migration and invasion of cancer zzso Our zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while it did not affect zzso of zzso signal regulating zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly decreased the nuclear level of nuclear factor zzso B zzso suggesting that zzso inhibited zzso zzso Taken together, the results suggested that zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso cells by reducing zzso zzso It also inhibited zzso and zzso signaling pathways as well as zzso zzso These findings reveal new therapeutic potential for zzso in zzso zzso
