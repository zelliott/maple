The interconnected zzso signaling zzso and Target of zzso zzso signaling pathways constitute the main branches of the zzso system that couples growth to nutritional conditions in zzso Here, we addressed the influence of these pathways and of diet restriction on the balance between the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso and their differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso organ, a pool of zzso zzso blood cells zzso is kept zzso in response to signaling from a specialized group of cells forming the zzso signaling center zzso which serves as a stem cell zzso We show that, reminiscent of the situation in human, loss of the negative regulator of zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso zzso blood cell differentiation and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we demonstrate that components of the zzso pathways control zzso zzso zzso at two zzso First, they zzso regulate the size and activity of the zzso zzso Second, they are required within the zzso to control their growth and zzso Moreover, we show that diet restriction or genetic zzso mimicking zzso acid deprivation triggers zzso cell zzso zzso our study highlights the role of the zzso pathways in orchestrating zzso zzso fate and links blood cell fate to nutritional zzso
