The family of zzso receptors contains nine different zzso of G zzso receptors which mediate the biological effects of adrenaline and zzso With few exceptions, the full therapeutic potential of zzso therapy has not yet been explored for the group of zzso zzso In the absence of sufficiently zzso zzso which can distinguish between individual zzso zzso of the zzso family, zzso mouse models with deletions in these zzso genes have recently been generated and zzso These genetic mouse models have helped to assign specific pharmacological effects of zzso zzso or zzso to individual zzso zzso However, some unexpected and novel functions of zzso receptors were also uncovered in these mouse models: zzso control of zzso release from zzso nerves in the central and sympathetic nervous system may be regulated by three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A similar feedback loop also controls the release of catecholamines from the adrenal zzso zzso are not only involved in regulating vascular tone in the adult zzso but they are essential for the development of the vascular system of the zzso during prenatal zzso The challenge will now be to generate strategies to identify whether the findings obtained in zzso mice may predict the action of zzso zzso drugs in zzso
