As stem cells zzso in adult zzso continue to be identified and zzso it becomes clear that their survival, zzso and zzso depend on specific signals in their zzso or zzso Although adult zzso of diverse zzso differ by their zzso origin, cycling activity, and zzso capacity, there appear to be zzso similarities regarding the cellular and molecular components of the SC zzso Interestingly, many zzso house both zzso and zzso SC zzso which rely on the coexistence of zzso and zzso niches for proper zzso In this review we present a general definition of adult SC niches in the most studied zzso zzso We further focus on zzso their cellular organization and on highlighting recently identified key molecular zzso Finally, we detail the potential involvement of the SC niche in tissue zzso with a particular emphasis on aging and zzso
