zzso zzso cells zzso regulate the zzso and zzso of zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso genes represent a newly identified group of zzso zzso channels zzso Studies have suggested that, among the four human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso might be expressed within the zzso zzso zzso a study showed that zzso is expressed by human zzso zzso zzso However, their precise expression pattern along the gastrointestinal zzso or the lineage specificity of the cells expressing these zzso remains largely zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso each in a zzso zzso manner, in human zzso While zzso was expressed exclusively in zzso zzso cells, zzso was expressed in the zzso cells of both the small zzso and the zzso In addition, we found that zzso expression is significantly zzso in the active zzso of zzso zzso where zzso cells were zzso suggesting that zzso expression is restricted to zzso cells under both normal and zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso cell differentiation by a zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the expression of not zzso but zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso cell differentiation zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that the zzso or zzso of zzso activity leads to the preferential expression of either zzso or zzso respectively, in zzso zzso These results collectively confirmed that zzso and zzso could be added to the zzso genes of humans zzso due to their abilities to clearly identify zzso cells of zzso origin and a distinct subset of zzso cells, zzso
