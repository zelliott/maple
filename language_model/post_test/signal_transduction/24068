zzso zzso zzso play an important role in smooth muscle cell zzso migration and proliferation during vascular zzso To investigate the expression of zzso by zzso we examined the protein zzso and zzso expression of zzso by cultured zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from human zzso zzso zzso To further zzso the molecular mechanism for zzso expression in zzso we determined the sequence requirements for zzso gene zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed substantial zzso expression at both the protein and zzso zzso A series of zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter demonstrated that an zzso site spanning zzso to zzso zzso was critical for the zzso promoter activity in zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed the zzso binding activity in zzso and showed that the protein bound to the zzso site consisted predominantly of zzso zzso and zzso Two structurally different zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso 

These results indicated the expression of zzso in vascular zzso and showed that the zzso gene expression was dependent on the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso through zzso binding zzso
