zzso zzso releases a spectrum of zzso zzso factors, controlled by zzso communication zzso zzso and zzso through the production of small zzso zzso signal molecules zzso We zzso that zzso may in fact serve a dual purpose, also allowing bacterial colonization via their intrinsic zzso zzso One class of signal zzso the zzso zzso has zzso effects on zzso cells, particularly those involved in host zzso In the present study, we have determined the comparative effects of two chemically distinct and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or the zzso zzso signal zzso on human zzso exposed to a series of stimuli designed to detect differential zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso displayed differential effects on the release of zzso zzso when human T cells were activated via the zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation without affecting zzso zzso Both molecules inhibited cell proliferation and the release of zzso following zzso zzso Furthermore, in the presence of zzso coli zzso zzso inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha release from human zzso as reported previously zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso did not inhibit in this zzso These data highlight the presence of two zzso active immune zzso zzso from zzso zzso which are zzso zzso and may be active at the zzso interface during infection with zzso zzso should the zzso airway zzso zzso prove to be accessible to zzso
