Multiple myeloma zzso is an invariably fatal form of cancer characterized by zzso proliferation of zzso plasma cells in the bone zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso is activated in zzso cells through zzso active zzso a zzso zzso relevant to growth, survival, and migration of zzso zzso The identification of a number of small molecular compounds, such as zzso which disrupt the interaction of the zzso active zzso protein complex, provides valuable new therapeutic tools to target an alternative zzso in zzso independent of the zzso Here we evaluated the zzso zzso signaling changes, and biological zzso associated with the zzso of zzso signaling in zzso by zzso The compound blocks expression of zzso target genes and zzso zzso in both patient zzso cells and zzso cell lines without a significant effect in normal plasma zzso In zzso models of human zzso zzso zzso tumor growth and zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate the efficacy of zzso the zzso zzso complex to exploit tumor dependence on zzso signaling as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of zzso
