The recognition of changes in environmental conditions, and the ability to adapt to these changes, is essential for the viability of zzso There are numerous well characterized systems by which the presence or absence of an individual zzso may be recognized by a zzso However, the recognition of a zzso is just one step in a process that often results in changes in the expression of whole sets of genes required to respond to that zzso In higher zzso the zzso zzso between zzso recognition and zzso control can be zzso Recent evidence from the relatively simple zzso zzso suggests that complex zzso pathways may be zzso through the direct interaction between individual zzso and regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural analyses are beginning to unravel these elegant genetic control zzso
