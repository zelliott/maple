In previous papers we started to investigate the possible relationship existing between cell proliferation and cell zzso We reported that in rat zzso undergoing cell proliferation upon stimulation with zzso A or cell death following zzso treatment, an induction of zzso and zzso occurs with different but partially overlapping zzso zzso et zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that, in both zzso the early induction of these nuclear zzso is necessary to allow the induction of zzso genes regulated at the zzso level by zzso complex, zzso zzso activity was investigated in the aforementioned zzso Indeed, we found that zzso is activated not only in zzso but also in zzso cells, with a zzso in zzso with our data about zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the same experimental zzso Moreover, our findings suggest that an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso also occurs in our model of zzso zzso
