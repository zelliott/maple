Acute and chronic rejection are major problems in clinical zzso zzso is largely zzso by natural killer zzso and T cells that use zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to eliminate the zzso The purpose of this review is to inform the reader of recent advances in our understanding of the roles of zzso molecules in rejection and their potential as zzso of zzso 

Although it is well accepted that T cells are the major zzso cells in acute zzso there is an increasing recognition that cells of the innate immune system, and in particular zzso cells, also play a major role in zzso zzso 

Both zzso cells and zzso T cells contribute to acute zzso The major molecules involved include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiles that include these and other molecules may allow better management of organ zzso zzso
