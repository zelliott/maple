It is now established that most of the approximately 800 zzso receptors zzso are regulated by zzso in a process that results in the recruitment of zzso leading to zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso This generalized view of zzso regulation, however, does not provide an adequate mechanism for the control of zzso zzso zzso Here, we review the evidence that zzso zzso is, in fact, a flexible and dynamic regulatory process in which zzso are zzso in a unique manner that is associated with the cell type in which the zzso is zzso In this scenario, zzso offers a mechanism of regulating the zzso outcome of zzso that can be tailored to meet a specific zzso zzso
