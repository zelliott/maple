To investigate the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of zzso stem cells by zzso signaling zzso 

zzso cartilage was taken from a zzso zzso zzso stem cells were isolated and zzso zzso human nuclear zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso signaling system, and zzso inhibitor zzso an inhibitor of the zzso signaling system, were added into the culture medium zzso The cells cultured in the medium added with zzso saline were used as control zzso Then the cultured cells were zzso The expression of the zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso was used to detect the levels of collagen II, collagen X, and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso method was used to calculate the growth zzso The cell phase was examined by flow zzso The level of alkaline zzso (AP) was zzso Western zzso was used to detect the protein expression of collagen II, collagen X, and zzso a signaling protein of zzso 

Only 2 the expression of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso The expression of zzso was stronger in the zzso group than in the other 2 zzso zzso remarkably promoted the expression of collagen II and inhibited the expression of collagen X and zzso remarkably promoted the expression of collagen X and did not remarkably influence the expression of collagen zzso zzso method showed that zzso significantly promote the proliferation of the cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not significantly promote the cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso The percentage of cells at S phase of the zzso group was zzso significantly higher than those of the zzso group and control group zzso and zzso zzso was significantly expressed in the zzso group, and less expressed in the other zzso Western zzso showed a significantly increased expression of collagen X protein and decreased expression of collagen II protein and zzso 

When the zzso signaling system is activated the zzso stem cells zzso and when the zzso signaling system is suppressed the zzso stem cells zzso
