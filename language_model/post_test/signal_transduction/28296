zzso communication is a fundamental process that proteins use to zzso signals from one site to functionally important zzso zzso Although zzso is usually associated with zzso proteins and zzso zzso communication may be a fundamental property of zzso In some cases, communication occurs with minimal structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are small, zzso binding zzso that can use multiple surfaces for zzso diverse zzso Furthermore, these zzso have long-range energetic zzso that link the zzso site to zzso regions of the zzso Here, we show that zzso behavior in a representative member of the zzso domain family may be directly detected using zzso zzso dynamics zzso The changes in zzso dynamics parameters in the second zzso domain from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined upon binding a zzso zzso zzso dynamic effects were detected that zzso to previously observed zzso energetic zzso These results provide one of the first experimental examples for the potential role of zzso zzso dynamics in zzso long-range signals within a zzso and reinforce the idea that dynamic fluctuations in proteins contribute to zzso signal zzso
