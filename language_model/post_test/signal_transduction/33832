zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso belonging to a family of zzso zzso zzso It is involved in the regulation of neural crest production in chicken and promotes zzso differentiation in zzso Here, we investigate the functions of zzso in zzso eye zzso zzso of full-length zzso and especially its zzso form lacking the zzso domain, increased the thickness of the zzso nerve and produced a more extended projection field in the zzso zzso compared with control zzso In contrast, injection of zzso zzso zzso reduced the eye size, inhibited zzso nerve extension, and increased the number of zzso cells in the retinal zzso cell and inner nuclear zzso zzso of full-length zzso increased the lateral separation of the expression zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso had the opposite zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may play roles in the early eye determination, zzso zzso nerve extension, and branching of the retinal zzso cell zzso zzso with the zzso region of zzso being critical for these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso caused changes in the expression pattern of zzso similar to those observed after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso abolished the zzso zzso Physical interaction of zzso and zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso We concluded that zzso serves as a zzso of zzso zzso
