Recent evidence supports that zzso long considered a zzso factor, may also have a zzso function in skeletal zzso The zzso view, mainly based on zzso studies in human and in zzso animal models, was challenged by experiments with zzso in which zzso induced zzso The biological effects of zzso in differentiated muscle, however, remain poorly zzso In the present study, we tested whether zzso has zzso effects in zzso and we characterized the mechanisms leading to these zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso for 24 h increased protein synthesis zzso and enhanced cellular zzso activity by 22 and zzso respectively, without changing cell zzso These effects were confirmed in zzso differentiated from primary rat zzso zzso activated two signaling zzso 1) zzso and its target zzso and 2) zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was inhibited by an zzso against zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso was only partially zzso zzso completely abolished zzso stimulation of zzso as well as zzso of zzso and its downstream targets zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso C1 target zzso without altering zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our results provide evidence that zzso enhances zzso in zzso and that this is based on enhanced protein translation zzso by the zzso and zzso and zzso signaling zzso
