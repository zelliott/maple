zzso human zzso zzso cells cultured inside zzso basement membrane form zzso that resemble the zzso structures of zzso zzso This three-dimensional culture system has been used for identifying and characterizing the signal zzso pathways controlling cell proliferation and death, and for studying their zzso in zzso zzso We have compared the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells grown in zzso and the zzso structures of human breast zzso The tissue architecture of zzso zzso was formed by zzso connected to a basement membrane and by abundant zzso between zzso zzso Intermediate filaments that joined into large and abundant filament zzso connected zzso and zzso to sites at the nuclear zzso Fewer and thinner zzso of filaments were observed in zzso zzso cells and even fewer in breast zzso Tight junctions were observed between cells in breast tissue but missing in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells had a polar organization similar to that observed in breast zzso with zzso and the zzso apparatus on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had an zzso frequently zzso surface and had a single zzso The distribution of zzso was similar to that in the zzso cells of breast zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells had multiple zzso a more regular profile, and less zzso zzso zzso has the resolution required to survey features of zzso cell and zzso architecture that may change with zzso designed to induce zzso zzso
