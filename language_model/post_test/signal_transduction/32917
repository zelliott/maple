The identification of molecules that regulate human zzso stem cells has focused mainly on zzso of which very few are known to act directly on stem zzso Recent studies in lower organisms and the mouse have suggested that bone zzso proteins zzso may play a critical role in the zzso of zzso tissue from the zzso germ zzso Here we report that zzso regulate the proliferation and differentiation of highly zzso primitive human zzso cells from adult and zzso zzso zzso of rare zzso stem cells were isolated from human zzso tissue and were found to express the zzso type I receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of isolated stem cell populations with soluble zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso changes in zzso zzso cell surface zzso and zzso zzso capacity after transplantation in zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso Similar to transforming growth factor zzso treatment of zzso cells with zzso or zzso at high zzso inhibited proliferation yet maintained the primitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, low zzso of zzso induced proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso cells, whereas at higher zzso zzso extended the length of time that zzso capacity could be maintained in ex zzso culture, indicating a direct effect on stem cell zzso The discovery that zzso are capable of regulating zzso cells provides a new zzso for controlling human stem cell development and a powerful model system for studying the biological mechanism of zzso action using primary human zzso
