Loss of zzso tumor zzso function is a critical event in breast zzso We have previously identified the stress hormone zzso as a negative regulator of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Here, we have identified a direct role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The positive regulatory effect of zzso is lost upon the addition of zzso We have shown that zzso interacts with the zzso promoter only in the absence of zzso and that this interaction is zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso protein zzso at the RIBS promoter zzso zzso and zzso interact in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and this interaction involves the zzso to central regions of both zzso This work presents the first evidence of a zzso role for zzso as a positive regulator of gene zzso and loss of zzso from the zzso promoter in response to stress hormones leads to decreased zzso zzso Because low levels of zzso have been implicated in the development of sporadic breast cancer, this may represent a novel mechanism through which prolonged stress signaling increases breast cancer zzso
