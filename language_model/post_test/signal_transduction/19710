Through zzso of the A1 zzso receptors zzso at both the central and peripheral level, zzso produces zzso in a wide range of zzso However, the mechanisms involved in the peripheral effect are still not fully zzso zzso the mechanisms by which peripheral zzso of zzso reduces inflammatory zzso (a decrease in the zzso zzso were addressed in the present zzso zzso of rat zzso root zzso revealed significant expression of zzso in primary sensory zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso of zzso reduced inflammatory zzso because zzso zzso administration of an zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso On the other hand, local zzso administration of zzso (a selective zzso zzso reversed mechanical zzso induced by zzso or by the directly acting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in primary zzso zzso by zzso treatment with zzso zzso significantly reduced peripheral zzso action of zzso zzso blockade of zzso inflammatory zzso by the zzso of zzso depends on the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso because the peripheral zzso effect of zzso was prevented by zzso with zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso G zzso as well as with a zzso blocker zzso However, this effect of zzso was not reduced by zzso excluding the participation of zzso zzso These results suggest that the peripheral zzso of zzso plays a role in the regulation of inflammatory zzso by a mechanism that involves the zzso zzso signaling zzso
