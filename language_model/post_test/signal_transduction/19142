It has been reported that zzso DNA zzso decreases gradually during cell culture and an zzso zzso However, less is known about the zzso changes of age-related specific genes in zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso that are critical for the zzso zzso of normal zzso In this study, we show that zzso and zzso have different zzso patterns during the aging process of normal human zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter is gradually zzso up into middle-aged zzso but not with zzso zzso whereas zzso is always zzso in the aging zzso zzso the protein levels of DNA zzso 1 zzso and zzso increase from young to middle-aged zzso but decrease in the zzso zzso while zzso decreases zzso from young to zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso directly zzso its expression and blocks the zzso DNA zzso zzso by zzso in middle-aged zzso More importantly, zzso by zzso or zzso zzso interference zzso resulted in an increased zzso level and premature zzso of middle-aged zzso demonstrated by cell growth arrest and high zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso but not zzso is involved in the DNA zzso zzso aging zzso zzso promoter zzso may be a critical biological barrier to postpone the aging zzso
