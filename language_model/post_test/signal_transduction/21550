The zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently the subject of genetic changes in human zzso which contribute to the zzso zzso by altering zzso zzso Examples of such genetic changes include zzso zzso domain deletions and point zzso and small deletions in the zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that a point zzso in one of the zzso zzso zzso would increase the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso which is not a potent stimulus of zzso by zzso zzso zzso This zzso would permit zzso stimulation of zzso zzso in settings in which zzso does not normally do zzso To test this hypothesis, we have generated and evaluated various zzso zzso containing zzso at zzso and zzso zzso is a much more potent stimulus of the zzso zzso than of zzso Furthermore, the affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso is greater than the affinity of zzso for zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso but is not highly zzso zzso in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso domain in zzso may permit potent stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso that are not normally potent zzso zzso thereby providing for a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso may be zzso These results also suggest that novel zzso zzso and zzso activities may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
