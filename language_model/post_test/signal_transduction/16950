zzso are associated with organ fibrosis, but their precise origin and functional role remain zzso We used multiple genetically engineered mice to track, fate map and zzso cells to determine the source and function of zzso in kidney zzso Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified that the total pool of zzso is split, with 50% arising from local resident zzso through zzso The zzso zzso derive through differentiation from bone zzso zzso the zzso transition program zzso and the zzso transition program zzso zzso deletion of zzso in zzso muscle zzso zzso cells revealed the importance of this zzso in the recruitment of zzso through zzso Using genetic mouse models and a zzso strategy, we determined that vascular zzso probably do not contribute to the emergence of zzso or zzso Our data suggest that targeting diverse pathways is required to substantially inhibit the composite zzso of zzso in kidney zzso
