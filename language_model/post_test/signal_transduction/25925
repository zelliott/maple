The most common cause of cardiac side effects of zzso is acquired long zzso syndrome, which is characterized by abnormal cardiac zzso and most often caused by direct blockade of the cardiac zzso channel human zzso zzso gene zzso However, little is known about therapeutic compounds that target zzso channels other than zzso We have discovered that zzso zzso zzso a very potent zzso compound for the treatment of acute zzso zzso is zzso via two separate zzso a well characterized zzso of zzso trafficking and a poorly understood increase of cardiac calcium zzso We have analyzed the latter mechanism in the present study using zzso and zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso enhances cardiac calcium currents in the therapeutic concentration range via a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso In guinea pig zzso zzso even a modest reduction in zzso activity is sufficient to increase cellular zzso zzso Under control conditions, zzso levels are kept low by zzso and do not affect calcium current zzso Based on pharmacological experiments and zzso infusion of zzso we propose that in guinea pig zzso zzso zzso regulates calcium currents independently of the protein zzso zzso along a zzso that includes a secondary zzso zzso Overall, our report describes a novel form of acquired long zzso syndrome where the target modified by zzso is an zzso signaling zzso
