zzso protein zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso are activated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to a variety of zzso signals and act in pathways controlling cell growth, shape, zzso survival, and zzso zzso is unique among the zzso family members because it is also activated through zzso zzso by zzso or similar zzso to generate the zzso active zzso zzso zzso of full-length zzso by zzso or zzso stimulates cell survival and protects cells from cell death, whereas zzso zzso zzso a cell death zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso by the 26 S zzso but full-length zzso is zzso zzso of zzso by preventing its zzso and degradation results in a dramatic stimulation of cell zzso Although many proteins have been shown to interact with and regulate full-length zzso little is known about the regulation of zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein for zzso and zzso that was originally identified by its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts specifically with zzso zzso but not active or inactive full-length zzso through a region between the GAP and zzso zzso The interaction with zzso zzso the protein zzso activity of zzso and changes the zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso decreases the stimulation of cell death induced by stabilization of zzso
