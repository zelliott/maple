zzso is a complex process that is orchestrated by several growth factors, zzso cues, signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms of bone formation is pivotal for clarifying the zzso of bone zzso Previously, we reported that zzso zzso for zzso differentiation zzso a novel positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso regulated the differentiation of mouse embryonic zzso into zzso However, the zzso role of zzso in bone formation has not been zzso Here, we clarified the role of zzso in bone formation in zzso and in zzso zzso disruption caused zzso premature zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, analyses using primary zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso regulated differentiation and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso with zzso The zzso region of zzso which contains a zzso zzso was capable of binding to zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is dependent on the zzso region of zzso and that zzso functions as a novel negative regulator of zzso signaling and is required for proper development for zzso zzso These findings will aid a comprehensive description of the mechanism that controls normal and premature zzso zzso
