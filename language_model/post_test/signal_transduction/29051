zzso tissue growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso protein with major roles in zzso zzso zzso tissue repair, cancer and zzso It is a member of the zzso family of zzso gene products which are zzso by four discrete protein zzso in which reside growth factor binding zzso functional motifs for zzso recognition, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A primary function of zzso is to zzso and coordinate signaling responses involving cell surface zzso key components of the zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso of these molecular cues regulates growth factor and zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso and differentiation in tissue zzso zzso amplification of zzso dependent signals results in a failure to terminate tissue repair, leading pathological zzso in conditions such as zzso and zzso
