zzso zzso is essential for reproduction and depends on proper zzso stem cell zzso zzso Genes and signaling pathways that regulate zzso function have not been well zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso factor zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso expression was identified in a subset of zzso at birth, was restricted to zzso during normal zzso and zzso expressing cells were abundant in a zzso model of zzso zzso We used the zzso transplantation technique to overcome the limitation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso mice and found that each of these genes is required for zzso zzso and not for zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso shows severe zzso depletion by zzso Day 7 during the first wave of zzso These defects were due to lack of zzso proliferation and an inability of zzso to maintain an zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling is critical for the fate of zzso zzso and that abnormalities in this zzso may contribute to male zzso and zzso germ cell zzso
