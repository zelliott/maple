zzso tuberculosis is a virulent zzso pathogen that survives in zzso even in the presence of an intact zzso immune zzso Type I zzso have been shown to exacerbate tuberculosis in mice and to be associated with disease progression in infected zzso Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which type I zzso regulate the host response to zzso tuberculosis infection are poorly zzso In this study, we show that zzso tuberculosis zzso an zzso gene expression signature in infected primary human zzso which is dependent on host type I zzso signaling as well as the zzso zzso factor, region of zzso We further demonstrate that type I zzso selectively limit the production of zzso a critical zzso of immunity to zzso zzso This regulation occurs at the level of zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso or zzso zzso amplification and appears to be zzso used by virulent zzso since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to trigger significant expression of type I zzso or release of mature zzso zzso The latter property is associated with decreased zzso zzso maturation in the zzso zzso Interestingly, human zzso in contrast to zzso produce comparable levels of zzso in response to either zzso tuberculosis or zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate that virulent and zzso zzso employ distinct pathways for regulating zzso production in human zzso and reveal that in the case of zzso tuberculosis infection the induction of type I zzso is a major mechanism used for this zzso
