zzso cells in culture respond to cell density by altering their proliferation rates and their pattern of protein zzso zzso avian zzso zzso cells are a case in point where zzso production increases approximately zzso at high cell density while proliferation almost zzso In an earlier report focusing on the cell density regulation of zzso zzso the signaling mechanism zzso the presence of other cells was shown to have the characteristics of a loosely bound component of the cell zzso zzso these studies to the cell density regulation of zzso the cell density signal zzso was again shown to be altered by medium zzso stimulating cell zzso zzso however, was only disruptive to cell signaling when there was a high ratio of medium to zzso When sufficient cells were present, agitation was less zzso zzso the zzso controlling zzso production and the zzso controlling the zzso of growth seemed to be linked because the signaling mechanism is disrupted in a parallel manner by zzso However, the zzso response of zzso cells is more complex in that there is also a positive influence at moderate cell density zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso on the rate of cell zzso As a consequence, zzso cells would not zzso into an area of low cell density, but within the same dish would rapidly fill an area of moderate zzso zzso cells were capable of filling a gap between high cell density areas if the gap was less than 2 zzso zzso agitation also affected cells at low cell density in a different zzso It was zzso if all the cells were at low cell density but it was zzso if the cells at low cell density were in close proximity to cells at high cell zzso In addition, medium zzso by agitation over cells at a high cell density would stimulate cells at low cell density to divide and grow out into low cell density zzso Using the zzso activity of the zzso medium as an zzso this component of the zzso was shown to have unique zzso heat, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By gel exclusion zzso it was larger than 100 zzso But after zzso treatment its mobility shifted to zzso 30 zzso while retaining zzso
