The zzso activity of zzso exchange factors zzso is considered critical to maintain the typically high activity of zzso zzso found in cancer zzso However, the large number of them has made it difficult to pinpoint those playing zzso zzso roles in zzso In this work, we have investigated whether zzso of the zzso zzso exert such specific roles in skin zzso Using genetically engineered mice, we show here that zzso and zzso favor zzso the initiation and promotion zzso of skin zzso zzso profiling and signaling experiments indicate such function is linked to the engagement of, and subsequent participation in, zzso zzso programs that promote zzso proliferation and recruitment of zzso zzso This is a zzso mechanism because the loss of zzso proteins does not cause zzso in zzso zzso These results reveal a previously unknown zzso zzso zzso mechanism that influences the biology of cancer cells and their zzso They also suggest that zzso therapies may be of potential interest in skin tumor prevention and/or zzso
