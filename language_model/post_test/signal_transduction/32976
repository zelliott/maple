zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cells results in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the dynamics of zzso metabolism is important for calcium dependent processes in zzso This report investigates the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of intact abdominal zzso zzso with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso increased total zzso zzso levels in a dose dependent manner zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso consisted primarily of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, when nerve zzso zzso were provided with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso products were zzso and zzso In contrast, incubation of zzso zzso with 1 zzso zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso gamma S and zzso increased zzso levels, suggesting that the direct zzso of zzso C zzso by zzso occurs in a membrane zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that in the intact nerve zzso and in crude zzso a zzso zzso quickly zzso zzso to produce to zzso and zzso This zzso was zzso characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 864 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso The zzso activity can be zzso inhibited by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that show complex binding zzso zzso numbers zzso 1) and can distinguish different forms of the zzso in zzso zzso These two zzso could be very useful tools to determine the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso
