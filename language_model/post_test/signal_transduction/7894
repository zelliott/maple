In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso regulates body size and male tail zzso via a zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso are zzso factors, but rely on zzso zzso for appropriate regulation of target genes in response to zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso pathway, zzso encodes multiple zinc finger zzso factors zzso to zzso zzso which functions in zzso zzso We have studied the molecular functions of zzso as a model for zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso Using zzso zzso to known zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso acts primarily as a zzso zzso in body size regulation in zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso functions contribute to male tail zzso We further show that different zzso regions have intrinsic zzso and zzso activities using a zzso zzso zzso We use zzso analysis to identify zzso target genes in body size zzso zzso with the importance of repression in zzso body size regulation, we find more zzso genes than activated genes in this zzso Finally, we identify five zzso targets with body size and/or male tail patterning zzso including zzso factors related to zzso and zzso and signaling molecules related to zzso and zzso Our results thus suggest that zzso products function zzso as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso regulated body size and male tail zzso
