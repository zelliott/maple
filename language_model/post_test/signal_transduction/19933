Signal zzso typically begins by zzso zzso of a zzso partner that is otherwise in its resting zzso However, in cases where signal zzso is zzso by default, the mechanism of regulation is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso without accessory zzso and is kept in its resting state by the negative regulator, zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1), which is the zzso of a zzso zzso fused with an zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso physically zzso the zzso activity of zzso from the zzso zzso permitting sustained zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso causes zzso zzso required for both zzso sugar zzso and cell zzso In animals, zzso zzso results in signal zzso whereas in plants, zzso results in signal zzso These findings reveal how different organisms rearrange a regulatory system to result in opposite outcomes using similar zzso zzso zzso
