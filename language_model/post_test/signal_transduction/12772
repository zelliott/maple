The thesis of this article is that the zzso zzso of the electron transfer chain and the zzso system is to remove zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or hormone is analogous and presents the features of ideal control system; zzso zzso sensitivity and amplification, and rapid transitions between resting and active zzso In the first part of the article, the simplest zzso model zzso with the experimental results is put zzso After the system is zzso zzso and linear models are zzso An important aspect captured by the model is that the zzso is structurally zzso corresponding to the assumption of regulatory zzso distinct from zzso zzso The structural distinction between a regulatory site and a zzso site zzso different binding and specificity properties of the two types of sites with respect to the zzso In the second part, the experimental evidence for the theory is zzso It is shown that zzso and hormone indeed reduce zzso zzso and that the properties of time lag and zzso predicted by the theory are indeed verified in experiment and are in turn explained by the zzso The theory can explain and correlate various zzso unexplained experimental phenomena such as the zzso of zzso synthesis and the functional role of the zzso zzso zzso The property of zzso predicted by the zzso model, is indicated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso with reduced zzso indeed display zzso zzso In zzso memory for short term zzso may reside in the zzso prolonged zzso of zzso in sensory zzso
