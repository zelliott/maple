The two delta zzso zzso remain the most puzzling zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the recent zzso of the zzso domain structure of zzso many fundamental questions with regard to the zzso mechanism of function still remain zzso Of necessity, the majority of studies on delta receptors focused on the zzso function of zzso since zzso approaches to date are limited to the characterization of spontaneous currents through the zzso zzso Indeed, accumulated evidence primarily from zzso transgenic mice suggest that major zzso roles of zzso are zzso via zzso signaling by the zzso C zzso Why then would the zzso retain a zzso zzso channel domain if they do not form functional zzso zzso Any progress with regard to zzso function of the two delta zzso has been hampered by their largely unknown zzso Even now that a pharmacological profile for zzso is being established on the basis of the zzso domain structure, zzso zzso channels in zzso expression systems stay closed in the presence of molecules that have been demonstrated to bind to the zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we review the current knowledge of delta zzso focusing on the disputed zzso zzso
