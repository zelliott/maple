zzso a 28 zzso acid, zzso zzso is an zzso zzso for the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso In addition to various zzso functions, including stimulation of zzso release, zzso has been characterized as an important regulator of energy zzso zzso administration has been shown to increase zzso in zzso and stimulate food intake in zzso Studies suggest that these zzso effects are zzso primarily through zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this context, zzso has been recognized as a potential target for the treatment of zzso zzso and body weight zzso Cell lines provide convenient in zzso systems to identify and characterize potential zzso and to analyze zzso functional zzso While zzso cell lines that zzso zzso have served as effective research tools for these studies, such cell lines may differ in signaling response to zzso compared with zzso or zzso cells expressing zzso We show here that a cell line derived from a rat anterior zzso zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso as judged by reverse zzso In a zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrate a zzso increase in zzso zzso on stimulation with rat zzso and a related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), but are unresponsive to treatment with inactive zzso rat zzso A zzso zzso with a more robust and stable zzso response, was isolated from the parental population of cells to allow further analysis of zzso signal zzso Using zzso toxin and the zzso C inhibitor zzso we show that zzso signals through the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso rise of zzso zzso in zzso cells involves initial zzso from zzso stores followed by a sustained zzso that occurs via influx of zzso zzso through zzso zzso In addition, unlike observations reported in zzso cell systems, the zzso cells do not exhibit a high level of zzso zzso activity as determined in a zzso zzso zzso Overall, the data presented here suggest that the zzso parental and zzso cells provide novel in zzso systems for the characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
