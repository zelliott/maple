Lead zzso was one of the first poisons identified, and the developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to its toxic zzso Relatively low, zzso doses, of zzso that produce no overt signs of zzso can affect zzso zzso and motor zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso on behavioral performance and gene expression in zzso mice were zzso zzso were exposed to zzso from zzso zzso 8 to zzso zzso 21 and later evaluated in exploratory behavior, zzso Morris water zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso caused significant zzso in exploratory behavior and water maze performance during the probe trial, but zzso performance was not zzso zzso males displayed violent behavior towards their cage zzso but not to a stranger in the zzso zzso Gene expression analysis at zzso by zzso and zzso was performed to provide a molecular link to the behavior changes that were zzso zzso strongly zzso gene expression within the signaling pathways of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso focal zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso gene expression within the pathways for zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of genes for major zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso analysis indicated an increase of gene expression in the whole brain for zzso 1 and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso 1, zzso Trail, zzso and zzso gene expression of brain regions indicated that zzso zzso the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso Brain region protein zzso for zzso an zzso zzso showed a significant decrease only within the zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso affects the behavior of male and female mice in that females did less exploration and the males were selectively more zzso Gene expression data pointed to evidence of zzso in the brain of both female and male zzso zzso had more of an effect in the males on expression of zzso zzso genes associated with odor detection and social zzso
