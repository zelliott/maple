zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in particular are highly zzso tumors that frequently exhibit regions of severe zzso and zzso Because these features correlate with poor zzso we investigated zzso whose expression might regulate hypoxic zzso cell survival and zzso We determined that the expression of zzso zzso is decreased significantly in highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor studies revealed that reduced zzso levels zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso targets multiple components of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso repression increases the abundance and activity of multiple zzso zzso This elevated zzso signaling also promotes the zzso of zzso factor zzso most notably zzso We further show that zzso zzso regulation is zzso dependent, via zzso zzso zzso our results identify an zzso signaling axis that promotes zzso cell survival and tumor zzso particularly in zzso zzso zzso
