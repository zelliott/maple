The zzso zzso is a specialized zzso stage of zzso zzso that is zzso and resistant to environmental zzso The zzso zzso is formed in response to a high external concentration of a zzso zzso zzso Response to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a promising genetic model for zzso zzso zzso More than 20 genes have been identified that are required for normal zzso zzso The functions of these genes include production of the zzso exposure of sensory zzso endings to the environment, structural and functional integrity of those sensory zzso and the capacity of sensory zzso to make appropriate zzso zzso evidence suggests that two partially redundant sensory pathways act in concert to control zzso zzso At least two classes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in the zzso zzso On the basis of on these findings, a speculative model for the zzso response is zzso In this model, the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso sensors that repress zzso formation in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso formation in response to zzso It is currently unclear whether or not the two genetically defined sensory pathways both act in zzso and zzso
