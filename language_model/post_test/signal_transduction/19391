zzso zzso a zzso growth factor released from zzso cells, is indispensable for cardiac development, structural zzso and functional integrity of the zzso In recent years, a growing number of studies have focused on zzso and members of the zzso family that serve as receptors for zzso in order to better understand the role of this signaling zzso in physiology and zzso of the zzso An essential role for zzso and zzso in heart development and functionality has been suggested by studies in conditional zzso mice and by the zzso side effects of zzso zzso therapies used for treatment of breast zzso In zzso and in zzso studies using zzso human zzso zzso which contains the zzso growth factor zzso domain zzso for zzso zzso have further supported the hypothesis that zzso plays an important role in heart zzso zzso with other studies, expression of zzso not only restored normal zzso structure altered by nutritional zzso in cell cultures, but also improved the pumping function of the heart in several animal models of chronic heart failure zzso As a result of these findings, proteins involved in the zzso zzso have been explored as potential drug targets for treatment of heart zzso Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zzso have been conducted in both China and zzso As predicted, zzso treatment improved both cardiac function and reversed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may represent a new drug for treatment of zzso with a novel therapeutic zzso
