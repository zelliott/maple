zzso involving zzso modification of proteins are key components of the zzso signaling zzso Each cycle is comprised of two zzso forms of a particular zzso A classic signaling zzso is structured by a chain or cascade of basic cycle units in such a way that the activated protein in one cycle promotes the zzso of the next protein in the chain, and so zzso Starting from a zzso kinetic description and using a careful zzso analysis, we have zzso to our knowledge for the first time, a consistent approximation of the chain with one variable per zzso The model we derive is distinct from the one that has been in use in the literature for several years, which is a zzso extension of the zzso zzso zzso Even though much has been done regarding the mathematical modeling of these systems, our contribution fills a gap between existing models and, in doing so, we have unveiled critical new properties of this type of signaling zzso A key feature of our new model is that a negative feedback emerges naturally, exerted between each cycle and its zzso Due to this negative feedback, the system displays zzso zzso zzso under constant stimulation and, most important, zzso zzso both forwards and zzso This last attribute challenges the widespread notion of zzso in signaling zzso zzso examples of applications to zzso zzso are zzso All these properties are shared by the complete zzso description and our simplified model, but not by previously derived zzso models of signaling zzso
