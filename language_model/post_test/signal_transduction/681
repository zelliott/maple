Dynamic zzso zzso are initiated and maintained by zzso filament zzso including the zzso This protein assembly is activated in zzso by distinct zzso factors such as zzso syndrome zzso family proteins or zzso but the relative in zzso functions of each of them remain zzso Here, we report the conditional genetic disruption of zzso zzso implicated previously in dynamic zzso reorganizations driving zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells showed little changes in overall cell zzso and zzso zzso analyses and zzso imaging studies revealed zzso zzso architecture, zzso zzso and zzso network zzso although zzso assembly rates in the zzso were modestly zzso In contrast, zzso growth zzso zzso reorganization and zzso zzso were impaired in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso caused reduction of zzso activity and defects in random and directed cell zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso cells could be zzso at least in part, by active zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso removal did not affect the efficiency of zzso zzso Together, we conclude that zzso is fully zzso for zzso zzso during zzso zzso or zzso pit zzso Furthermore, we propose that zzso promotes cell migration zzso through contributing to zzso of selected zzso
