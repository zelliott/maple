zzso shedding of the zzso precursor protein zzso by the zzso activity zzso is a key regulatory event preventing the generation of the Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso are essential for diverse zzso zzso such as embryonic development, cell zzso and zzso zzso Previously, several zzso were suggested as candidate zzso for zzso in particular members of the zzso family (a zzso and zzso Two recent studies analyzed primary zzso which are the cell type affected in zzso and finally demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso activity is selectively zzso by zzso An increase in zzso zzso is considered a therapeutic approach for zzso However, the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso remain only partly zzso Signaling pathways zzso protein zzso C and zzso zzso play a central role in stimulating zzso zzso of zzso Additionally, several recent publications demonstrate that zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso are tightly controlled at the level of transcription, zzso by zzso acid receptors and zzso and at the level of translation and protein zzso This review focuses on the recent progress made in unraveling the molecular identity, regulation and therapeutic potential of zzso in Alzheimer's zzso
