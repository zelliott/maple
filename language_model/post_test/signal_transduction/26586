The zzso signaling regulator zzso zzso is expressed in the brain, but little is known regarding its role in the zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we report that zzso expression was zzso in high-grade human zzso tissue samples and zzso cell zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso migration and invasion, we generated human zzso cell lines in which zzso was either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso while elimination of zzso zzso the migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso migration and invasion by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso directly with tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 5 zzso which signals upstream and is required for the zzso of zzso and committed it to zzso degradation by promoting zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that zzso negative regulates zzso cell migration and invasion by zzso zzso zzso of zzso
