zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso is a protein zzso that zzso zzso availability signals to control numerous cellular functions including zzso a process of cellular zzso activated by zzso zzso Addressing the therapeutic potential of modulating zzso signaling and zzso in human disease requires active chemicals with zzso desirable zzso 

Using an automated zzso zzso we screened a collection of zzso chemicals and identified three approved drugs zzso zzso zzso and one pharmacological zzso zzso capable of rapidly increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the four compounds stimulate zzso and inhibit zzso signaling in cells maintained in zzso zzso The compounds did not inhibit zzso which also contains zzso as a zzso zzso suggesting that they do not inhibit zzso zzso activity but rather inhibit signaling to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso were rapidly reversed upon drug withdrawal whereas zzso inhibited zzso essentially zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso was required for zzso of zzso signaling by zzso but not for zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso exposure of immortalized mouse zzso zzso to these drugs was not toxic in zzso conditions but led to rapid cell death by zzso in zzso conditions, by a mechanism determined in large part by the zzso sclerosis complex protein zzso an upstream regulator of zzso By contrast, transient exposure to the zzso inhibitor zzso caused essentially irreversible zzso zzso sustained zzso of cell growth and no selective cell killing in zzso 

The observation that drugs already approved for human use can zzso inhibit zzso and stimulate zzso should greatly facilitate the zzso and clinical testing of zzso zzso for indications such as zzso zzso diabetes, cardiovascular disease and zzso
