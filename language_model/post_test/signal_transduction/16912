zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and differentiate under tight regulation by various factors in the stem cell zzso Recent studies have shown that the precursor of nerve growth factor zzso zzso abounds in the central nervous system zzso and that its expression level in the brain is substantially elevated with aging as well as in several types of zzso zzso In this study, we found for the first time that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso isolated from zzso mouse zzso and caused cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase without affecting zzso In addition, zzso reduced the differentiation of zzso to zzso The effects of zzso were blocked by the fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and human zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interaction was involved in the effects of zzso on zzso proliferation and zzso zzso decreased the zzso level of zzso signal responsive zzso 1/2 zzso zzso in a zzso manner under both zzso and differentiation zzso The zzso of zzso 1/2 zzso by zzso significantly reduced the proliferation and zzso of zzso indicating that zzso 1/2 zzso by zzso partially explains its effects on zzso proliferation and zzso These results suggest that the zzso signal plays a key role in the regulation of zzso zzso
