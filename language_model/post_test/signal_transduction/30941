zzso soft tissue injury and bone fracture are significant contributors to the initial systemic inflammatory response in multiply injured zzso zzso inflammation can lead to organ dysfunction remote from the site of traumatic zzso The mechanisms underlying the recognition of peripheral injury and the subsequent zzso of the immune response are zzso zzso receptors zzso recognize microbial products but also may recognize danger signals released from damaged zzso Here we report that peripheral tissue trauma zzso systemic inflammation and remote organ zzso Moreover, this systemic response to a sterile local injury requires zzso zzso 4 zzso Compared with zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated reduced systemic and zzso inflammatory responses to bilateral zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso in the liver required functional zzso zzso zzso mice failed to demonstrate protection from zzso systemic inflammation and zzso zzso zzso our results also argue against a contribution of zzso zzso to this zzso These findings identify a critical role for zzso in the rapid recognition and response zzso to severe traumatic zzso Application of these findings in an evolutionary context suggests that zzso organisms have evolved to use the same pattern recognition zzso for surviving traumatic and infectious zzso
