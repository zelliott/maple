zzso and zzso are protein zzso that mediate signaling by zzso R zzso zzso receptors including the zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso Although well studied in mouse systems, the mechanism by which they function in human systems is less zzso To extend our knowledge of how these proteins regulate inflammatory signaling in human cells, we genetically and zzso manipulated zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso of zzso expression in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso with zzso suppressed zzso induced zzso and zzso production whereas zzso zzso suppressed zzso induced but not zzso induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso zzso restored zzso induced zzso gene expression suggesting that the zzso zzso activity is zzso relative to its scaffolding zzso zzso with this finding, an zzso selective zzso inhibitor zzso that inhibited zzso degradation failed to block zzso induced zzso zzso In contrast, an inhibitor of both zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso also antagonized zzso zzso and zzso zzso production in human zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso Therefore in human cells the zzso functions of zzso are essential, whereas the zzso activity of zzso appears redundant with that of zzso zzso zzso of both zzso appears necessary to block zzso zzso zzso
