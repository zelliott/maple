Although the neural zzso appears as a relatively uniform tissue when viewed from its surface, it is in fact highly patterned along its zzso and zzso zzso The question of how and when such patterns arise has been the subject of intensive investigations over several zzso Most studies aimed at understanding retinal pattern formation have used the zzso map, the ordered projections of retinal zzso cells to the brain, as a functional zzso of the zzso However, other cell types are also zzso organized in the zzso The most commonly recognized example of such a zzso cellular organization is the differential distribution of zzso types across the zzso zzso patterns are highly zzso and may represent an important adaptation to the visual niche a given species zzso Nevertheless, few studies have addressed this functional zzso of pattern to date and our understanding of its development has remained zzso Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular zzso that control zzso of the eye zzso relate these findings to the development of zzso patterns and discuss common and unique strategies involved in both aspects of retinal pattern zzso
