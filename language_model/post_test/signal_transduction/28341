In the developing nervous system, controlled zzso extension and branching are critical for the establishment of connections between zzso and their zzso Although much is known about the regulation of zzso development, many of the molecular events that regulate zzso extension remain zzso zzso factor zzso site opener zzso and zzso factor zzso have important roles in the regulation of the zzso as well as membrane zzso To investigate the role of these molecules in zzso we expressed zzso and zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso inactive zzso or dominant negative zzso resulted in enhanced zzso extension and branching and this effect was zzso by zzso of zzso active zzso We sought to identify the downstream zzso of zzso during zzso extension by zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso with zzso inactive zzso and dominant negative zzso We found that zzso zzso alpha plays a role in zzso extension and branching downstream of zzso Also, expression of inactive zzso depleted the zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso from the growth cone leading edge, indicating that these effects on zzso may be zzso by changes in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso through zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso and branching during zzso zzso
