The extent of zzso and/or vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression in zzso tumors zzso with zzso zzso amplification, and poor clinical zzso Recently, we have shown that zzso growth zzso and zzso growth factors stimulate zzso expression in zzso cells via induction of zzso zzso zzso Because another marker of poor prognosis in zzso tumors is high expression of zzso zzso factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso we sought to evaluate the involvement of zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells cultured in zzso media increased after 8 to 16 hours in zzso zzso induced increases in zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso levels were zzso zzso induced a zzso to zzso increase in zzso promoter activity, which could be zzso if the zzso response element in the zzso promoter was zzso zzso of zzso small interfering zzso blocked zzso increases in zzso promoter activity and zzso protein zzso The zzso increases in zzso and zzso expression required zzso zzso zzso activity and were completely blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso plays a role in regulating zzso levels in zzso cells and that targeted therapies to zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and/or zzso have the potential to inhibit zzso expression and limit zzso tumor zzso
