zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that can survive inside zzso zzso replication of zzso zzso requires the zzso complex, which is highly similar to the zzso DNA transfer zzso In this study, we showed that a class A scavenger zzso zzso of zzso is required to zzso zzso zzso and contributes to the establishment of bacterial infection in zzso zzso from zzso mice inhibited zzso and zzso replication of both wild type strain and the zzso zzso and that bacterial proliferation was inhibited in zzso zzso Adding zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not from zzso coli, to zzso inhibited bacterial zzso zzso bacterial zzso induced zzso of zzso into zzso membrane zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso into zzso by using zzso as a zzso and that the zzso type IV zzso system of zzso zzso regulates signal zzso dependent on zzso to form zzso zzso and which is zzso by zzso zzso
