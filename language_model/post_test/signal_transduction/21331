During pregnancy, vascular zzso and zzso agents such as zzso oxide zzso increase blood flow to the zzso zzso Using our zzso artery zzso cell zzso culture model, based on cells from pregnant zzso and zzso zzso zzso we investigate the relative zzso roles of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso NO zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso is fully inhibited using zzso of zzso C zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significant residual zzso activity remains in both zzso and zzso No change in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is observed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 1/2 inhibitor zzso (10 zzso did not alter zzso zzso activity in zzso but zzso the zzso response in zzso Using two zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed no effect with zzso (10 zzso on zzso activity in zzso and zzso but zzso (10 zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso in zzso resulted in slight zzso of zzso zzso activity, but relative zzso zzso zzso was not altered by zzso zzso continued to inhibit zzso zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso still had no zzso zzso Our data indicate both zzso and multiple zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso activity in our zzso We report that pregnancy adaptation of zzso zzso includes the reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso activity and enhanced stimulation of zzso activity through a zzso zzso zzso zzso
