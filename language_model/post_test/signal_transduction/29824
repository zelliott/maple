Because of the evolutionary conservation of innate mechanisms of host defense, zzso has emerged as an ideal animal in which to study the genetic control of immune recognition and zzso The discovery that the Toll zzso is required for defense against zzso infection in zzso was pivotal in studies of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso genetic screens in zzso to isolate additional zzso unable to induce zzso responses to infection have identified and ordered the function of components of two signaling zzso the Toll and zzso zzso that activate responses to zzso zzso blood cells also contribute to host defense through zzso and zzso and may carry out a form of zzso recognition that is independent of microbial pattern zzso Recent work suggests that zzso will be a useful model for zzso zzso mechanisms of several medically important zzso
