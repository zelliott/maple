zzso are zzso zzso molecules of the zzso zzso family with sequences highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and their human zzso zzso zzso are unique among the zzso proteins in that they have zzso zzso Furthermore, alternative zzso generates zzso zzso with different zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso may play important roles in regulating the function or functions of zzso By using both sense and zzso approaches, we have shown that zzso is a zzso zzso in prostate zzso This observation raises the possibility that the zzso domain of zzso may be involved in signal zzso or interaction with zzso elements to elicit the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains several potential zzso sites, including putative consensus sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of the potential zzso zzso sites is located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for signal zzso in zzso These structural features suggest that the zzso domain of zzso may be important for signal zzso To test this possibility, we generated several zzso zzso zzso and tested their ability to support zzso and their abilities to be zzso in zzso zzso from these studies revealed that zzso is zzso in zzso However, replacing this zzso with zzso did not significantly compromise its zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in zzso but deletion of the potential zzso zzso zzso site did not significantly reduce the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso sites in the zzso domain of zzso are not required for the zzso zzso However, these zzso sites are probably involved in the regulation of zzso signal zzso Thus, there are probably distinct structural requirements for the zzso and the signal zzso functions of zzso zzso a zzso deletion zzso containing a zzso zzso domain was able to support zzso zzso This is in contrast to our previous finding that a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso domain could not support cell zzso This result indicates that the extra four zzso zzso which are absent in zzso and contain a potential zzso zzso site, are important for the zzso zzso
