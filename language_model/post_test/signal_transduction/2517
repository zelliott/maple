zzso growth zzso factor zzso ) mediates zzso zzso and zzso effects through the zzso zzso a membrane bound zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso for a large number of zzso and zzso cells and activates organ zzso zzso transcripts have been detected in various zzso cell zzso zzso the potential role of zzso signaling for circulating cells of the immune system, especially under conditions of zzso was zzso Several zzso and zzso cell lines were found to express zzso or zzso zzso while activity of both genes was mutually exclusive with the exception of low level zzso in two zzso zzso zzso transcripts were present in low quantities in freshly isolated peripheral blood zzso cells zzso In contrast, zzso expression was not detected in freshly isolated cells from peripheral blood, but was induced in zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso incubation led to an increased zzso steady state transcript level in zzso zzso cells and moderately promoted cell viability of freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso expression is thus established in activated zzso in particular under conditions resembling zzso making these cells accessible to functional effects of zzso
