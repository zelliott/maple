The zzso zzso domain functions as a zzso for the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso to mediate myriad cell fate zzso zzso zzso activity is balanced by zzso repression, zzso by zzso in concert with its zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso neural zzso protein zzso zzso is a nuclear factor that zzso zzso zzso during multiple peripheral nervous system cell fate zzso zzso zzso was particularly critical when zzso activity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso generated several zzso zzso zzso zzso most zzso targets in the zzso and opposed zzso zzso of an zzso zzso A direct role for zzso in zzso repression was indicated by binding of zzso to zzso and by strong zzso zzso of zzso zzso to most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fully rescued sensory organ precursors in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso can antagonize zzso independently of zzso These data shed first light on the in zzso function for a zzso protein as an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso regulating neural zzso
