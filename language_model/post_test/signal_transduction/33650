The rat zzso system contains a variety of location zzso and zzso cells and directional zzso zzso zzso cells, thought to be critical for zzso The HD cells can be found throughout many portions of the zzso formation, as well as additional zzso cortical and zzso zzso These zzso regions are generally strongly interconnected zzso Earlier work, along with theoretical considerations, suggest that despite the ubiquitous presence of HD cells, there may be a single region which is critical for the initial formation of this HD zzso Specifically, it has been suggested that the critical HD cell network resides in a zzso loop formed by the interconnected lateral zzso nucleus and zzso zzso nucleus of zzso Unlike the HD cells, place cells have not been observed in zzso zzso They are, however, found in various forms throughout much of the zzso zzso zzso accounts of the place cells suggest that they are partly dependent on a path integration process which is, in turn, dependent on the HD zzso According to the above reasoning, zzso of the zzso bodies should completely eliminate both HD and zzso cells in the zzso zzso Here, we tested for both HD and place cell activity in various zzso formation zzso regions following zzso of the zzso zzso We found that these zzso caused nearly complete elimination of the HD cell zzso but left the place cell signal largely zzso Our interpretation of these findings is somewhat limited by the fact that we did not provide a thorough test of the path integration abilities of the post zzso place zzso These findings pose a challenge for current theoretical accounts of place and grid zzso They also help to explain the role played by the zzso bodies in spatial learning and zzso
