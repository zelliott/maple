zzso stem cells are maintained within niches that promote zzso by providing signals that specify the stem cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso reside in niches at the anterior tip of the tissue and support continuous growth of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that a neighboring dynamic population of zzso cells, called escort cells, are zzso niche zzso We show that escort cells produce both zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and that zzso signaling is specific for the zzso niche whereas zzso signaling is active in both zzso and daughter zzso In addition, we show that multiple escort cells simultaneously zzso germ cell zzso and contact zzso Thus, zzso are maintained in a dynamic niche by a zzso population of niche zzso
