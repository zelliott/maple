Cell zzso such as physical forces can activate zzso genes but the regulatory mechanisms are not zzso We determined if the zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso and thereby regulate the zzso target gene zzso We used zzso cells and human zzso zzso to examine zzso zzso of an zzso gene and zzso cells, an zzso model system, to facilitate interaction studies of zzso zzso with regulatory zzso Mechanical stress applied to zzso cells increased promoter activity of the zzso target gene zzso A by zzso zzso was blocked by zzso to zzso binding sites in the zzso A zzso zzso experiments in zzso cells with zzso expression zzso showed that when zzso with zzso active zzso zzso zzso but not an zzso binding zzso increased promoter activity of the zzso target zzso zzso A, and enhanced binding of nuclear extracts to a zzso A promoter zzso zzso A promoter activity was blocked by dominant negative zzso zzso that was zzso at zzso and zzso by zzso active zzso bound to the zzso A promoter more effectively than zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso while the zzso zzso double zzso protein showed zzso reduction of zzso We conclude that stress zzso of zzso zzso zzso at specific zzso zzso modifications which in turn enhance the expression of zzso zzso
