zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso II zzso zzso involves zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso rat brain zzso This zzso is only partially responsible for this heightened action of zzso II in the spontaneously zzso rat zzso brain zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso involves zzso of zzso and protein zzso B zzso zzso II zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso brain zzso and was accompanied by its zzso from the zzso to the nuclear zzso Although the magnitude of stimulation by zzso II was comparable, the stimulation was more persistent in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso rat zzso zzso of zzso had no significant effect in the zzso rat zzso However, it caused a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso completely attenuated zzso II stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso rat zzso whereas it caused only a zzso decrease in the zzso zzso However, an additive zzso was observed when both zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso II also zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso This stimulation was zzso higher and lasted longer in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso rat zzso In conclusion, these observations demonstrate an exclusive involvement of zzso signaling zzso in a heightened zzso zzso action of zzso II in the zzso zzso Thus, this study offers an excellent potential for the development of new therapies for the treatment of centrally zzso zzso
