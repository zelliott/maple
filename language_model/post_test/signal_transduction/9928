The cell lineages that form the transporting zzso zzso and zzso and the intervening zzso zzso tissue originate from stem cells near the root zzso We demonstrate that in zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowing zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates the spatial domain of zzso zzso Thus, by controlling the identity of cell zzso the zzso interaction of zzso signaling and its zzso specific zzso regulates proliferation and differentiation of cell lineages during vascular development, demonstrating a previously zzso regulatory circuit underlying zzso zzso
