In this study, the role of the zzso zzso zzso in cardiovascular dysfunction associated with zzso was examined with the use of zzso a zzso zzso Male zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso alone, zzso + zzso zzso zzso or zzso + high-dose zzso (10 zzso and compared with control zzso zzso in the zzso group showed an increase in the ratio of heart weight to body weight, which was ameliorated by zzso at both low and high zzso zzso and zzso parameters were also evaluated and confirmed that zzso attenuated the cardiac zzso induced by zzso The extent of zzso of the zzso zzso targeting zzso was zzso by Western zzso to evaluate the activity of zzso in the heart zzso Both Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analyses revealed enhancement of zzso and zzso protein 1 activity and reduction of zzso expression in the zzso group, and this response was inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso induced by zzso as evidenced by the detection of terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso cells and the expressions of zzso and zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso is involved in the cardiac zzso induced by experimental zzso The antagonism of this zzso may thus be useful as an alternative target in the treatment of zzso heart zzso
