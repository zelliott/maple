zzso of zzso signaling zzso is a critical inhibitor of zzso signal zzso in zzso but the precise zzso mechanism of action of zzso is zzso Studies in zzso have shown that zzso binds to zzso and zzso their zzso activity, but recent studies indicate zzso may act in a similar manner to zzso by zzso interacting with zzso receptors and then zzso zzso zzso Here, we have generated mice, termed zzso in which a putative zzso binding site, zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is zzso We confirm that zzso binds to zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in impaired negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is prolonged in zzso cells, but not to the extent seen in cells completely lacking zzso suggesting that zzso maintains activity to zzso zzso signaling via other zzso Despite this, we show that hypersensitivity to zzso results in enhanced innate tumor protection in zzso mice in zzso and zzso expression of an zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso contributes to the regulation of signaling through zzso via the recruitment of zzso to the zzso
