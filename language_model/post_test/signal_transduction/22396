The zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are elevated during vascular and zzso zzso How zzso stimulation causes vascular injury remains poorly zzso This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism by which zzso stimulation leads to vascular zzso 

Exposure of bovine zzso zzso cells to either zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso 2 structurally related zzso zzso for 24 hours markedly increased the release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso an index of zzso oxide zzso zzso also significantly suppressed activity of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and reduced levels of zzso an essential zzso zzso zzso and zzso increases in zzso were accompanied by the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso significantly increased protein zzso zzso zzso in membrane zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, exposure of isolated mouse zzso to zzso markedly increased zzso in zzso but not in those from zzso knockout zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso increases both zzso and zzso resulting in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
