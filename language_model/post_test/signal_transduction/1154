zzso acid zzso a wide variety of biological processes including zzso zzso and zzso It interacts with specific receptors in the nucleus, the zzso acid receptors zzso The molecular mechanism by which zzso acid mediates cellular differentiation and growth suppression in neural cells remains zzso However, zzso zzso release of zzso acid and its zzso may play an important role in cell zzso zzso and zzso In brain zzso zzso acid is mainly released by the action of zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso zzso We have used the model of differentiation in zzso cells induced by zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso acid produces an increase in zzso zzso activity in the nuclear zzso The pan zzso acid zzso zzso zzso can prevent this increase in zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity is a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cell zzso also have zzso C and zzso D zzso activities that are zzso by zzso zzso Selective zzso C and zzso D zzso block the stimulation of zzso C and zzso D zzso Thus, both direct and indirect mechanisms of zzso acid release exist in zzso cell zzso zzso acid and its zzso markedly affect the zzso outgrowth and neurotransmitter release in cells of zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso acid receptors coupled with zzso zzso C and D in the nuclear membrane play an important role in the zzso of zzso acid in zzso and zzso zzso zzso during differentiation and growth zzso zzso zzso metabolism may be involved in the downstream zzso regulation of zzso zzso signal zzso in schizophrenia and zzso disease zzso The development of new zzso zzso with diminished toxicity that can cross the zzso barrier without harm and can zzso zzso zzso signaling will be important in developing pharmacological interventions for these neurological zzso
