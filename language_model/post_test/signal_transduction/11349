zzso zzso of zzso signaling molecules lead to zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso We have previously cloned and characterized zzso gene on human zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated from the zzso gene due to alternative zzso of the alternative promoter type, zzso almost identical zzso with divergence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso cells with the potential of zzso zzso Here, we describe our investigations of expression of zzso zzso in various types of human primary zzso zzso zzso expression array analysis revealed that zzso zzso were significantly zzso in 2 of 8 cases of primary gastric zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso in a case of primary gastric cancer zzso ring cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso were investigated by using zzso axis zzso zzso zzso of synthetic zzso zzso into the zzso marginal zone of zzso zzso eggs at the zzso stage did not induce axis zzso In contrast, zzso injection of synthetic zzso zzso induced axis zzso in zzso of zzso zzso axis duplication, zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso in some cases of gastric cancer might lead to zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
