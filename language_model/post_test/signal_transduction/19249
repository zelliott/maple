The cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is a potential target for zzso zzso zzso zzso for many types of zzso The lack of effective therapy for zzso breast cancer zzso prompted us to examine whether zzso is expressed in zzso and can be targeted with zzso zzso 

zzso protein expression was assessed in 44 primary zzso zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in tumor cells in zzso zzso from 12 zzso breast cancer zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso on growth, zzso and migration of zzso cells was tested in zzso The ability of zzso zzso to induce zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and to inhibit spontaneous zzso and tumor recurrence zzso zzso 12 mice per zzso was tested in breast cancer models in zzso The mechanisms responsible for the zzso effect of zzso zzso were also investigated in the cell lines and in the mouse zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso protein was zzso expressed in 32 of the 44 zzso primary zzso zzso tested, in zzso cell lines, and in tumor cells in zzso zzso from 12 zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso statistically significantly inhibited growth, zzso and migration of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of tumor zzso in a zzso zzso experimental lung zzso model zzso zzso vs control, mean area of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso difference of mean zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso statistically significantly reduced spontaneous lung zzso and tumor zzso in an zzso zzso mouse zzso The mechanisms responsible for zzso effect included increased zzso and reduced zzso activity in tumor cells, decreased blood vessel density in the tumor zzso and reduced zzso of signaling pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation and zzso 

This study identified zzso as a new target for zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso by multiple mechanisms, including the zzso of signaling pathways crucial for zzso cell survival, zzso and zzso
