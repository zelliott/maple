zzso gene therapy is a novel approach to the treatment of diseases such as zzso heart failure zzso Gene transfer to the heart would allow for the replacement of defective or missing cellular proteins that may improve cardiac zzso Our laboratory has been focusing on the feasibility of restoring zzso signaling deficiencies that are a characteristic of chronic zzso We have now studied isolated zzso zzso from rabbits that have been chronically paced to produce zzso zzso We document molecular zzso signaling defects including zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso functional zzso zzso and an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer of the human zzso or an inhibitor of zzso to these failing zzso led to the restoration of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that defects present in this critical zzso signaling zzso can be corrected in zzso using genetic modification and raise the possibility of novel zzso therapies for zzso including the zzso of zzso activity in the zzso
