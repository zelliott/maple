zzso growth factor zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso The response of zzso to zzso does not appear to be channeled through any known component of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso In addition, zzso sequences upstream of the zzso start site are devoid of previously identified zzso zzso such as those found in the zzso zzso These data suggest that a novel signal zzso zzso regulates the zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso also respond to this zzso but with poor zzso However, this zzso operates very efficiently on other zzso genes that zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso
