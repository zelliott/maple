zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways have been zzso but the molecular mechanisms and cooperative roles of such interaction in zzso are poorly zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso and zzso activities were zzso decreased in zzso which inhibit zzso transformation and proliferation by zzso zzso The zzso of the components of the zzso zzso by zzso occurred in cells retaining zzso zzso including primary zzso but not in cells retaining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation and zzso zzso zzso induced by either zzso growth factor or zzso indicating a role of zzso in the regulation of growth induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation by zzso occurs at least partly via reduction of the protein level of zzso Both zzso and zzso Ras proteins are subjected to regulation by zzso which occurs in cells retaining zzso but not zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso was further confirmed by Ras reduction and subsequent inhibitions of the zzso zzso components by knock down of zzso form of zzso The Ras regulation by zzso was blocked by treatment of zzso an inhibitor of the zzso protein degradation zzso Overall, zzso zzso proliferation of cells at least partly by reduction of Ras protein level via zzso This study provides zzso for the role of the zzso zzso in zzso caused by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
