zzso zzso are potent zzso zzso that are produced during infections and whose synthesis and signaling networks present potential zzso targets for zzso zzso acts through the zzso of four distinct G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous in zzso and in zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso receptors suppresses inflammatory responses to microbial pathogens through zzso signaling zzso Although it is speculated that zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso might counteract zzso zzso in the context of bacterial infection (or severe zzso this has not previously been tested in zzso To address this, we infected zzso zzso and zzso mice with the important respiratory pathogen zzso zzso or injected mice zzso with zzso zzso we observed that zzso mice were protected from mortality after infection or zzso The enhanced survival observed in the infected zzso mice correlated with enhanced pulmonary clearance of zzso reduced zzso of lung zzso lower numbers of circulating blood zzso and an impaired zzso response to zzso In zzso studies revealed improved zzso zzso zzso and zzso capacities in zzso cells that were associated with an increased capacity to generate NO in response to immune zzso Our studies underscore the complex nature of zzso zzso in the context of zzso interactions in the zzso zzso targeting of the zzso axis represents a novel area zzso greater investigative interest in the prevention and/or treatment of infectious zzso
