To survey and compare the signaling pathways from the insulin and zzso growth zzso zzso receptors in zzso and differentiated muscle cells, we examined the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by the combination of insulin and zzso These zzso were detected by zzso with zzso against zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso 100, 41, and 37 zzso zzso appeared in response to zzso With the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso cells, and only the zzso content of the zzso one increased in response to zzso The zzso of zzso 41, and 37 zzso were tentatively identified as the insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso with zzso specific for these zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso are probably the zzso of the insulin and zzso zzso The amounts of zzso zzso and zzso were roughly the same in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Thus, differentiation of the zzso to zzso was not accompanied by the zzso appearance of new zzso zzso zzso or marked changes in the amounts of known participants in their signaling zzso
