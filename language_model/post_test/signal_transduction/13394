zzso cell lines exhibit different responses to zzso depending on their maturation zzso We investigated the mechanisms underlying the differential zzso responsiveness in the less mature zzso and in mature zzso zzso A reduction in the binding activity of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso to different zzso binding elements zzso was observed in zzso This reduced binding activity was not due to an impaired zzso zzso Studies on the expression of a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso showed that this protein was expressed zzso at high levels in zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso the Gu binding protein zzso inhibited the zzso gene zzso in zzso cells, whereas a construct expressing the zzso portion of zzso in the zzso orientation reverts the zzso zzso of zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso may account for the differential zzso responsiveness in zzso cell lines at different stages of zzso
