zzso a marker of neural stem cells, is also expressed by cells located in the zzso of the pancreatic zzso and by a zzso of zzso cells but not by zzso zzso These findings raised the possibility that the pancreatic zzso is zzso and comprised of zzso of zzso and zzso precursor zzso We examined this issue in two zzso mouse models characterized by protracted expression of several zzso properties in zzso zzso One zzso line comprises mice lacking mature zzso due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso responsible for the conversion of zzso into zzso while the second line consists of mice with a global deletion of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso expressed by zzso cells and by insulin and zzso cells of zzso of both lines of zzso In addition, the lack of zzso signaling increased zzso zzso levels in zzso of zzso zzso and adult zzso We conclude that zzso cells located in the pancreatic zzso generate the cells of the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso
