The zzso is hypothesized to be the zzso cell in zzso However, zzso cell models have been most commonly used to investigate mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso we sought to determine if differences might exist between zzso and zzso cell models relative to the zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso cells zzso in response to zzso fluid flow zzso stress zzso zzso nuclear zzso was observed in the zzso cells at 2 and 16 zzso zzso but only at 16 zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso cells released high amounts of zzso into the media at all levels of zzso zzso zzso and we observed a zzso pattern relative to the level of zzso In contrast zzso release by zzso cells was only detected during 16 and 24 zzso zzso starting at zzso and never reached the levels produced by the zzso zzso zzso added zzso was able to induce zzso nuclear zzso in all cells suggesting that the differences between the cell lines observed for zzso nuclear zzso were associated with the differences in zzso zzso To investigate a possible mechanism for the differences in zzso release by the zzso and zzso cells we examined the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression by zzso zzso cell zzso zzso levels at both 0 and zzso after zzso of zzso showed zzso increases with zzso at 4 and 24 zzso and 24-hour levels were higher than zzso zzso zzso cell zzso expression was similarly zzso however at 24-hour zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso Our data suggest significant differences in the sensitivity and zzso of the response mechanisms of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso our data support a role for zzso in zzso the zzso of zzso signaling in response to the fluid flow zzso zzso
