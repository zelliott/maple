zzso is a hormone zzso principally in the zzso zzso that has been classically associated with zzso zzso However, several lines of evidence suggest that zzso plays a role in pain zzso This paper reviews the available evidence on zzso zzso effects in animals and human zzso 

A zzso search was performed using the terms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso has been evaluated in diverse pain models, and several findings show that zzso receptors zzso pain mechanisms as zzso zzso an zzso effect at spinal and zzso levels under conditions of acute and inflammatory zzso More recently, zzso zzso has been extended to zzso pain zzso This effect agrees with the zzso of zzso receptors in thalamus, zzso zzso horn of the spinal cord, spinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso result from zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which leads to reduced zzso zzso formation and reduced zzso In addition, zzso is able to activate zzso receptors zzso to open several zzso channels and to inhibit expression of zzso and zzso zzso This hormone also zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function and acts as a free radical zzso 

zzso receptors constitute attractive targets for developing zzso drugs, and their zzso may prove to be a useful strategy to generate analgesics with a novel mechanism of zzso
