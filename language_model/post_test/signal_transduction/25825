zzso necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso plays a critical role in establishing both innate and acquired immune responses by zzso signals from the zzso zzso the zzso family, and the zzso zzso Here, we report a previously unidentified function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso T cells were dramatically zzso This enhancement is likely due to zzso zzso zzso in which zzso of the zzso zzso was enhanced and the subsequent zzso gene expression was zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms of the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso signaling was zzso in mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells to investigate the interaction between zzso and the zzso site that zzso with the zzso site present in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated upon zzso stimulation in zzso zzso cells, while a zzso zzso that zzso zzso binding but retains zzso binding zzso the zzso reduction in zzso zzso These results indicate that the binding of zzso to the zzso site of the zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso which is likely to be involved in the proper regulation of zzso zzso and zzso
