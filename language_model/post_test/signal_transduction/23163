Growing evidence has shown that zzso signaling might be a crucial factor in zzso but it remains unclear if it may function in zzso zzso under aging and zzso The purpose of this study is to examine and zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso zzso and dynamic changes of aging in zzso and zzso zzso rat models of Parkinson's disease using zzso electronic zzso western zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was abundantly and selectively identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso were densely distributed in the zzso zzso while they were less distributed in the zzso zzso where zzso zzso were zzso zzso A correlated decrease of zzso zzso and zzso was also detected during animal aging zzso While increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was found in the zzso model, dynamic zzso and zzso changes along with zzso zzso loss were demonstrated in the zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso This study has thus revealed the presence of the zzso signaling complex in zzso zzso zzso and its response to aging, zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it might contribute to zzso zzso or zzso during zzso and disease progression of Parkinson's zzso the underlying mechanism and key signaling pathways involved warrant further zzso
