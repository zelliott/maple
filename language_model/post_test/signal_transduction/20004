zzso stress caused by a variety of chemical and physical agents may lead to DNA breaks and zzso zzso Response to DNA damage depends on zzso sensor zzso and their downstream zzso which arrange cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso triggers cell cycle arrest (by keeping zzso complexes zzso combined with zzso of zzso zzso and induction of DNA repair zzso However, zzso stress activates also zzso protein zzso zzso which may control the functions of checkpoint proteins both directly, by zzso zzso or zzso by regulation of their zzso Our results indicate that in root zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso takes part in response to zzso zzso zzso It is shown that zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso but only if cell cycle checkpoints are alleviated by zzso Since zzso and, zzso caffeine reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it may be that there is a cooperation of zzso zzso signaling pathways and zzso checkpoints during response to zzso zzso
