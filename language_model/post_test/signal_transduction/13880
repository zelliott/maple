zzso zzso type 2 zzso also called zzso (the zzso A4 zzso conveys the zzso properties of zzso A4 and zzso A1 zzso and the zzso signals zzso by serum zzso protein A and zzso among zzso We tested here the hypothesis that zzso might exist as zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso (the two other family zzso and operate in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso with zzso zzso cells revealed zzso zzso of the zzso significantly, zzso but not serum zzso protein A, could activate zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso shock protein 27 signaling signature was unveiled after zzso application, leading to generation of zzso as measured in zzso (in primary zzso and in zzso (after zzso injection in the zzso The latter response was absent in mice lacking the zzso zzso Using a similar approach, zzso zzso evoked using the zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso path that was confirmed in primary zzso These findings provide a molecular mechanism that accounts for the dual nature of zzso and indicate that zzso binding and zzso state contribute to the zzso landscape of zzso
