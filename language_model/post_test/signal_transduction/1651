zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the binding and presentation of several growth factors to their zzso thereby regulating cellular growth and zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso in mouse spinal zzso we administered zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso to cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit accelerated zzso zzso closure, accompanied by suppression of zzso zzso at the median hinge point and zzso zzso at the paired zzso hinge points of the zzso zzso These effects appear specific, as they can be prevented by addition of zzso zzso to the culture zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Both zzso and zzso groups appear to be necessary for the action of zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrates a normal distribution of sonic zzso zzso in zzso zzso By contrast, patched 1 transcripts are zzso abundant in the zzso and diminished in the zzso zzso suggesting that sonic zzso zzso from the zzso may be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate a regulatory role for zzso zzso in mouse spinal zzso
