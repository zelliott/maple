zzso fluid zzso is a frequent clinical observation in diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso fluid often reveals the presence of free zzso zzso of zzso cells, giving rise to the question of the ability of zzso tumor cells to resist the loss of zzso zzso zzso as zzso and to develop new tumor zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso cells cultured under zzso conditions form well-organized zzso composed of viable cells, which progressively enter in zzso Although the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways are activated in adherent zzso cells, loss of zzso results in the zzso of these zzso By comparison, we show that the zzso zzso cells zzso enter zzso in an zzso zzso and zzso zzso The survival of zzso cells can be reversed by zzso zzso with zzso according to a zzso zzso zzso Finally, our findings show that impairment of cell zzso activates zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Our results underline the importance of zzso contacts in the zzso resistance of zzso zzso
