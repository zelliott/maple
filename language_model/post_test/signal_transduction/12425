zzso belongs to the family of zzso Ras zzso which play an important role in cell zzso survival, and zzso The zzso Ras zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso share zzso sequence zzso and activate very similar signaling zzso Only the zzso zzso regions differ zzso A growing body of literature demonstrates that each Ras zzso possesses unique functions in normal zzso processes as well as in zzso One of the central questions in the field of Ras biology is how these very similar proteins achieve such remarkable specificity in zzso interactions that regulate signal zzso zzso Here we explore specific binding of zzso to zzso Using zzso techniques and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso region of zzso contributes in a major way to the interaction with zzso while the zzso domain of zzso provides a way to control the interaction by zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso binds specifically to the zzso domain of zzso zzso with zzso zzso while the zzso zzso domain of zzso may interact with the zzso domain of zzso
