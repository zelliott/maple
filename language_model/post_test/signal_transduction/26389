Bone zzso failure is a nearly universal complication of zzso zzso The proteins zzso by zzso genes are involved in DNA damage responses through the formation of a zzso nuclear complex that zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso However, it is not known whether loss of zzso zzso zzso activity accounts for the zzso stem cell defects characteristic of zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso increases the activity and expression of zzso a key zzso factor in zzso stem zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso chain extension known to have zzso zzso Specifically, zzso modified with zzso zzso chain extension efficiently activates a zzso zzso zzso cell factor zzso We also show that zzso cells display diminished capacity to activate zzso leading to reduced zzso of zzso targets zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in normal human zzso stem and zzso cells results in fewer zzso active cells and zzso expansion of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that diminished zzso signaling may be an underlying molecular zzso in zzso zzso stem cells leading to their accelerated zzso
