In embryonic growth cartilage, Indian zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso participate in a negative feedback loop that regulates zzso zzso zzso this region zzso major structural and functional zzso To explore the organization of the zzso system in zzso growth plate, we zzso growth plates of zzso rats into their constituent zones and assessed expression of genes participating in the zzso feedback zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in regions analogous to the expression zzso in embryonic growth zzso However, zzso was expressed in resting zone cartilage, a site that differs from the embryonic source, the zzso zzso We then used mice in which zzso has replaced coding sequences of zzso and thus serves as a marker for active zzso zzso At 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age, zzso expression was detected in a pattern analogous to that of embryonic zzso The findings support the hypothesis that the embryonic zzso feedback loop is maintained in the zzso growth plate except that the source of zzso has shifted to a more zzso location in the resting zzso
