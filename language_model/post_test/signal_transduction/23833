zzso proteins have an zzso zzso domain anchored to zzso zzso by a single, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 55 zzso proteins in zzso zzso with several novel zzso including zzso which we find is required for zzso and is zzso in the nuclear zzso A total of six zzso proteins are present in the zzso outer membrane and have relatively zzso zzso segments that serve as targeting zzso The rest, by far the majority, zzso via a zzso system of zzso zzso zzso tail anchors are first inserted into the zzso zzso and additional segments within the zzso domain of each protein can dictate subsequent sorting to a precise destination within the zzso
