The aim of the present study was to investigate if there is an altered expression of zzso during organ culture of rat zzso artery segments by using a sensitive pharmacological method and molecular biological zzso zzso zzso induced contraction via zzso The contraction and zzso zzso levels were elevated during organ zzso zzso inhibitor zzso D, zzso inhibitor zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prevented the increase in zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso was significantly lower in the artery segments cultured for 1 day in the presence of specific zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso than that of the cultured zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso involves zzso and zzso signal zzso via the protein zzso C and the zzso 1/2 zzso
