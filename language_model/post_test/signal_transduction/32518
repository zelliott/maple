zzso cells do not only respond to an zzso with a simple rise in zzso It is now clear that complex patterns of zzso zzso in terms of space and time are observed in many cell types and that these patterns may be a cellular mechanism for the regulation of different zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso promotes the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso It has been shown that at high zzso of zzso zzso or zzso the zzso response is initiated in the zzso pole of the cell before spreading across the whole zzso This site of initiation of the zzso zzso is in the region where zzso release of zzso occurs and is also the site of a zzso zzso channel thought to be zzso important for fluid zzso Lower zzso of zzso elicit zzso zzso with complex repetitive patterns characteristic of each zzso At zzso zzso zzso we have recently described repetitive zzso zzso spikes that are zzso restricted to the zzso pole of the zzso In addition to these zzso zzso also promotes slow transient zzso rises that result in a global rise in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in all of these various zzso responses, most of which can be reproduced by the infusion of zzso into the zzso The high zzso of the zzso pole is zzso to be due to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso We speculate that in response to zzso the zzso spikes elicit zzso from a small zzso zzso of zzso and that the broader zzso induce both zzso and cell changes that involve movement of zzso into this zzso zzso
