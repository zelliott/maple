zzso radiation zzso zzso instability, transmitted over many generations through the progeny of surviving zzso It is zzso as the expression of delayed effects such as delayed cell death, delayed zzso instability and delayed zzso zzso zzso instability exerts its delayed effects for prolonged periods of time, suggesting the presence of a mechanism by which the initial DNA damage in the surviving cells is zzso Our recent studies have shown that transmitted memory causes delayed DNA zzso which in turn activates DNA damage checkpoint, and is involved in delayed manifestation of zzso zzso Although the zzso involved in DNA damage memory remain to be determined, we suggest that zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso structure, which can be transmitted many generations through the zzso and is involved in initiation and perpetuation of zzso zzso The possible involvement of delayed zzso of a DNA damage checkpoint in the delayed induction of zzso instability in bystander cells is also zzso
