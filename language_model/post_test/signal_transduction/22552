All cells are unavoidably exposed to chemicals that can zzso DNA to form zzso zzso Among the various DNA zzso formed, zzso zzso can be highly zzso and we recently demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically initiate zzso in zzso zzso Here we show, in both zzso and human cells, that the zzso branch of the DNA mismatch repair zzso (but not the zzso zzso is absolutely required for signaling the initiation of zzso in response to zzso and is partially required for signaling zzso in response to zzso Further, zzso zzso signal the stabilization of the zzso tumor zzso and such signaling is also zzso Despite this, zzso zzso can be executed in a zzso zzso DNA mismatch repair status did not influence the response of cells to other zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, it appears that mismatch repair status, rather than zzso status, is a strong indicator of the zzso of cells to zzso zzso This experimental system will allow dissection of the signal zzso events that couple a specific type of DNA base zzso with the final outcome of zzso cell zzso
