zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso can be engaged for zzso signaling either by zzso or by binding zzso zzso These signaling mechanisms require zzso to associate with two distinct zzso zzso zzso and complement zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso anchor, suggesting that it is concentrated within zzso zzso or zzso zzso This study was undertaken to determine the extent to which zzso signaling is zzso to zzso zzso Human zzso zzso was zzso or zzso with zzso after zzso with the zzso zzso agents, zzso or zzso zzso Both agents suppressed increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso but did not affect zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso were separated into zzso raft and zzso zzso revealing the presence of zzso and zzso but the virtual absence of zzso alpha chain in zzso zzso either zzso or in response to zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed close proximity of a zzso raft marker to both zzso and zzso but not zzso We conclude that zzso can engage distinct signaling pathways involving different partner proteins that are functionally and physically zzso from one another in both zzso raft and zzso zzso of the plasma zzso
