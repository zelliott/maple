In the zzso period, zzso zzso cells express a set of the maturation gene battery in an zzso manner and establish synaptic function in the zzso zzso Using primary cultures combined with specific zzso of signaling zzso the present investigation revealed that the expression of the maturation zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled by zzso unified signaling mechanisms that operate zzso through stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels zzso Na channel type II zzso and zzso zzso zzso This signaling then zzso the zzso zzso gene 1 zzso zzso factor of the zzso family in an zzso zzso zzso with the culture study, the zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso the maturation genes in a zzso regulated zzso This zzso as revealed by the zzso zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso motifs present in the promoter zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by DNA zzso in the developing zzso prevents the zzso of the maturation genes but has no effects on preceding zzso processes occurring in the zzso zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso gene regulation in the terminal maturation program and specifies the identity of zzso zzso zzso
