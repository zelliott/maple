zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential to induce T cell commitment and to suppress B cell development from zzso zzso zzso zzso competition for zzso is critically regulated by zzso Fringe zzso which zzso zzso growth factor repeats in the zzso zzso domain to enhance binding zzso for DL zzso zzso zzso is also essential for the process of zzso which drives zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso precursors to zzso and generate a large pool of zzso zzso zzso We have used several genetic approaches to determine the importance of zzso interactions in regulating competition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for DL zzso in zzso Surprisingly, although zzso zzso enhanced zzso binding by zzso zzso zzso it did not zzso them with a competitive advantage in mixed zzso In contrast, zzso zzso enhanced competition of zzso zzso precursors for DL zzso zzso modification of zzso in the zzso zzso domain contributed to but was not solely responsible for the zzso effects of zzso zzso Although previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso zzso compete poorly for DL zzso zzso zzso did not fully restore zzso zzso pools from zzso cells with zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso and zzso signaling have largely zzso functions in zzso zzso our data reveal that zzso enhances zzso precursor competition for zzso DL zzso to maximize zzso zzso expansion during the earliest stage of zzso
