In an attempt to demonstrate the linkage between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling and the activity of the systemic or local zzso system in zzso we produced transgenic mice harboring zzso zzso promoter containing the zzso or zzso zzso target site zzso fused to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was dependent upon zzso of zzso as administration of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso the zzso promoter activity and abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso level in the zzso Administration of zzso II zzso to the mice resulted in prominent expression of zzso in the liver and heart of animals containing wild type zzso but not in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling caused zzso of zzso proteins in the liver zzso the pattern of which was distinct from that in the heart zzso The zzso expression of zzso promoter appears to be zzso by physical association of zzso with zzso zzso in liver and zzso 3 and zzso zzso in zzso Taken together, these results point to the differences in signaling mechanisms in the circulating and localized zzso system and identify at least two molecular steps, the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso interaction, as pivotal in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
