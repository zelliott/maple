zzso of the zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso on mouse zzso zzso cells zzso and on zzso zzso cells zzso from zzso mice was examined by zzso with specific zzso and was evaluated by flow zzso zzso were shown to express both zzso and zzso whereas zzso DC expressed only zzso The contribution of these zzso molecules to zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso clones was investigated in zzso blocking zzso At optimal doses, zzso or zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso proliferation induced by either zzso or zzso zzso also zzso zzso proliferation induced by zzso but only moderately reduced zzso proliferation induced by zzso zzso in these experiments was specific, since zzso control zzso against other zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso or DC zzso had no effect on zzso zzso In marked zzso the capacity of zzso to present zzso to our zzso clones was resistant to treatment with the same zzso against zzso zzso or zzso We conclude that interactions between zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso DC with their respective zzso on our zzso clones are required for optimal presentation of protein zzso to zzso Our results also indicate that neither zzso nor zzso is required for the analogous zzso of our zzso clones by zzso
