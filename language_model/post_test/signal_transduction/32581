zzso in bone is complex in nature, being influenced by many zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso It has been zzso that zzso zzso resident cells in bone, zzso signals of mechanical loading that result in anabolic responses such as the expression of zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso To date, however, neither the actual stimuli to which zzso respond nor the pathways of signal zzso are well zzso zzso primary rat bone cells exhibit distinct responses to stretching depending on their zzso zzso young zzso that become progressively zzso show striking responses to strain at zzso zzso these include an early response of zzso zzso and the late responses such as the production of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso levels of their zzso is zzso being preceded by two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Compared to a typical transient immediate early expression of zzso zzso shows another distinct peak about 8 h after the initiation of zzso Second zzso in zzso and zzso expression are entirely dependent on the first wave of zzso expression judging from the zzso by zzso zzso is perhaps critically involved in the prolonged anabolic responses of bone zzso zzso to the zzso mechanical zzso In these cells, the zzso zzso is essential to their response to zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso channels, zzso zzso and of zzso Na channels, zzso in combination abolish the effects of stretching such as elevated zzso zzso Although zzso or zzso calcium channels or zzso mechanisms, such as a zzso zzso for example, are zzso particulars of secondary zzso entry pathways are not certain at this zzso It is zzso however, that the calcium zzso both primary and secondary, trigger the anabolic reaction of bone to stretching via zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso
