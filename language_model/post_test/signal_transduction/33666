zzso is a zzso protein that zzso zzso signaling and plays essential roles in zzso zzso including head zzso skeletal development, and limb zzso zzso is also implicated in zzso arthritis, and cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these zzso zzso is a high affinity zzso zzso for zzso which is a zzso zzso that acts together with the zzso zzso zzso to initiate zzso signal zzso Two different models have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso One model suggests that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that zzso interaction with zzso promotes zzso zzso and degradation, thereby reducing the cell surface zzso zzso To clarify the molecular basis of zzso action, we examined how zzso affects the zzso zzso in several zzso cell lines including mouse embryonic zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso signaling but zzso neither zzso zzso from the cell surface nor reduction of total zzso protein level and that zzso has no effect on the rate of continuous zzso of zzso and the zzso (about zzso zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso is independent of zzso zzso and zzso
