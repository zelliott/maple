The zzso signaling zzso regulates a variety of biological zzso including zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso and prognosis of many human zzso We studied the function and zzso significance of zzso and zzso growth factor protein expression in patients with classical Hodgkin's zzso 

zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor, were determined by zzso zzso values were defined in zzso of German and Dutch patients with classical Hodgkin's zzso zzso studies were performed on Hodgkin's zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso was detected in the tumor cells of zzso zzso of the patients and expression of its zzso zzso growth factor, in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression correlated with a zzso freedom from tumor progression of zzso whereas lack of expression correlated with a zzso freedom from tumor progression of zzso zzso in the combined zzso In zzso analysis both zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and stage zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso for freedom from tumor zzso In functional studies zzso with zzso growth factor did not affect cell growth, while the zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed cell growth by inducing zzso cell cycle zzso 

Although functional studies showed an zzso role of the zzso growth zzso signaling zzso in cell cycle zzso expression of zzso in tumor cells from patients with classical Hodgkin's zzso strongly correlated with a favorable prognosis in two independent zzso
