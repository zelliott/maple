Indian zzso zzso has been reported to stimulate zzso ex zzso In this study we studied the consequences of loss of function of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso has no essential role in primitive zzso but it is required in a non cell autonomous fashion for definitive zzso Many components of the zzso signaling zzso are present in the fetal liver, with zzso and zzso being most highly expressed in the zzso and zzso being most highly expressed in zzso stem and zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso cell populations are produced in normal numbers in zzso and respond normally to zzso zzso in zzso but terminal zzso differentiation is defective leading to fatal anemia in mid gestation in many zzso knockout zzso These zzso studies are consistent with previous zzso studies which show zzso can induce blood from zzso or expand zzso in zzso zzso
