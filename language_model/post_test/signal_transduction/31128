zzso zzso is a membrane protein whose function in zzso zzso signal zzso has been zzso among zzso and whose malfunction has been implicated in human zzso zzso analysis has shown that zzso zzso regulates zzso signal zzso but its activity and structure are not zzso We investigated the functional and structural properties of zzso zzso and its zzso domain zzso 183 zzso that are predicted to reside in the zzso Our results show that zzso as well as truncated zzso deleted of its zzso forms a stable zzso This observation is consistent with the proposal that zzso is structurally similar to zzso zzso The zzso itself zzso and is required for both zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso forms of the zzso one that zzso zzso and the other that zzso the target sequence of the zzso zzso zzso stabilize zzso but do not prevent zzso and zzso of zzso zzso deleted of its zzso is stable and zzso to the plasma zzso These data show that degradation of zzso is regulated at a step subsequent to zzso although zzso is a likely zzso We also show that the zzso of mouse zzso regulates zzso
