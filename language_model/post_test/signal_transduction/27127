zzso zzso recordings from rat zzso zzso nerve zzso were made in order to characterize the responses of different populations of zzso zzso the small zzso to intravenous zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso nerve zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had low spontaneous discharge zzso zzso zzso impulses zzso and showed a zzso increase in firing at the peak of the response to 50 zzso zzso with the overall response lasting several zzso The onset of the response occurred after a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso administration of zzso which zzso largely to the circulation delay in these zzso The threshold dose of zzso was zzso 5 zzso zzso The response to 100 zzso zzso was completely abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso and by chronic zzso zzso performed 10-14 days prior to zzso indicating that zzso sensitivity was via zzso receptors and exclusively zzso via zzso zzso rather than zzso or enteric zzso zzso Evidence that zzso zzso had zzso receptive fields was indicated by the lack of any response to zzso zzso and the sensitivity of the zzso response to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso responded to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in a slowly adapting zzso The response to acid was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso but not zzso by zzso at a time when the response to zzso zzso had been completely zzso zzso The exquisite sensitivity of some zzso zzso zzso to zzso suggests that they may play a zzso role in the zzso and zzso consequences of zzso release from the small zzso possibly acting in a zzso zzso However, this sensitivity to zzso represents only one aspect of the broad zzso of these zzso zzso and is not an obligatory component of the signal zzso zzso
