zzso patch clamp experiments were used to investigate the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso receptors in modulating zzso zzso currents in rat zzso brain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso but not the zzso acid zzso current in a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso of zzso receptors were used to identify zzso zzso cells as typical medium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso but not the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso or zzso - zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso zzso The zzso C inhibitor zzso but not the inactive structural analogue zzso also zzso with zzso zzso The zzso of protein zzso C by zzso zzso zzso or the blockade of this zzso by zzso did not alter the effect of zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso 1, zzso zzso and a more efficient zzso of zzso zzso by zzso instead of zzso in the zzso solution, abolished the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso B which enhances zzso zzso also prevented the effect of zzso zzso the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso and zzso but not the inactive structural analogue zzso were also zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso mechanism of zzso receptors to inhibit zzso zzso channels is the zzso zzso and zzso zzso II zzso The zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso C pathways do not appear to be zzso
