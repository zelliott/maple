Although zzso is known to exhibit zzso and zzso activities, very little is known about its mechanism of zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso mediates its effects through interference with the zzso zzso As examined by the DNA binding of zzso we found that zzso suppressed tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso induced by various inflammatory agents and zzso Further studies showed that zzso blocked the zzso and degradation of zzso alpha through the zzso of zzso of zzso alpha zzso and zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso reporter activity induced by zzso zzso zzso death domain, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso but not that induced by zzso zzso We also found that zzso inhibited the expression of zzso gene products involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation zzso D1 and zzso and invasion zzso and zzso This correlated with enhancement of the zzso induced by zzso and the zzso agent zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso cellular zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso and zzso activities previously assigned to zzso may be zzso in part through the suppression of the zzso zzso zzso
