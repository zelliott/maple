zzso peptides and zzso exert their effects via G zzso receptors zzso It has been shown that, in addition to zzso factors, some zzso are able to activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, thus leading to cell zzso The aim of this study was to test whether zzso of zzso receptors has protective effects on serum zzso cell death and to study the possible implication of zzso zzso in this zzso In zzso zzso cells fully differentiated by exposure to zzso acid for five days, the zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted cell survival after serum deprivation zzso and zzso blue exclusion zzso without inducing cell zzso These effects were fully reversed by zzso by the selective zzso zzso zzso and also by the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effect was also abolished by zzso and by zzso In mouse primary cortical zzso zzso reduced the percentage of zzso after 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of serum zzso as determined by zzso zzso This effect was blocked by zzso by zzso with zzso toxin and by zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso in this primary zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that stimulation of the zzso zzso promotes zzso survival in a zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade and suggest that zzso may be a key downstream zzso involved in this zzso zzso
