zzso zzso and zzso forming the zzso protein family, act as molecular zzso between zzso filaments and proteins anchored in the cell zzso By participating in a complex zzso network of signal zzso zzso zzso proteins play a key role in the regulation of zzso and polarity of normal cells through interactions with membrane zzso zzso zzso Dynamic zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso zzso are involved, lead to the formation of zzso structures, such as zzso and zzso which are responsible for cellular zzso The interactions of zzso proteins with active zzso zzso cause the acquisition of zzso cellular features by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso protein activity is regulated by zzso reactions and linking zzso The model of zzso based on the molecular zzso changes by breaking the zzso bonds and exposing zzso binding sites is essential for the proper functioning of the zzso zzso Additionally, the connection types between the zzso and membrane proteins zzso or indirect by zzso and zzso play an important role in zzso of signals from the zzso zzso Due to the wide range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso features, detailed exploration of the zzso zzso will provide a series of answers to questions about ambiguous functions in many zzso signal zzso zzso
