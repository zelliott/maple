zzso zzso are unique zzso zzso with zzso potential that develop in the zzso head zzso next to the neural zzso They contribute to the paired sensory zzso and the zzso sensory zzso generating a wide variety of cell types ranging from lens zzso to sensory zzso cells and zzso Although progress has been made in recent years to identify the molecular players that mediate zzso zzso induction and zzso the processes that initiate zzso development are not well zzso One hypothesis suggests that all zzso precursors arise from a common territory, the zzso region, which is then subdivided to generate zzso of specific zzso This model implies that their induction begins through molecular and cellular mechanisms common to all zzso zzso and molecular evidence suggests that zzso induction is a zzso process and that the molecular networks establishing the zzso domain as well as the acquisition of zzso identity are surprisingly similar to those used in zzso to specify sensory zzso
