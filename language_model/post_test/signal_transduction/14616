Growth plate zzso undergo a tightly regulated process of zzso allowing for the zzso growth of zzso Although it is known that zzso hormone related protein zzso and Indian zzso regulate the differentiation of growth plate zzso how these pathways interact to regulate zzso development is not fully zzso We examined how the interaction between zzso and the zzso activated zzso factors, zzso and zzso regulates growth plate zzso differentiation and zzso Analysis of fetal limbs showed that zzso is a negative regulator and zzso a positive regulator of type X collagen zzso zzso zzso cultures showed that zzso treatment inhibited type X collagen expression and increased zzso zzso This effect was substantially enhanced in zzso zzso was blocked in zzso zzso and was only partially inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso in cell cultures, and regulated the level of the zzso form of zzso in a zzso dependent zzso These results show that zzso regulates growth plate zzso proliferation and differentiation in part through the activity of zzso suggesting a crucial role for zzso in growth plate zzso zzso
