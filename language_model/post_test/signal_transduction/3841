zzso G proteins zzso zzso conduct signals from membrane receptors zzso zzso to regulatory proteins localized to various cellular zzso They are in excess over any G zzso zzso type on the cell zzso which is necessary for signal zzso These facts account for the large number of G protein molecules bound to membrane zzso Thus, the zzso interactions are crucial for their cellular zzso and consequently for signal zzso In this work, the binding of G protein zzso to model zzso zzso formed with defined membrane zzso has been zzso It is shown that although G protein zzso were able to bind to zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso enhanced their binding to model zzso This mechanism also appears to be used by other zzso and functionally zzso peripheral zzso such as protein zzso C and the insect protein zzso III, indicating that it could constitute a general mode of zzso zzso relevant in the activity and zzso of some peripheral zzso proteins from soluble to particulate zzso Other factors, such as the presence of cholesterol or the zzso surface charge, also modulated the binding of the G protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso the binding of G zzso zzso zzso 2 and the G protein zzso to zzso was not increased by zzso prone zzso Their distinct interactions with membrane lipids may, in part, explain the different cellular zzso of all of these proteins during the signaling zzso
