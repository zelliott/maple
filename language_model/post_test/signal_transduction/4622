zzso is a zzso zzso zzso originally found to have roles in zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have indicated that zzso also zzso in the development of zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell proliferation and tumor zzso Here we have explored the functions and molecular mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso The suppression of zzso expression in zzso cell lines significantly reduced cell proliferation and zzso and increased serum zzso zzso Using tandem affinity zzso combined with protein identification by mass zzso we found that zzso zzso interacts with zzso and that it mediates zzso effects as well as zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso induced by zzso Interestingly, zzso acted as an inhibitor of cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso cells, and high zzso of zzso reduced cell zzso The negative effects of zzso on proliferation were zzso by zzso Analysis of more than 400 primary tumors from The Cancer Genome zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso is significantly zzso in zzso and that the reduced expression is linked to poor patient survival zzso The expression of zzso zzso is increased in glioblastoma, and it predicts poor patient survival zzso Current results illustrate a novel mechanism for zzso zzso where zzso cells reduce zzso expression to decrease its zzso zzso In zzso the expression of zzso zzso is zzso to sensitize the cells to low zzso of zzso for maintaining cell zzso
