The objective of this study was to determine how increasing the zzso zzso content would affect the zzso ability to take up and metabolize zzso 

During the first 4 h of the study, liver zzso deposition was zzso by zzso zzso infusion in the presence of zzso This was followed by a zzso zzso control period, during which the zzso infusion was stopped, and a zzso experimental period in which net zzso zzso zzso zzso and disposition zzso zzso and zzso were measured in the absence of zzso but in the presence of a zzso challenge including portal vein zzso zzso 

zzso infusion increased net zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso causing a large difference in zzso zzso content (62 zzso 9 zzso 100 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion zzso did not alter zzso but it reduced the percent of zzso directed to zzso (79 zzso 4 zzso 55 zzso 6; P zzso zzso and increased the percent directed to zzso (12 zzso 3 zzso 29 zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (9 zzso 3 zzso 16 zzso 3; P zzso zzso This change was associated with increased zzso protein zzso zzso diminished insulin zzso and a shift in zzso zzso activity toward a state discouraging zzso zzso 

These data indicate that increases in zzso zzso can generate a state of zzso insulin resistance, which is characterized by impaired zzso synthesis despite preserved zzso
