zzso is the most abundant zzso in the brain, but its regulators are essentially zzso In zzso zzso is obligatory in zzso the zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso ON zzso To identify the zzso of zzso we conducted a zzso zzso screen with zzso active zzso as a zzso The screen frequently identified a regulator of zzso signaling zzso zzso the interaction of which we confirmed by zzso with zzso in zzso cells and in zzso zzso localized to the zzso tips of ON bipolar zzso along with zzso and zzso When zzso was zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel, it accelerated the zzso of the channel response to zzso in a zzso zzso Because light onset suppresses zzso release from zzso onto the ON bipolar zzso zzso should accelerate the rising phase of the light response of the ON bipolar zzso This would tend to match its zzso to that of the OFF bipolar that arises directly from zzso zzso
