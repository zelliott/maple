zzso and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration zzso The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be zzso by the complexity of the acquired immune system of zzso zzso zzso zzso innate immunity is zzso and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic zzso The goals of this study were to zzso fundamental immune processes in zzso affected by zzso and to measure zzso responses zzso Five zzso each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle zzso orbit altitude of zzso zzso for 12 days and zzso zzso A new generation of flies was reared in zzso In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing zzso number and activity in zzso In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso of selected genes following infection with zzso zzso The zzso levels of relevant immune zzso genes were determined in both larvae and adults by zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to zzso zzso coli in culture was attenuated following zzso and in zzso the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was zzso In addition, the level of zzso expression of pattern recognition receptors and zzso that specifically recognize bacteria, and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and immune stress zzso hallmarks of zzso zzso were also reduced in zzso In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in zzso following a systemic infection with zzso coli zzso remained zzso We show that zzso altered both cellular and zzso immune responses in zzso and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting zzso
