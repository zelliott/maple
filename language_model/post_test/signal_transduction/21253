It is well known that vascular smooth muscle tone can be modulated by signals arising in the zzso zzso zzso relaxing factor, zzso zzso factor, and zzso Here we show that during zzso a signal can originate in smooth muscle cells and act on the zzso to cause synthesis of zzso relaxing zzso We studied responses to two zzso zzso and zzso that act by initiating a rise in smooth muscle cell zzso zzso concentration zzso and exert little or no direct effect on the zzso zzso was used as a zzso indicator in either smooth muscle or zzso cells of zzso from the zzso cheek zzso zzso and zzso caused the expected rise in smooth muscle cell zzso that was accompanied by an zzso in zzso cell zzso The rise in zzso cell zzso was followed by increased synthesis of zzso as evidenced by an enhancement of the zzso induced by both agents after blockade of NO zzso The zzso involved in signal transmission from smooth muscle to zzso is as yet zzso However, given that zzso cell junctions are frequent in these vessels, we zzso that the rise in smooth muscle cell zzso generates a diffusion zzso that drives zzso through zzso cell junctions and into the zzso cells, thereby initiating the synthesis of zzso
