Male zzso mice, unlike female zzso develop a severe early onset zzso disease that has been linked to an intrinsic B cell zzso In investigating this B cell zzso the present study showed that male, but not female, zzso contained a higher percentage of large, activated zzso B cells that were more responsive to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the large B cells from the male mice was also observed in the absence of zzso zzso or any other zzso In examining the mechanism of the B cell hyperactivity, it was found that zzso of zzso large B cells from male mice, unlike large B cells from female mice, expressed zzso zzso zzso a zzso normally expressed on activated zzso zzso The percentage of large B cells from the male zzso that expressed zzso was increased to zzso by stimulation with zzso A functional role for zzso expression on B cells was confirmed by showing that zzso blocked the spontaneous proliferation of the large B cells from male zzso In addition, the zzso capacity of the large B cells from the male mice was demonstrated by their ability to induce DNA synthesis in small B cells in a zzso zzso These results demonstrated that large B cells from male zzso expressed functionally active zzso It is likely that the B cell zzso expression and increased zzso to zzso signaling due to an intrinsic B cell zzso promotes zzso disease in zzso zzso
