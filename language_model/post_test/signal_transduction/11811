zzso is a major zzso compound found in red wine at a much higher concentration than the zzso zzso In this study, we examined potential zzso effects and found that compared to zzso zzso more zzso zzso zzso invasion and migration in zzso human zzso cells, an effect likely zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We then measured zzso zzso to investigate whether the decreased zzso zzso was attributable to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso at equivalent zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso and was a more potent inhibitor of zzso activity than zzso An ex zzso binding zzso further revealed that zzso directly binds to zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is a molecular target of zzso for the zzso of zzso invasion and migration of zzso zzso
