The substantial importance of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso trafficking has continued to emerge beyond its initial identification as a zzso zzso zzso seemed to be a relatively simple zzso with an zzso zzso domain extended as a flexible rod, zzso consistent with its primary role in zzso zzso to zzso zzso The rolling interaction between zzso and zzso zzso by this zzso interaction requires zzso zzso extensions on specific zzso zzso acid zzso In some cells, such as zzso the zzso involved in formation of the zzso are zzso zzso while in other cells, such as T cells, they are expressed only after appropriate zzso Thus, zzso supports zzso recruitment in both innate and zzso arms of the immune zzso A complex array of zzso acids within the zzso engage multiple sugar zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso and provide the molecular interactions responsible for the zzso catch bonds that support zzso zzso Such binding of zzso can also induce signaling events that influence cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso has revealed a better understanding of how it performs as a zzso zzso and yielded unexpected insights that extend its scope from supporting zzso rolling in inflammatory settings to zzso including stem cell zzso to the zzso and mature zzso zzso to secondary zzso zzso zzso has been found to bind zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to support the zzso response to these zzso Surprisingly, the zzso modifications of zzso that support rolling zzso by zzso in inflammatory conditions interfere with zzso binding to zzso zzso and thereby limit responsiveness to the zzso cues used in steady state zzso zzso The zzso influence of zzso on cell traffic in both inflammatory and steady state settings is therefore substantially determined by the orchestrated addition of zzso However, central as specific zzso is to zzso function, in zzso regulation of zzso zzso in T cells remains poorly zzso It is our purpose zzso to review what is known, and not known, of zzso zzso and to update understanding of zzso functional zzso
