zzso zzso is expressed in zzso throughout the central nervous system, particularly at the zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso analysis of transgenic mice lacking zzso has provided compelling evidence for involvement of zzso in cerebral water balance, zzso migration, and neural signal zzso zzso mice have reduced brain swelling and improved neurological outcome in models of zzso zzso cerebral zzso including water zzso focal cerebral zzso and bacterial zzso However, brain swelling and clinical outcome are worse in zzso mice in models of zzso zzso zzso zzso including cortical zzso brain zzso brain zzso and zzso probably due to impaired zzso brain water zzso zzso zzso or zzso slows zzso migration in response to a zzso stimulus in zzso and zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso progression following injury in zzso zzso mice also manifest reduced zzso and zzso zzso and increased threshold and prolonged duration of induced zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso may account for the neural signal zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose zzso of zzso expression or function as a novel therapeutic strategy for a variety of cerebral disorders including stroke, zzso infection, zzso zzso and traumatic brain zzso
