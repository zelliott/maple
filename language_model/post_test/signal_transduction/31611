The purpose of this research was to investigate the role of zzso zzso in human prostate zzso We found that expression of zzso was significantly elevated in zzso zzso cells in comparison with that in their zzso counterparts, zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected in other human prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and, by zzso analysis, was detected in zzso zzso of zzso of surgical specimens of human prostate zzso zzso expression of zzso by small interfering zzso inhibited growth of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso promoted zzso growth of zzso cells induced by zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity regardless of the presence or absence of zzso and zzso the promoters of zzso target zzso These effects of zzso could be attenuated by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and were enhanced by zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso was elevated in zzso cells zzso zzso which could be blocked by zzso zzso Finally, we zzso that the zzso domain of zzso was responsible for zzso of zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso of zzso through the zzso pathway, inappropriately activates zzso signaling axis and stimulates cell growth in prostate cancer zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in prostate cancer development and zzso
