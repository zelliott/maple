Mechanical loading zzso both nuclear distortion and zzso in gene expression in a variety of cell zzso zzso is the process by which zzso mechanical forces can activate a number of well-studied zzso signaling zzso Inevitably, such signals are zzso to the nucleus and induce zzso zzso changes in gene zzso However, gene expression also can be regulated through zzso in nuclear architecture, providing direct control of zzso zzso One putative zzso mechanism for this phenomenon involves zzso in nuclear architecture that result from the mechanical zzso of the zzso This zzso is associated with direct mechanical strain or zzso stress, which is transferred to the zzso This review describes the current state of knowledge relating the nuclear architecture and the transfer of mechanical forces to the nucleus zzso by the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the nucleus zzso zzso in nuclear zzso which may be associated with cell zzso These phenomena are discussed in relation to the potential influence of nuclear zzso zzso of zzso and cell zzso
