As a model system to study protein traffic in polarized zzso cells, we have used the zzso zzso zzso This zzso travels first to the zzso surface, where it can bind zzso zzso or zzso The zzso is then zzso and delivered to zzso The zzso is sorted into zzso zzso which are zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso domain of the zzso contains several sorting zzso The 17 zzso closest to the membrane are an autonomous signal that is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso For rapid zzso there are two independent signals, both of which contain critical zzso zzso Finally, zzso is signaled by zzso of a particular zzso
