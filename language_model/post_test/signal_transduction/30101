zzso acid zzso and its derivatives are zzso signaling molecules in plant defense and development, but the site of their zzso within plant tissue is entirely zzso To address the question whether applied zzso accumulates zzso or zzso leaves of tomato and barley were fed with zzso zzso and the label was localized in zzso and zzso leaf zzso by zzso In tomato the zzso was zzso within the zzso but no label was found within the zzso zzso By contrast, in barley leaf zzso zzso was detected within the zzso cells suggesting a cellular zzso of zzso applied zzso zzso applied to leaves of both plants as in the labeling experiments, led in all leaf cells to the expression of zzso genes indicating that the perception is completed by zzso signal zzso
