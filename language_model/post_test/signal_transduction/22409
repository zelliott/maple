zzso zzso of breast zzso are characterized by zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso protein and associated gene amplification, and the zzso zzso zzso is believed to play a critical role in the zzso of these zzso The development and zzso of zzso a humanized zzso zzso against the zzso domain of zzso zzso has significantly improved treatment outcomes in patients with zzso breast zzso However, despite this clinical zzso zzso needs for better prediction of zzso response and overcoming primary and acquired resistance zzso In this review, we discuss several potential mechanisms of resistance to zzso that have been closely studied over the last zzso Briefly, these mechanisms include: impaired access of zzso to zzso by expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso alternative signaling from zzso growth zzso zzso other zzso growth factor zzso family members, or zzso zzso downstream signaling caused by loss of zzso and zzso zzso deleted from zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso zzso In addition, we discuss potential strategies for overcoming resistance to zzso Specifically, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partially overcame zzso resistance in a clinical setting, so its efficacy results and limited data regarding potential mechanisms of resistance to the drug are also zzso
