zzso a novel zzso human zzso expressed and zzso in zzso coli with an additional zzso acid sequence forming another zzso structure, was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China zzso in 2005 for the treatment of zzso lung zzso However, the molecular mechanism of its potent zzso activity remains poorly understood and warrants further zzso In this study, we examined the zzso activities of zzso in zzso The results showed that zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso It could inhibit the wound healing migration of zzso cells and invasion of zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso decreased the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso could also inhibit the expressions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso exerted an zzso effect on the zzso of zzso zzso these data provided a molecular basis for the zzso effects of zzso
