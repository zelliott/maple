zzso degradation is a central component of the protein quality control zzso Here we show that efficient zzso in zzso coli requires the active zzso zzso zzso zzso of this pathway, leading to depletion of zzso zzso results in temperature sensitivity and reduced rate of zzso zzso The effect on zzso is general, as can be seen from the slowing down of the degradation of unstable zzso including zzso zzso In addition, reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso brings about an increase in the levels of protein zzso which contain a wide range of zzso as expected if a broad spectrum of zzso are zzso Additional outcomes of zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the transcript levels of heat shock genes and increased zzso In zzso coli the zzso zzso zzso is the only source of zzso zzso which is a key zzso compound involved in major cellular zzso In this communication we present evidence for the general role of the zzso zzso zzso in protein zzso
