zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells has been documented by many zzso Our present interest is in the growth control exerted by these zzso The mechanisms involved in zzso zzso growth regulation are not known and investigations using existing cell lines are complicated by the zzso expression of numerous different zzso as well as by the fact that these cell lines are cultured in serum that contains naturally occurring zzso for these zzso To study the zzso induced growth response of cells zzso with either zzso or zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso we have developed new zzso cell lines derived from zzso mouse zzso zzso These new cell lines, designated with the zzso zzso can be cultured zzso in zzso zzso zzso insulin is the only zzso growth factor added to the culture medium of zzso zzso cell lines, and their proliferation can be stopped and started by the respective removal or addition of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were used to activate the corresponding zzso and zzso receptors over periods extending to 6 zzso We observed distinct patterns of zzso zzso growth regulation in zzso cultures, but not in zzso zzso At zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso cells by zzso with respect to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso production as well as growth zzso are zzso toxin sensitive indicating that the zzso expressed zzso receptors demonstrate classical zzso zzso zzso The presence of 1 zzso zzso stimulates growth of zzso zzso expressing cells by approximately zzso with respect to normal zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso cells form colonies in soft zzso indicating that they retain zzso growth zzso These cell lines provide a simple system that could be used as a tool for probing the complex molecular mechanisms associated with zzso zzso growth zzso
