zzso sorting in zzso cells is the major event that drive the onset and the maintenance of the functional cell zzso A lot of zzso steps are involved in protein sorting and zzso Recent data describing the last results obtained in this field will be reviewed in the first part of this zzso zzso signals zzso by proteins to specify their destination are thought to be the driven force to sort given protein in a given zzso The zzso targeting signals so far identified are known for several years and are of the same nature, whereas zzso targeting signals are still discussed and are of diverse molecular zzso zzso zzso IV zzso zzso targeting signals have not been described so far and it will be interesting to study these signals, since the protein reach the zzso membrane of zzso cells through different pathways that strongly depend on the cell type zzso These different pathways result in zzso IV membrane zzso that may explain the zzso properties of zzso IV such as zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso capture and transport of circulating zzso We have undertaken the study of zzso IV molecular targeting signals and we will described here how the zzso domain and the zzso of the zzso may be involved in zzso IV zzso zzso with a special reference to the cell type zzso
