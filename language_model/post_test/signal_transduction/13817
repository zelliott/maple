zzso acid zzso signal zzso during zzso seed development and zzso requires a Group A zzso zzso factor zzso by zzso zzso zzso In addition to the basic zzso zzso DNA binding domain, Group A zzso are characterized by three zzso zzso regions zzso C2 and zzso and one zzso zzso region zzso These zzso regions are considered to play roles in zzso zzso however, except for the zzso site, the importance of the highly zzso zzso acids is zzso Here, we report a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes an intact zzso protein with one zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso plants showed zzso zzso during zzso and could zzso on medium containing 175 zzso zzso or 500 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso late zzso abundant zzso proteins and directly targeted by zzso zzso expressed at very low levels in zzso plants compared with the wild zzso In zzso the zzso protein exhibited greatly reduced interaction with zzso compared with zzso These data suggest that zzso in zzso contributes to the function of zzso via its interaction with zzso
