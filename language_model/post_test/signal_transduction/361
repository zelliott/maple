The zzso class of zzso regulates division and differentiation of plant zzso They are perceived and signaled by a zzso mechanism similar to those observed in zzso Research into the components of zzso had previously been marred by genetic zzso However, recent studies have addressed this with the creation of zzso zzso In addition, several new elements regulating zzso signaling have been zzso This has uncovered many roles in diverse zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we look at these processes specifically in the context of root zzso We focus on the formation and maintenance of the root zzso zzso primary and secondary vascular development, lateral root emergence and development, and root zzso We believe that the root is an ideal organ with which to investigate zzso signaling in a wider zzso
