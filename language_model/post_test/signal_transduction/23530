The study was done to identify the candidate zzso single zzso zzso zzso and candidate zzso mechanisms that contribute to Parkinson's disease zzso zzso and to generate a zzso to zzso to zzso hypothesis using an zzso zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso association study zzso zzso data of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cases and zzso zzso zzso candidate zzso zzso and Pathways zzso analysis was applied to the zzso zzso zzso The first stage involved the zzso of candidate zzso zzso by linkage zzso analysis and the functional zzso zzso of the most significant zzso zzso The second stage involved the zzso of biological mechanisms for the zzso candidate zzso zzso using zzso set enrichment zzso zzso analysis identified three candidate zzso two zzso zzso zzso and three hypothetical biological zzso zzso zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso to protein domain specific binding zzso p zzso zzso false discovery rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive regulation of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of protein zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso negative regulation of zzso organization zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso to protein domain specific binding zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and positive regulation of zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso process zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and steroid zzso process zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By applying the zzso analysis to zzso zzso zzso data, three candidate zzso two genes zzso and zzso and 21 pathways involving protein domain specific binding and zzso were identified, which may contribute to zzso zzso
