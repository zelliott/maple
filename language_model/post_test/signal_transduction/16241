In melanoma, the zzso of zzso signaling zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso is critical for tumor zzso We have recently reported that the zzso inhibitor zzso causes efficient zzso of melanoma zzso Here, we show that in addition to its zzso zzso activity, zzso also targets the zzso zzso In melanoma cell lines, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso reporter gene zzso Furthermore, the effective zzso of melanoma growth by zzso was attenuated upon zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso signaling by zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso 1, identified in a screen of 315 zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is well tolerated and orally active against zzso 903 and zzso melanoma zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso both the zzso and the zzso pathways and that the dual targeting of these pathways may be zzso as a therapeutic strategy in zzso
