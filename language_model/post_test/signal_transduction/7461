Men with zzso dysfunction zzso respond poorly to oral zzso zzso following radical zzso Recent studies have reported that zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso signaling zzso play important roles in cavernous zzso and in the deterioration of zzso function in a mouse model of cavernous nerve injury zzso and in patients with spinal zzso zzso The mothers against zzso zzso 7 zzso is known to inhibit the zzso of zzso and zzso 

To investigate the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso function in a mouse model of zzso 

zzso zzso mice were used and distributed into 7 groups: sham operation group, zzso zzso group, and zzso groups receiving a single zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus particles zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Two weeks after bilateral cavernous nerve crushing and treatment, zzso function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous zzso The zzso was harvested for zzso examinations and Western zzso zzso 

The highest zzso response was noted in zzso mice treated with zzso at a dose of zzso zzso which reached up to zzso of sham control zzso Local delivery of zzso significantly decreased zzso cell zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen I, and collagen IV, and induced zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in the corpus zzso tissue of zzso zzso 

The zzso gene transfer of zzso successfully restored zzso function by enhancing zzso cell function and through zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by use of zzso may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for zzso induced by radical zzso
