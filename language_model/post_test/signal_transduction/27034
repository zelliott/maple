This study investigated the expression of zzso class I zzso on zzso and zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso All of these zzso induced the zzso on both cells in a zzso manner, with zzso inducing much more expression than zzso or zzso zzso We have already reported that protein zzso C zzso is involved in the zzso expression induced by zzso on zzso zzso The zzso expression induced by zzso was also blocked by a zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso expression by zzso or zzso beta was not inhibited by zzso by a protein zzso A zzso zzso nor by a zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in the induction of zzso class I zzso on both cells by zzso and zzso zzso We concluded that zzso and zzso beta induced much less expression of zzso class I zzso on both cells than zzso and that this might be because the signaling zzso by zzso and zzso beta differed from that by zzso
