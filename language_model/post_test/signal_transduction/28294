To establish a chronic infection, zzso C virus zzso has to evade the host zzso zzso of zzso proteins in cultured cells and in zzso of transgenic mice zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso It is not known if zzso signaling is inhibited in patients with chronic zzso C as well, and the molecular mechanisms are not well zzso 

zzso signaling was investigated in liver zzso from patients with chronic zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso interference with zzso signaling were analyzed in cultured cells, zzso transgenic mice, and liver zzso 

zzso DNA binding of zzso was significantly impaired in liver zzso from patients with chronic zzso C compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were intact, but zzso of zzso on zzso 31 was zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso an inhibitor of zzso DNA zzso Increased expression levels of zzso zzso 2A were found in liver extracts from zzso transgenic mice and in liver zzso of patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of zzso increased binding to zzso and reduced zzso DNA binding of zzso 

We conclude that zzso interferes with zzso signaling via zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso association, resulting in reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso
