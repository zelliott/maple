A selective zzso gamma zzso involving point zzso in both the paternal and the maternal zzso has been zzso The zzso gamma zzso affected two brothers of a four zzso family; one of them died at the age of 3 of a viral pneumonia with zzso zzso features zzso zzso and gut zzso cell zzso whereas the other is still alive at the age of 10 with relatively mild infection zzso In this work, the effects of the absence of the zzso gamma chain in the structure and signal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex and in the selection and function of T zzso were zzso The absence of zzso gamma did not prevent the expression of certain amounts of zzso complexes on the surface of T zzso This suggests the existence of at least two zzso zzso in T cells, either with or without zzso zzso A persistent low proportion of zzso T cells, not functional in zzso (they were unable to zzso and probably in zzso zzso to a lethal viral zzso was zzso In contrast, the proportion of zzso T cells was not altered, and they were functional both in zzso (they showed a normal proliferation and a low, but zzso increase of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso although the production of zzso was zzso and in zzso (they normally helped B zzso These results show that the absence of zzso gamma affects the selection and function of zzso but apparently not zzso T zzso although the possibility that the zzso T cells represent a specific zzso can not be ruled zzso They also suggest that the interactions of the zzso complex with its zzso during zzso selection and zzso recognition in the periphery may be zzso with zzso interacting through zzso gamma and, probably, zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
