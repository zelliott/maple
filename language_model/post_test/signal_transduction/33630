Little is known of the first zzso events that regulate neural fate in response to zzso signals such as zzso and zzso zzso is one of the earliest zzso factors to be expressed in the developing zzso and has been shown to be regulated by these zzso zzso We have used both zzso and zzso experiments in zzso to zzso the role of zzso in determining neural zzso zzso zzso caused induction of neural tissue from a very early stage of cell zzso in the zzso and this effect was maintained such that large zzso of additional zzso were apparent, including almost complete zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso using zzso resulted in a reduction in the size of the zzso ears and eyes and subsequent zzso of some aspects of zzso Our data also suggest that the zzso effects of zzso can compensate for zzso of zzso zzso in inducing neural tissue but it is not sufficient to maintain neural fate, suggesting the presence of zzso roles of zzso at later zzso
