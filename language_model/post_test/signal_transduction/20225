zzso is a zzso process that involves the sequential formation of zzso and zzso from retinal zzso Once zzso is completed, zzso zzso cells can be zzso to differentiate into zzso lineages and constitute a zzso source of neural zzso The identification of the intrinsic and zzso factors that control proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells or retinal zzso is needed in order to fully define their potential therapeutic use in zzso zzso Here we determined the response of retinal zzso derived from zzso zzso primary cell cultures to zzso signal zzso zzso Using Western zzso analysis, zzso and calcium imaging we found that zzso zzso an increase of the number of zzso cells that present spontaneous zzso calcium zzso as well as their frequency, which involve the participation of zzso zzso calcium channels zzso This process zzso with the zzso of zzso factor zzso through zzso zzso and the induction of expression of the early zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapid and sustained and the pharmacological blockade of zzso activity inhibited the effect of zzso on zzso zzso Furthermore, consistent with the role of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso the modification of zzso zzso zzso pattern in these cells suggesting that zzso zzso participate in the differentiation zzso Our results support the notion that zzso retinal zzso derived from zzso zzso primary cell cultures respond to zzso through the same molecular zzso previously characterized in zzso zzso and developing zzso We speculate that the induction of zzso zzso signaling could represent a novel strategy to enhance neural versus zzso zzso from these cells through genetic and zzso zzso
