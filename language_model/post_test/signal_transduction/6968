Although vascular complications are a hallmark of diabetes, the molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso dysfunction are zzso We showed that zzso oxygen species generated from zzso promoted zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso This zzso signaling occurred within the zzso compartment and resulted in progressively decreased availability of zzso at the cell zzso zzso the responses of zzso cells to zzso zzso in a mouse model of diabetes were impaired because of a specific zzso of zzso at the cell surface, despite a lack of change in transcript zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not require intrinsic zzso zzso activity and was instead zzso by zzso family zzso The reduced cell surface abundance of zzso in diabetic mice was reversed by treatment with the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso role for zzso zzso These findings uncover a mode of zzso zzso signaling that can progressively lead to continuously muted responses to zzso zzso and limit zzso zzso
