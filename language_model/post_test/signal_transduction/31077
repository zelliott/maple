The zzso of idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso is zzso Because viral zzso of zzso has been suggested, we have established a zzso model of progressive pulmonary zzso by infecting zzso mice zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso in humans with zzso have been implicated in driving the zzso response, we studied their role in our zzso zzso zzso infection of the lung was associated with recruitment of zzso zzso to areas with zzso zzso and zzso in infected zzso Using zzso Western zzso and zzso techniques, we demonstrated that recruited zzso zzso showed high levels of expression of the proteins zzso zzso zzso in inflammatory zone 1), zzso growth zzso and zzso I, and also active zzso of zzso indicative of zzso of zzso by an alternative zzso zzso I expression was also evident in zzso zzso and increased zzso activity was found in lungs of infected zzso Lung tissue from patients with zzso showed increased expression of zzso I in zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with normal zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso I could be a mechanism driving lung zzso
