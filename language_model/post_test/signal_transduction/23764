The unique sensitivity of early red cell zzso to iron zzso known as the zzso iron restriction response, serves as a basis for human zzso zzso This response zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repression in iron zzso zzso zzso the zzso iron restriction response results from zzso of zzso zzso and can be suppressed by providing the zzso product zzso Recent studies have implicated the zzso iron restriction response in anemia of chronic disease and inflammation zzso offering new therapeutic avenues for a major clinical problem; however, inflammatory signals may also directly repress zzso in zzso Here, we show that suppression of the zzso iron restriction response by zzso administration corrected anemia and zzso defects in rats with zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso repression by inflammatory signaling is zzso modulated by the zzso iron restriction response in a zzso zzso involving induction of the zzso zzso factor zzso These results reveal the integration of iron and inflammatory zzso in a zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso
