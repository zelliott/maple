zzso zzso C zzso zzso are critically involved in the regulation of innate immune zzso zzso we investigated the role of conventional zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression zzso by the zzso zzso 3 zzso signaling zzso zzso of conventional zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells or zzso cells by an zzso zzso zzso selectively inhibited zzso synthesis induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, reporter gene zzso confirmed that zzso regulates zzso promoter activity, since zzso of dominant negative zzso but not zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso but not zzso promoter activity upon zzso engagement in zzso zzso zzso zzso negative zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso of zzso zzso adapter inducing zzso and zzso zzso Additional zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and DNA binding activity analogous to their control counterparts in response to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso activity is essential for zzso the interaction of zzso but not zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with specific small interfering zzso inhibited zzso expression and zzso zzso promoter activity, establishing zzso as a component of zzso signaling that regulates zzso gene expression by targeting zzso protein zzso Finally, we analyzed the involvement of zzso in other signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso These experiments revealed that zzso play a role in the synthesis of zzso induced via both zzso and zzso zzso
