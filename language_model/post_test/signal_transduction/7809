The zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso gene I zzso and the melanoma zzso gene 5 zzso are key zzso receptors that recognize virus infection to produce type I zzso A third zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and zzso but lacks a zzso zzso and recruitment zzso We generated zzso mice and report that the loss of this gene greatly zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso induction of type I zzso However, negative feedback zzso of zzso zzso was found to be normal in the absence of zzso indicating that zzso is not the primary negative regulator of type I zzso zzso Our data further indicate that zzso mice exhibited resistance to lethal zzso zzso virus infection, a virus whose zzso zzso zzso are recognized specifically by zzso rather than by zzso to trigger the production of type I zzso However, mice lacking zzso were observed to exhibit a zzso in type I zzso production in response to infection by the zzso virus, the replication of which activates zzso innate immune zzso zzso our data indicate a disparate regulatory role for zzso in the triggering of innate immune signaling pathways following zzso virus zzso
