The signaling pathways imposing hormonal control over zzso differentiation are poorly zzso While insulin and zzso signaling have been found previously to be essential for zzso the relative importance of their many downstream branches have not been zzso One direct zzso that is inhibited by zzso zzso is the zzso sclerosis complex 2 zzso zzso which associates with zzso and acts as a critical negative regulator of the zzso target of zzso zzso complex 1 zzso Loss of function of the zzso complex results in zzso zzso signaling and, through zzso feedback mechanisms and loss of zzso activity, leads to a zzso block of zzso signaling to its other downstream zzso 

We find that, despite severe insulin resistance and the absence of zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso display enhanced zzso differentiation that is dependent on the elevated zzso activity in these zzso zzso of zzso causes a robust increase in the zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso which is the master zzso regulator of zzso zzso In examining the requirements for different zzso zzso sites on zzso we find that only zzso zzso lacking all five previously identified zzso sites fully block zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso cells, and this zzso also zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso from patients with zzso sclerosis complex contain both zzso and smooth zzso components with activated zzso signaling and elevated zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso of zzso signaling is a critical step in zzso differentiation and identifies zzso as a primary target of zzso driving this zzso zzso the zzso complex regulates the differentiation of zzso cell zzso at least in part, through its control of zzso activity and zzso zzso
