zzso signaling is important in skin zzso zzso Its possible involvement in zzso zzso determination and zzso stage zzso development, however, has not been studied zzso To address these issues we manipulated zzso zzso expression in a zzso conditional mouse model, where the zzso is the only source of active zzso zzso We find that zzso restores sweat zzso and all hair zzso in zzso but each requires its action at an idiosyncratic time of development: by zzso for guard, by zzso for zzso and starting at zzso for zzso zzso Guard and zzso hairs were indistinguishable from their zzso zzso but restored zzso and zzso zzso although zzso were somewhat smaller and lacked characteristic zzso zzso secondary hair zzso formation of zzso zzso and zzso hairs required higher zzso expression level than did guard hair or sweat zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is required until the early zzso zzso stage for guard hair germs to make zzso but is zzso for their zzso Similarly, sweat zzso zzso require zzso at an early stage to form mature zzso Thus we zzso that zzso signaling is needed for the determination and development of various skin zzso at zzso restricted zzso
