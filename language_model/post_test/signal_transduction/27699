The developing cerebral zzso zzso overlapping periods of zzso suicide, and differentiation to generate the mature cortical zzso The following experiments examined the role of the zzso hormone zzso in comparison to the zzso in the regulation of zzso cortical cell zzso To zzso choices between zzso zzso and neural zzso embryonic rat cerebral cortical zzso were zzso immortalized with the zzso large T zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso At the zzso temperature, zzso of large T zzso expression was accompanied by induction of zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso double minute 2 zzso that lead to cell zzso suicide, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exit cell cycle and die zzso or differentiate primarily into zzso and immature zzso zzso At the zzso temperature, zzso specifically induced an zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso while increasing zzso and decreasing zzso zzso zzso rapidly increased and then decreased zzso relative to controls, suggesting zzso zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso prevented DNA zzso a marker for zzso However, zzso also induced a transient increase in released zzso zzso suggesting that zzso simultaneously induced rapid cell death in a zzso of zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso also increased cell zzso Both zzso and the zzso supported zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso zzso only supported the expression of a subset of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and the zzso support overlapping and distinct aspects of differentiation in the developing cerebral zzso
