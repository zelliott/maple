zzso is a trace element present in practically all cells in plants and zzso It exerts interesting actions in living zzso At pharmacological doses, zzso compounds display relevant biological actions such as mimicking insulin and growth factors as well as having zzso zzso Some zzso compounds also show zzso zzso The importance of zzso in bone arises from the studies developed to establish the zzso of this element in animals and zzso Bone zzso where the element seems to play an important role, accumulates great amounts of zzso This paper reviews the physiology of zzso the involvement of different growth factors on bone development, and the effects of zzso derivatives on the skeletal system of animal models and zzso zzso Two cellular lines are discussed in zzso one derived from a rat zzso zzso and the other is a zzso zzso cell line zzso The effects of different growth factors and their mechanisms of action in these cellular lines are zzso These models of zzso are especially useful in understanding the zzso signaling pathways of zzso derivatives in hard zzso zzso uses an intricate interplay of zzso mechanisms to exert different zzso and pharmacological zzso The effects of zzso derivatives on some cellular signaling pathways related to insulin are compiled in this zzso The comprehension of these zzso signaling pathways may facilitate the design of zzso compounds with promising therapeutic applications as well as the understanding of secondary side effects derived from the use of zzso as a therapeutic zzso
