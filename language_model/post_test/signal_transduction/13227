zzso signal zzso is amplified by the dynamic zzso of accessory molecules at zzso cell contact sites, along with the simultaneous exclusion from these sites of negative regulators, such as certain zzso zzso and large zzso zzso However, given the general nature of the zzso zzso mechanism underlying molecular segregation events at the zzso cell interaction site, the possibility exists that negative regulators might similarly be zzso at these zzso Using zzso zzso we have demonstrated that zzso protein 14 zzso a direct T cell zzso focuses toward zzso cell contact sites in conjunction with zzso zzso We have further established that the function of zzso is dependent upon its zzso to the sites of zzso zzso where it zzso regulates T cell zzso Thus, zzso provides an example of a soluble negative T cell regulator whose zzso activity is linked to zzso of the zzso cell contact site, thereby hindering early events triggered by the zzso
