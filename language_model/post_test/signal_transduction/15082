zzso a naturally occurring zzso compound has been identified as a small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso family zzso It zzso zzso in a wide range of tumor cell lines and enhances zzso and zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso and related proteins are important zzso of zzso and frequently zzso in human zzso Increased levels of these proteins zzso zzso and zzso and may be associated with poor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso functions of zzso family members represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance to zzso zzso 

We tested the effect of zzso also denominated as zzso radiation and the combination of both on zzso induction in human zzso cells, zzso T and zzso Because zzso of the zzso zzso is important for zzso induction by many different stress zzso and zzso is known to inhibit zzso of zzso we also investigated the role of this signaling cascade in zzso zzso using a zzso and genetic zzso 

zzso induced zzso in a zzso and zzso fashion, with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso T and zzso cells, zzso zzso analysis revealed a synergistic interaction between zzso and radiation, which also appeared to be zzso Like radiation, zzso activated zzso which was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso In cells zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso 

Our data show that zzso strongly enhances zzso zzso in human zzso cells and indicate a requirement for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This type of zzso zzso may overcome treatment resistance and lead to the development of new effective combination zzso
