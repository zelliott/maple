We have studied signaling mechanisms that stimulate zzso and zzso hormone zzso in isolated male rat zzso zzso As judged by reverse zzso plaque zzso zzso zzso stimulates as many zzso to zzso as does zzso hormone zzso However, zzso and zzso use different signaling zzso The zzso action of zzso is not very sensitive to zzso I, an inhibitor of protein zzso C, but is blocked by loading cells with a calcium zzso zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso is blocked by zzso I and is not very sensitive to the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso whereas zzso does zzso As judged by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso or zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso develops more slowly (in several minutes) than that of zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso independently either by calcium zzso or by zzso of protein zzso zzso
