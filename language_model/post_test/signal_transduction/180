zzso zzso is a tissue zzso specifically expressed in zzso Our laboratory and others have shown that zzso zzso protects zzso against zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly zzso Recent studies demonstrate that zzso zzso a multitude of zzso and temporally regulated responses in gene zzso and initial evidence suggested that zzso might function in altering biological processes of gene zzso In this study, we asked how zzso may help regulate genes responsive to zzso zzso of hypoxic response genes following zzso deprivation zzso was examined using zzso zzso in zzso transgenic zzso and wild type zzso mouse zzso From a total of 113 genes on the zzso zzso expression of 65 genes was zzso Under rest condition, 14 genes were zzso in zzso zzso compared to zzso In zzso zzso after zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso 20 genes were significantly zzso and only zzso zzso was significantly zzso However, out of the 20 zzso genes in zzso zzso 12 of them were no longer significantly changed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mars and zzso Among these 12 zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were already reduced in zzso zzso compared to zzso under rest zzso Additionally, three genes that initially showed no changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso after zzso in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of multiple hypoxic response genes in the early phase after zzso Further studies on these gene networks and interactions may lead to better understanding of zzso in signaling pathways that contribute to zzso
