The mechanisms that regulate the establishment of adult stem cell pools during normal and zzso zzso development are still largely zzso Here, we asked whether a maternal zzso surge, which occurs during human maternal infections and has been implicated in cognitive disorders, might have long-lasting consequences for neural stem cell pools in adult zzso We show that zzso zzso administered zzso zzso resulted in an expanded adult zzso neural precursor pool and zzso zzso zzso in offspring months after fetal zzso This increase is likely the long-term consequence of acute zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that normally regulates the number of zzso neural zzso These studies therefore identify an zzso neural stem cell zzso zzso in zzso and support a model in which zzso increased maternal zzso can act through this zzso in offspring to zzso neural precursor biology from zzso throughout zzso
