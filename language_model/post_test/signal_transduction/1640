zzso smooth muscle shows both plasticity and zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso concentration zzso may take the form of a uniform maintained rise, a transient uniform zzso zzso a transient localized rise in zzso (also known as spark and zzso a transient zzso wave of localized zzso zzso zzso zzso recurring zzso zzso waves, or recurring synchronized zzso waves dependent on the type of blood vessel and the nature of zzso In this zzso evidence is presented which demonstrates that interactions of zzso zzso located in the zzso of the cell, zzso zzso and zzso form the basis of this plasticity of zzso zzso We focus in particular on how the zzso complexes of zzso and superficial zzso zzso through the generation of local zzso zzso zzso maintain zzso zzso couple these to either contraction or relaxation, and promote zzso cycling during zzso
