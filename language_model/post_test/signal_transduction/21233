The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a Ras protein that mediates induction of the zzso zzso To better understand how zzso zzso activate Ras and cause zzso cell division, we have characterized zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso At 25 degrees, zzso increases zzso activity resulting in a zzso zzso At 15 degrees, zzso decreases zzso activity resulting in a zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso causes a zzso zzso to zzso zzso substitution at zzso acid 19, a zzso zzso in all Ras zzso We introduced the zzso change into human zzso protein and found that the in zzso zzso activity of zzso became zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso zzso interacts with GAP and zzso since zzso that decrease GAP and zzso activity affect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso primarily affects the intrinsic rate of zzso zzso by zzso and that this effect may be sufficient to account for the zzso zzso caused by zzso Our results suggest that a zzso in a human zzso gene analogous to zzso might contribute to zzso zzso
