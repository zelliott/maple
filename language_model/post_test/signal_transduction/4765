zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso where it is involved in wound healing and zzso tissue fibrosis, zzso disease, and zzso zzso zzso zzso can also facilitate cell zzso important in wound healing through a zzso mechanism via its association with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the mechanism how zzso is zzso into the zzso therefore provides a strategy for modulating these zzso and pathological functions of the zzso Here, through molecular modeling and zzso we have identified the zzso site of zzso zzso We demonstrate the requirement of this binding site for zzso of zzso into the zzso through a mechanism involving cell surface shedding of zzso By zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso site within zzso we also demonstrate how this mimicking zzso can in isolation compensate for the zzso loss of cell zzso on zzso via binding to zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the subsequent formation of focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso A novel regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso into the zzso compartment that depends upon zzso zzso and the binding of HS is zzso
