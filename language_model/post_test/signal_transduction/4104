We investigated the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on the acquisition of zzso ability by zzso zzso T cells in human zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso or zzso at primary stimulation inhibited the production of zzso at secondary zzso and the combination of these stimuli resulted in cooperative zzso During primary stimulation with zzso the zzso zzso level was elevated in zzso cells but not in zzso or control zzso The signal provided by zzso but not by zzso was inhibited with zzso indicating that it was zzso by zzso After differentiation into zzso cells, zzso levels in zzso and zzso cells were not zzso Our results suggest that both zzso and zzso play important roles with distinct mechanisms in zzso the zzso of zzso production of zzso zzso T zzso
