The contribution of bacterial infection to zzso is usually ascribed to zzso zzso An alternate view is that direct interaction of bacteria with tumor cells promotes tumor zzso Here, we show that the zzso of large tumors favors bacterial survival, which in turn directly zzso tumor growth by zzso tumor cell zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso survives in the zzso of large but not small tumors, resulting in the promotion of tumor zzso zzso did not affect the percentage of regulatory T cells or zzso zzso cells in the zzso Through zzso zzso zzso activated zzso protein zzso and nuclear zzso in tumor cells, resulting in the increased production of zzso oxide and zzso and increased proliferation of tumor zzso All of these effects were zzso by zzso expression of zzso but not zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with tumor cells from gastric zzso patients resulted in similar zzso These findings provide a new insight into zzso zzso and illustrate the importance of zzso therapy to treat tumors with bacterial zzso
