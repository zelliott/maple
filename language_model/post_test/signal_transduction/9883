Recent studies have demonstrated that the small zzso can be zzso by applying mechanical forces to the zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms which account for this growth are unknown, and might be best examined using a mouse zzso The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility of developing zzso small zzso growth in zzso 

zzso old zzso mice had a zzso segment taken out of zzso and distended with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this group was compared with a control group without zzso zzso length and diameter were measured zzso and after 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso depth, and muscle thickness in the isolated segment were zzso Rate of zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso in zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso expression of targeted factors was performed to investigate potential mechanisms which might lead to zzso zzso 

At harvest, the zzso group showed a significant increase in length and diameter versus zzso zzso zzso zzso depth, and muscular layer thickness increased in the zzso zzso The zzso group also showed significantly increased rates of zzso cell proliferation versus zzso zzso zzso showed a trend toward higher zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso however, this difference was not statistically zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with zzso is a viable method for increasing small zzso length and zzso This model may provide a new method for studying the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso
