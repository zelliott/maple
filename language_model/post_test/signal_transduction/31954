To get more understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gastric cancer, 25 paired samples were applied to gene expression zzso zzso Here, expression zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso was significantly elevated in gastric cancer zzso The zzso network analysis of zzso genes generated eight zzso We also mapped copy number variations zzso and associated zzso expression changes into pathways and identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways involved in zzso evading zzso and sustained zzso zzso Taken together, our results reveal several interesting genes including zzso as potential zzso for gastric cancer, and highlight more zzso insight of zzso genes in genetic pathways of gastric zzso
