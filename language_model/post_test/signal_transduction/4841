zzso terminal differentiation is the process that ultimately forms the zzso barrier that is essential for zzso zzso This process is controlled, in part, by signal zzso and gene expression mechanisms, and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is known to be an important regulator of multiple zzso zzso Using zzso analysis of a zzso cell zzso model of zzso zzso we identified zzso genes that are regulated by zzso growth factor zzso a zzso of the zzso We further discovered, and separately confirmed by functional zzso that zzso zzso abrogates all of the known essential processes of zzso differentiation by 1) decreasing the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) regulating numerous genes forming the zzso zzso and 3) suppressing the expression of tight junction zzso In zzso cultures of skin, zzso acted to impair zzso barrier integrity, as shown by increased zzso water zzso As defective zzso differentiation and disruption of barrier function are primary features of many human skin diseases, we used zzso analyses to identify genes that are known to be associated with skin zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso genes were significantly enriched for skin disease zzso These results provide a zzso understanding of the actions of zzso signaling to inhibit zzso zzso providing new insight into the role of zzso imbalance in skin zzso
