zzso are zzso with well recognized functions during zzso zzso zzso signaling has been demonstrated to be important in zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in regulating normal zzso zzso cell proliferation is not well zzso Here we determine that zzso is expressed throughout the mouse zzso tract including the zzso zzso zzso media from zzso cells zzso proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso cells resulted in zzso transformation of the latter as evidenced by the formation of zzso a condition also accomplished by stable zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso media failed to induce nuclear zzso of zzso but led to increased activities of protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C resulted in a decreased ability of zzso to induce zzso formation in zzso zzso Finally, zzso was redistributed in zzso zzso cells, resulting in diminished zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stimulates zzso migration, zzso zzso and zzso growth of zzso cells by a zzso zzso These findings may help understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso
