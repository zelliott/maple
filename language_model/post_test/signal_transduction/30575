Not all breast zzso respond to zzso and many develop resistance despite initial zzso We used an in zzso model of zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso to investigate mechanisms of this resistance and develop strategies to circumvent zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso which were barely detected in control zzso tumors, increased slightly with tamoxifen and were markedly increased when tumors became zzso zzso which zzso zzso improved the zzso effect of tamoxifen and delayed acquired resistance, but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso (both downstream of zzso were increased in the zzso tumors and were suppressed by zzso There was no apparent increase in zzso zzso (also downstream of zzso in resistant tumors, but it was nonetheless suppressed by zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso which can interact with both zzso and membrane zzso was elevated in the zzso tumors compared with the sensitive zzso However, zzso gene products, including total zzso itself and zzso zzso remained suppressed even at the time of acquired zzso zzso antagonism of classic zzso zzso function was retained in these resistant tumors and even in tumors that zzso zzso zzso zzso and are de zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may mediate tamoxifen resistance in zzso breast cancer despite continued suppression of zzso zzso function by zzso zzso expression remains dependent on zzso but is activated in the zzso zzso This study provides a rationale to combine zzso zzso with tamoxifen in clinical studies, even in tumors that do not initially zzso zzso
