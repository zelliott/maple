zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is an important zzso in zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of zzso in the zzso and lung zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso models and the zzso mechanism by transforming growth factor zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

COPD rat model was established and was treated with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted, and expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were examined by zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The normal human zzso zzso cell zzso was zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso and then zzso with zzso Expressions of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso 

As compared with the model group, after treatment with zzso zzso zzso peak zzso flow zzso forced zzso volume in zzso zzso zzso and zzso vital capacity zzso in the zzso zzso zzso intervention group were all significantly zzso zzso of zzso was also improved, but expression of zzso was significantly zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso both at the zzso level and the protein zzso Furthermore, effect of zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells was zzso by zzso zzso both at the zzso level and the protein zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in the COPD rat model may be mainly caused by the increased expression of zzso and this process is probably related to the zzso of zzso signal zzso
