zzso increases zzso transport by stimulating the trafficking of zzso zzso to the cell surface, a process known as zzso zzso A key protein in signaling this process is zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso whose activity appears to be suppressed by zzso zzso zzso is a zzso GAP with a sequence highly similar to that of zzso and with the same zzso specificity as that of zzso The role of zzso in regulating zzso trafficking has been zzso Our previous study showed that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso even though insulin caused zzso on its single zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show in zzso zzso that zzso is only zzso as abundant as zzso that zzso of zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso by activated zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso does not participate in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that the GAP activity of zzso is not suppressed by zzso zzso In addition, we discovered that zzso is much more highly expressed in skeletal muscle than fat and that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partially reversed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is known to cause zzso zzso in zzso The above findings strongly suggest that zzso is a component in the signal zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso in zzso
