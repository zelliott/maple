Despite substantial increases in research funding by the pharmaceutical industry, drug discovery rates seem to have reached a plateau or perhaps are even zzso suggesting the need for new zzso zzso interactions have long been thought to provide interesting drug discovery targets, but the development of small molecules that zzso such interactions has so far achieved a low success zzso In contrast to this historic trend, a few recent successes raise hopes for routinely identifying zzso zzso zzso In this Opinion article, we point out the importance of coupled binding and folding for zzso zzso interactions generally, and from this and associated zzso we develop a new strategy for identifying zzso interactions that would be particularly promising targets for zzso by small zzso This novel strategy, based on zzso zzso zzso has the potential to increase significantly the discovery rate for new zzso zzso
