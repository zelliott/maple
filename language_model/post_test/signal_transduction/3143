zzso receptors zzso serve as the major innate immune sensors for detection of specific molecular patterns on various zzso zzso activate signaling events mainly by utilizing zzso zzso Recent research advances have provided evidence that zzso signaling is linked to induction of zzso zzso is currently known to affect both of the immune defense and suppression of inflammatory zzso In zzso immune responses, zzso zzso of zzso microbes (called zzso contributes to the former zzso while the latter seems to be zzso by the control of the zzso integrity or selective zzso clearance of zzso signaling proteins (called zzso Several zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso mediate zzso and zzso In this review, we zzso the expanded knowledge regarding zzso signaling and zzso zzso After that, we will focus on zzso signaling downstream of zzso and the effect of zzso on zzso zzso thus highlighting the signaling zzso between the zzso innate immune responses and the regulation of innate immunity by zzso and zzso
