zzso zzso zzso a zzso fungus and the zzso agent of tan spot of zzso produces one or a combination of zzso toxins zzso necessary for disease zzso The two most studied toxins produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are proteins that cause zzso or zzso symptoms zzso Investigation of host responses induced by zzso provides better insight into the nature of the host zzso zzso analysis of zzso has provided evidence that it can elicit responses similar to those associated with zzso In order to evaluate whether there are consistent host responses associated with zzso a similar analysis of zzso changes in the same sensitive zzso was zzso Comparative analysis of zzso and zzso zzso changes showed that similar groups of genes zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso components of the zzso and zzso acid pathways are zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction proved to be common zzso for these zzso Despite similarities in defense responses, zzso and zzso responses as well as symptom development occur more rapidly for zzso compared to zzso which could be explained by differences in perception as well as by differences in zzso of a specific process, for example, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this study suggest that perception of zzso will result in zzso of defense responses as part of a susceptible interaction and further supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso exploit defense responses in order to induce cell zzso
