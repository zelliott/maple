zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins that use the energy of zzso zzso for the zzso transport of zzso across zzso They are common to all zzso cells and are located in the plasma membrane or in zzso of acid zzso In many insect zzso zzso molecules reside in large numbers in the zzso plasma membrane and create an zzso zzso zzso that is used for the zzso or zzso of the zzso space, the zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso the import of zzso and diverse other cellular zzso Here, we zzso our results on the functions and regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the blowfly zzso zzso In this zzso zzso activity zzso the zzso of a zzso saliva in response to the zzso zzso zzso Because of particular zzso and zzso features, the blowfly zzso zzso are a superior and exemplary system for the analysis of the zzso signaling pathways and mechanisms that zzso zzso activity and zzso transport in an insect zzso
