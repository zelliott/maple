zzso restriction zzso extends the lifespan of a wide variety of species and reduces the zzso of major age-related zzso Cell zzso has been proposed as one zzso mechanism for tissue and zzso zzso We show for the first time that zzso short-term DR reduced zzso of zzso cells in the small zzso zzso and liver of mice, which are zzso known to accumulate increased numbers of zzso cells with advancing zzso This reduction was associated with improved zzso maintenance without increased zzso zzso We also found a decrease in cumulative zzso stress markers in the same compartments despite absence of significant changes in zzso zzso stress markers at the whole tissue zzso The data suggest the possibility that reduction of cell zzso may be a primary consequence of DR which in turn may explain known effects of DR such as improved zzso function and reduced production of zzso oxygen zzso
