We investigate the signaling mechanisms that induce retinal zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by asking whether surviving zzso extend zzso by zzso We show that zzso zzso is sufficient to keep zzso zzso alive in the absence of any zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso do not extend zzso or zzso unless signaled to do so by single zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso by zzso zzso factors is remarkably slow but is profoundly zzso by zzso levels of electrical activity spontaneously generated within embryonic zzso or zzso on a zzso silicon zzso These findings demonstrate that these surviving zzso do not zzso extend zzso and provide insight into the signals that may be necessary to promote zzso zzso
