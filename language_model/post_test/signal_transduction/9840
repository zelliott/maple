In the present study, we aim to zzso the roles of zzso a 22 zzso protein in plasma membrane zzso in modulating zzso differentiation of neural zzso cells zzso In the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso knockout mice revealed remarkably higher levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the more abundant formation of newborn zzso than wild type zzso We then studied the potential mechanisms of zzso in modulating zzso signaling and zzso differentiation in isolated cultured zzso under zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso embryonic rat zzso were exposed to zzso zzso for 24 h and then switched to zzso zzso for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days whereas zzso zzso were continuously cultured with zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso hypoxic zzso had zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso We further studied the roles of zzso in zzso zzso differentiation by using zzso scaffolding domain zzso and zzso small interfering zzso In both zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso promoted the expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso differentiation were abolished by zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso These results provide strong evidence to prove that zzso can inhibit zzso differentiation via zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso and that zzso signaling is a crucial target of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contributes to enhanced zzso differentiation in zzso
