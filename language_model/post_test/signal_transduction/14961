Green tea consumption is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in green tea, mimics zzso actions of insulin to inhibit zzso in zzso Because signaling pathways regulating zzso and zzso actions of insulin are shared in common, we hypothesized that zzso may also have zzso actions to stimulate production of zzso oxide zzso from zzso zzso Acute zzso administration of zzso to zzso vascular beds isolated ex zzso from zzso rats caused zzso zzso This was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso family zzso zzso Treatment of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso acutely zzso production of NO zzso with zzso fluorescent dye zzso that was zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso with zzso also resulted in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso that was zzso by zzso or zzso (but not by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso (but not zzso with small interfering zzso inhibited both zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as production of NO in zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso generated zzso zzso zzso with zzso fluorescent dye zzso whereas treatment with zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso has zzso zzso actions zzso by zzso signaling pathways requiring zzso oxygen species and zzso that lead to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This mechanism may explain, in part, beneficial vascular and zzso health effects of green tea zzso
