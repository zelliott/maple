To investigate the zzso effect of zzso on zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso 

Human zzso ALL cell line was cultured in zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso against zzso cell line was examined using modified zzso zzso The cellular zzso changes were observed using a light zzso The percent of zzso of zzso cell line after drug treatment was evaluated by flow zzso zzso The active levels of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways and the expression levels of zzso and zzso were examined by Western zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cell line in both zzso and zzso manner with the zzso of zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso after 72 h zzso The cellular membrane of zzso cell line treated with zzso became zzso some of them zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cell line with the zzso rates following 0, 5, 10 zzso zzso treatment for 24 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso which were zzso activated in zzso cell line, zzso the level of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso the expression of zzso protein zzso 

zzso exerted zzso effect in zzso cell line zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso
