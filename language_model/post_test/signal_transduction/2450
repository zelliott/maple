zzso giant cells are the zzso cells of the rat zzso In this study, the role of protein zzso C zzso pathways in the control of DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso cells, derived from a rat zzso can be zzso manipulated to zzso or differentiate and provide a useful model for studying zzso giant cell zzso zzso The role of protein zzso C signal zzso was examined through the treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso derivatives zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso a control zzso zzso (a protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso Treatment with zzso significantly attenuated DNA synthesis in zzso and zzso zzso cells and accelerated the acquisition of zzso zzso capabilities by zzso zzso Treatment with zzso the related but functionally distinct zzso did not significantly affect zzso DNA synthesis or proliferation and only zzso increased zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell proliferation but failed to influence zzso zzso production zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly influence zzso zzso zzso did not significantly influence the concentration of either zzso or the zzso zzso it in zzso zzso cells, or the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso pathways sensitive to protein zzso C are involved in the control of zzso cell zzso zzso production of zzso is sensitive to zzso but appears to be independent of protein zzso C and occurs at a stage other than zzso zzso
