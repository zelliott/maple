Bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso signaling molecules that belong to the transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso proteins have diverse roles during development where they regulate zzso zzso and zzso in many different cell types by modulating the zzso of specific target zzso zzso have also been implicated in both promotion and zzso of cancer zzso We have recently shown that zzso is commonly expressed in breast cancer but its functional significance has not been previously zzso Our data demonstrate that in all nine breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso treatment leads to a dramatic growth suppression as a result of the induction of zzso arrest of the cell zzso At the same time, zzso stimulates cell migration and invasion in a subset of these breast cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso changes were zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso whereas no zzso of zzso zzso or zzso was zzso Our results thus zzso that zzso is an important regulator of key zzso characteristics of cancer cells, cell growth, cell migration, and invasion, and that, similar to zzso it possesses both tumor zzso and zzso properties in breast zzso
