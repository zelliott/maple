zzso between zzso zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso plays important roles in modulating and zzso downstream cellular responses resulting from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells is a zzso zzso system that generates zzso oxygen species zzso for the purposes of innate immunity and zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso involves sequential interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso components to regulate electron transfer from zzso to molecular zzso Here we identify an zzso interaction between zzso and the closely related zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso that regulates the formation of zzso zzso is unable to stimulate zzso formation by zzso zzso but zzso like zzso and zzso was able to specifically bind to zzso zzso in zzso zzso acted as a competitive inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso formation in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso insert domain but not the zzso I zzso zzso expression of zzso inhibited zzso formation induced by zzso active zzso in an zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso of the zzso domain of zzso syndrome protein into human zzso resulted in an enhanced zzso zzso response, consistent with zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in activated zzso We propose here a novel antagonism between zzso and zzso zzso at the level of the zzso proteins that zzso the generation of zzso used for host defense, cell zzso and zzso
