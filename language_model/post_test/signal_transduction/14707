Recent studies have revealed that zzso stress has zzso effects in several models of neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso zzso zzso However, how zzso stress affects acute brain injury after zzso remains zzso We have previously reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso stress and subsequent zzso injury after cerebral zzso In this study, we investigated the relationship between zzso stress and acute brain injury after zzso using zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso was produced by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death at 24 zzso detected by a cell death zzso was significantly decreased in the cerebral zzso of the zzso zzso rats compared with the zzso zzso The mortality rate at 24 h was also significantly decreased in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso study demonstrated that zzso zzso production after zzso was reduced in the cerebral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are survival signals in zzso cell death, was more enhanced in the cerebral zzso of the zzso zzso rats after zzso using Western zzso analysis and zzso We conclude that reduction in zzso stress by zzso zzso may zzso acute brain injury after zzso via zzso of zzso survival zzso
