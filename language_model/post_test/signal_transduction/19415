A single layer of zzso zzso cells covers the zzso surface of the zzso zzso Normally, zzso zzso cells do not zzso suggesting that factors inhibit their undergoing zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells due to zzso zzso zzso or zzso burn may result in zzso zzso Various growth factors such as zzso growth factor 2 and transforming growth factor zzso are involved in zzso transition zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that cell migration toward artificial wound zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand whether zzso signal might have an important role in zzso regulation, gene transfer of zzso was employed to block transforming growth factor zzso signal in rat zzso zzso 3 days before zzso zzso zzso during healing zzso after zzso burn was markedly suppressed by zzso zzso associated with zzso of cell zzso zzso blocking zzso signal effectively suppresses zzso zzso and zzso reaction by zzso zzso without zzso repair of wound zzso Strategies that block zzso may be useful for prevention and treatment of zzso disorders in the zzso zzso
