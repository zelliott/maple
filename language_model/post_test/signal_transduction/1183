The authors review current views on of the zzso of the neural tube defects zzso zzso and zzso In this context, the following four approaches to the study of zzso are zzso normal zzso and timing of early human neural development from conception to the ascent of the zzso zzso mechanical and molecular biology of neural tube closure derived from experimental and animal zzso zzso and zzso features of the zzso zzso and zzso and the experimental evidence for the importance of both genetic and environmental influences on human zzso Although considerable insight into both normal neural tube closure and the zzso by which this process may be disrupted has been reported in recent years, the exact zzso by which human zzso and zzso arise remain zzso
