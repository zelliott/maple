Altitude zzso is a rather specific form of experimental zzso which is induced by acute exposure to a zzso hypoxic zzso Several zzso have been shown to be involved in the mechanisms of altitude zzso However, their roles and interaction were not zzso 

The novel neurotransmitter zzso oxide zzso may be involved in the mechanisms of altitude zzso through its zzso zzso roles in relation to the zzso zzso 

There were 177 mice zzso zzso zzso with several zzso The altitude zzso threshold zzso was used as an index to evaluate the acute hypoxic zzso 

NO synthesis zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso 800 zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the ACT in mice, while the NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso administration prevented the effect of decreasing ACT caused by zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded a decrease in the ACT in mice and this decrease in hypoxic tolerance caused by zzso can be prevented by zzso with either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest an important zzso role for zzso oxide and zzso in the development of altitude zzso and further support the hypothesized relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
