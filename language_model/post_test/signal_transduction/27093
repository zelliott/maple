Signaling via the zzso cell zzso complex zzso programmed cell death zzso in zzso human T zzso We have investigated the time course zzso of the induction of programmed cell death in cloned zzso T zzso zzso changes zzso zzso were noted by flow zzso as early as 3 zzso after stimulation of clone cells with zzso zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA became visible 3 zzso after zzso zzso and 5 zzso after zzso or zzso zzso zzso and peaked after 8 to 24 zzso zzso cell death (as revealed by flow zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso was detected 5 zzso after zzso treatment and 10 zzso after zzso or zzso zzso zzso With all three zzso zzso cell death was recorded after 16 to 18 zzso Taken together, our data indicate that the zzso death of mature human T cells is a rapid event which is completed within 18 zzso zzso of DNA fragmentation is preceded by the reduction of cell size which can be readily examined by flow zzso
