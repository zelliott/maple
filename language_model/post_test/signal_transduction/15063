Advanced zzso end products zzso trigger an zzso reaction which then zzso zzso cell zzso this is a critical event in the process of diabetic vascular zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso protects human zzso cells against zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate the possible involvement of zzso and zzso signaling in the action of zzso 

zzso were treated with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso For detection of zzso the zzso zzso Orange zzso flow zzso and zzso activity zzso were zzso Generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and the change in zzso membrane potential were measured using flow zzso and zzso immune zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso by Western zzso 

zzso exerted its zzso effect by zzso the overproduction of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso survival correlated with zzso activity and was inhibited by the specific zzso zzso zzso also was activated by zzso and rescued cells from zzso although the zzso effect was less marked than for zzso zzso survival was independent of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking the zzso and zzso activities with zzso zzso or zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso effectively abolished the zzso of the zzso zzso production and zzso zzso 

Our studies suggest that zzso via zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso stress through the zzso of zzso damage in zzso
