zzso receptors zzso contribute to zzso transmission and synaptic plasticity and are thought to be important for zzso To better understand where zzso signaling is necessary for learning, we combined viral genetic strategies with genetic mouse models to investigate the contribution of zzso in the zzso system to zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso was not required for zzso zzso however, zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso medium zzso zzso zzso which receive input from zzso zzso were critical for this type of zzso zzso signaling was also required in brain regions that project to zzso zzso because removing zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso area zzso also prevented zzso This effect was likely attributable to loss of zzso signaling in the zzso of the prefrontal zzso zzso because learning could be restored in these animals by rescuing zzso expression in the zzso Moreover, removing zzso exclusively from the zzso also prevented zzso Our findings suggest that zzso in zzso that project to and receive projections from the zzso are necessary for zzso conditioning and specifically zzso the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
