zzso is an expensive zzso zzso derived from zzso plants that is widely used in traditional zzso incense and zzso Only wounded trees can produce zzso and the huge demand for the zzso products has led all zzso zzso being endangered and listed in the zzso II of the zzso zzso The major components of zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso to a lack of zzso information, the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation remains zzso 

To identify the primary genes that maybe related to zzso formation, we zzso 2 zzso libraries generated from healthy and wounded zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso with an average length of zzso zzso were zzso and they were zzso in detail at zzso zzso Of those associated with zzso formation, 30 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, and a handful of zzso factors and protein zzso were related to wound signal zzso Three full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and zzso zzso revealed that they are active zzso with the major products being zzso A zzso zzso zzso induction experiment revealed that the expression of zzso was significantly induced by zzso and the production of zzso was elevated zzso The expression of some zzso factors and protein zzso especially zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also induced by zzso and coordinated with zzso zzso suggesting they maybe positive regulators of zzso 

This study provides extensive zzso information for zzso zzso and valuable clues for zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso
