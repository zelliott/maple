The complement system is composed of soluble blood plasma proteins and cell membrane zzso A major function of the soluble complement proteins is to bind to and destroy invading zzso The membrane proteins of the complement system are divided into complement receptors and complement regulatory zzso zzso receptors on zzso cells promote binding and zzso of pathogens coated with complement zzso whereas complement regulatory proteins protect healthy zzso from accidental damage by the soluble complement zzso Upon binding of complement proteins or protein fragments that are generated during complement zzso these receptors and regulatory proteins zzso various signals into cells bearing zzso The complement membrane attack complex zzso binds to cell zzso independent of any zzso and also activates multiple signaling zzso The zzso and zzso signals zzso by complement components are of great consequence to health and zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso by zzso B and T zzso It may also exert zzso or zzso effects on various cell zzso At zzso doses, the complement membrane attack complex has zzso effects on many cell types leading to cellular responses, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and even cell zzso zzso complement also zzso increased cell resistance to zzso doses of zzso Finally, certain pathogens take advantage of complement membrane proteins to gain entry into zzso The emerging data on these zzso signaling pathways is hereby zzso
