zzso zzso constitute a family of zzso molecules zzso expressed in zzso In the immune system, they regulate many processes such as zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the expression in the zzso of the two same zzso zzso zzso described previously in the zzso zzso was found to induce two separate biological activities on T zzso a robust zzso zzso T cell proliferation in the absence of zzso and notably, a zzso signal that zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice transgenic for zzso The zzso proliferation induced by zzso displayed increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso thus suggesting the zzso expansion of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso T cell zzso was evidenced when the Gal and the zzso were zzso at doses zzso to induce T cell zzso By mass zzso analysis, several zzso and zzso surface zzso including zzso zzso as well as other molecules specific to zzso zzso and zzso were identified as putative zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso with specific zzso of zzso zzso or zzso prevented its zzso and zzso T zzso zzso This seems to be associated with the zzso binding to zzso which lowers the zzso threshold of the zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our findings support a distinctive role for locally produced zzso as an zzso of otherwise borderline immune responses and also suggest that zzso might fuel the zzso at inflammatory zzso
