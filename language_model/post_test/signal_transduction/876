Ras zzso are universal molecular switches that act as kinetic timers of signal zzso zzso They are zzso modified by the addition of zzso groups to their zzso zzso zzso which plug the proteins to zzso and influence their dynamic sorting and zzso For the past zzso years, the plasma membrane has been considered to be the zzso platform from which Ras zzso Recent work using zzso imaging and novel zzso to zzso where and when Ras is active has supported this long-held zzso However, an equally fascinating aspect of these imaging studies has been the discovery of dynamic Ras activity, as well as distinct signal zzso from zzso zzso zzso of Ras on the zzso exhibits zzso different from Ras zzso on the plasma zzso and zzso Ras zzso seems particularly prominent in zzso However, data on the spatial and zzso regulation of Ras activity has frequently differed depending on the nature of the probe, the cell type and the zzso Nevertheless, because Ras zzso through zzso en route to the plasma zzso it seems likely that Ras can signal from such zzso The burning question in this field concerns the significance of this observation for zzso Ras zzso zzso
