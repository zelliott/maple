Recently, the novel synthetic zzso zzso zzso acid zzso has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce zzso in several human zzso cell zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso action, we identified, using the differential display method, several genes that are zzso regulated by zzso The sequence of one of these genes was highly zzso to mouse zzso a gene closely related to zzso Both of these genes have been reported to play a role in negative growth control and zzso zzso was expressed in a variety of zzso including liver, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso The levels of both zzso and zzso zzso was rapidly increased in a number of zzso cell lines after treatment with zzso This increase was specific for zzso because zzso acid, a zzso acid zzso zzso and an zzso X zzso zzso were zzso These results suggest that this action of zzso involves a novel mechanism that is independent of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso indicating that it causes an increase in the stability of these zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the induction of zzso indicating that this increase occurred independently of zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that the zzso of cell growth by zzso is accompanied by an increase in zzso and zzso zzso and that this enhancement is regulated at a zzso zzso Our results support a role for zzso and zzso in the negative growth control by zzso
