zzso factors are zzso proteins which are able to identify specific zzso sequences and by binding to them may regulate the expression of genes at the level of zzso In addition to the general zzso factors, which are basically the same for each gene transcribed by zzso zzso zzso II, more than 100 specific zzso factors have been identified so zzso These specific zzso factors regulate the expression patterns of various sets of zzso genes during growth and development and enable the adjustment of cells and zzso to environmental zzso Especially the zzso proteins have found increasing interest, since members of these families such as zzso and zzso seem to be involved in zzso changes in peripheral zzso Many studies have also used them as marker proteins for activated zzso in the central nervous system to identify functional pathways and connections between brain zzso The zzso system is implicated both in the hormonal and the central regulation of blood pressure and volume zzso By binding to their specific receptors zzso zzso namely zzso zzso II, have also been reported to induce the expression of a variety of zzso zzso factors zzso of the zzso and other families in peripheral zzso such as kidney and blood vessels and in specific brain zzso By zzso zzso transient zzso zzso signals are transformed into long-lasting genetic zzso While the zzso II induced expression of zzso in peripheral zzso seems to be associated with zzso the zzso significance of this expression in brain zzso with their zzso cells is much less zzso This contribution reviews the zzso II induced zzso expression in various zzso and discusses the possible zzso and zzso consequences of the resulting changes in genetic zzso
