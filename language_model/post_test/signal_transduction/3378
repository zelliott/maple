To evaluate the protective effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso salt that combined zzso zzso zzso with zzso on bone in an zzso model of bone zzso 

Eighty female zzso rats were zzso zzso or zzso Three months later, the rats were assigned to six groups (10 for zzso zzso zzso control, zzso zzso zzso or 440 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso Drugs were administered orally for 3 zzso When the treatment was zzso the following parameters were zzso bone mineral density zzso the zzso properties of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso of type I collagen zzso and a series of markers for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in serum were measured using zzso and their gene expression levels in the bone were measured using zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso or 440 zzso or zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso and improved the bone zzso and bone strength in zzso zzso The treatments also decreased in the levels of zzso and zzso restored the zzso level in serum and bone zzso increased the serum zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso decreased the zzso level, and increased the zzso level in serum in a zzso zzso It also significantly zzso the zzso expression and zzso zzso expression in bone zzso 

zzso may be an zzso treatment for zzso osteoporosis that acts, in part, via a decrease in zzso through the zzso zzso
