During T zzso zzso zzso recognition of an zzso a highly organized and specific pattern of membrane proteins forms in the junction between the T cell and the zzso cell zzso This specialized zzso junction is called the zzso zzso It is several zzso large and forms over many zzso A plethora of experiments are being performed to study the mechanisms that zzso zzso formation and the way in which information transfer occurs across the zzso The wealth of experimental data that is beginning to emerge must be understood within a zzso framework if it is to prove useful in developing zzso to control the immune zzso zzso models can complement experiments in the quest for such a zzso understanding by suggesting zzso testable zzso Here, a quantitative zzso assembly model is zzso The model uses concepts developed in physical chemistry and cell biology and is able to predict the zzso evolution of cell shape and zzso protein patterns observed during zzso zzso Attention is directed to how the juxtaposition of model predictions and experimental data has led to intriguing hypotheses regarding the role of zzso and self peptides during zzso zzso as well as correlations between T cell zzso functions and the zzso of zzso zzso We remark on some ways in which synergistic experiments and modeling studies can improve current models, and we take steps toward a better understanding of information transfer across the T zzso zzso
