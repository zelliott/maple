zzso oxygen species zzso are conventionally classified as toxic consequences of zzso life, and the brain is particularly susceptible to zzso zzso stress and damage zzso to its high energy and oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso are a widespread source of brain zzso implicated in seizures, stroke and zzso A zzso role for zzso generation in normal brain function has not been established, despite the fact that mice and humans lacking functional zzso proteins have cognitive zzso Using molecular imaging with zzso zzso a new selective fluorescent indicator for hydrogen zzso zzso we show that adult zzso zzso cells zzso generate zzso through zzso to regulate zzso growth signaling zzso which in turn maintains their normal proliferation in zzso and in zzso Our results challenge the traditional view that brain zzso are solely deleterious by demonstrating that controlled zzso chemistry is needed for maintaining specific cell zzso
