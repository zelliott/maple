Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso is converted to a series of zzso products thought to be responsible for the biological effects of dietary zzso zzso separation of the crude acid mixture of zzso guided by cell proliferation zzso in human zzso cells, resulted in the isolation of zzso zzso as a major zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells by approximately zzso at a zzso concentration of 25 zzso zzso had no apparent effect on the proliferation of zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso was a weak zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso and efficiently inhibited the zzso zzso binding of the zzso to its zzso DNA responsive zzso The zzso effects of zzso also were exhibited in zzso of zzso zzso gene expression and in cells zzso zzso with an zzso reporter construct zzso zzso activated both binding of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso to its zzso DNA responsive element and expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso these results demonstrated that zzso a major in zzso product of zzso could inhibit the proliferation of both zzso and zzso breast tumor cells and that zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso function and a weak zzso of zzso zzso zzso
