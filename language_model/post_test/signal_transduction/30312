Growing evidence suggests that only a fraction of prostate zzso detected clinically are potentially zzso An important clinical issue is identifying men with zzso cancer who might be spared aggressive therapies with associated zzso Previously, using zzso analysis we defined 3 molecular zzso of prostate cancer with different zzso zzso One, zzso displayed features consistent with more zzso behavior, where an zzso marker zzso for zzso predicted favorable outcome after radical zzso Here we characterize a second candidate tissue zzso zzso expressed in zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso on a tissue zzso zzso 225 cases, was associated with decreased tumor recurrence after radical zzso zzso independent of zzso tumor stage, zzso grade, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment of zzso and zzso expression in this tumor set improved outcome zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso is induced by zzso in prostate zzso zzso this finding, Gene Set zzso Analysis revealed enrichment of zzso genes in zzso tumors zzso Our findings identify zzso as a new zzso for zzso tumors that improves zzso and reveal zzso signaling as an important zzso feature of this potentially clinically favorable molecular zzso
