zzso zzso often zzso the development of heart zzso Numerous zzso signaling pathways have been implicated in the zzso response in zzso in culture, but their roles in the zzso response to zzso relevant stimuli in zzso is zzso We previously reported that zzso gene transfer of zzso a dominant zzso zzso of the immediate upstream zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso abrogates the zzso response of zzso rat zzso to zzso in zzso We now report that gene transfer of zzso to the adult rat heart blocks zzso zzso by pressure overload, demonstrating that the activity of zzso signaling pathways can be inhibited by gene transfer of zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, gene transfer of zzso inhibited pressure zzso cardiac zzso as determined by zzso and several zzso measures including left zzso zzso wall zzso the ratio of zzso weight to body weight, zzso diameter, and zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso Our data suggest that the zzso are critical regulators of cardiac zzso in zzso and therefore may serve as novel drug targets in the treatment of zzso and heart zzso
