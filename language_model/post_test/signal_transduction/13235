Human zzso virus type 1 zzso is the agent of an aggressive zzso of zzso T zzso called adult zzso zzso and is associated with numerous zzso zzso To establish infection, zzso must activate targeted T cells during early stages of zzso We recently demonstrated that the zzso accessory protein zzso is critical for persistent infection in zzso and for viral zzso in zzso primary zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso To test whether zzso zzso signaling pathways required for zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso and nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso reporter gene activity in zzso zzso T cells compared to zzso control zzso zzso zzso specifically induced zzso zzso approximately zzso in zzso with the zzso protein zzso pathway, but did not influence zzso or zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso signals by zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and a dominant negative zzso of zzso abolished the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso of T zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functionally zzso for zzso which selectively zzso zzso calcium zzso Our data are the first to demonstrate a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose a novel mechanism by which zzso a virus associated with zzso disease, zzso common zzso zzso pathways critical for the virus to establish persistent zzso
