Many viruses have evolved zzso zzso that couple the energy released from irreversible protein zzso to the work of membrane zzso The viral fusion proteins require a triggering event to undergo a cascade of tightly regulated zzso zzso Different zzso of the zzso zzso fusion zzso protein have either a short zzso or long zzso zzso tail zzso and a long CT suppresses fusion activity in a zzso zzso zzso of a domain to the F protein CT, which has the propensity to form a zzso zzso zzso the F protein and increases the energy required for fusion zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso and measurement of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso indicate that this suppression of fusion by the long CT or addition of a zzso bundle occurs at a step preceding initial membrane zzso The data suggest that F protein zzso involves CT signaling to the zzso
