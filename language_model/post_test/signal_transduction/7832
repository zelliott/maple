zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso is a key initial step in the insulin zzso zzso Despite several reports of association of the zzso zzso in its gene zzso with type 2 diabetes, we and others have not observed this association in zzso zzso However, other nearby zzso might account for the putative association zzso 

We zzso the zzso map of zzso and selected 20 markers designed to capture common variations in the zzso We zzso this comprehensive set of markers in several zzso and zzso samples of European descent zzso zzso zzso 

In an initial sample of zzso North American and Polish zzso pairs, the minor zzso of the zzso zzso showed nominal evidence of association with type 2 diabetes zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This association showed a trend in the same direction in zzso zzso samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The combined OR was zzso zzso zzso zzso but statistical correction for the number of zzso examined yielded a p value of zzso We detected no differences across zzso zzso in zzso quantitative zzso 

Our data do not support an association of common zzso in zzso with type 2 diabetes in populations of European zzso
