In this paper, we show that zzso in the gene zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a significant reduction in the zzso of zzso responses recorded from the zzso surface of adult zzso This lends support to previously published findings that zzso zzso in zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso in zzso also affect the zzso behavior response of zzso Moreover, there is a requirement for zzso and zzso zzso function in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso like that of the adult, zzso a zzso second messenger, generated by the zzso of zzso and zzso and modulated by the zzso gene zzso
