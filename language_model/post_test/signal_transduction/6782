zzso zzso a blue light zzso zzso in plants, has two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso as well as a zzso zzso domain zzso and acts as a zzso protein zzso A zzso domain harbors a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso upon zzso zzso via a signaling state in which the zzso of the zzso activity by zzso is zzso To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso activity, and molecular structure were studied with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso samples of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso characteristics with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the zzso of the zzso zzso which was well explained by the fact that the signaling state lasted for a shorter period of time compared with that of the zzso Small angle zzso scattering revealed zzso forms of the proteins in solution and detected zzso zzso changes, suggesting an extension of the global molecular shapes of both zzso Constructed molecular model of full-length zzso based on the small angle zzso scattering data proved the arrangement of zzso zzso and zzso for the first time that showed a tandem arrangement both in the dark and under zzso zzso The models suggest that zzso alters its position relative to zzso under zzso zzso This finding demonstrates that zzso may interact with zzso and modify the zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso of the duration of the signaling state in zzso
