Analysis of protein zzso with flow zzso techniques has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of zzso zzso allowing cellular zzso in complex populations to be analyzed accurately and zzso In this review, we examine the development of zzso or zzso flow zzso and the zzso upon which the technique is zzso zzso flow zzso is compared to traditional zzso methods, and its advantages, such as single cell analysis, zzso data zzso rapid zzso and the ability to analyze rare cell subsets, are zzso We also discuss the many technical considerations that must be addressed when developing new zzso or analyzing new zzso including zzso accessibility, stability of the zzso zzso selection, surface zzso integrity, and zzso suitability for zzso zzso inside fixed and zzso zzso The methods that have been used to date are described in light of these technical zzso The importance of developing zzso platforms in parallel with these techniques is emphasized due to the large, zzso zzso that are rapidly accumulated and which require more efficient data viewing and complex zzso methods than currently available for flow zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the potential clinical applications of zzso flow zzso in analyzing immune cell development and zzso immune responses, as well as zzso profiling of disease states or drug efficacy and specificity against particular signaling zzso
