Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the zzso system provides both direct and indirect zzso drive onto zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice that lack zzso zzso to determine the consequences of chronic zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly attenuated in the nucleus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not prefrontal zzso zzso of zzso mice, while zzso zzso release was absent in the zzso and attenuated in the zzso and zzso The decrease in zzso tone was associated with a profound increase in the density of zzso state D1 and zzso zzso receptors in the zzso and zzso while zzso receptors in the zzso were relatively zzso As a behavioral consequence of these zzso changes, zzso mice were hypersensitive to the zzso zzso and aversive effects of cocaine, as measured by locomotor activity and zzso place zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso receptors attenuated the locomotor hypersensitivity to cocaine in zzso zzso As zzso activity in humans is genetically controlled and the zzso inhibitor zzso has shown promise as a zzso for cocaine zzso these results have implications for the influence of genetic and pharmacological zzso zzso on zzso system function and drug zzso
