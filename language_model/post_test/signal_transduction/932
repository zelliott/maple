The zzso family of zzso encodes a distinct class of zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso Although the zzso genes are zzso highly zzso the contribution of zzso proteins to zzso development is zzso zzso mice were previously described but showed only minor zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso compound zzso knockout mice were zzso Mice lacking expression of zzso zzso and zzso are viable and zzso However, zzso mice show a profound reduction in body size at birth and throughout zzso zzso In addition, the in zzso response of distinct zzso cell populations to growth factors is severely zzso In particular, zzso proteins are required for the efficient proliferation of peripheral T zzso zzso by synergistic zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that members of the zzso family of proteins are important but zzso factors for growth factor zzso
