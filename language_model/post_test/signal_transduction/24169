The zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of primary zzso sensory zzso zzso that are renewed throughout adulthood by local, restricted zzso zzso zzso The molecular signals that control this zzso in zzso are zzso Using zzso bulb zzso zzso in adult mice to trigger zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso in the zzso we show the in zzso involvement of a zzso in the cellular events leading to the zzso of the zzso We find that, of many potential zzso signals, only leukemia zzso factor zzso is induced before the onset of zzso zzso zzso The rise in zzso zzso expression zzso at 8 zzso after zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso indicate that zzso is zzso in part, in the injured zzso zzso This rise in zzso is necessary for zzso zzso as zzso in the zzso zzso mouse fails to stimulate cell proliferation in the zzso Moreover, delivery of zzso zzso to the intact adult zzso using an zzso zzso stimulates zzso labeling in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that injured zzso release zzso as a stimulus to initiate their own zzso
