zzso is a single layer of cells lining each blood vessel that accomplishes a vast variety of specialized functions, which variations are implicated in the development of many cardiovascular zzso zzso are found in most human cells, however the zzso synthesis in zzso occurs in a major part via a zzso zzso The relatively slight dependence of zzso cells on zzso zzso zzso could suggest that zzso play no significant role in zzso Several recent observations clearly indicate that zzso zzso not only can contribute to zzso generation but also are involved in maintaining the fine regulatory balance among zzso calcium zzso zzso oxygen species production and NO zzso The zzso zzso may function as a sensor of zzso in the local environment, contributing to survival of zzso cells under zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species are significant signaling molecules in zzso zzso zzso may play a central role in many cardiovascular zzso
