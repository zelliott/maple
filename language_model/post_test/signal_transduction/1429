Human zzso alpha zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso L chains by the zzso cell line zzso zzso alpha by the human zzso cell line zzso and zzso by human zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso markedly inhibited all three zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso production in crude membrane zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso activity present in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity was sensitive to zzso zzso induced the zzso of a zzso zzso in membrane preparations from zzso zzso zzso toxin also induced the zzso of a zzso zzso in the same membrane zzso The present findings indicate that the zzso is linked to a zzso G protein that stimulates the activity of zzso zzso
