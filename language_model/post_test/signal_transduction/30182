zzso zzso of zzso signaling 3) is an zzso protein that is selectively and rapidly induced by appropriate zzso and that zzso responses of immune cells to zzso by interfering with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the observations that zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso gene and protein expression in primary mouse zzso zzso zzso cell line and zzso zzso we investigated which sequences of the zzso zzso gene are responsive to zzso By promoter deletion analysis we identified a functional zzso element, located at zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso whose presence and integrity is necessary to ensure responsiveness to zzso This element contains a zzso consensus binding sequence zzso element zzso whose specific zzso totally abolished the responsiveness to zzso In contrast, discrete deletion of other zzso regions of the zzso promoter did not substantially modify the zzso by zzso zzso shift zzso analyses revealed that zzso promotes specific DNA binding activities to an zzso probe containing the zzso zzso Even though zzso triggered zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, only zzso was appropriately activated and thus found to specifically bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was not impaired in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that the induction of zzso by zzso depends upon the presence of a zzso element in the zzso promoter that is specifically activated by zzso
