Evidence suggests that the zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso not only mediates the effects of zzso II zzso but also has direct effects on zzso and zzso protein production in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso This study is aimed at identifying the signaling pathways involved in these zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso led to the zzso of Ras and zzso zzso It also zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso of the zzso factor zzso response element zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso from a zzso promoter containing multiple zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso protein and zzso from the zzso zzso A specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as well as a zzso Ras zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso also blocked zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso increased cellular zzso with similar zzso and this was significantly blocked by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso as well as zzso activity of both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso cells displayed significantly greater cellular zzso relative to zzso zzso These results show for the first time that oxidized lipids such as zzso can induce zzso growth and zzso gene expression and mediate growth factor effects via zzso of the zzso zzso and key target zzso zzso
