zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for both zzso zzso and for its acceleration during hypoxic zzso A key challenge lies in understanding how zzso signaling elicits distinct functions during zzso and stress zzso Here we asked whether these distinct functions might be specified by the dynamic behavior of the zzso zzso We used flow zzso to analyze zzso zzso dynamics in primary zzso tissue in zzso and in zzso identifying two signaling zzso In later zzso zzso zzso stimulation triggers a low intensity but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In early zzso the zzso signal is superseded by a high-intensity graded zzso zzso zzso We zzso the biological functions of zzso and graded zzso signaling using the zzso mice, which express a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are restricted to the zzso signaling mode, which zzso these mice from fatal zzso anemia by promoting zzso survival decisions in zzso However, the absence of the graded zzso response in the zzso mice prevents them from accelerating red cell production in response to stress, including a failure to zzso the zzso zzso which we show is a novel stress zzso We found that zzso protein levels decline with zzso zzso governing the transition from high-intensity graded signaling in early zzso to zzso zzso signaling in later zzso Thus, using zzso zzso we converted later zzso into high-intensity graded signal zzso capable of zzso a downstream stress zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso does not limit the zzso signaling response, a zzso paradigm with therapeutic implications in zzso zzso Our findings show how the zzso and graded zzso combine to generate zzso zzso signaling over the entire zzso and stress zzso zzso They suggest that dynamic behavior may zzso information during zzso signal zzso
