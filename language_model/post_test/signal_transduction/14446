The zzso exporter zzso is the inner membrane component of the zzso drug zzso system in zzso coli and is responsible for the resistance of this zzso to a wide range of zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of the zzso zzso in complex with a designed zzso protein zzso inhibitor at zzso zzso The three zzso of zzso are locked in different zzso revealing distinct channels in each zzso There seems to be remote zzso zzso between the channel access, exit, and the putative zzso site, explaining how the zzso motive force is used for drug zzso Thus our structure suggests a transport zzso not through the central pore but through the identified channels in the individual zzso which greatly advances our understanding of the zzso export zzso
