Preservation of both the integrity and fluidity of biological zzso is a critical cellular zzso zzso Signaling pathways that govern zzso zzso fluidity have long been known in bacteria, yet no such pathways have been identified in zzso Here we identify zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whose growth is zzso influenced by its two principal zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deficient in the core components of the cell wall integrity zzso pathway, a zzso zzso zzso dependent on both zzso zzso sole protein zzso zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso small zzso were among those inhibited by zzso yet zzso by zzso A single zzso zzso and a single GAP zzso of zzso were also identified, neither of which participate in the zzso zzso In contrast, key components of the zzso pathway, such as zzso zzso and zzso failed to influence fatty acid zzso The differential influence of zzso and zzso on growth of key zzso correlated with changes in membrane fluidity measured by zzso zzso of zzso a plasma zzso zzso This work provides the first evidence for the existence of a signaling zzso that enables zzso cells to control membrane zzso a requirement for division, differentiation and environmental zzso
