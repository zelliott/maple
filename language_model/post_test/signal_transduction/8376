Single zzso zzso zzso are the most frequent type of sequence variation between individuals, and represent a promising tool for finding genetic zzso of complex diseases and understanding the differences in drug zzso In this regard, it is of particular interest to study the effect of zzso zzso in the context of biological networks such as cell zzso zzso zzso provides curated information about the functional and zzso effects of sequence variation, including zzso as well as on zzso of protein zzso However, no strategy has been developed to integrate this information with biological networks, with the ultimate goal of studying the impact of the functional effect of zzso in the structure and dynamics of biological zzso 

First, we identified the different challenges posed by the integration of the zzso effect of sequence zzso and zzso with biological zzso Second, we developed a strategy for the combination of data extracted from public resources, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We generated attribute files containing zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of biological networks, which can be imported into network zzso tools such as zzso These resources allow the mapping and zzso of zzso and natural variations of human proteins and their zzso effect on biological networks zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction networks, dynamic zzso Finally, an example on the use of the sequence variation data in the dynamics of a network model is zzso 

In this paper we present a general strategy for the integration of zzso and sequence variation data for zzso analysis and zzso purposes, including the study of the functional impact of protein sequence variations on the dynamics of zzso zzso This is of particular interest when the zzso or zzso is known to be associated to zzso We expect that this approach will help in the study of the functional impact of zzso zzso on the zzso of cell zzso zzso which ultimately will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying complex zzso
