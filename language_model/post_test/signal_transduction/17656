zzso is frequently associated with insulin resistance states as found in type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso of free fatty acids zzso on pancreatic zzso have long been zzso Acute exposure of the pancreatic zzso to zzso results in an increase of insulin release, whereas a chronic exposure results in zzso and suppression of zzso We recently showed that zzso zzso insulin release in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso Reduction of plasma zzso levels in zzso rats or humans severely zzso zzso insulin zzso These results imply that zzso plasma levels of zzso are important for zzso zzso zzso it has been accepted that fatty acid zzso is necessary for its stimulation of insulin zzso the possible mechanisms by which fatty acids zzso affect insulin zzso are discussed in this zzso zzso zzso zzso controls several aspects of the zzso function including zzso of certain types of protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso channels, protein zzso zzso and/or zzso oxide zzso zzso and binding to nuclear zzso zzso The present review also describes the possible effects of zzso on insulin zzso We showed for the first time that acute exposure of zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso Another aspect considered in this review is the source of zzso for pancreatic zzso In addition to be exported to the zzso lipids can be transferred from zzso zzso to pancreatic zzso in zzso This process consists an additional source of zzso that may plays a significant role to regulate insulin zzso
