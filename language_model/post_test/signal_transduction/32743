zzso zzso zzso are implicated in the zzso changes induced by the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso dynamics are primarily modulated by interactions of zzso and zzso II that are regulated by zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso of the regulatory zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso were zzso and cell spreading was inhibited in baby zzso zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso active zzso These data indicate that zzso is a target for zzso and that zzso may regulate zzso dynamics by decreasing zzso activity and zzso zzso
