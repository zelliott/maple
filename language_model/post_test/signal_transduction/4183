The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, mediates zzso zzso cell death, zzso zzso has been recognized to be important in the regulation of normal and zzso zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully zzso To zzso the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso we investigated the influence of zzso zzso zzso on zzso signal zzso in zzso human T cell zzso Early signal zzso events were evaluated in zzso T cell lines using zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso (10 zzso but not with an zzso control zzso almost completely inhibited the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was zzso concentration dependent and was detected after incubation for at least 15 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not affect the zzso release of zzso from the internal stores or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of multiple cellular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for up to 6 h did not alter the expression of zzso on the surface of the T zzso zzso of zzso zzso B cells with zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso increase in zzso calcium zzso Our results show that zzso of the zzso zzso can suppress the zzso signaling process in human T but not B zzso
