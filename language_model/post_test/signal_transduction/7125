zzso is a potential therapeutic target for the fatal muscle disease, zzso muscular zzso zzso In adult skeletal muscle, zzso is restricted to the zzso and zzso junctions and can compensate for zzso loss in zzso mice, a mouse model of zzso but requires zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso expression and the zzso zzso zzso which promotes muscle zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso By generating zzso mice, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso membrane stability, reduced muscle zzso decreased inflammation and zzso protection from zzso injury in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression also reduced progressive muscle zzso and zzso in the zzso of aged zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso promoter and increased zzso expression of zzso in muscles of zzso mice, directing the assembly of a substitute zzso complex, and revealing a novel zzso signaling axis that can functionally compensate for zzso
