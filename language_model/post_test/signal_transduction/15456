T cells absorb zzso membrane zzso prepared from plasma membrane of zzso presenting cells, via dual zzso interactions of T cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso complex zzso plus zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling for zzso zzso is also required for the zzso zzso zzso those findings, we had established a high zzso screening zzso platform and screened a library for isolation of small molecules zzso the zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that treatments (1 zzso with various zzso antagonists, including a class of zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso resulted in ubiquitous zzso of the zzso zzso without compromising viability of T zzso Further studies revealed that the zzso drug treatments caused impairment of specific zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso of zzso and zzso and entry of zzso zzso following zzso stimulation were attenuated while zzso of zzso zzso upon zzso triggering progressed normally after the zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was also found to be impaired by the drug treatments, zzso that the zzso by the drug treatments of downstream signaling events (and the zzso zzso could result from lack of directional relocation of signaling and cell surface zzso We also assessed the potential application of zzso zzso as immune zzso by probing effects of the long-term drug treatments (24 zzso on viability of resting primary T cells and cell cycle progression of zzso T zzso This study unveils a novel regulatory mechanism for T cell immunity in response to environmental factors having effects on zzso zzso
