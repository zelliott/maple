zzso zzso zzso is the first part in the process of zzso repair after injury in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso barrier is important as a first line of defense against bacteria and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in zzso zzso but its mechanisms are not well zzso zzso bacterial zzso immature barrier function, innate immunity zzso and inflammation likely play a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso by zzso in response to inflammatory stimuli and has zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso stimulates the inflammatory response by presenting zzso to its zzso however, at high zzso zzso is able to neutralize zzso and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory zzso We sought to determine how zzso would affect wound healing in an in zzso model of zzso cell zzso and protect against zzso injury in a zzso model of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were seeded in zzso zzso slides and grown to zzso A zzso wound was created using a cell zzso mounted on the microscope to achieve uniform zzso Media was replaced with media containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso after 0, 8, and 24 hours and then zzso Cellular zzso was evaluated via digital images captured on an zzso microscope and wound closure was determined by automated zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction after zzso isolation from wounded cells 24 hours after zzso 

zzso alone attenuated wound healing in immature zzso zzso This zzso is reversed by 24 hours with increasing zzso of zzso so that wound healing is equivalent to control zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased with zzso alone but levels returned to that of control after addition of zzso in the higher zzso zzso had no effect on the development of zzso injury when given during our zzso model of zzso zzso bacterial colonization and zzso of innate immunity by zzso are likely involved in the zzso of zzso zzso of wound healing was reversed when zzso was added to zzso but only in the higher zzso At these same zzso of zzso zzso was decreased to that of zzso 

These results indicate that zzso may be a novel therapeutic strategy to facilitate wound healing after the acute phase of NEC and other forms of zzso zzso
