The zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso signals both zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses via zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso located zzso pools, zzso Both zzso pools share similar, though not zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in order to inhibit the zzso death zzso while sparing synaptic responses, it is critical to identify selective zzso zzso of zzso zzso The present study addressed these issues by using primary cultures of rat zzso zzso and a pharmacological protocol of selective zzso stimulation for Western zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso of zzso zzso either alone or together with synaptic zzso triggers zzso re-entry into the cell cycle, which does not proceed beyond the zzso This zzso cell cycle re-entry is particularly associated with zzso death triggered specifically via zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso death was significantly inhibited by pharmacological blockade of zzso zzso D1 expression or by zzso zzso D1 zzso Taken together, these data suggest a zzso relationship between zzso D1 induction and zzso zzso zzso death along the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 may be a putative target for the development of zzso strategies sparing zzso synaptic zzso zzso
