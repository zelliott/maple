The zzso status of embryonic stem cells zzso zzso upon them the capacity to differentiate into the three primary germ zzso zzso zzso and zzso from which all the cells of the adult body are zzso An understanding of the mechanisms controlling zzso is thus essential for driving the differentiation of human zzso cells into cell types useful for clinical zzso The zzso zzso zzso is necessary to maintain zzso in human zzso and in mouse zzso stem cells zzso but the molecular mechanisms by which it achieves this effect remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso controls expression of the key zzso factor zzso in human zzso and in mouse zzso zzso in turn prevents zzso differentiation induced by zzso zzso and limits the zzso activity of the zzso zzso blocking progression along the zzso zzso This zzso loop zzso stasis in zzso and zzso zzso thereby maintaining the zzso status of human zzso and mouse zzso
