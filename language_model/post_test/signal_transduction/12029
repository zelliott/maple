Global zzso of zzso hormone or its zzso zzso in male mice results in zzso and zzso Using novel zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated a strong expression of this gene in zzso germ zzso zzso was expressed in embryonic and zzso zzso No zzso expression was detected in zzso muscles in adult zzso We produced a zzso zzso of zzso and then deleted this gene in male germ cells in zzso located in normal zzso zzso No differences in fertility or zzso of such males were found, suggesting zzso role of zzso signaling in germ cell differentiation in adult zzso We have also produced zzso transgenic mice with reduced zzso expression Such males zzso various degree of zzso and bilateral zzso Total gene expression analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso of a significant number of genes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso or zzso genes in male zzso ligament resulted in its abnormal zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso pathways are potential targets of zzso signaling during zzso zzso
