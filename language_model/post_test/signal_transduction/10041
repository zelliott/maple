zzso such as nerve growth factor and zzso zzso factor, activate zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso at the cell surface followed by zzso and recruitment of zzso signaling zzso The zzso pathways used by zzso share many common protein zzso that are used by other zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso mechanism that involves a zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso which is rapidly zzso zzso in primary zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso events and also zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso We have identified a single zzso zzso zzso event in zzso that plays a critical role in zzso zzso A zzso complex of zzso and zzso an upstream component of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso However, zzso zzso enables zzso to recruit zzso through its zzso domain, thereby freeing the zzso zzso domain to engage zzso for zzso zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso interaction and sustained zzso zzso activity, a response that is not normally observed in other zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling involves an zzso switch mechanism through an unconventional zzso that zzso zzso action from other growth factor zzso
