zzso zzso causes zzso zzso dysfunction in isolated blood vessels, although the signaling pathways involved in this effect remain to be zzso Although zzso zzso zzso D zzso activity in cultured zzso cells, the role of zzso in the vascular effects of zzso remains zzso This study investigated the hypothesis that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in isolated rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso activity and inhibited zzso zzso to zzso within an identical concentration zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso was not prevented by the selective protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso which suggested that this zzso was not involved in the zzso zzso dysfunction produced by zzso The ability of two other zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso dysfunction was also associated closely with their ability to stimulate vascular zzso zzso Parallel stimulation of zzso activity and zzso of zzso relaxation was also observed with zzso zzso zzso which suggested that the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso dysfunction was not a phenomenon particular to zzso The magnitude of zzso stimulation and the extent of zzso dysfunction induced by these diverse stimuli were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso signal zzso zzso is important in the zzso zzso dysfunction produced by zzso and perhaps other zzso
