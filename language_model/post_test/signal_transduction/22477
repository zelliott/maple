Through local zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso controls tissue formation and zzso during embryonic and adult zzso In the heart, zzso is expressed in a variety of cell types, such as zzso smooth muscle cells, and zzso zzso In zzso zzso is activated in zzso embryonic and immature zzso and it is zzso in the zzso during zzso zzso However, zzso signaling in the adult zzso could be activated zzso in response to zzso injury, suggesting that zzso signaling may contribute to cardiac zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso domain zzso the severity of zzso injury and improves zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso of the zzso zzso either zzso or in bone zzso cells, leads to impaired cardiac repair following zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the complex mechanisms of zzso signaling and its role in cardiac repair and zzso after zzso zzso
