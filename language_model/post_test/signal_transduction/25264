zzso is a zzso zzso which is normally expressed on the surface of a variety of zzso and zzso zzso on some human zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed on resting human peripheral blood T cells and two leukemia T cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on peripheral blood T cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso production, and zzso of the zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso and zzso 78 is also suppressed and cannot be reversed by the addition of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso can be a potent negative regulator for T cell zzso at the resting zzso
