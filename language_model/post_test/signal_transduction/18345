zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein containing a zzso zzso zzso domain, multiple potential zzso zzso sites, and several zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso in cells zzso with growth factors, zzso and zzso for G zzso zzso A major zzso protein detected in cells treated with zzso stimuli is the zzso zzso zzso Although the role of zzso interaction in cell signaling has not yet been zzso zzso is known to mediate zzso protein zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso growth factor zzso However, the mechanism by which the zzso zzso exerts a positive signaling role remains zzso In this study, we prepared zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding site zzso the zzso zzso zzso binding sites zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso domain was required for zzso mediation of zzso zzso by zzso it was not essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no apparent effect on zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in the cells that we have zzso These results establish a role for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and clearly demonstrate that zzso interaction is essential for zzso zzso by zzso and zzso These findings also suggest that the positive role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso depends on its interaction with zzso
