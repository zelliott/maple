zzso is an zzso zzso activated in response to heat shock and other zzso that induce zzso zzso of zzso requires induced proximity resulting after recruitment to zzso zzso complexes such as the zzso We have adapted zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso induced proximity in real time in single zzso zzso fragments of the fluorescent protein Venus that can associate to reform the fluorescent complex were fused to zzso allowing zzso and kinetic zzso of zzso induced proximity after heat shock and other zzso This revealed that the zzso zzso platform occurred in the zzso and not in the nucleus in response to heat zzso DNA damage, zzso zzso and other zzso zzso as measured by this approach, in response to heat shock was zzso dependent and upstream of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify zzso as a key negative regulator of heat zzso zzso zzso
