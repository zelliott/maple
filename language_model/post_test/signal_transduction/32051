We recently determined that zzso zzso which have only one pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso directly regulate the zzso of zzso and thereby control cellular zzso levels and zzso both plant development and zzso The zzso zzso contains six zzso and these are localized to different zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso have been identified in zzso and plants, but not in zzso The considerable differences in length and zzso acid sequence between zzso members may result in variations in protein structure and in their specificity to interact with zzso and/or target zzso Here, we discuss the possibility that the zzso are novel sensor relay proteins that use zzso molecules as a zzso
