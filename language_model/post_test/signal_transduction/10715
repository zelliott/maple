zzso can play key roles in regulation by controlling the levels of critical components of, for example, signal zzso zzso zzso processing can remove regulatory proteins when they are not needed, while transforming others from the dormant into the biologically active zzso The latter mechanism often involves a subsequent change of cellular zzso such as the movement from the membrane to the zzso The investigation of these processes has revealed a new type of zzso activity, regulated zzso zzso and a zzso switch in activity occurring in the zzso family of zzso zzso The bacterial zzso and the human zzso precursor processing pathways are used as models to review these novel principles that are zzso zzso and have wide biological zzso
