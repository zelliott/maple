zzso zzso are the state of matter existing between the liquid and the zzso phase, and there is a recent surging interest in its biological zzso Our previous study showed that liquid zzso compounds zzso which are precursors of the liquid zzso enhanced zzso differentiation at a relatively low concentration zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso However, biological zzso of zzso on tumor cells are zzso In this study, the biological activity of 16 zzso to a chronic zzso leukemia cell line, zzso was zzso As a result, two compounds, zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso 9) showed marked growth suppression of zzso cells at zzso zzso These compounds are similar in structure with a core of three aromatic rings including a zzso ring and zzso of one zzso chain and one hydroxide on either zzso In addition, only compound 7 induced the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The contrasting results between compounds 7 and 9 indicate different mechanisms to suppress the cell proliferation between the two zzso These results suggest the possibility of zzso for application as new zzso zzso
