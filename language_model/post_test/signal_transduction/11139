Application of embryonic and adult stem cells in zzso medicine will require efficient protocols for directing stem cell differentiation into zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso growth factors, or zzso zzso components will require extended in zzso culture that would delay zzso transplantation and may well alter the zzso of cultured zzso zzso zzso to direct stem cell differentiation may zzso prolonged culture, but safety concerns zzso clinical application of genetically altered cells in the foreseeable future A novel alternative would be to incorporate protein zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso factors that play important roles in zzso zzso Such zzso zzso factors would then have the ability to zzso across the cell membrane and be zzso within the zzso where they would act as zzso signaling zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso factors would only have a limited active zzso so that their effects may only be zzso However, this could provide sufficient stimulus for initiating stem cell differentiation into a required zzso
