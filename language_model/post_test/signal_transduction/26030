zzso zzso zzso a phenomenon in which brief zzso stimuli of 1 organ protect another organ against an zzso zzso has been demonstrated to protect the zzso and adult brain in animal zzso However, zzso of the protection and underlying mechanisms remain to be zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that remote limb zzso zzso applied immediately after zzso provides zzso in a rat model of zzso zzso zzso by mechanisms involving zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso 

zzso was induced in zzso Day 10 rat zzso by unilateral carotid zzso and 2 hours of zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by 4 conditioning cycles of 10 minutes of zzso and zzso on both hind limbs immediately after zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso was administered to determine underlying zzso zzso volume, brain zzso and neurological outcomes after zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso 

zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso volume at 48 hours and improved functional outcomes at 4 weeks after zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso given immediately after zzso also decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, limb zzso zzso recovered zzso activity and decreased zzso zzso whereas no differences in zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protects against zzso zzso brain injury in rats by zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso
