zzso human embryonic stem zzso cells require mechanisms to maintain zzso integrity in response to DNA damage that could compromise competency for zzso development, and zzso The mechanisms that protect the zzso in rapidly zzso zzso cells are minimally zzso Human zzso cells have an zzso cell cycle with a very brief zzso period suggesting that mechanisms zzso responsiveness to DNA damage may zzso from those in zzso zzso Here, we investigated how zzso cells react to DNA damage induced by zzso radiation zzso and whether zzso insult evokes DNA repair pathways and/or cell zzso We find that zzso cells respond to DNA damage by rapidly inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso levels, as well as zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike normal zzso cells, zzso cells and cancer cells robustly express the zzso protein zzso consistent with the zzso growth zzso zzso depletion of zzso diminishes zzso survival zzso Thus, our findings provide insight into pathways and processes that are activated in human embryonic stem cells upon DNA insult to support development and tissue zzso
