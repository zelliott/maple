The application of zzso and zzso techniques has enabled responses of zzso to be examined at the level of individual zzso Eight distinct types of zzso channel activity have been revealed in T zzso A variety of external stimuli shifts the pattern of channel activity from the resting state, which is dominated by zzso zzso zzso Channel regulation is achieved both by acute zzso and by altered expression in the zzso During zzso zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso channels become active and appear to zzso zzso zzso These acute changes are followed by increased expression of zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso challenge in zzso media, cell swelling zzso zzso of zzso channels, which may, in turn, indirectly activate zzso channels and trigger a regulatory decrease in cell zzso
