G protein activated zzso channels zzso zzso are switched on by direct binding of zzso following zzso of zzso proteins via G zzso receptors zzso Although zzso zzso do not activate zzso they interact with the channels and regulate the gating pattern of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases the zzso activity zzso and increases the extent of zzso by zzso or zzso zzso Here we show that this regulation is exerted by the zzso zzso zzso and involves the formation of zzso zzso by a mechanism distinct from mere zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso The regulation of zzso and zzso current was produced by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which strongly binds zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso Furthermore, regulation by zzso was unique to the zzso zzso it was not observed in zzso zzso zzso In zzso protein interaction experiments showed that zzso zzso enhanced the binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso channels behaved as a zzso zzso zzso showing low zzso and strong zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect either zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso (a pore zzso able to form functional zzso zzso exhibited large zzso and was poorly activated by zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso and restored the ability of zzso to activate zzso like in zzso zzso the unique zzso segment of the C zzso of zzso to zzso rendered the latter functionally similar to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso containing channels are regulated by both zzso and zzso while zzso is a zzso insensitive to zzso
