zzso is a risk factor for zzso breast zzso zzso is lower in obese individuals and may be zzso regulating breast cancer zzso Here we determined that five breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed one or both of the zzso zzso In addition, we found that the addition of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso cell lines inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and zzso cells were inhibited at lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso may be related to zzso since zzso zzso was increased by zzso in the zzso cell zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the response of breast cancer cells to zzso we established the zzso cell line by zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso This line readily formed zzso in zzso mice and was responsive to zzso in zzso In zzso zzso cells were growth inhibited by zzso zzso while the parental cells were zzso This zzso appeared to be due to zzso of zzso zzso These results provide information on how obesity may influence breast cancer cell proliferation and establish a new model to examine interactions between zzso and zzso
