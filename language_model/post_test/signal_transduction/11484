Many of the effects of zzso oxide are zzso by the direct modification of zzso zzso resulting in an zzso called a zzso Here, we describe a novel method for detecting proteins that contain zzso In this three-step zzso zzso zzso are converted to zzso zzso zzso proteins can then be detected by zzso or can be zzso by zzso zzso We include examples of the detection of zzso proteins in brain zzso after in zzso zzso as well as the detection of zzso zzso in selected zzso zzso
