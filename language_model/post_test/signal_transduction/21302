zzso plants lose water primarily through zzso pores on the zzso The hormone zzso acid zzso decreases water loss by regulating opening and closing of zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso effects on zzso through interaction with a protein zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso binds to the zzso zzso to signal zzso zzso closure, whereas zzso and PA interact with the zzso zzso of zzso G protein to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results reveal a zzso signaling zzso that regulates plant water zzso
