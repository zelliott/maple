zzso to partial zzso zzso signals include positive selection of zzso survival of zzso T cells, and zzso zzso As part of an effort to understand the molecular basis of these zzso we have determined how zzso and partial zzso zzso act differently to induce a change in gene zzso We have found that the early growth response gene 1 zzso promoter is activated by zzso and partial zzso zzso but the partial zzso zzso zzso lower promoter zzso Both zzso and partial zzso zzso require all six serum response elements in the zzso promoter to reach maximum zzso Although slightly fewer cells respond to the partial zzso all of the responding cells have reduced activity compared with the cells responding to zzso The factors binding to the serum response elements of the zzso promoter form a zzso complex zzso consisting of serum response factor and either zzso or serum response factor accessory zzso zzso of a stable zzso and zzso promoter activity are both dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso formation over time reveals that this complex is induced well by partial zzso zzso but it is not zzso whereas zzso stimulation zzso longer lived zzso zzso the data suggest that both zzso and partial zzso zzso can induce formation of multiple zzso on the zzso promoter, but the ability of the zzso zzso to maintain these complexes for an extended time results in the increased potency of the zzso
