zzso are a family of proteins produced by various cells following stimulation by biological or synthetic zzso The interaction with the membrane zzso is followed by the zzso of the expression of particular genes that are responsible for their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is an early and critical event in the control of zzso gene zzso In this review we will briefly discuss the mechanisms exploited by zzso to control at zzso level the expression of zzso zzso In particular we will focus on some characteristics if zzso DNA elements that are located upstream from the initiation site for zzso zzso and of nuclear zzso factors that are required for zzso of gene expression by zzso
