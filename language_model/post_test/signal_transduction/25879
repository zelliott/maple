zzso act as signaling zzso that regulate a diverse range of cellular zzso Although numerous zzso functions have been zzso little is known about the effect of zzso on zzso differentiation into zzso Here, we report that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affect zzso differentiation of zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso classical zzso differentiation to zzso The expression of zzso a zzso marker, was induced in accordance with the zzso status of the zzso signaling zzso in which zzso and zzso had opposite zzso zzso zzso of this zzso aborted the zzso indicating that this signaling zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso through the zzso zzso signaling zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso signaling were dependent on zzso whereas the zzso calcium influx was dependent on zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso coupled zzso In contrast, the effects of zzso were independent of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso differentiation into zzso through regulating the zzso and zzso signaling pathways via distinct zzso
