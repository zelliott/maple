zzso size is determined by cell number and size, and involves two fundamental zzso cell proliferation and cell zzso Although several plant hormones are known to play critical roles in shaping organ size by regulating the cell cycle, it is not known whether zzso zzso are also involved in regulating cell zzso Here we identified a rice zzso zzso zzso for organ size, referred to as zzso that displays zzso and erect leaves, typical zzso zzso together with reduced seed zzso zzso is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso The small stature of the zzso zzso resulted from reduced organ sizes due to decreased cell numbers resulting from reduced cell division rate, as supported by the observed zzso of zzso with a number of genes involved in cell zzso The zzso zzso displayed a zzso enhanced zzso response and greatly reduced zzso contents at the zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso is a regulator of zzso signaling and cell zzso Thus, zzso may provide a possible connection between zzso and zzso regulation in controlling organ zzso
