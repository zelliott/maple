Indian zzso zzso one of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates proliferation and differentiation of zzso during zzso bone zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso all zzso zzso In order to discern the direct versus indirect roles of zzso in cartilage development, we have used the zzso approach to remove zzso activity specifically in zzso Animals generated by this means develop shorter long bones when compared to zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation proceeds zzso However, like zzso mice, proliferation of zzso is reduced by about zzso supporting a direct role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Moreover, by zzso either zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso specifically in the cartilage using the zzso zzso system, we demonstrate that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is sufficient to promote zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso D1 is markedly zzso when either zzso or zzso activity is removed from zzso indicating that zzso regulates zzso proliferation at least in part by modulating the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, the present study establishes zzso as a key zzso in the zzso zzso
