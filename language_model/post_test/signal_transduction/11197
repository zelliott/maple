zzso signaling in bacterial zzso has become an important model system for experimental and theoretical zzso These studies have provided a wealth of detailed molecular structures, including the structures of zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso How these three proteins interact to form the zzso complex remains zzso By using zzso and zzso image analysis, we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the zzso zzso The complex contains zzso zzso and the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso We observe density consistent with a structure containing 24 zzso zzso and additional density sufficient to house the expected four zzso zzso and six zzso zzso Within this bipolar structure are four groups of three zzso zzso that are not zzso zzso and are therefore unlike the zzso zzso observed in the zzso crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso In the latter, the zzso contacts occur in the signaling zzso near the hairpin zzso In our structure, the signaling zzso within zzso appear spaced apart by the presence of zzso and zzso This structure argues against models where one zzso and one zzso bind to the outer face of each of the zzso in the zzso This structure of the zzso complex provides an additional basis for understanding the architecture of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso found at the cell poles in zzso zzso
