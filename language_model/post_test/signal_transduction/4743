T cell development comprises a zzso process of commitment from a zzso zzso To define molecular mechanisms controlling this zzso we zzso five stages spanning the commitment process using zzso and zzso to track zzso shifts in transcription, zzso of active zzso factor zzso zzso modifications at diverse classes of zzso zzso and binding repertoire of zzso and zzso zzso factors with complementary roles in zzso zzso The results highlight potential zzso zzso elements in play and reveal both zzso sites and diverse mechanisms of repression that silence genes used in alternative zzso zzso marking is dynamic and zzso and though zzso marks zzso repressive marks often lag behind changes in zzso zzso binding of zzso and zzso relative to zzso marking reveals distinctive zzso zzso recruitment of these crucial zzso factors to different zzso of their potential sites, dependent on dose and zzso zzso
