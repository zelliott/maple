The currently used standard treatment for chronic zzso C using a dual combination of zzso is only successful in 50% zzso With the exception of some clinical and zzso factors, degree of inflammation zzso and degree of zzso zzso there are no other known markers which may serve as valid zzso of response to zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso with signaling pathways modulated by zzso zzso 1/2, zzso and zzso proteins is one mechanism which may influence the interaction between zzso and zzso These proteins regulate different cell processes such as zzso of zzso zzso of zzso regulation of cell proliferation zzso zzso it is possible that impaired signaling or zzso of some of these proteins by zzso infection may cause resistance to zzso zzso This review is completed by results of preliminary study the aim of which was zzso assessment and analysis of expression of zzso 2, 3 zzso their zzso zzso 2, 3 and zzso 3 and proteins zzso 1 and zzso 1/2 in liver zzso of 26 patients with chronic zzso C treated by dual combination zzso and subsequent correlation of the results of zzso analysis zzso with zzso picture and clinical response to zzso The results shows increased expression of zzso 3, zzso 2 and zzso 1 proteins and decreased expression of zzso 3 and zzso 2 in zzso of patients with more marked inflammation and zzso In patients with sustained zzso response there was increased expression of zzso 3 and zzso 1 and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased expression of zzso 3 and zzso zzso However, zzso to the small sample size, the results only zzso statistical significance, but we suggest that proteins of zzso family and their zzso zzso and zzso probably play an important regulatory role during response to treatment for chronic zzso zzso
