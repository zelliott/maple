The bone zzso zzso zzso niche can protect acute zzso leukemia zzso cells against the zzso of zzso agents and is a possible source of zzso The zzso zzso zzso axis is a major zzso in the zzso between zzso cells and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the use of zzso an orally available, zzso zzso of zzso as an zzso zzso This compound effectively blocked zzso migration of human ALL cells in culture and disrupted zzso zzso to zzso To examine how to zzso use this compound in zzso several combinations with zzso drugs were tested in a zzso zzso zzso The best treatment regimen was then tested in zzso Mice transplanted with zzso zzso ALL cells survived significantly longer when treated with a combination of zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso mice transplanted with human ALL cells and treated with zzso and zzso had few circulating zzso cells, normal zzso and reduced human zzso cells in the zzso at the termination of the zzso These results show that combined treatment with zzso may be of significant benefit in zzso residual leukemia cells at locations where they would otherwise be protected by zzso
