The zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso implicated in tumor cell proliferation and zzso We hypothesized that zzso signaling impacts zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso models of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mice were crossed with zzso zzso mice in the zzso background to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice underwent portal vein injection with zzso cells zzso and received daily soluble zzso or zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso controls underwent portal vein injection with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso mice underwent portal vein injection with zzso cells after stable zzso with full-length zzso or mock zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had reduced tumor zzso size, and zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso with zzso or genetic deletion of zzso reduced zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso of function by zzso with full-length zzso increased zzso tumor burden compared to zzso control zzso zzso 

zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso models of zzso zzso Further work is needed to target the zzso axis for possible prophylaxis and treatment of primary and zzso zzso zzso
