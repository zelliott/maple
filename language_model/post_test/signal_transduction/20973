zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel were examined by patch clamp zzso of the outer nuclear membrane of isolated zzso zzso With 140 zzso zzso as the charge carrier zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso free zzso zzso 200 zzso the zzso exhibited four and possibly five zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso observed state M was 113 zzso around 0 zzso and approximately 300 zzso at 60 zzso The channel was frequently observed with high open probability zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 zzso zzso time distribution analysis revealed at least two kinetic states of M with time zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and approximately 20 zzso and at least three closed states with zzso approximately 1 zzso approximately 10 zzso and zzso zzso Higher zzso potential increased the relative frequency and zzso of the longest closed zzso A novel zzso kinetic mode was observed, in which the channel zzso rapidly between two new zzso zzso F1 and zzso The relative occupation probability of the flicker states exhibited zzso dependence described by a zzso distribution corresponding to zzso electron charges moving across the entire electric field during F1 to zzso zzso Channel zzso or zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso was consistently observed in the continuous presence of zzso and the absence of change in zzso Some zzso zzso channel zzso could be reversed by an increase in zzso before irreversible zzso A model for zzso channel gating is proposed in which one mechanism controls channel opening in both the normal and flicker zzso whereas a separate independent mechanism generates flicker activity and zzso zzso zzso of functional channels indicates that the zzso tends to zzso into microscopic zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and channel zzso may contribute to complex zzso signals in zzso
