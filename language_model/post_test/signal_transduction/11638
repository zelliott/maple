We recently reported that the first zzso expression of zzso proteins during coronary smooth muscle cell zzso differentiation from isolated zzso cells was restricted to cells undergoing zzso transformation zzso The objectives of this study were to examine more closely the relation between zzso zzso zzso and serum response factor zzso transcription, and to specifically test whether zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso We report here that zzso stimulates zzso and promotes zzso expression of zzso marker genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso prevented zzso reorganization into stress zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso with the selective zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso blocked zzso prevented the appearance of zzso and zzso cells, and abolished expression and nuclear zzso of zzso To test the role of zzso signaling for zzso differentiation in zzso quail zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso or vehicle and then grafted into zzso host chick zzso to produce a zzso zzso The ability of grafted cells to participate in coronary vessel formation was monitored by zzso with zzso for quail cell nuclear zzso and zzso marker zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso failed to form zzso in zzso Time course studies traced this zzso to a failure of zzso zzso cells to migrate into or survive within the zzso In zzso these data point to important roles for zzso signaling in molecular pathways controlling zzso zzso zzso transcription, and cell survival that are required to produce zzso from zzso zzso
