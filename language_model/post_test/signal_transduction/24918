zzso zzso involves the zzso and coordinated movement of large populations of cells that give rise to the zzso zzso and zzso germ zzso Although many of the genes involved in the zzso of cell identity during this process have been identified, little is known of the genes that coordinate cell zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso locus encodes zzso and that zzso activity is required for cells to undergo correct zzso extension movements during zzso In the absence of zzso function, abnormal extension of zzso tissue results in zzso and other zzso defects in the zzso The requirement for zzso is cell zzso and our results indicate that the correct extension of zzso tissue is at least partly dependent on zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso is rescued by a truncated form of zzso that does not signal through the zzso zzso pathway, suggesting that, as in flies, zzso zzso might mediate zzso events through a divergent signal zzso zzso Our results provide genetic and experimental evidence that zzso activity in lateral zzso has a crucial role in driving the zzso extension movements underlying zzso zzso
