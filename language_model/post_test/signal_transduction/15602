Progressive loss of zzso has been documented as an early zzso in the development of zzso zzso In a variety of zzso diseases, including diabetic zzso the zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso has been demonstrated to promote zzso death and the development of zzso In this manuscript we analyzed the role of zzso zzso on zzso induced zzso in zzso 

To accomplish this we generated stable zzso zzso deficient zzso cell lines and examined zzso and zzso signaling signatures as well as zzso zzso after stimulation with zzso 

After stimulation with zzso we can demonstrate an enhanced and prolonged zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso signaling via zzso is significantly zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso is also prolonged in the zzso When we analyzed the underlying mechanisms we found a zzso zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed that the zzso is less zzso in zzso zzso 

Since we can demonstrate a key role for zzso in the signaling response after stimulation with zzso we conclude that zzso might be an interesting target zzso as a zzso zzso zzso
