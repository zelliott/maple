Our recent study revealed that soluble factors derived from accessory cells zzso zzso and physical interaction with T cells of the accessory cells are both required for the induction of the proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells by zzso zzso coupled on latex zzso The accessory zzso soluble factor could be replaced by zzso and zzso and the role of live zzso for physical interaction with T cells was found to be zzso with zzso zzso provided the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso before zzso zzso analysis in the present study revealed that zzso and zzso act zzso to induce zzso proliferation in the above system but either one of the factors alone reveals only a marginal or weak zzso Furthermore, it was shown that the zzso activity of the culture zzso of zzso was substantially inhibited by zzso zzso Taken together with our previous results that zzso serum strongly inhibited the zzso activity of the culture zzso these results indicate that the main responsible molecules in the culture zzso are zzso and zzso although a presence of other effective factors is not zzso The zzso zzso zzso by T cells in the presence of zzso and zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that the proliferation of T cells in this system is mostly zzso by a zzso zzso Our study further showed that accessory cells seem to acquire cell surface properties necessary for the effective interaction with T cells during zzso zzso of culture with zzso Presumably, a certain zzso required for the interaction is induced on the cell surface of the zzso by zzso
