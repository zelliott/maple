The class zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is activated downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors on zzso zzso deletion of individual genes for class zzso regulatory zzso severely zzso the development and function of B cells but not T zzso Here we analyze conditional zzso mice in which zzso and T cells lack the major class zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These cells exhibit nearly complete loss of zzso signaling downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nevertheless, zzso development is largely zzso and peripheral T cells show only partial zzso in proliferation and zzso production in zzso Both genetic and zzso experiments suggest that class zzso zzso signaling plays a limited role in zzso proliferation driven by zzso zzso In zzso class zzso T cells provide reduced help to B cells but show normal ability to mediate zzso zzso Together these findings provide definitive evidence that class zzso zzso regulatory zzso are essential for a subset of zzso functions while challenging the notion that this signaling mechanism is a critical zzso of zzso signals downstream of zzso
