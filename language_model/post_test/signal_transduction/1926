zzso family zzso zzso activity is suppressed by two zzso zzso These involve binding of the zzso domain to the zzso zzso tail and association of the zzso domain with a zzso type II zzso formed by the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of the zzso family member zzso by zzso zzso binding or by zzso zzso zzso does not affect tail zzso zzso in zzso Surprisingly, replacement of the wild type zzso tail with a zzso zzso zzso sequence did not affect zzso zzso or downstream signaling by these zzso mechanisms, suggesting that zzso through zzso occurs without zzso zzso These results identify zzso interaction as an independent mode of zzso zzso regulation in zzso and suggest that different mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso may generate distinct output signals because of differences in zzso or zzso domain zzso
