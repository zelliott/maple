Clinical use of the zzso agent zzso zzso is limited by its zzso zzso Attempts to decrease zzso injury showed promising results in zzso but failed to reduce the adverse effects of zzso in zzso suggesting that other mechanisms contribute to its zzso as zzso Evidence that zzso also zzso cardiac injury by compromising zzso zzso integrity is zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso is known for its zzso function, and for modulating cellular zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso zzso the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso (2 zzso for 12 weeks to induce zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso compared to zzso zzso Surviving zzso zzso mice had depressed cardiac function compared to zzso animals, accompanied by increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso damage in the absence of zzso was associated with impaired zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso compared to zzso The absence of zzso in zzso and in zzso reduced zzso zzso both under zzso conditions and after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso unveiling a unique feedback loop between zzso and zzso Finally, enhanced zzso disruption in zzso zzso hearts went along with increased zzso zzso zzso Taken together, this study is the first to provide evidence for the implication of the zzso element zzso in protecting against zzso cardiac injury and zzso
