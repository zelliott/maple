zzso patterning is a zzso theme during embryonic zzso To zzso its fundamental principles, the hair zzso is an attractive model due to its easy accessibility and zzso zzso zzso asymmetry is evident from its angling and the zzso of associated zzso However, zzso patterning is not restricted to the zzso itself but also generates zzso hair zzso asymmetry which, for zzso zzso generates zzso zzso that alternately point into opposite zzso Here we show by analyzing zzso and transgenic mice that zzso and zzso signaling are involved in the control of the molecular and zzso asymmetry of the zzso and the associated hair zzso zzso zzso is affected by polarized zzso and zzso signaling in mature hair zzso When zzso signaling is impaired, molecular asymmetry is lost and mice no longer form zzso zzso Both signaling pathways affect the polarized expression of zzso which likely functions as a directional reference for hair zzso production in all zzso We propose that this regulatory zzso also establishes zzso asymmetry during zzso Moreover, the identified molecular hierarchy offers a model for the periodic patterning of zzso hairs mechanistically similar to zzso zzso
