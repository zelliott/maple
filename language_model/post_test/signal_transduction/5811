The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso exhibit polar plasma membrane zzso zzso and play a key role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promotes its PM zzso However, the underlying mechanisms remain zzso Here, we show that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso was impaired in zzso zzso signaling zzso Similarly, reducing membrane zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso zzso Gas zzso zzso analyses indicate that membrane zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso supporting a link between membrane zzso and zzso signaling in regulating zzso zzso We show that zzso promoted zzso recycling from zzso to the PM and increased zzso steady state levels in the PM zzso Furthermore, we show that the positive effect of zzso on zzso levels in the PM was impaired by zzso membrane zzso or zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited pronounced defects in primary root zzso and zzso zzso Our data collectively indicate that, although there are distinct processes involved in zzso regulation of specific zzso zzso the zzso processes are required for zzso regulation of zzso recycling, and PM zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
