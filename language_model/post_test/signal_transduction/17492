zzso modifications of proteins are involved in determining their activities, stability, and specificity of zzso More than 140 major and minor modifications of proteins have been zzso Of these, only a few have been studied in relation to the aging of cells, zzso and zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several of these modifications occur on proteins involved in crucial cellular zzso such as DNA zzso protein zzso protein degradation, signal zzso zzso organization, and the components of zzso zzso Some of the modifications are the markers of abnormal and altered proteins for rapid zzso Others make them less susceptible to degradation by normal zzso zzso and hence these accumulate during zzso
