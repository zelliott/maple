Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the complex interactions between components of the zzso zzso and the zzso immune system can involve either direct contact with zzso cells in the zzso zzso or, zzso contact with zzso cells lining the zzso that then influence the function of zzso zzso Although in some cases these interactions involve signaling specific to particular organisms and in others, to classes of organisms, a common theme is that signaling is invariably channeled through receptors that address many organisms or all organisms such as the zzso receptors zzso and zzso Here, I review this information with the intention of identifying how the zzso zzso influences specific functions of the zzso immune system such the production of particular zzso as well as broader functions such as the maintenance of zzso immune zzso and host zzso
