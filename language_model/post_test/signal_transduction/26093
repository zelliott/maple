zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso zzso protein essential for protein quality control in the zzso as well as a central regulator of unfolded protein response zzso The induction of zzso is well established as a marker for zzso zzso Recently, mouse models targeting the zzso zzso indicate that zzso has critical roles in cancer zzso drug resistance, zzso neurological diseases, and zzso The discovery of a zzso zzso zzso and cell surface zzso adds new insights to its function beyond the zzso compartment in regulating growth factor signaling and cell zzso Here, we zzso and update several approaches for the detection and zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell surface zzso and the use of small interfering zzso to zzso zzso zzso These techniques can be applied to culture cells as well as zzso
