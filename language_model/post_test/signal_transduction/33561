In order to identify novel zzso signaling molecules involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso processes in the freshwater zzso zzso zzso we initiated a systematic zzso screening project, the zzso zzso zzso In the project, twelve zzso were identified so zzso The zzso family is composed of seven members, which share a zzso motif at their zzso All the peptides have an ability to induce metamorphosis of zzso zzso zzso larvae into zzso In zzso zzso induce detachment of the bud from a parental zzso A zzso zzso enhances zzso differentiation by inducing the zzso zzso stem cells to enter the zzso differentiation zzso A zzso zzso zzso specifically and zzso zzso contraction of the zzso muscle of the body column, in particularly in the zzso region of zzso zzso that totally lack nerve zzso Two members of a novel zzso family zzso were contained in the same zzso However, they have opposite zzso functions in zzso zzso From these results, it seems fair to say reasonable to conclude that the so-called zzso nervous system of zzso is in reality more complex than generally zzso
