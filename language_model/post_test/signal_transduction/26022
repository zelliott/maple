zzso monitoring of many functioning zzso is essential for understanding zzso dysfunction as an early event in the progression to zzso zzso optical signal zzso imaging has been shown to allow high resolution detection of zzso zzso responses in the zzso and other neural zzso In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso imaging for functional examination of insulin zzso zzso cells, a popular model for investigating diabetes associated zzso zzso Our experiments indicate that zzso imaging permits simultaneous monitoring of zzso zzso responses in multiple cells with high spatial zzso and zzso zzso zzso Rapid zzso image sequences revealed transient optical responses that had time courses tightly correlated with the zzso zzso
