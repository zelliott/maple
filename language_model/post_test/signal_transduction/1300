zzso zzso are channels in the plant cell wall that in conjunction with associated zzso form an zzso communication network that supports the zzso and long-distance trafficking of a wide spectrum of zzso proteins and zzso zzso The trafficking of such zzso is of importance in the orchestration of zzso autonomous zzso and zzso zzso Plant viruses zzso movement proteins zzso that zzso this communication network to facilitate the spread of zzso These viral proteins thus represent excellent experimental keys for exploring the mechanisms involved in zzso trafficking and communication via zzso
