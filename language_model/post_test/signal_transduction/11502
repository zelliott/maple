The zzso clock in the zzso nucleus zzso is thought to drive daily rhythms of behavior by zzso factors that act locally within the zzso In a systematic screen, we identified transforming growth zzso zzso as a likely zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is expressed rhythmically in the zzso and when infused into the third zzso it zzso inhibited locomotor activity and disrupted zzso zzso zzso These actions are zzso by zzso growth factor zzso receptors on zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Mice with a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited excessive daytime locomotor activity and failed to suppress activity when exposed to zzso These results zzso zzso zzso signaling in the daily control of locomotor activity, and identify a neural circuit in the zzso that likely mediates the regulation of behavior both by the zzso and the zzso
