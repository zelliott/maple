According to the prevailing zzso zzso are short-lived cells that undergo spontaneous zzso within 24 hours of their release from the bone zzso However, zzso survival can be significantly prolonged within inflamed tissue by zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso During screening experiments aimed at identifying the effect of the adhesive zzso on zzso survival, we found that zzso zzso was able to delay both spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso survival was as efficient as that induced by the zzso zzso and provided an zzso increased delay in zzso when given in combination with zzso zzso delivered its zzso effect through binding the zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso shares significant features with the zzso survival signaling pathway, requiring zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as de zzso protein zzso but the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso were slower and more sustained compared with zzso This study demonstrates a novel functional role for zzso in zzso biology and suggests that adhesive signaling pathways provide an important zzso checkpoint for the resolution of inflammatory responses in zzso
