According to the zzso raft theory, the plasma membrane contains small zzso enriched in cholesterol and zzso which may serve as platforms to organize membrane zzso Using zzso zzso to zzso membrane cholesterol, many G zzso receptors have been shown to depend on putative zzso zzso for proper zzso Here we examine the hypothesis that treatment of zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso or zzso receptors zzso zzso with zzso will reduce zzso zzso signaling to zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso zzso to acutely inhibit zzso zzso or to cause zzso of zzso zzso following chronic treatment was attenuated with zzso These effects were due to removal of cholesterol, because zzso of cholesterol restored zzso responses back to control values, and were confirmed in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso The effects of zzso may be due to zzso of the zzso zzso from G proteins but were not because of decreases in zzso number and were not zzso by zzso zzso In contrast to the results in zzso zzso cells, zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells had no effect on acute zzso or zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The differential responses of zzso and zzso zzso to cholesterol depletion suggest that zzso receptors are more dependent on cholesterol for efficient signaling than delta receptors and can be partly explained by zzso of zzso but not zzso receptors in zzso and zzso membrane zzso
