To investigate the zzso capacity and the production of zzso signals in zzso bacteria isolated from a food production environment, and the possible correlation between both zzso 

zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from equipment and working surfaces in a raw vegetable processing line, and tested for zzso capacity using an in zzso zzso zzso All zzso showed significantly higher zzso capacity than zzso coli laboratory strain zzso which was included as a negative control, and differed up to zzso in relative zzso zzso Various zzso based on reporter bacteria were used to detect zzso signals produced by the zzso Twenty-six zzso produced zzso five zzso produced zzso zzso zzso and none produced the zzso zzso zzso 

No correlation was found between in zzso zzso capacity and production of zzso zzso molecules among the 68 strains isolated from the raw vegetable processing zzso 

Several recent studies have shown a role of zzso zzso sensing in zzso formation of specific zzso bacterial zzso The current work shows that production of AHL and other zzso signals is not widespread in zzso zzso from a raw vegetable processing line, and is not a general requirement for zzso formation, at least in zzso
