The molecular mechanisms that govern the survival, maturation and export of zzso are the subject of intense study, and candidates for involvement in these processes might be identified by their differential expression during zzso zzso One such zzso is the zzso zzso which is not expressed on most zzso zzso zzso cells in the normal zzso We have examined zzso expression on zzso from several class zzso and class zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice, and have found a strong correlation between zzso expression and positive zzso zzso expression in zzso was formally demonstrated to be dependent upon zzso recognition as evidenced by studying zzso from zzso mice which totally lack expression of this zzso This link between selection and zzso expression was reminiscent of zzso and indeed the majority of selected zzso from normal mice that express zzso also express zzso We compared zzso and zzso induction in zzso using zzso zzso from zzso mice that were zzso either with zzso against zzso or with zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso The data shows that with either zzso zzso is induced rapidly on the zzso surface with expression detected in as little as 2 zzso zzso induction is slower with zzso expression taking up to 20 zzso We also zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso strain with zzso zzso with peptides of varying affinities for the zzso Here zzso peptides which induce zzso expression poorly were able to induce significant levels of zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the induction of zzso and zzso upon selection is not zzso Thus a combination of the zzso and zzso selection markers may be a powerful tool to isolate zzso that have either been very recently selected or have arisen from differing zzso affinity interactions during zzso
