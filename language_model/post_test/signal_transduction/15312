The zzso zzso contains ten genes that zzso class II zzso zzso of which the two that are related most closely to zzso zzso gamma zzso were named zzso and zzso Although the zzso has become a popular model system to study immune mechanisms, and although zzso are central regulators of zzso which zzso zzso zzso functionally to zzso zzso has not been zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso the functions of zzso and zzso and have identified a subset of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes as zzso targets in the zzso zzso these genes are zzso in response to raised levels of either zzso or zzso zzso studies using two different pathogens show that zzso zzso is required for resistance against bacterial infections in the young zzso and that the levels of zzso need to be regulated zzso raising zzso levels zzso fish zzso against bacterial zzso zzso injected with high doses of zzso coli are able to clear the bacteria within a day, and the zzso are necessary for this zzso zzso The protective response to zzso zzso a natural fish pathogen that is lethal at low doses, also requires zzso As in the induction of target zzso the two zzso act at least partly zzso Together with the previously demonstrated type III zzso response, these results show that the counterparts of the zzso viral and bacterial zzso zzso functions are in place in zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are functionally equivalent to zzso zzso
