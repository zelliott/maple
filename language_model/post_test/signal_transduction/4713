The zzso has recently been identified as an important zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso colitis and cancer, but the zzso involved remains incompletely zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso is a central regulator of multiple inflammatory signaling zzso One important target of zzso may be the signaling zzso downstream of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which has been associated with many human zzso Here, we show that long-term exposure of zzso cells, a model of human zzso zzso with zzso led to a striking increase in cell surface zzso zzso an effect that was completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso binding by zzso and zzso binding zzso was associated with enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity, prolonged zzso zzso and a significant increase in zzso zzso expression compared with zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso expression and signaling in primary zzso isolated from human colon zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be a plausible mechanism to explain the exaggerated cellular responsiveness that characterizes inflammatory zzso disease and that may contribute to a zzso that zzso to zzso cancer through enhanced zzso zzso
