G zzso receptors zzso play an integral role in the signal zzso of an enormous array of biological phenomena, thereby serving to zzso at a molecular level almost all components of human zzso This role is nowhere more evident than in cardiovascular biology, where zzso regulate such core measures of cardiovascular function as heart rate, zzso and vascular zzso zzso interaction zzso signal zzso zzso and requires the presence of the zzso at the plasma zzso Plasma membrane zzso is in turn a function of the delivery of a zzso to and removal from the cell surface, a concept defined most broadly as zzso zzso This review illuminates our current view of zzso trafficking, particularly within the cardiovascular system, as well as highlights the recent and provocative finding that components of the zzso trafficking machinery can facilitate zzso signaling independent of G protein zzso
