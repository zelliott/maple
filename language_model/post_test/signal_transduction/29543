A variety of rod zzso zzso result in zzso dominant zzso zzso and zzso night zzso in zzso One subset of these zzso encodes zzso active forms of the rod zzso zzso Some of these dominant rod zzso zzso zzso which zzso transgenic zzso zzso provide an animal model for zzso night zzso In a genetic screen to identify retinal zzso zzso in zzso we identified a dominant zzso in the zzso gene zzso that encodes the zzso that is expressed in zzso zzso Deep zzso analysis and zzso showed that the zzso was attributable to a zzso zzso zzso recordings revealed that the zzso zzso zzso cells were strongly zzso which partially masked their zzso zzso This zzso primarily resulted from both the persistent binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Whereas zzso in several zzso genes other than zzso were shown to induce zzso cell zzso by stabilizing a zzso complex, zzso represented the first zzso zzso that stabilized this protein zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso led to elevated levels of zzso in the zzso which zzso a novel retinal zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso completely rescued the zzso zzso cell death, which indicated that the zzso is entirely dependent on both zzso and zzso Such a combination of multiple pathological pathways resulting from a single zzso may zzso several dominant retinal diseases in zzso
