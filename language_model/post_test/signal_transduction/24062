The association of familial Alzheimer's disease zzso with zzso in Alzheimer's zzso precursor protein zzso suggests important functions for zzso in the central nervous zzso zzso in zzso impair its function to zzso resistance to zzso in cells under stress, and this may contribute to zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso brain, but the mechanisms involved are zzso We examined the role of the late zzso virus 40 zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso We show that in zzso zzso cells, expression of zzso human zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso This zzso was further enhanced by expression of zzso although zzso alone was not sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso led to a marked increase in zzso cell death that was significantly blocked by zzso These effects of zzso were accompanied by zzso nuclear zzso and dependent gene zzso The zzso of zzso is dependent on the expression of zzso and is inhibited by the expression of zzso forms of either zzso zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for the zzso effects of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso by aberrations in zzso and/or zzso could promote zzso loss in zzso brain, due to secondary zzso Thus a link is established between zzso and zzso and zzso
