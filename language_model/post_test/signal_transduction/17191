zzso undergo significant zzso after traumatic brain injury zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways control brain zzso during development and under pathological zzso How the zzso zzso pathways are regulated in the brain after zzso remains largely unknown, zzso This study used the rat fluid percussion injury model to investigate changes in the zzso zzso pathways after zzso The results showed that zzso leads to zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso proteins from zzso fraction to the membrane fraction after zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso are significantly activated by zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso pathways are key regulators of brain zzso these results depict regulatory mechanisms of the zzso zzso pathways after zzso and pave the way for the study of therapeutic agents targeting the zzso zzso pathways for functional recovery after zzso
