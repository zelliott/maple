zzso zzso differentiation is essential for zzso formation and the establishment of zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that coordinate zzso development in the brain are largely zzso We found that the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoting complex zzso regulates zzso differentiation in primary zzso zzso zzso and in the rat zzso zzso zzso triggered the degradation of the zzso factor zzso and thereby promoted zzso zzso The zzso target gene zzso zzso II, which acts locally at zzso sites, zzso the ability of zzso to suppress zzso zzso Thus, our findings define a zzso zzso signaling zzso that zzso zzso development, which holds important implications for zzso connectivity and plasticity in the zzso
