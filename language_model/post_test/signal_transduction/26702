Cellular zzso suppresses cancer by arresting the proliferation of cells at risk for zzso zzso Recently, zzso cells were shown to zzso numerous zzso growth factors, and zzso that can alter the tissue zzso and may promote age-related zzso To identify small molecules that suppress the zzso zzso zzso zzso we developed a screening protocol using normal human zzso and a library of compounds that are approved for human zzso Among the promising library constituents was the zzso zzso Both zzso and the related zzso cortisol decreased the production and zzso of selected zzso zzso including several zzso zzso zzso the zzso suppressed the zzso without reverting the tumor zzso growth arrest and were zzso whether cells were induced to zzso by zzso radiation or strong zzso signals delivered by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso component zzso required the zzso zzso which, in the presence of zzso inhibited zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combining zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate feasibility of screening for compounds that inhibit the effects of zzso zzso They further show that zzso inhibit selected components of the zzso and suggest that zzso and zzso two zzso drugs, might exert their effects in part by suppressing zzso zzso
