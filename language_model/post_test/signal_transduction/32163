zzso is the process by which physical forces are sensed and converted into zzso signals that then result in cellular zzso The discovery and development of various molecular pathways involved in this process have revolutionized the fundamental and clinical understanding regarding the formation and progression of zzso zzso The aim of this review is to report the recent advances in zzso zzso zzso The zzso pathways that participate in the formation and growth of zzso scars can be divided into those whose role in zzso has been proven (the zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso and those who have a possible but as yet unproven role (such as zzso and G zzso zzso zzso and zzso During zzso development, these cellular zzso pathways interact actively with the zzso zzso They also zzso extensively with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso pathways provides a new platform for understanding zzso zzso This better understanding will facilitate research into this promising field and may help to promote the development of pharmacological interventions that could ultimately zzso zzso or even reverse zzso formation or zzso
