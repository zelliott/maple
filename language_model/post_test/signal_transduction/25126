In addition to the zzso interaction with classical and novel protein zzso C zzso zzso the zzso zzso tumor promoters bind to other receptors lacking zzso zzso Among these novel zzso zzso zzso two families of proteins may play a role in the regulation of cell growth and zzso transformation: zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso These proteins possess a single copy of the C1 domain that is involved in binding of zzso zzso and the zzso second zzso zzso Four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated zzso all of them possessing zzso protein activity for zzso a small zzso protein that controls zzso zzso organization, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso and promotes zzso transformation in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The C1 domain in zzso may, therefore, have a dominant role in zzso zzso and is essential for zzso zzso zzso of downstream zzso of zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, a novel concept emerges in which zzso zzso may exert cellular responses through pathways not involving zzso zzso zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso zzso receptors adds an additional level of complexity to the understanding of zzso zzso effects and the molecular mechanisms of zzso
