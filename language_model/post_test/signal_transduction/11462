The zzso zzso family zzso are versatile molecular switches in many processes during plant growth, development, and responses to the zzso To understand how zzso achieves its functional versatility in zzso we performed a zzso identification of putative zzso targets using a combination of the zzso zzso method, zzso tools, and a robust functional zzso in zzso In this study, we have identified 11 zzso genes zzso novel zzso termed zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso that contain a zzso (for zzso zzso motif required for their specific interaction with zzso zzso zzso are divergent and classified into five groups that share little sequence zzso outside of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in tobacco zzso tubes of the nine Ric genes that are expressed in zzso zzso causes distinct zzso zzso distinct functions for various zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both cause zzso growth like zzso and display zzso zzso to the tip of zzso tubes, suggesting that these zzso may be two distinct targets of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso I) promotes zzso tube zzso but does not affect zzso tube growth polarity and shows zzso zzso to the zzso suggesting that zzso may participate in a zzso zzso probably controlled by a different zzso zzso of all other zzso causes various degrees of growth zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso zzso also exhibit distinct patterns of zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that various zzso have evolved to interact with zzso zzso and to perform distinct functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that six of the nine zzso are expressed in various parts of zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that zzso function as zzso zzso targets that control various zzso signaling pathways in zzso
