Construction of large and zzso signaling pathways is essential to understand information processing under normal and pathological zzso On this front, zzso approaches offer the advantage of large zzso exploration whereas zzso approaches offer a more reliable view of zzso activities but are zzso to small zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate an zzso zzso approach to construct large signaling pathways from zzso data within a zzso time zzso Our zzso advantage of the fast turnaround time of the zzso zzso carried out in four steps: zzso screen optimal zzso zzso zzso select the responsive ones, zzso combine them in a zzso fashion to construct a zzso zzso and zzso zzso a reduced generic zzso via an zzso Linear zzso zzso As a case study, we uncover novel players and their corresponding pathways in primary human zzso by interrogating the signal zzso downstream of 81 receptors of interest and constructing a detailed model for the responsive part of the network zzso 177 species (of which 14 are zzso and 365 zzso
