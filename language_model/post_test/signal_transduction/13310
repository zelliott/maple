The zzso signaling zzso is essential for embryonic development and can be involved in zzso when zzso zzso In a subset of zzso tumors, zzso zzso have been identified, and this suggested that zzso activated zzso signaling may contribute to zzso of this zzso Because zzso has been recognized as a main component of zzso zzso and its zzso were reported in several types of zzso we analyzed zzso gene zzso in 22 pediatric zzso zzso zzso sets of the zzso which cover the whole coding region of the zzso zzso were used for zzso zzso zzso revealing zzso band patterns were further analyzed for zzso We have only identified 4 silent zzso in the coding region and 3 zzso zzso in zzso zzso accordingly no zzso gene zzso were zzso Our results indicated that zzso of zzso gene as a mechanism of zzso are not associated with pediatric zzso tumors including zzso zzso
