In zzso zzso of the three germ layers is one of the earliest zzso decisions occurring prior to zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has a central role in cell autonomous zzso of zzso and in the generation of zzso zzso Yet, zzso zzso factors that cooperate with zzso signals are less zzso Here we report that the zzso factors zzso and zzso are expressed in the animal zzso before zzso zzso At the initiation of zzso transcription, expression of zzso expands into the marginal region that gives rise to zzso zzso of zzso delayed zzso movements, prevented zzso zzso at the subsequent zzso stage and caused severe defects in zzso zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso reduced the expression of genes involved in zzso formation and zzso We also report that zzso functions with zzso signaling in a positive feedback zzso each zzso the expression of the other in the marginal region and both are necessary for zzso gene zzso One target of zzso is the zzso 1 gene zzso that mediates some of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso associates with zzso regulatory sequences of the zzso zzso Several zzso binding sites within the zzso promoter region of zzso were identified by their in zzso association with zzso zzso The same promoter region was necessary but not sufficient to mediate zzso activity in a reporter gene zzso In sum, our results indicate that the zzso protein is a key zzso factor in the marginal zone acting in a positive feedback loop with zzso signaling that promotes zzso zzso at late zzso zzso
