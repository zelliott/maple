zzso or zzso was shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and downstream zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso activity of zzso or in zzso translated zzso and zzso was equally inhibited by zzso in in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso signal zzso was also inhibited in cells lacking zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso and cannot be used as a specific zzso zzso inhibitor to study the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
