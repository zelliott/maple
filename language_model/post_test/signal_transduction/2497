The liver plays a crucial role in the acute phase response after zzso mechanisms responsible for zzso inflammatory signals to the nucleus to initiate this response are not zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the induction of the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in the liver after burn zzso zzso were subjected to either a zzso burn or sham zzso zzso were removed over a time course and extracted for nuclear zzso We found that zzso but not zzso binding was predominantly increased in the liver after burn injury as assessed by gel mobility and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso nuclear protein levels were increased 6- to zzso in the zzso of burned rats compared with those of sham zzso zzso zzso was rapidly induced after burn zzso the subsequent increase of zzso binding was completely blocked by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a differential and early induction of zzso binding activity occurs in the liver after burn zzso this induction is zzso by an increase in zzso These findings suggest an important role for zzso in zzso inflammatory signals to the nucleus of liver cells after a systemic burn zzso
