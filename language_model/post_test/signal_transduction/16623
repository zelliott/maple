zzso heads interacting with zzso zzso a process fueled by zzso and regulated by zzso powers the zzso action of the human zzso zzso of zzso the competition between zzso its products of zzso and zzso for binding to myosin, and the sequence of shifting affinities in that competition, constitute the central mechanism of muscular zzso The force, work, and power produced during the cardiac cycle stems from an zzso of the zzso head that is closely associated with strong binding of zzso to zzso and release of zzso While fluctuations of zzso zzso bound to zzso and related shifts in zzso on the thin filaments regulate the number of zzso on a zzso basis, the zzso work produced is zzso by a delayed force response to stretch that develops during zzso This zzso zzso response is facilitated by specialized zzso structures, including zzso portions of the zzso essential light chain and zzso binding protein C, which are thought to guide and orient the zzso head or enhance thin filament zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory light chain, zzso binding protein C, and zzso T also assist in this zzso Animal models show zzso shifts in zzso and other zzso proteins have major effects on power zzso but zzso shifts in human zzso are modest at best and are therefore likely to play only a minor role in modulating zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso modifications of the zzso proteins and to changes in their chemical zzso
