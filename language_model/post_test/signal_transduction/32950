zzso of the zzso zzso to the regulated zzso zzso zzso the binding of a sorting signal to a sorting zzso identified as membrane zzso E zzso The sorting zzso located at the N zzso of zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed on the surface of an zzso zzso In this study, molecular modeling of zzso predicted that the zzso zzso in the zzso signal bind specifically to two basic zzso zzso and zzso present in a loop unique to zzso compared with other zzso To test the model, these two zzso on zzso were zzso to zzso or Ala, followed by zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso containing zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso or both zzso zzso showed no binding of zzso (which contains the zzso signal zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, substitution of an zzso to zzso at a zzso site, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso did not affect the level of zzso binding when compared zzso type zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso signal motif zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminated binding to zzso zzso These results indicate that the sorting signal of zzso zzso and zzso specifically interacts with zzso and zzso at a novel binding site, independent of the active site on zzso
