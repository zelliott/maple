During the last decade, extensive research has been performed in the field of orthopedic medicine to develop zzso therapies for the restoration of injured bone zzso We previously demonstrated that human primary fetal bone cells zzso associated with porous scaffolds induced a bone formation in critical zzso zzso however, the environmental factors regulating their behavior in culture have not been zzso zzso zzso fetal zzso week zzso were compared to zzso human zzso stem cells zzso for their capacity to zzso and differentiate into zzso under various culture zzso When cultured in standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased cell proliferation of both cell zzso Investigation of the zzso capacity of zzso and zzso in a normal culture medium indicated that zzso expressed higher expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso markers compared with zzso while zzso was expressed at very low levels in both cells zzso However, zzso but not zzso enhanced zzso markers in response to zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso with zzso factors increased cell numbers and reduced zzso differentiation in zzso with the opposite effect seen in zzso Associated with a higher expression of zzso zzso zzso produced a higher zzso extra cellular zzso compared with zzso Taken together, data presented in this study suggest that zzso have characteristics of zzso cells that are more advanced in their osteogenesis development compared with zzso stem cells, making fetal cells an interesting biological tool for treatment of skeletal defects and zzso
