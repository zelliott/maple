zzso transition zzso is a process by which zzso cells undergo zzso transition to zzso cells and thus is involved in the zzso of tumor zzso and organ zzso zzso signaling is a highly zzso zzso that regulates zzso communication and directs cell fate zzso Here, we show the critical role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling either by zzso inhibitor or by knocking down of zzso signaling molecules by small interfering zzso zzso zzso in association with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was sufficient for the induction of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling induced zzso expression via direct zzso zzso zzso these data show that zzso signaling zzso promote zzso zzso through the induction of zzso Further studies on zzso signaling may provide diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancer and zzso zzso
