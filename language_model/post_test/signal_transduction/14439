In zzso zzso zzso zzso as in humans with chronic zzso zzso obstruction triggers proliferation of zzso zzso cells that are surrounded by zzso produced by adjacent zzso cells in the zzso zzso The proximity of the zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso promotes the zzso response to zzso liver zzso zzso zzso mice, we found that zzso duct obstruction zzso activity of the zzso zzso pathway, a system that regulates the viability and differentiation of various zzso during zzso After zzso many zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in the portal zzso express zzso zzso zzso and/or target zzso zzso zzso of an immature zzso line that expresses the zzso zzso zzso zzso with liver zzso cells demonstrated that both cell types produced zzso zzso that enhanced each other's viability and zzso Further support for the concept that zzso signaling zzso the response to zzso was generated by studying zzso mice, which have an impaired ability to zzso zzso signaling due to a zzso zzso of zzso After zzso zzso mice zzso zzso gene expression earlier than zzso controls and zzso an unusually intense zzso reaction, more expanded zzso portal areas, and a greater number of zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal that adult zzso resurrect zzso signaling systems, such as the zzso pathway, to guide zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso
