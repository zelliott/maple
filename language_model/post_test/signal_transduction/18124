Several modifications of the zzso zzso which alter its zzso and zzso interaction with zzso and other zzso have been zzso However, the significance of the lateral mobility of zzso molecules in the plasma zzso as a regulator of their distribution and function, is poorly zzso We examined this problem by increasing the cholesterol content of plasma zzso and consequently zzso the fluidity of membrane zzso in rat zzso Under these conditions, the zzso of zzso zzso molecules in focal zzso their zzso to the zzso domain of zzso and their association with the zzso protein zzso were significantly enhanced as compared to control zzso However, the zzso of zzso pathways by the association of zzso with zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso zzso were zzso The treated cells also showed distinct changes in shape, and their zzso stress fiber network was more dense and thick as compared to control zzso The changes in fluidity of zzso occurred zzso and fluidity of zzso increased, while that of zzso was zzso Our results suggest that proteins in focal zzso could be zzso in specific zzso zzso which regulate specific aspects of zzso zzso zzso
