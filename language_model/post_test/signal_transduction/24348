The generation of a functional nervous system is dependent on precise zzso of zzso during zzso This zzso is directed by the distribution of local and long-range guidance cues, the latter of which are believed to be distributed in zzso zzso of guidance cues have been associated with growth cone function for over a hundred zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms used by growth cones to respond to these zzso in part zzso to the lack of identifiable zzso in zzso In the developing zzso zzso two zzso of the zzso zzso are necessary for correct zzso zzso in zzso The zzso are found in regions where growth cones make critical steering zzso Observations of different growth cone behaviors associated with these zzso have provided some insights into how growth cones respond to zzso Growth cones appear to respond more faithfully to changes in zzso rather than absolute levels, of zzso zzso whereas the absolute levels may regulate growth cone zzso
