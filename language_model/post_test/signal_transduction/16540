Three experiments demonstrated that, following the extinction of an established zzso stimulus zzso zzso zzso the pairing of an zzso stimulus from another zzso zzso light) with the zzso stimulus zzso results in strong recovery of responding to the extinguished zzso This recovery occurred to about an equal degree regardless of whether or not initial training contained zzso zzso zzso is, consistent zzso zzso some degree of zzso including zzso discrimination training, partial zzso or even zzso discrimination training zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 demonstrated that this recovery of responding was largely specific to the extinguished zzso but moderate zzso to other stimuli from the same zzso did zzso The results are discussed with reference to alternative mechanisms zzso to zzso zzso between otherwise distinct zzso These models assume that such zzso is zzso by either a shared response, shared zzso shared context, or shared hidden units within a layered neural zzso A specific layered network is proposed to explain the present results as well as other types of savings seen previously in conditioning of the rabbit zzso membrane zzso
