Several types of peripheral blood cells express ABC zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to different cellular sites and fulfill zzso functions such as zzso storage in zzso dense zzso All mature blood cells originate from the same precursor and specific zzso arise during zzso To characterize this process, zzso zzso and function of zzso and zzso were assessed in zzso human zzso zzso and leukemia cell lines using real time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and cell viability zzso Median zzso zzso copy numbers were significantly enhanced by zzso differentiation from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso copies per zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for native and differentiated cells, respectively, p zzso zzso and zzso protein was localized to zzso structures and to the plasma membrane both in differentiated zzso and bone zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso decreased during maturation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for native zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells in the presence of zzso p zzso zzso and was significantly reduced in mature zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not significantly altered under all differentiation zzso These results indicate that zzso expression is zzso regulated during zzso The increase of zzso together with its specific zzso during differentiation toward zzso supports the concept of zzso specific functions whereas decreased zzso expression in zzso differentiation may have implications for zzso
