zzso zzso zzso is required for proliferation of zzso zzso cell zzso precursors during development and is zzso in certain zzso zzso To identify genes expressed specifically in zzso cell zzso zzso we used zzso zzso to analyze regulation of zzso zzso sequence tags in zzso primary cultures of zzso mouse zzso that respond to the zzso Sonic zzso In zzso we applied zzso noise models to render a zzso robust indication of zzso in Sonic zzso zzso Twelve genes so identified were tested, and 10 zzso showed appropriate expression in the external zzso layer zzso of the zzso day zzso 7 zzso and zzso by zzso 15, as verified by in zzso zzso zzso profiling of the developing zzso was carried out from zzso 1 to 30 to generate a database of zzso gene regulation profiles zzso From the database an zzso was developed to capture the zzso typical of zzso zzso The zzso accurately predicted expression in zzso of an additional 18 zzso sequence tags with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso We then compared the positive zzso value of our zzso procedure with other widely used methods, as verified by the zzso in zzso These findings suggest that replicate experiments and incorporation of noise models increase zzso zzso They further show that zzso methods are an effective means to identify zzso gene expression in the developing zzso cell zzso
