zzso of blood zzso is a fundamental zzso in the zzso zzso is released from pancreatic zzso in response to changes in blood zzso the zzso of which leads to impaired insulin zzso and diabetes zzso zzso zzso that release insulin occupy approximately zzso of the zzso cells, while zzso zzso zzso are also present in zzso zzso analysis of zzso is a direct approach for studying mechanisms of insulin zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso in zzso and its concentration and zzso can be measured in real time by zzso imaging using zzso zzso metabolism is assessed by zzso of zzso by its zzso Furthermore, zzso are equipped with zzso channels, which zzso zzso zzso signals to electric zzso zzso analysis by patch clamp techniques detects the activity of various zzso channels and membrane zzso Several zzso lines including zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso are zzso however, they do not necessarily retain normal responsiveness to zzso zzso analysis of zzso functions of zzso requires the use of acutely isolated or primary cultured zzso from normal zzso The methods for preparation of zzso and single zzso using zzso can be applied to a variety of animals of small to large sizes, which can produce zzso and zzso with zzso responsiveness to zzso These primary cultured zzso can be used for zzso signal zzso mechanisms, and evaluating effects of drugs, providing excellent tools for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
