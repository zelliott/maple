zzso receptors mediate adhesive events that are critical for a specific and effective immune response to foreign zzso zzso interactions of zzso and zzso cells zzso to zzso regulate the efficiency and specificity of trafficking into secondary zzso zzso and peripheral zzso Within these sites, zzso facilitate cell movement via interactions with the zzso zzso and promote and stabilize zzso interactions between T zzso and zzso that are critical for initiating T zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the role of zzso in T zzso zzso with a focus on how these receptors participate in zzso zzso and T cell zzso how zzso stimulation regulates zzso activity, and how zzso define functionally unique zzso of T cells and zzso
