zzso zzso in the zzso area zzso are critical for zzso zzso surge release of zzso hormone zzso however, it is not clear which zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The goals of the present studies were: zzso to determine whether zzso regulates zzso zzso similarly in two subdivisions of the zzso that play a role in zzso surge release, the zzso zzso region that contains the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the region containing the zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso to determine whether zzso zzso in either or both regions exhibit zzso changes consistent with a role in the regulation of zzso surge zzso To accomplish these goals, we measured zzso acid zzso zzso 65 and 67 zzso levels at several time points in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats exhibiting zzso surge release, and in zzso zzso rats in which zzso surge release was blocked by prior administration of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that, despite their close zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region are regulated differently from those in the zzso Only zzso in the zzso region show zzso changes in zzso 67 zzso expression that appear to be linked to zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso Our findings also indicate that a morning rise and an afternoon fall in zzso 67 zzso levels marks two zzso signals required for zzso and zzso surge zzso Finally, our results suggest that there are distinct zzso signals to the zzso and zzso regions and that these signals zzso regulate zzso 65 and 67 gene zzso
