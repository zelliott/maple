The ubiquitous toxic zzso zzso elicits zzso adverse and zzso responses in zzso zzso The biological targets of zzso are largely unknown at zzso We analyzed the signaling zzso for induction of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso evidence revealed that induction required cap 'n' zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso response element zzso of zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso extending the zzso of zzso from 21 to 200 zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso turnover of zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso of zzso but did not disrupt the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association in the zzso In the nucleus, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso followed by zzso of zzso with a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso associated with the zzso zzso ARE zzso zzso zzso substantially increased the ARE occupancy by zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was shown to be zzso in the zzso and zzso in the nucleus in the presence of zzso without changing the protein level, implicating zzso recycling of zzso Our data reveal that zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso through a distinct mechanism from that by antioxidants and suggest an zzso model of zzso zzso in which the binding of zzso zzso zzso to ARE controls both the zzso and zzso expression of zzso
