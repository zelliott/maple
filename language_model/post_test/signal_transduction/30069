zzso of the mouse zzso along the zzso axis during body plan development requires migration of the zzso visceral zzso zzso towards the future anterior side by a mechanism that has remained zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and the zzso of its zzso are required for normal migration of the zzso Whereas zzso zzso provides the driving force for zzso migration by stimulating the proliferation of visceral zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso determine the direction of migration by zzso zzso zzso activity on the future anterior zzso
