zzso restriction zzso the only zzso intervention known to slow aging and extend life span in organisms ranging from zzso to mice, has been linked to the zzso of zzso zzso and Ras zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso life span extension caused by deficiencies in zzso zzso and zzso and by calorie zzso zzso of stress resistance zzso factors zzso and zzso which are positively regulated by zzso also caused a major although not complete zzso of the effect of calorie restriction on life zzso The deletion of both zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with calorie restriction caused a remarkable zzso life span extension, which, surprisingly, was only partially reversed by the lack of zzso These results indicate that the zzso and the zzso pathways are major zzso of the calorie zzso stress resistance and life span extension, although additional zzso are zzso zzso the zzso effect caused by the zzso of both pathways is much more potent than that caused by zzso
