The success of insects is in large part due to their ability to survive environmental stress, including heat, cold, and zzso zzso are also exposed to infection, zzso or zzso stress, and to zzso or zzso The molecular mechanisms of stress sensing and response have been widely investigated in zzso cell lines, and the area of stress research is now so vast to be beyond the scope of a single review zzso However, the mechanisms by which stress zzso to the zzso are sensed and integrated at the tissue and cellular level are less well zzso Increasingly, common molecular events between immune and other stress responses are observed in zzso and much of this work stems of efforts in insect molecular science and zzso We describe here the current knowledge in the area of immune and stress zzso and response at the level of the zzso tissue and cell, zzso on a key zzso tissue in insects, the zzso zzso and drawing together the known pathways that zzso responses to different stress zzso The zzso are critical for insect survival and are increasingly implicated in responses to multiple and distinct stress zzso zzso as zzso function is central to survival, they are potentially key targets for insect control, which will be facilitated by increased understanding of the complexities of stress zzso in the zzso
