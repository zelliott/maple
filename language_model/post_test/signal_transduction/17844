zzso mice are affected by a systemic zzso disease that results in zzso recruitment to a wide range of vascular beds, including the cerebral zzso The mechanisms responsible for the zzso trafficking to the brain in these animals are not zzso zzso the aim of this study was to directly examine the cerebral zzso in zzso mice and determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for this zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso cell interactions zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso mice at 8, 12, and 16 zzso of zzso zzso rolling and zzso were rarely observed in zzso mice of any zzso zzso mice displayed similar results at 8 and 12 zzso However, at 16 zzso significant increases in zzso rolling and zzso were observed in these zzso zzso analysis revealed that the interacting cells were exclusively zzso zzso rolling was reduced, but not eliminated in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was not reduced in these mice, indicating that zzso rolling was not required for zzso recruitment to the cerebral zzso in this model of systemic zzso zzso blockade also had no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, blockade of either the zzso zzso or zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade also significantly inhibited zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the systemic inflammatory response that affects zzso mice results in zzso rolling and zzso in the cerebral zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso these zzso
