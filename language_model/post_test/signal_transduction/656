Common to multiple vascular diseases, including zzso zzso zzso and transplant zzso is a localized inflammatory zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso respond to local inflammation and migrate from the media into the zzso of the vessel where they zzso and zzso zzso which they respond to in an zzso fashion, sustaining the progression of the zzso The deleterious effects of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso on vascular zzso and development of these zzso processes have been the subject of intense zzso Although a great deal of attention has been given to the negative effects of zzso zzso and zzso relatively little has been reported on the potentially beneficial zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso on the vascular response to zzso The vast majority of emphasis on zzso and function of zzso zzso has been placed on zzso zzso the role of zzso cells, and direct effects of zzso zzso on vascular cells is poorly zzso We will review the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso inhibit signal zzso and gene expression in inflammatory zzso We will review studies in which beneficial zzso effects of zzso zzso on progression of vascular disease are achieved by zzso of immune zzso We will also present the limited studies in which zzso effects of these zzso on zzso and zzso cells dampen the vascular response to zzso We propose that expression of zzso zzso by activated zzso may represent an zzso feed back mechanism to promote resolution of the vascular response to zzso
