Plant zzso zzso zzso mediate multiple zzso signals ranging from hormone to stress and regulate diverse cellular processes important for polarized cell growth, zzso development, zzso and responses to the zzso They shuttle between the zzso inactive state and the zzso activated state and their zzso is predominantly zzso by a family of zzso zzso exchange factors zzso referred to as zzso Using the zzso zzso as zzso we identified members of a zzso zzso zzso family as potential upstream regulators for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are emerging as important regulators for growth and development and play a crucial role in zzso zzso root hair development, a polarized cell growth zzso We therefore screened zzso zzso zzso in these zzso for root hair defects and found that zzso in one of them, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced severe root hair zzso We show that the zzso zzso correlated with reduced levels of active zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in roots and root hairs and that zzso zzso signaling in zzso countered the zzso zzso Taken together, these observations strongly support zzso as an upstream regulator for the zzso zzso that controls zzso root hair zzso Moreover, zzso was pulled down by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner zzso a dynamic signaling complex involving zzso a zzso and a zzso
