zzso disorders and the drugs used to treat them lead to changes in zzso zzso We used a genetic animal model to investigate to what extent changes in zzso signal zzso zzso a vulnerability to mood or anxiety zzso 

zzso of gene expression in a selectively bred strain of rats with a high vulnerability to develop zzso learned helplessness zzso a strain highly resistant to the same behavior zzso and zzso zzso zzso control animals were compared using quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain zzso 

zzso learned helpless animals had a zzso reduced expression of the zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso and a zzso increased level of the zzso protein zzso zzso in the prefrontal zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso Other significant changes included changes in the expression levels of the alpha zzso zzso of protein zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso 

zzso learned helpless animals show evidence of altered signal zzso and regulation of zzso compared to zzso and zzso control zzso
