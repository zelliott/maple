The zzso G protein zzso is a central player in signal zzso relaying signals from activated zzso receptors zzso to zzso and other proteins to elicit changes in zzso zzso the zzso zzso and gene zzso zzso functions at the zzso surface of the plasma zzso as do its zzso targets, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso Recent insights into the structure and function of these signaling complexes reveal several recurring themes, including complex zzso interactions between zzso its protein target, and the zzso that are likely essential for zzso control and maximum efficiency in signal zzso Thus, the plasma membrane is not only a source of zzso but also a key player in the scaffolding of zzso signaling zzso
