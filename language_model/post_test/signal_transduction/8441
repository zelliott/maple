The zzso signaling zzso regulates the intrinsic size of zzso by controlling two opposing zzso proliferation and zzso The nuclear zzso of this zzso is Yes zzso protein zzso which is a WW zzso zzso zzso In addition to WW zzso zzso has a zzso density, zzso large, zzso zzso zzso motif that is located at its zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso of zzso in cells is zzso motif dependent, we generated a delta C zzso of zzso lacking the five most zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso which constitute a zzso zzso zzso We report here that the zzso motif is necessary for zzso zzso in the nucleus, for the stabilization of zzso and for promoting zzso of zzso cells maintained at low concentration of zzso We suggest that an unknown zzso zzso protein (or zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso Since the zzso zzso acts as a tumor zzso pathway, the zzso complex of zzso represents a potential target of cancer zzso
