zzso a zzso zzso generated by the zzso of the blood zzso cascade following vessel injury, converts zzso to zzso activates zzso and several zzso factors, and plays a pivotal role in zzso and zzso zzso acts as a zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso caused proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Here, we show that a low concentration of zzso caused proliferation of mouse zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cells, while higher zzso affected cell viability in a zzso zzso Similar effects were observed when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The dying cells showed nuclear zzso and zzso suggesting that cell death occurred by zzso The extent to which zzso induced cell death was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso or by a minimum functional domain of zzso termed zzso Furthermore, a synthetic compound that zzso signaling from the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently prevented zzso zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso appear to neutralize zzso zzso
