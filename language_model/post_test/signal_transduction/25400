The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in breast cancer development and zzso zzso therapy to block the zzso zzso is highly effective, but its usefulness is limited by common intrinsic and acquired zzso Multiple mechanisms responsible for zzso resistance have been proposed and include deregulation of various components of the zzso zzso itself, zzso in cell cycle and cell survival signaling zzso and the zzso of escape pathways that can provide tumors with alternative zzso and survival zzso Among these, increased expression or signaling of growth factor zzso zzso especially the zzso pathway, has been associated with both experimental and clinical zzso therapy zzso New treatment combinations targeting both zzso and growth factor zzso signaling to block the zzso between these pathways and eliminate escape routes have been proven highly effective in zzso zzso zzso of recent clinical studies, while partly supporting this approach, also highlight the need to better identify a zzso the patients whose tumors are most likely to benefit from these specific zzso zzso
