zzso cells respond to zzso shock by zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso cascade called the zzso high zzso zzso response zzso How zzso respond to zzso shock is zzso zzso of this investigation show that a second zzso zzso cascade in zzso called the protein zzso C1 zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased rapidly in cells following a shift of the external medium to lower zzso The intensity of the response was zzso to the magnitude of the decrease in zzso zzso This response to zzso shock required upstream protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso external zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a response that was blocked by zzso a zzso active zzso in an upstream protein zzso These results indicate that zzso contain two zzso signal zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso pathway, that respond to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
