The signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso family of adapters includes zzso Ewing's zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules play critical roles in immune zzso The zzso of the zzso family, zzso is zzso in zzso zzso disease in zzso Moreover, genetically engineered mice lacking one or more zzso family members have defects in multiple immune cell types including T cells, natural killer zzso cells, zzso cells, and B zzso zzso data show that zzso family adapters regulate immunity by influencing the functions of zzso family zzso through two distinct but cooperative zzso First, zzso family adapters couple zzso family receptors to active zzso signals, which promote immune cell zzso Second, zzso family adapters interfere with the intrinsic ability of zzso family receptors to trigger zzso signals, which could be zzso via molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter effect of zzso family adapters does not seem to be because of direct blocking of zzso zzso binding to zzso family zzso Rather, it appears to zzso alternative mechanisms such as functional competition, zzso or zzso zzso In the absence of zzso family zzso the zzso signals zzso by zzso family receptors suppress critical zzso zzso explaining in part the pronounced zzso seen in zzso family zzso humans and zzso Thus, zzso family adapters are molecular switches that regulate immunity as a result of their capacity to control the type of signals and functions emanating from zzso family zzso
