zzso cells have an absolute requirement for survival and proliferation for specific growth zzso The growth factors maintain the critical vitality of the cells by stimulating zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso also occurs rapidly through the stimulation of the zzso zzso These immediate zzso events, not initiated by serum zzso appear to be necessary for the integrity of cellular viability zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce the zzso of zzso through a zzso not requiring the zzso of zzso zzso zzso A role for zzso influx or zzso release in the action of zzso or zzso has not been zzso Although zzso of zzso has been reported in response to zzso the signal zzso process of zzso and zzso appears not to be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso metabolism or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is clearly modulated by the zzso zzso yet only the zzso zzso has any known intrinsic zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso zzso and perhaps zzso appear to be zzso to zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso This may be a direct zzso interaction with zzso zzso or zzso through an intermediate protein such as those using zzso Such is the case for many hormone receptors that couple to amplifying zzso zzso zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or members of the insulin growth factor family that couple to zzso zzso in proximity to the receptors zzso One of the zzso systems that zzso zzso and other zzso stimulate appears to have some characteristics similar to zzso zzso zzso of zzso stimulate some similar zzso zzso and perhaps even zzso zzso The zzso growth factors, however, stimulate zzso zzso of some proteins that are not zzso in response to zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso systems are independently zzso Although zzso zzso stimulate many of the same zzso activities zzso synthesis in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is clearly associated with the action of zzso zzso zzso or the nuclear zzso zzso such as zzso It is zzso therefore, that zzso zzso are playing a critical role in the control of proliferation although the dominant amount of cellular protein zzso are on zzso Both classes of zzso are apparently required for zzso zzso All the zzso growth factors examined thus far stimulate the zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
