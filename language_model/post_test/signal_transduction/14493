Within the developing zzso zzso growth factors direct zzso precursors to generate zzso versus zzso a process that if zzso might lead to neural zzso In this regard, genetic zzso resulting in zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso cause Noonan zzso zzso which is associated with learning disabilities and mental zzso Here, we demonstrate that genetic zzso of zzso in cultured cortical precursors or in the embryonic zzso inhibited zzso zzso and caused enhanced and precocious zzso zzso zzso expression of an zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso decisions were similarly zzso in a mouse zzso model that zzso human zzso Thus, zzso instructs precursors to make zzso and not zzso during the zzso period, and zzso in the relative ratios of these two cell types upon zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the cognitive zzso in zzso zzso
