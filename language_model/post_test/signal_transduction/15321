zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in zzso and various types of zzso zzso is expressed in zzso stem cells and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso both of which play an important role in zzso We recently reported that zzso levels correlate zzso with survival in patients with acute zzso zzso Here we present the first direct evidence of a role for zzso in zzso We used short hairpin zzso interference to define the effects of zzso zzso on proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation and lower expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso key zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling was increased and zzso signaling was zzso Further insights into the molecular basis of zzso effects were provided by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso target zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso has an important role zzso and may regulate the balance between proliferation and zzso zzso zzso expression could tip the balance toward zzso thus providing zzso as well as zzso stem cells protection from zzso zzso
