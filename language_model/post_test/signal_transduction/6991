The zzso regulatory network downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is controlled by two opposing zzso family zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso switch model has been invoked to explain how zzso zzso can drive differentiation by shifting the system from a zzso activity state to a zzso activity zzso Although the model explains zzso and zzso zzso zzso in several different cell types, how Yan and zzso protein expression dynamics contribute to these and other zzso transitions remains poorly zzso Toward this goal we have used a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso to perform a comparative study of Yan and zzso protein expression throughout zzso zzso zzso with the prevailing model of the zzso network, we found numerous instances where zzso and Yan adopt a mutually exclusive pattern of zzso However we also observed many examples of zzso While some zzso occurred in cells where zzso signaling is presumed low, other zzso occurred in cells with high zzso zzso The instances of zzso Yan and zzso in zzso with high zzso signaling cannot be explained by the current model, and thus they provide important contexts for future investigation of how zzso differences in zzso zzso network zzso or responsiveness to other signaling zzso affect the zzso zzso
