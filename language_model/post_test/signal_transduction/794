Although regulation of zzso and cartilage development by zzso signaling is well established, the function of zzso in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely zzso Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of zzso signaling in cartilage zzso We found that zzso the primary zzso zzso involved in cartilage destruction, zzso expression of zzso and zzso in primary culture zzso zzso The level of zzso was also increased in zzso of zzso cartilage, suggesting the association of zzso signaling with zzso cartilage zzso In addition, our results show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of primary culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by stimulating zzso activity of zzso whereas zzso zzso is inhibited via the zzso of cell survival zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which block zzso signaling zzso Our results collectively suggest that zzso is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the zzso of zzso zzso via different zzso
