zzso proteins activated by zzso form complexes with zzso Upon zzso these complexes zzso to the nucleus of the cell, where they induce zzso of genes related to zzso of cell growth, cell differentiation and zzso We investigated the role of zzso in the zzso zzso cascade in 4 human cervical cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on our results, zzso cells show low zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso 2, 3, 5 and zzso zzso cells were likewise defective in zzso zzso as evidenced by a lack of significant growth zzso following zzso zzso In addition, zzso did not induce zzso of the zzso gene or change zzso protein zzso Introduction of zzso and/or zzso into zzso cells restored zzso zzso as determined by zzso of the zzso reporter gene and by prominent zzso cell death with zzso zzso Analysis of the downstream targets activated by zzso yielded rapid zzso of zzso with subsequent zzso of the zzso factor zzso but unchanged zzso zzso in the 4 cervical cancer cell zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso decrease of zzso zzso expression is closely associated with defective zzso response and lack of growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may be zzso and zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso are triggered by zzso independently of each other in human cervical zzso
