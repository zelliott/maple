The deregulation of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso has a significant role in the progression of zzso Despite the development of a number of zzso agents that can arrest tumor growth, their success in the clinic is limited in several tumor types, particularly in the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we generated and characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso released from stem cells zzso to ultimately develop a unique zzso therapy for zzso We show that zzso released from zzso specifically zzso to tumors, inhibit zzso signaling resulting in reduced zzso growth and zzso in zzso and in zzso in both established and primary zzso cell zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso cells for zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso and TRAIL target a wide spectrum of zzso cell types with varying degrees of TRAIL resistance and significantly reduce zzso growth and invasion in both established and primary invasive zzso in zzso This study demonstrates the efficacy of zzso zzso targeted therapy in zzso and provides a unique approach with clinical zzso
