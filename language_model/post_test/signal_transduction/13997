Although showing an zzso activity, zzso also zzso zzso production of human gastric cancer zzso zzso This study aimed to assess this effect and to examine whether zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to assess the cell proliferation and adhesive zzso zzso zzso was performed to measure the cell cycle zzso zzso healing zzso was used to detect the migration ability of zzso zzso production was determined by zzso zzso of zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso were measured by real-time zzso zzso pathways involved were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso triggered zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest, and decreased migration of zzso zzso zzso expression and the adhesive ability of zzso cells to zzso were significantly increased by zzso but were inhibited after being zzso with zzso in zzso zzso As zzso was zzso increased zzso of zzso cells to zzso induced by zzso was zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso provoked zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways which could be zzso by zzso 

Although showing zzso and zzso activities in zzso cells, zzso displayed a potential tendency to promote zzso of gastric cancer cells by increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso could counteract the zzso and simultaneously keep zzso and zzso properties of zzso on zzso cells, which reduces the risk to use zzso in therapy of gastric zzso
