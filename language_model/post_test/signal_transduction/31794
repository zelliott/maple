Within the last decade, zzso have been shown to be capable of zzso toward a classically activated zzso zzso with a high zzso potential or an alternatively activated zzso zzso Some pathogens are capable of interfering with differentiation in order to zzso the zzso activity and enhance their survival in the zzso 

To test this ability in zzso zzso zzso zzso we infected zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso devoid of two major zzso islands, zzso and zzso The induction of genes linked with zzso or zzso polarization was determined by zzso of gene expression by zzso The zzso zzso induced a high, zzso zzso response but a low zzso response in infected zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso induced a low zzso response but a high, zzso zzso response in infected zzso The response to zzso zzso infection was virtually the same as the zzso zzso 

We therefore propose that zzso zzso zzso studied here can zzso zzso towards the less zzso zzso zzso and that this polarization is dependent on the type III zzso system zzso by zzso
