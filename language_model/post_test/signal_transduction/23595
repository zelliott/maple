Cell zzso junctions characteristically arise from the cooperative integration of zzso zzso cell zzso pathways and the zzso This is exemplified by zzso interactions zzso by classical zzso zzso zzso These junctions are sites where zzso zzso systems functionally couple to the dynamic zzso zzso a process that zzso physical interactions with many zzso regulators and regulation by cell zzso zzso Such integration implies a potential role for molecules that may stand at the interface between zzso zzso and the zzso One such candidate is the cortical scaffolding zzso zzso which is a component of both zzso and zzso zzso While its contribution to zzso zzso has been extensively zzso less is known about how zzso contributes to zzso zzso A major recent advance has come with the zzso that zzso zzso are active mechanical structures, where zzso serves as part of a zzso zzso by which junctions sense and elicit cellular responses to mechanical zzso zzso has emerged as an important element in zzso zzso a perspective that illuminates its role in zzso zzso We now review its role as a cortical scaffold and its role in zzso zzso
