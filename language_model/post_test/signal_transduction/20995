Based on zzso and functional data obtained with tissue culture cells and zzso zzso proteins have been implicated in a number of different signal zzso zzso in particular in the zzso zzso of protein zzso We performed a functional analysis of zzso in a zzso zzso initiated by the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are strongly enriched in the developing central nervous zzso In addition, they are predominantly expressed in the region zzso to the zzso zzso of the eye zzso disc where cells differentiate as zzso In these cells zzso zzso is localized zzso Both the expression pattern and the zzso zzso are consistent with the proposed function of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis combined with rescue experiments involving zzso zzso of zzso and Ras indicate that zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso signaling zzso and necessary for zzso zzso It acts upstream of zzso and downstream of zzso
