Ras signaling to its downstream zzso appears to include combinations of zzso Ras zzso at the plasma membrane zzso and zzso dynamic lateral segregation in the zzso and zzso of Ras from the PM to zzso zzso These processes are governed by the zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso has no zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins promotes their cellular zzso and signaling by mechanisms as yet unknown, possibly involving zzso zzso of zzso also promotes their association with zzso randomly zzso zzso that apparently provide a means by which multiple copies of activated Ras and its signal can spread zzso zzso of zzso evidently targets it to the zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso was shown to act as a target for zzso which sequesters the active protein from the zzso thereby zzso its trafficking to zzso apparatus and early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was shown to provide a regulated zzso switch on zzso zzso which promotes its zzso to the zzso All these zzso events are characterized by zzso trafficking of the zzso Ras proteins and seem to govern the selectivity and probably also the zzso of the Ras zzso In this review, we discuss the various modifications and interactions of the zzso zzso the trafficking of Ras proteins in the PM and between the PM and the zzso and the relevance of the zzso zzso of Ras for Ras zzso
