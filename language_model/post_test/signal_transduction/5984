zzso zzso positioning is of fundamental importance for generating cell diversity during zzso In the zzso zzso 1 cell zzso zzso positioning has been shown to depend on zzso G protein zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso independent zzso of G protein signaling zzso and zzso zzso are required for proper regulation of zzso positioning zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso regulates zzso positioning in its zzso or zzso bound zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso in this zzso zzso was genetically shown to act in concert with zzso to regulate zzso movements in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was recently found to behave as a zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that reduction of function of zzso results in a 1 cell zzso zzso very similar to the zzso of zzso depleted of zzso zzso is able to directly bind to zzso zzso to zzso consistent with a zzso zzso zzso is localized at the zzso cortex, and its activity is essential for the zzso zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso directly zzso zzso activity and that zzso is the signaling zzso regulating zzso positioning in the early zzso
