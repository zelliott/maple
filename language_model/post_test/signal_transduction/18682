In the present report we have shown that bovine zzso zzso cultured in low oxygen tension, zzso in conditions mimicking their hypoxic in zzso environment, respond to zzso (10 zzso by an increased DNA binding activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso M zzso the active zzso of zzso for 24 h was found to reduce this activity particularly in the case of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso were activated by exposure of the zzso to a 1 h treatment with zzso This effect was greater in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of reducing the zzso zzso zzso whatever the tension of oxygen present in the zzso The zzso zzso levels of collagen type II zzso and zzso core protein were found to be significantly increased by a zzso treatment with zzso M zzso This stimulating effect was also observed in the presence of zzso suggesting that the drug could prevent or reduce the zzso zzso of extra cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased by zzso under the same zzso In conclusion, zzso can effectively inhibit the zzso zzso zzso and the binding of zzso and zzso zzso factors, two key factors involved in the expression of several zzso genes by zzso In addition, the drug can reduce the zzso effect of the zzso by reducing the zzso zzso and enhance the synthesis of zzso zzso such as type II collagen and zzso These results may explain the zzso properties of zzso and its zzso effects on zzso cartilage, in spite of the absence of zzso at zzso zzso
