To investigate whether zzso zzso oxide donor zzso 409 could zzso zzso graft injury in liver transplantation using zzso zzso 

The major concern of live donor liver transplantation is zzso graft injury at the early phase after zzso Novel therapeutic strategies should be zzso 

We employed a rat zzso liver transplantation model using zzso zzso zzso zzso 409 was given at 30 minutes before graft harvesting (2 zzso to the donor and immediately after zzso (1 zzso to the recipient zzso zzso zzso survival, zzso genes zzso portal zzso and zzso zzso changes were compared between the 2 zzso 

zzso graft survival rates in the zzso group were significantly improved compared with those of rats not receiving zzso 409 zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso group, portal pressure was significantly decreased within the first 60 minutes after zzso whereas in the control group, transient portal hypertension was zzso zzso expression (both zzso and zzso of early growth zzso zzso zzso zzso A, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso was significantly zzso accompanied with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during the first 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso especially the integrity of zzso was well protected in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 409 zzso zzso zzso in liver transplantation by zzso of portal hypertension and zzso of acute phase inflammatory response by zzso of zzso together with prior induction of heat shock zzso
