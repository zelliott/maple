Giant cell tumor of bone zzso is a benign zzso but occasionally shows local zzso and zzso consists of zzso giant cells zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso which are capable of proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling can induce zzso differentiation and zzso during bone zzso zzso This study analyzed the profiles of zzso and zzso D1 expression in zzso to zzso an involvement of zzso zzso in zzso We performed zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 16 zzso tumors, including 5 zzso cases that were surgically zzso All 16 cases of zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso was observed in zzso of SC and zzso zzso D1 zzso was found mainly in zzso of zzso while zzso zzso was restricted to zzso of zzso The nuclear zzso labeling index zzso in both SC zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso tumors than in primary tumors in all the 4 zzso However, zzso zzso in SC zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not higher in zzso tumors than in primary zzso Our results suggested zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Since zzso D1 in zzso was never associated with the expression of the well-known zzso marker zzso zzso D1 expression might play a role in zzso formation instead of promoting cell proliferation during zzso zzso zzso it was suggested that the nuclear zzso zzso level might be associated with tumor recurrence in zzso
