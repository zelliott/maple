zzso growth factor 15 zzso is expressed in the developing mouse central nervous system and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed defects of the cardiac zzso tract probably because of zzso behavior of the cardiac neural crest zzso In this study, we examined zzso of the zzso gene by transient transgenic analysis using zzso as a zzso We identified two zzso one directed zzso expression in the zzso zzso and the other in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, human zzso regions which are highly zzso to these two mouse enhancers showed almost the same zzso activities as those of mice in transgenic mouse zzso indicating that the two enhancers are zzso between humans and zzso We also showed that the mouse and human zzso zzso can regulate zzso expression in chick zzso in almost the same way as in mouse zzso We found that the zzso expression domain with this zzso was expanded by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso expression in the zzso These findings suggest that a zzso positive regulation exists between zzso and zzso in the zzso Together with cardiac zzso tract defects in zzso zzso the conservation of enhancers in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that human zzso zzso of zzso is involved in early development and the distribution of cardiac neural crest cells and is one of the candidate genes for zzso heart zzso
