We are creating families of designer G zzso receptors zzso to allow for precise zzso control of zzso signaling in zzso These engineered zzso called receptors activated solely by synthetic zzso zzso are unresponsive to zzso zzso but can be activated by zzso zzso of zzso inert, zzso small zzso Currently, zzso exist for the three major zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso and zzso We review these advances here to facilitate the use of these powerful and diverse zzso
