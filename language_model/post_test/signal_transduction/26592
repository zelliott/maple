At the developing zzso junction zzso physical contact between motor zzso and muscle cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we previously showed that zzso zzso induced muscle zzso zzso which facilitated interactions between the synaptic partners and promoted zzso zzso The zzso were generated by zzso signals through muscle zzso zzso zzso a protein of the zzso complex that zzso the activity of zzso zzso Because zzso also extend zzso that mediate early zzso zzso here we test zzso function in the assembly of these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso leads to an increase in zzso growth and synaptic zzso zzso zzso along zzso whereas the development of these zzso is inhibited following the expression of a zzso zzso lacking sequences important for regulating zzso zzso The zzso zzso also zzso the induction of zzso zzso and zzso clusters by basic zzso growth factor, a zzso zzso that triggers zzso zzso Of importance, introduction of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso formation, which is observed as a reduction in the zzso of zzso receptors at zzso sites in zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling in motor zzso promotes zzso interaction and zzso zzso
