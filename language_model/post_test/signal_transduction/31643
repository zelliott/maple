The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso insulin like growth zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso on the proliferation and migration of zzso oral zzso and leg skin zzso cell lines, using an in zzso scratch zzso zzso from the two sites were zzso grown to zzso and then an area of cells removed zzso void zzso Cell migration alone (with the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso to the culture media) and proliferation and migration combined (without zzso into the cell void area were observed at 0, 5, 10, 24 and 36 zzso The presence of zzso in the culture media significantly slowed the closure of the cell void area, as zzso was zzso For the oral cells only, zzso significantly slowed both migration (with zzso and proliferation and migration combined (without zzso For the limb cells only, both zzso and zzso significantly increased zzso proliferation and migration combined (without zzso For both cell types, zzso significantly reduced migration (with zzso IGF-1 had no effect on any of the parameters zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso and zzso have differential effects on the proliferation and migration of zzso oral and limb zzso These differences in zzso responses to growth factors may in part form the basis of the different clinical outcomes for oral and limb zzso
