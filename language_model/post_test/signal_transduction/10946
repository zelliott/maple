zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso also known as zzso and its relatives zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso In normal cells, zzso of this zzso zzso zzso family triggers a rich network of signaling pathways that control normal cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso in several cell zzso The first tumor studied for an zzso of the zzso zzso is breast zzso and so far the majority of studies have been performed on this zzso Although involvement of zzso as a cause of human cell transformation needs to be further investigated, zzso of the zzso zzso in human breast zzso has been associated with a more aggressive course of zzso It has been suggested that this association depends on zzso zzso vessel formation and/or zzso however, poor prognosis may not be directly related to the presence of the zzso on the cell membrane but instead to the breast zzso subset identified by zzso zzso and characterized by a peculiar gene expression profile, as recently zzso zzso tumors were recently shown to benefit from zzso treatment and to be resistant to zzso zzso Despite the fact that many pathways interacting with zzso are still not fully zzso this zzso zzso zzso is, to date, a promising zzso for targeted zzso
