In the zzso zzso cone zzso efficiently adapt to changing background light intensity and, therefore, are able to signal small differences in zzso between objects and backgrounds, even when the absolute intensity of the background changes over five to six orders of zzso zzso rod zzso in contrast, adapt very little and only at zzso that nearly zzso the zzso of their zzso In search of a molecular explanation for this observation we assessed zzso zzso of zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso zzso channels of intact zzso rods and zzso zzso zzso were isolated by gentle zzso of ground zzso zzso zzso and cones were distinguished by whether or not their outer segments bind zzso zzso We measured membrane currents under zzso in zzso loaded with zzso a zzso zzso zzso and fixed zzso of zzso At 600 zzso free zzso zzso the zzso of the cone zzso channels sensitivity to zzso zzso is approximately zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity is less in rod than in cone zzso zzso decreasing zzso zzso to zzso zzso activates a large inward membrane current in cones, but not in zzso Current zzso arises from a zzso zzso zzso of cone zzso channels, presumably because of an increase in their affinity to the zzso zzso The time course of current zzso is temperature zzso it is well described by a single exponential process of approximately zzso zzso time constant at zzso degrees C and 138 zzso at 32 degrees zzso The absence of zzso zzso zzso current zzso in intact zzso in view of the known channel zzso by zzso zzso affirms the zzso in intact rods may only occur at low zzso zzso those expected at zzso that nearly zzso the rod zzso The correspondence between zzso dependence of zzso zzso and the ability to light adapt suggest these events are correlated in zzso
