zzso data show that zzso radiation increases the risk of cardiovascular zzso The zzso is one of the main targets of zzso zzso Rapid zzso zzso in the biological processes were investigated after exposure to a clinically relevant radiation dose zzso zzso gamma zzso The changes in protein expression were determined using the human zzso cell line zzso as a zzso Two complementary zzso approaches, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acids in Cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso expressed proteins were identified and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso tandem mass zzso The zzso proteins were mainly zzso in four key zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso bodies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso end zzso We suggest that these zzso facilitate the repair processes needed to overcome the stress caused by zzso and are indicative of the vascular damage leading to zzso zzso and cerebrovascular zzso
