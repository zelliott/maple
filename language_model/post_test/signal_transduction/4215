The 60 zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso is regarded as the major signal zzso of zzso cellular responses, whereas the signal capacity and role of the 80 zzso zzso zzso remain largely zzso We show here that the zzso form of zzso is superior to soluble zzso in zzso zzso in various systems such as T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso by membrane zzso can lead to zzso different zzso responses such as rendering resistant tumor cells sensitive to zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the diversity of zzso effects can be controlled through the differential sensitivity of zzso for the two forms of zzso and suggests an important zzso role for zzso in local inflammatory zzso
