zzso can couple zzso to a large number of G zzso receptors zzso making it a prime candidate as a universal zzso for zzso In order to increase the zzso of zzso three zzso incorporating increasing lengths of zzso zzso zzso 44 or 81 zzso into the zzso of zzso were constructed and named zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were examined for their ability to mediate zzso stimulation of zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso was more effective than zzso and zzso at zzso to zzso zzso zzso coupled zzso to 10 different zzso receptors examined and, for 50% of these zzso zzso zzso activities were higher than those zzso via zzso Similar results were observed for zzso zzso zzso These results show that incorporating the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso can increase the zzso of zzso towards zzso zzso
