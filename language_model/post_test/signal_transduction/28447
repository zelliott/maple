zzso analysis offers a powerful tool for studying the mechanisms of cellular zzso although the correlation between zzso and protein expression is largely zzso In this study, a zzso analysis was performed to compare zzso in response to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a model zzso zzso zzso cell system, and in response to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso We sought to validate zzso changes by monitoring changes at the protein level using a parallel zzso strategy, and report a surprisingly high correlation between zzso and translation for the subset of genes zzso We further zzso the identified targets and relate differential expression to changes in the biological properties of zzso zzso We found differential regulation of several key cell cycle zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of a large number of zzso zzso consistent with increased proliferation of the zzso zzso Furthermore, differential expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso was linked to altered zzso of these zzso Finally, we provide evidence for enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Together, we have identified changes that are likely to drive proliferation and zzso growth of zzso zzso cancer zzso
