The ability of zzso to zzso synaptic strength zzso synaptic zzso learning and memory, and adaptation to sensory zzso Despite the importance of synaptic adaptation in directing, zzso and revising the behavioral response to environmental zzso the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic adaptation are far from zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a prime zzso of structural and functional synaptic zzso However, the signaling cascade activated by zzso to initiate these zzso changes has not been zzso We have previously shown that zzso activates zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso which regulates gene zzso via the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Using mice with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso we now show that zzso is necessary for the zzso of synaptic strength in response to environmental enrichment in zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso zzso mice failed to show zzso of synaptic transmission in response to activity deprivation in zzso a deficit that could be rescued by zzso of zzso zzso We also show that zzso forms part of a zzso and zzso signaling cascade required for zzso synaptic zzso which likely resides in the ability of zzso to regulate cell surface zzso expression via the induction of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an integral part of a signaling zzso that zzso the zzso response to synaptic and environmental zzso zzso may thus act as a key zzso in the zzso and zzso regulation of synaptic zzso
