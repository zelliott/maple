zzso zzso zzso is an zzso bleeding disorder characterized by a low zzso count and the production of zzso zzso The majority of zzso patients have zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso which can direct zzso zzso by zzso One effective treatment for patients with zzso is intravenous zzso zzso which rapidly reverses zzso The exact mechanism of zzso action in human patients is zzso although in mouse models of passive zzso zzso can rapidly increase zzso counts in the absence of zzso zzso Another zzso therapeutic that can similarly increase zzso counts independent of zzso immunity are zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are pattern recognition receptors which play a central role in helping direct the innate immune zzso zzso cells, which are notable for their expression of zzso have been directly implicated in zzso function as an zzso cell, while zzso can associate with zzso and zzso We therefore questioned whether zzso or the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso mediate their zzso effects in a manner dependent upon normal zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso does not inhibit zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso and that these zzso do not zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to significantly zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice which have defective zzso All known zzso zzso except zzso zzso the zzso adapter protein to drive zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient mice, we found that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso deficient mice to the same extent as normal zzso Thus both zzso and zzso zzso can mediate their zzso effects in zzso passive zzso independent of the zzso signaling zzso These data help shed light on the mechanism of action of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
