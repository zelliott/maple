zzso immune system such as zzso zzso 4 zzso represents the first line of defense against zzso In addition to its pivotal role in host zzso recent studies have suggested that zzso may play a broader role in zzso tissue inflammation and cell survival in response to zzso zzso We and other investigators have reported that cardiac zzso signaling is zzso modulated in zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso a survival benefit in the heart and in isolated zzso However, the signaling pathways leading to these effects are not completely zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso an zzso protein of zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso survival in an in zzso model of zzso zzso deprivation induced a significant increase in the number of zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso activated zzso signaling and led to significant reduction in zzso zzso and improved cellular function of surviving zzso with enhanced zzso zzso and cell zzso We found that both zzso and zzso are required for the zzso beneficial effects as demonstrated by improved survival and function in zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, genetic deletion or pharmacological zzso of zzso abolished survival and functional rescue of zzso treated with zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso protects zzso from zzso injury through zzso and zzso zzso
