Thanks to the recent discovery of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to different zzso zzso research in the different areas related to this zzso has regained a strong zzso In the following review, we first describe the zzso and actions of zzso peptides formed both in the circulation and locally at the tissue and organ zzso Evidence for the existence and distribution of zzso II zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso species and lower organisms is zzso The changes in zzso zzso expression during development and disease are zzso The signal zzso mechanisms and biological actions of zzso II zzso by the recently cloned zzso zzso are reviewed and the recent data concerning the zzso pathways linked to the zzso zzso are zzso Finally, based upon their molecular zzso we present evidence and also speculate upon the zzso function of the zzso II zzso zzso
