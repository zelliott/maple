Recently, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have been linked to tissue protection in the nervous zzso In this study, we tested their effects in a model of zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats zzso carotid zzso and exposure to zzso zzso for 50 zzso EPO (10 zzso body weight zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso 24), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle zzso saline with zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso 24) was injected zzso 4 h before zzso Both drugs were zzso as judged by measuring the zzso volumes, zzso score and gross zzso zzso The zzso volumes were significantly reduced by both EPO zzso and zzso zzso treatment, even though the plasma levels of zzso had dropped below the detection limit (1 zzso at the onset of zzso while those of EPO were in the zzso zzso Thus, a brief trigger by zzso before the insult appears to be sufficient for zzso zzso analysis after zzso treatment alone (no zzso revealed at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso animals after zzso EPO and the zzso zzso both provided significant and equal zzso when administered 4 h prior to zzso in zzso zzso The protection might be related to reduced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
