zzso a zzso integral membrane zzso is a principal component of zzso zzso We and others have suggested that zzso functions as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate certain zzso signaling molecules within zzso zzso In this regard, it has been shown that a zzso acid zzso region of the zzso zzso domain of zzso is sufficient to mediate the interaction of zzso with signaling zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso protein domain has been termed the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain functionally suppresses the activity of zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso binding may also play a negative regulatory role in signal zzso Here, we report the direct interaction of zzso with a growth factor zzso zzso a known zzso zzso zzso zzso Two consensus zzso binding motifs have been previously defined using zzso display zzso One of these motifs is present within the zzso zzso zzso of most known zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso We now show that this zzso binding motif within the zzso domain of the zzso can mediate the interaction of the zzso with the scaffolding zzso of zzso 1 and 3 but not with zzso zzso In addition, the scaffolding zzso of zzso 1 and 3 both functionally inhibit the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso this zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could be prevented by the addition of an zzso zzso that zzso contains a well zzso zzso binding motif and zzso is located within the zzso domain of the zzso and most known zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with protein zzso C, a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may function as a general zzso zzso The implications of our results are discussed within the context of zzso signal zzso In this regard, zzso signaling might explain how linear signaling pathways can branch and zzso zzso forming a signaling module or zzso
