The same set of stimuli and zzso methods that was used to study the dynamics of horizontal cells () was applied to a study of the response dynamics and signal processing in zzso cells in the zzso of the kissing zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains two major classes of zzso cells that could be identified from their zzso C and N zzso zzso C zzso cells had a zzso zzso field, whereas N cells had a zzso zzso zzso Both types of zzso cell were zzso but zzso was more extensive in the N zzso zzso zzso from C zzso cells lacked a DC component and had a small linear component that was zzso in terms of mean square error zzso the zzso component often accounted for zzso of the zzso zzso The C zzso cells did not show any characteristic color coding under any stimulus zzso Most responses of N cells to a zzso stimulus consisted of a series of zzso transient zzso and steady zzso did not generate any DC potential in these zzso The response to a zzso modulated input was composed of zzso zzso and zzso components and, zzso zzso zzso The response evoked by a red or green zzso stimulus given alone was not color zzso zzso red zzso in the presence of a green zzso zzso a color-coded response from zzso of N zzso zzso Color information was carried not only by the polarity but also by the dynamics of the zzso zzso No convincing evidence was obtained to indicate that the zzso component might be involved in color zzso Some N zzso cells produced a zzso zzso interaction kernel to show that the zzso sequence of red and green stimuli was a zzso to be zzso In a complex cell such as an zzso cell, responses evoked by a zzso stimulus given in darkness and by zzso of a mean zzso could be very different in terms of their zzso It was not always possible to predict the response evoked by one stimulus from observing the cell's response to another zzso This is because, in N cells, a zzso zzso zzso response is composed largely of zzso components whereas a zzso zzso zzso response is composed of linear as well as zzso zzso
