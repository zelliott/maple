zzso zzso zzso binding zzso responsive elements zzso are located downstream of the zzso initiation site in the zzso region of the zzso long terminal repeat zzso These downstream sequence zzso termed zzso can bind both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that the zzso are also zzso elements zzso since they zzso zzso signals zzso by zzso toxin zzso a potent zzso of the zzso protein zzso A zzso signal zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso can mediate the zzso zzso zzso by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso or zzso to produce a synergistic increase in zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso reporter zzso indicated that zzso of the zzso sites zzso the zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso whereas the zzso induced by zzso and zzso was zzso suggesting zzso and zzso cooperate differently with the zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso expression in zzso zzso Because the zzso are also zzso sites, we assessed the effect of the zzso combinations on zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso cooperated with zzso to produce a synergistic zzso of zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso sites within the zzso leader can mediate the zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso Since the zzso and zzso sites cannot bind zzso zzso we propose a mechanism in which the zzso zzso bind zzso composed of both zzso and zzso zzso
