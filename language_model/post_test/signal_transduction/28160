Essential zzso zzso is characterized by the abnormal and sustained proliferation of zzso The mechanism for this zzso expansion in zzso remains zzso We have previously reported that transforming growth zzso zzso is involved in negative feedback regulation of zzso in both healthy volunteers zzso and patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso The present study found that zzso zzso units zzso of zzso patients were less sensitive to zzso than those of zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of zzso patients was reduced in comparison with that of zzso Finally, to confirm that the impaired zzso sensitivity was caused by reduced expression of zzso we examined zzso zzso from zzso patients in the presence of zzso and verified that the zzso were indeed as susceptible as zzso from zzso to zzso Thus it was zzso that one of the mechanisms for impaired sensitivity of zzso to zzso is the reduced expression of zzso
