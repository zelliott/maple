Worldwide, zzso cancer has a higher zzso rate in men than in women, suggesting a protective role for sex hormones in the development of the zzso zzso data support a role for zzso and its receptors in the initiation and progression of zzso cancer and establishes that protective effects of zzso are exerted through zzso zzso replacement therapy zzso in zzso women as well as consumption of soy reduces the zzso of zzso zzso In the Women's Health Initiative trial, use of zzso in zzso women reduced the risk of colon cancer by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A recent zzso showed that in women, consumption of soy reduced the risk of colon cancer by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In this review, using the zzso data, we translate the findings in the clinical trials and zzso studies to define the role of zzso in the prevention of zzso zzso We zzso that sometime during the zzso process zzso expression in zzso is lost and the zzso zzso zzso or soy products, exerts its effects through preventing this zzso Thus, in the zzso zzso timing of zzso is a significant zzso of the observed benefit from this zzso We further argue that the protective effects of zzso are limited to certain molecular zzso zzso development of zzso zzso for prevention of zzso cancer depends on identification of susceptible zzso cancer zzso Thus, research to better understand the zzso zzso is fundamental for clinical delivery of these zzso
