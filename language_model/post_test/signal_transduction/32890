zzso of zzso zzso zzso requires the functions of zzso zzso zzso However, there is little information describing pathways through which zzso activities effect the discrete cellular changes that diversify zzso zzso We have identified the zzso signaling protein zzso as the product of a zzso downstream gene that acts in many segments as a component of such zzso In the embryonic zzso zzso is required for zzso of normal abdominal zzso belts and zzso mouth zzso both zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso and zzso are required to activate an early stripe of zzso zzso in abdominal zzso In the abdominal zzso zzso promotes zzso diversity by precisely zzso a single cell stripe of zzso zzso which generates a source of zzso signal that is not produced in zzso zzso In the head, zzso is required to activate zzso zzso in the zzso segment, where zzso is required for normal mouth hook zzso However, zzso does not require zzso function in the zzso segment, suggesting that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso can be linked to more than one downstream zzso
