zzso is a 46 zzso zzso zzso from activated T cells, and plays an important role both in the growth and production of zzso zzso zzso have been reported to express high and low affinity zzso The zzso zzso is composed of two membrane protein zzso alpha and beta zzso Both alpha and beta chain of mouse and human zzso zzso have been identified and zzso The alpha zzso is a 60 zzso protein which binds to zzso with low zzso The beta zzso is a 130 zzso protein which does not bind to zzso by itself, but forms the high affinity zzso zzso in the presence of the alpha zzso On the other hand, only a high affinity zzso population has been identified on human zzso zzso zzso experiments resulted in the identification of human zzso zzso on zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso
