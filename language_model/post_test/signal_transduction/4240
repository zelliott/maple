zzso a key step in cell division, is known to be precisely regulated both in its timing and zzso At present, the regulatory mechanism of zzso is not well zzso although it has been suggested that calcium signaling may play an important role in this zzso To test this notion, we introduced a sensitive fluorescent zzso indicator into the zzso zzso and used zzso zzso to measure the zzso variation of zzso free zzso concentration zzso during cell zzso It was evident that a localized zzso of zzso is closely associated with zzso First, we found that during zzso the level of free zzso was elevated locally precisely at the zzso zzso Second, the rise of free zzso was very rapid and occurred just preceding the initiation of zzso zzso These observations strongly suggest that zzso may be triggered by a calcium zzso In addition, we found that this zzso calcium signal arose mainly from internal stores of zzso rather than from external free zzso it could be blocked by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the localized zzso of zzso is caused by the release of free zzso from the zzso zzso through the zzso calcium zzso
