Body function zzso has a key function for the regulation of internal timing and adaptation to the zzso A wealth of recent data has implicated zzso biological rhythm generation and regulation in zzso to disease, zzso cognitive zzso zzso brain diseases, it has been established that many molecular pathways implicated in zzso are under zzso zzso At the molecular level, this regulation relies on clock genes forming zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso zzso of the master zzso zzso the zzso zzso nucleus, are endowed with this molecular zzso Brain cells in many other regions, including those which play a key role in learning and memory, as well as peripheral cells show a zzso zzso behavior regulated by the same molecular zzso We here address the question as to whether zzso clockwork signaling and/or the zzso dialogue between zzso zzso are disrupted in zzso neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's zzso The potential implications of clock genes in cognitive functions in normal conditions, clinical disturbances of zzso zzso and especially the zzso cycle, in zzso neurodegenerative diseases and data in animal models are zzso The currently limited knowledge in this field is discussed in the context of the more extensive body of data available on cell clocks and molecular clockwork during normal zzso zzso on implications of the synchronization between brain zzso in information processing in neural networks lay ground for future studies on brain health and zzso
