In recent years, there have been major advances in the understanding of both the cell biology of zzso trafficking between zzso compartments and the molecular targeting signals intrinsic to the trafficking proteins zzso One system to which these advances have been zzso applied is the regulation of the trafficking of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the cell surface in response to zzso The unique nature of the trafficking of zzso and its expression in highly differentiated cells makes this a question of considerable interest to cell zzso zzso the tangled web of molecular events zzso zzso trafficking will eventually lead to a greater understanding of zzso zzso zzso as well as fundamental cell biological principles related to zzso zzso and protein zzso
