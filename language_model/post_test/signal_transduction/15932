zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors are known to interact closely to promote zzso outgrowth and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso and its family member zzso zzso zzso signal through a zzso zzso complex consisting of zzso family zzso alpha 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice do not promote zzso initiation when zzso by zzso consistent with the role of zzso in zzso zzso Multiple alternatively spliced zzso of zzso are known to be expressed in the nervous zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso promoted zzso zzso It is currently unknown if zzso zzso is zzso regulated by these zzso In this study, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the major zzso target zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso significantly impaired zzso and zzso zzso outgrowth while zzso zzso cooperated with zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was essential for zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso of late phase zzso Taken together, these results not only demonstrated the essential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also suggested zzso zzso as a zzso zzso underlying mechanism contributing to the differential zzso activities of zzso zzso
