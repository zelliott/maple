The zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso is a central zzso of growth and zzso for both normal and zzso zzso zzso is the natural zzso inhibitor of zzso and can effectively complex with and thereby inhibit the zzso activity and zzso of zzso to the zzso We designed a fusion protein designated zzso zzso of human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso targets melanoma zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso before zzso showed specifically zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso significantly zzso melanoma cells to zzso radiation assessed using a zzso survival zzso zzso studies showed that zzso when zzso added to zzso cells, could be zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited in a time and/or zzso manner of tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso was also shown to specifically inhibit the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the cell nucleus and zzso gene zzso Further, initial studies showed that mice bearing well-established zzso zzso were treated zzso with zzso and showed a significant suppression of tumor zzso We also observed a decrease in levels of zzso and zzso signaling events downstream of zzso in the tumor zzso These studies demonstrate for the first time that tumor zzso delivery of zzso may be beneficial for the treatment of melanoma when combined with standard zzso therapies such as zzso
