Although zzso zzso have shown promising activity in relapsed zzso and sporadic activity in acute zzso zzso their mechanism of zzso is incompletely zzso making development of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the action of zzso in human acute zzso leukemia cell lines and clinical zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso killing of zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso signaling followed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso occurred in acute zzso leukemia cell lines undergoing zzso zzso Similar zzso and zzso zzso occurred in serial bone zzso samples harvested from a subset of acute zzso leukemia patients during zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso like zzso of zzso or zzso diminished zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that increased zzso and zzso levels reflect protein stabilization rather than increased gene zzso In zzso cells selected for zzso resistance, neither zzso of signaling downstream of zzso nor zzso and zzso stabilization zzso zzso these results not only identify a zzso downstream from zzso that contributes to zzso zzso in human acute zzso leukemia cells, but also demonstrate that zzso killing of zzso versus zzso cells reflects distinct zzso mechanisms downstream of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
