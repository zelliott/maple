Adult mouse zzso zone zzso neural zzso cells zzso retain the capacity to generate multiple lineages in zzso and in zzso Thus far, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of these cells have not been well zzso We have carried out zzso profiling of adult zzso cell cultures undergoing zzso to identify pathways that regulate zzso cell proliferation and to define a set of transcripts that can be used as molecular tools in the drug discovery zzso We carried out a zzso zzso of the results to identify transcripts specifically enriched in zzso and validated some of these using comparative literature analysis, quantitative zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso The results show a set of zzso factors, zzso molecules and plasma membrane markers that are zzso regulated during zzso zzso analysis highlights zzso in insulin growth factor, zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso Further characterization of these components could provide greater insight into the mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso in the adult zzso
