zzso express the G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso activates zzso cells zzso either with zzso or with zzso The signaling through the zzso expressed receptors was inhibited by specific zzso antagonists, zzso H and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso release of zzso was used to determine zzso zzso when these cells were triggered with zzso The response was not affected by the zzso specific zzso suggesting that no signals are zzso through this zzso The response was only partly inhibited by zzso but this zzso induced a zzso switch, zzso as a change in sensitivity to the zzso zzso The activity remaining in the presence of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso A cell permeable zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso binding region of zzso inhibited the zzso but not the zzso cellular response and induced the same type of zzso zzso We show that an zzso that has the potential to bind and activate zzso through zzso as well as through zzso uses the latter zzso and its signaling route, only when the zzso signal generated through zzso is zzso The zzso switch is achieved when signaling through zzso is inhibited both by a zzso zzso and by an inhibitor operating from the inside of the plasma zzso The phenomenon described is of general importance for proper interpretation of results generated through the use of different zzso zzso in zzso operated signaling zzso zzso
