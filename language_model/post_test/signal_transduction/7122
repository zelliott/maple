Renal zzso are commonly found among patients carrying a zzso deletion which renders loss of zzso zzso an important zzso factor implicated in a number of zzso zzso zzso is known to interact with zzso but the exact mechanism remains zzso In this study, we have measured the expression of zzso in both zzso and human zzso using zzso and analyzed its protein product and zzso interactions with Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins were verified with mass zzso As discovered, zzso binds with zzso zzso and zzso genes also have similar expression profiles during zzso kidney zzso Based on zzso between mouse and human, we hypothesized that such interaction also exists in zzso Through a zzso interference experiment using a human embryonic kidney zzso cell line, we demonstrated that zzso can alter zzso an important signaling pathway, through interacting with zzso Above findings may shed light on the mechanism of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso found in patients carrying a zzso zzso
