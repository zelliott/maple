zzso in zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso and severe zzso zzso and recent evidence indicates that the zzso alter the membrane trafficking of zzso zzso These disorders feature impaired bone zzso production of zzso along with excess zzso differentiated lineages corresponding to the two alternative fates of zzso zzso zzso We zzso a modified zzso zzso system and identified a new, widely expressed zzso zzso whose product is zzso to zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein distributed throughout the cell and zzso Its zzso sequence consists of several zzso repeats identical to those of the zzso region of zzso and its zzso zzso contains a unique zzso domain required for interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso repeats in zzso and in living cells, but the zzso domain zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso disrupt the interaction with zzso impair zzso of zzso and zzso and interfere with zzso zzso suggesting defective zzso of an zzso form of zzso as an explanation for the alternate switching of cell fates characteristic of zzso zzso
