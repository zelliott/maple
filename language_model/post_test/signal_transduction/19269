zzso sclerosis complex zzso is an often severe zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso zzso finding in zzso and their number and location has been shown to correlate roughly with the severity of zzso features in zzso Past studies have shown that zzso deletion events in zzso or zzso are very rare in zzso and suggested the potential involvement of the zzso zzso in their zzso We used deep sequencing to assess all coding zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso hot spots within zzso in 46 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso of zzso The same secondary zzso in zzso was identified in six zzso samples from one zzso Further study showed that this second hit zzso was widely distributed in the zzso from one cerebral zzso of this individual at zzso up to zzso No other secondary zzso were found in the other 40 zzso zzso These data indicate that small second hit zzso in any of these three genes are very rare in zzso zzso However, in one zzso individual, a second hit zzso point zzso occurred early during brain development, and likely contributed to zzso zzso
