We report for the first time that expression of the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is unique to zzso within the human zzso zzso zzso was expressed by zzso zzso cells zzso which was zzso increased by zzso and correlated with increased numbers of differentiated zzso Human zzso zzso also express zzso but the zzso is not expressed by either zzso DC type 1 zzso or zzso zzso We also show that zzso or zzso zzso which signal through zzso induce maturation of zzso as measured by increased expression of zzso and zzso and decreased expression of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso production by zzso which induced proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in their ability to stimulate zzso zzso from zzso but zzso was not as potent as zzso in stimulating zzso of zzso from zzso or inducing zzso proliferation zzso zzso expression by some DC zzso may have an important function in the human immune response in zzso via its role in differentiation of inflammatory zzso zzso
