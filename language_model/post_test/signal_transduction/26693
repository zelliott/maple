Pulmonary zzso is a feature of a number of important lung diseases, and zzso zzso injury plays a key role in their zzso Traditionally, type II zzso zzso cells have been viewed as the zzso cells of the zzso zzso however, recent studies have identified a number of other zzso and stem cell populations that may participate in zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that the injury zzso plays a role in regulation of zzso cell zzso In human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, zzso abnormalities including altered cell cycling zzso zzso and zzso are observed, suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso cells contributes to the characteristic zzso repair zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways such as the zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of these cells, and targeting these pathways may provide opportunities for therapeutic zzso There has been a great deal of interest in the delivery of zzso stem cells as a therapeutic strategy, and various stem and zzso cell populations have improved outcomes in animal lung zzso zzso The contributions of these cells to zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and zzso of soluble zzso has been implicated in the beneficial zzso It remains to be seen whether the promising results seen in the zzso studies will translate to human disease, and the first studies using zzso stem cells in clinical trials for zzso lung disease are zzso Strategies using other stem cell populations hold promise, but currently these are a lot further from the zzso
