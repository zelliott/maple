The zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in a variety of cellular responses such as zzso of cell survival, zzso zzso cell division, and cell zzso zzso generates important zzso second zzso that are zzso at the 3' position of their zzso ring zzso These membrane restricted lipids act by binding with high affinity to specific protein zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso include molecules that harbor such zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso also termed zzso The zzso zzso encodes three different zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2, and 3, zzso and each is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as zzso and breast zzso A second family of three protein zzso termed serum and zzso protein zzso zzso is structurally related to the zzso family including regulation by zzso but lack a zzso zzso However, in addition to zzso zzso a second class of 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso exists that is termed zzso zzso zzso zzso this domain is found in one of the zzso zzso Here, we zzso knowledge of the three zzso zzso and compare and contrast them to zzso with respect to their possible importance in cellular regulation and potential as therapeutic zzso
