Since the initial description of simple chemical transmission systems involving one zzso its respective zzso and second messenger, there has been an explosive growth in our understanding of the components and complexity of signal zzso systems involved in zzso zzso Why did zzso develop such a complex signaling system, including zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso and interconnected zzso zzso How is the specificity of a message zzso into a single zzso maintained when the zzso pathways are shared by so many other zzso How does a cell discriminate between the message carried by the same zzso conveying short-term responses, zzso messages, or signals for growth and zzso In the following article, the author tries to address these questions by providing a framework for zzso communication based on basic principle of information zzso It is suggested that many of the observed mechanisms of electrical and chemical transmission are a consequence of evolutionary strategies to develop efficient zzso and zzso zzso transmission of information between zzso
