zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are important zzso zzso zzso that play distinct roles in cell differentiation and zzso zzso zzso processing zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a recently isolated zzso zzso with zzso to zzso Little is known about the zzso processing function of zzso or about the signaling pathways with which it is zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of human zzso with the highest expression in the brain, lung and zzso In this paper, we characterize the zzso of zzso in zzso cells and show that zzso also possesses a zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso growth factor zzso or zzso treatment, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso nor ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso resulting in zzso zzso This site of zzso zzso is distinct from that of other zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso reporter construct causes trans zzso of the zzso These findings suggest that zzso a zzso zzso related to zzso may play a distinct role in signal zzso in addition to its role in zzso zzso
