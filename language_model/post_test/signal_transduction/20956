The zzso coli zzso zzso mediates tactic responses to zzso zzso and changes in zzso We have previously shown that the zzso ability of zzso which has a unique zzso in place of zzso at zzso zzso is specifically zzso by zzso zzso and that zzso protects the zzso from zzso In this study, we demonstrated the correlation between protective effects of various zzso and their zzso to elicit zzso zzso This indirect binding zzso was used to monitor the affinity of the zzso for zzso under various zzso It has been demonstrated by in zzso zzso that the zzso affinities of zzso and the related zzso zzso are unaffected by changes in the zzso state of the zzso Using the zzso protection zzso we zzso this issue both in zzso and in zzso The zzso levels of zzso did not affect its zzso zzso We also showed both in zzso and in zzso that the zzso affinity was unaffected by zzso These results suggest that the structure of the zzso domain of the zzso is zzso from the signaling states of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso system should be zzso to other zzso
