The two zzso zzso and one zzso domain containing zzso protein zzso is an essential element of the Ras signaling zzso in multiple zzso The zzso domain of zzso recognizes and interacts with zzso zzso on activated zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso bind to several zzso zzso proteins such as zzso To define the difference in zzso proteins in zzso cells, we performed zzso analysis using zzso zzso fusion proteins and found that several protein components zzso zzso zzso and zzso differently associated with zzso proteins in human Chang liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso bind to zzso fusion proteins in Chang liver, whereas zzso remarkably associate with zzso in zzso zzso Also zzso zzso proteins exclusively bound to the zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso of the Ras zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein has been identified as zzso zzso We observed that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso fusion proteins zzso with zzso II besides zzso These results suggest that zzso II may be a functional zzso involved in zzso signaling zzso on Ras zzso for tumor progression and differentiation of zzso zzso
