In this paper we review recent evidence on the molecular control of cell migration in the zzso and present an hypothesis for the evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso We suggest that there are at least two key factors involved in the acquisition of the zzso zzso zzso the expression of the protein zzso which arrests the migration of cortical plate cells by zzso them from the zzso zzso zzso This permits younger zzso to use the same fiber to migrate past the previous zzso and zzso the second factor is an zzso signaling zzso dependent on a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso may work by zzso zzso zzso cell zzso as young cells cross the cortical plate, permitting them to move to the more superficial zzso Interestingly, the zzso in zzso affects the migration of only those cells belonging to superficial zzso which are considered to be an evolutionary acquisition of the zzso zzso
