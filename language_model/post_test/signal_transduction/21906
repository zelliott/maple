zzso syndrome zzso zzso of sodium zzso and zzso zzso type 1) with decreased sodium zzso are caused by the zzso in the zzso zzso sodium channel zzso zzso proteins are small zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Earlier, we reported that zzso zzso zzso currents through zzso interaction in zzso zzso We hereby report that zzso zzso is associated with the zzso status as zzso active or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents whereas zzso inactive zzso zzso showed no zzso In order to further explore the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we performed competitive zzso with two zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso (a putative zzso factor for zzso Both proteins eliminate negative zzso of zzso on zzso zzso The zzso reversal of zzso effect was restricted to zzso zzso zzso assigned for putative zzso function while the zzso zzso motif imparted higher zzso The zzso currents remain unaffected by zzso though zzso appears to strongly bind zzso The zzso experiments suggest that in the presence of excessive zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso is zzso zzso and zzso limit the zzso availability to zzso thus minimizing its effect on channel zzso These observations decisively prove that zzso zzso zzso function through a complex mechanism that involves zzso status, and zzso interactions involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso
