When groups of cells from the inner marginal zone zzso of the early zzso zzso are placed on a zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso region spread into zzso whereas those from the zzso region, though they adhere to the zzso do not show this spreading zzso This different zzso is not reflected in the in zzso zzso of the respective cells kept in zzso No difference between zzso and zzso cells was observed, when they were tested for zzso zzso movement over the zzso or properties of zzso and zzso zzso However, cell contacts between individual zzso cells are significantly less stable than those between zzso zzso The higher flexibility of the zzso contacts seems to determine the spreading zzso of the zzso zzso which includes zzso outward movement of the peripheral cells, zzso of the cells, building up a horizontal tension within the zzso and zzso of cells from above into the bottom zzso zzso zzso lack these zzso zzso for zzso revealed a decisive difference of the zzso zzso of the zzso that zzso the zzso of the different types of zzso Evidence for a higher flexibility of zzso contacts in the zzso zzso was also obtained in zzso studies on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells show stronger zzso activity as compared to zzso zzso zzso The meaning of these observations for the mechanisms of zzso movements during zzso is central to the zzso
