zzso are specialized compartments of the plasma membrane that are involved in zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso Their formation requires the transport of zzso to the plasma zzso but the molecular mechanisms regulating the transport are largely zzso Here, zzso a critical role for zzso signaling through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso or zzso in zzso have dramatically reduced numbers of plasma membrane zzso zzso which is due to impaired transport of zzso zzso along zzso zzso to the plasma zzso zzso zzso promotes the recruitment of the zzso binding protein zzso to the cell cortex, which, in turn, zzso with zzso zzso to locally stabilize zzso and to zzso zzso of zzso into the plasma zzso Our results assign an important role to the zzso complex for zzso trafficking to the cell zzso
