zzso mechanical stress leads to bone loss, as evidenced by disuse osteoporosis in bedridden patients and zzso zzso have been identified as major cells responsible for zzso however, the mechanism underlying the response of bone to mechanical unloading remains poorly zzso In this study, we found that mechanical unloading of zzso mice caused decrease of zzso signaling activity accompanied by zzso of zzso To further analyze the zzso relationship among these events, zzso gene targeting mice were zzso We showed that zzso selectively inhibited zzso in zzso and zzso suppressed the activity of zzso and viability of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso mice were resistant to mechanical zzso bone zzso Reduction in bone formation in response to unloading was also zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso mice, zzso signaling was not altered by unloading in zzso zzso Those data implied that zzso played an essential role in zzso bone response to mechanical zzso likely through zzso zzso Our findings also indicated zzso is a promising target for preventing disuse zzso
