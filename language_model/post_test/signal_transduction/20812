zzso growth factor zzso induced short zzso in two different strains of zzso zzso The length of the zzso zzso was markedly increased in the presence of the protein zzso inhibitor zzso which is known to inhibit differentiation induced by nerve growth factor zzso zzso differentiation of zzso required zzso synthesis and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the levels of three zzso proteins and the zzso level of two late response genes zzso and zzso known to be induced by zzso Together, zzso and zzso caused a greater increase in these zzso than did either agent zzso zzso did not alter the extent of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but it did decrease the extent of zzso zzso in the absence of added zzso Thus, the ability of the zzso zzso to trigger zzso differentiation may depend on the state of its zzso at zzso and/or zzso zzso Two other strains of zzso did not extend zzso when exposed to zzso even when zzso was also zzso Thus, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso is zzso zzso
