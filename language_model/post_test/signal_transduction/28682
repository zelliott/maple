The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso cancer cell growth and immune cell function, however, its function within cells has yet to be properly zzso To investigate the cellular function of zzso stable cell lines zzso expressing zzso were zzso zzso of zzso expression was found to decrease zzso zzso zzso of a number of cellular proteins including the zzso zzso and to inhibit growth zzso zzso of components of the zzso pathway, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was supported by data showing that zzso expression resulted in a reduction in cell zzso zzso cells had fewer zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso and were defective in interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with lack of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso interference reflection zzso of live cells revealed that although small focal contacts at the leading edge were generated in zzso cells, they failed to mature into stable focal zzso as found in control zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that zzso cells retained limited random zzso but showed no zzso towards a zzso of zzso In addition, zzso contacts were zzso with a change in the zzso of zzso from discrete areas of zzso contact to large areas of membrane interaction, and there was a parallel zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a negative regulator of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
