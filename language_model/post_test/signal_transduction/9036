zzso changes in synaptic strength are well established as zzso long-term plasticity underlying learning and memory, but zzso zzso zzso zzso could complement changes in synaptic strength and regulate network zzso It is thought that zzso mechanisms match intrinsic zzso to the incoming synaptic drive, but evidence for involvement of zzso zzso is zzso Here, we show that zzso synaptic activity zzso target zzso zzso and switches the basis of action potential zzso from zzso to zzso zzso channel dominance, thereby adjusting zzso signaling between low and high activity states, zzso This zzso zzso signaling dramatically increases zzso currents in both the auditory brain stem and zzso zzso transforming synaptic integration and information transmission but with only modest changes in action potential zzso We conclude that zzso oxide is a zzso regulator, tuning zzso zzso to the recent history of zzso synaptic zzso over intervals of minutes to zzso
