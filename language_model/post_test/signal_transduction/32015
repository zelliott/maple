zzso in zzso is orchestrated by a series of zzso changes that occur towards the end of an zzso However, little is understood about the mechanisms that trigger these zzso zzso Here, nutritional zzso were manipulated to investigate the minimal nutritional zzso required for a zzso zzso zzso to initiate a zzso zzso acids were found to be necessary for a zzso to zzso indicating the involvement of an zzso acid sensitive zzso Feeding zzso an inhibitor of the target of zzso zzso zzso delayed the onset of a zzso and resulted in zzso larger zzso zzso also suppressed the growth of the zzso zzso relative to the whole body growth, and this was accompanied by suppression of zzso production and zzso Higher doses of zzso also slowed the growth rate, indicating that zzso signaling also plays a role in systemic zzso zzso signaling therefore couples the nutritional status of the zzso to the zzso system to regulate the timing of a zzso
