Association of zzso binding proteins with steroid zzso protein as well as modifications of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the large number of zzso factors are important for the zzso and control of signal zzso in the zzso zzso Each of the steps in the zzso system, that is, the steroid zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso and zzso regulations of specific genes zzso response zzso zzso may be controlled by the zzso interactions with other proteins and zzso During the study on the regulatory mechanism of zzso system, we found a new zzso factor in rat liver zzso that increases the binding of activated zzso complex zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso and we named this factor zzso zzso promoter zzso Recently, we have zzso zzso protein to zzso and characterized zzso zzso has an zzso of zzso and is composed of two apparently identical zzso with zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso and its zzso point is zzso zzso increases the binding of activated zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso activity is dependent on the zzso concentration of zzso although zzso does not bind to zzso Interestingly, zzso can bind to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to which activated zzso also zzso In this article, we will zzso the zzso properties of this interesting protein zzso and will discuss our thinking about the mode of zzso
