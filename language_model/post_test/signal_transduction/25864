zzso has wide effects on cardiovascular and zzso zzso The aims of this study are to investigate the direct damage effect of high zzso and high zzso on zzso and to study the effect of zzso on insulin resistance induced by zzso in zzso and the possible mechanism underlying the zzso activities of zzso The changes of zzso zzso intake rates were detected by isotope zzso method and the gene expressions in insulin signal zzso zzso were detected by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso intake rate significantly reduced in high zzso zzso or high zzso zzso treated primary rat zzso zzso After the treatment of zzso zzso the zzso intake rate recovered to the normal zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso occurred in zzso and was the highest in zzso after the stimulation with zzso which can be blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso levels of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso genes in insulin signal zzso zzso These results indicate that the direct damage of high zzso and high zzso on zzso might be through insulin resistance zzso zzso can inhibit zzso induced insulin resistance by zzso zzso This may provide a clue for therapy for zzso disease in diabetes zzso
