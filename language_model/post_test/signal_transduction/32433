zzso zzso is a key event in the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the reaction and requires specific zzso loop zzso on zzso distinct from the sites of zzso for binding and zzso In this study, we characterize the formation of a stable complex between zzso zzso in native washed disk zzso and its zzso zzso of the zzso after zzso and subsequent zzso gel zzso demonstrates zzso binding of zzso zzso to the zzso A real-time monitor for the transition of the zzso zzso into the bound state is provided by zzso zzso binding zzso The complex has the following zzso zzso the zzso of the reaction rises in linear proportion to the zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso kinetic analysis yields a zzso rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant of the complex is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso but with zzso it decreases by at least a factor of 10; however, zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast to the binding of zzso and zzso the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso does not stabilize the zzso II zzso however, zzso zzso competes with the zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso zzso of the kinetic parameters to cellular zzso at room temperature suggests that free competitive binding of the zzso would strongly inhibit the zzso zzso process after a few hundred zzso zzso
