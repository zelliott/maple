Light is an important environmental signal that zzso plant growth and zzso One important zzso component involved in plant light responses is zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso regulates not only zzso but also other zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso by identifying genes that are regulated by zzso We report that zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso factor, is zzso expressed in the zzso zzso Analysis shows that zzso transgenic zzso expressing zzso fusion protein display some features of the zzso zzso including decreased zzso cell expansion, open zzso in the dark, and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso adult transgenic plants expressing zzso have shorter zzso smaller and zzso leaves, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso directly regulates two genes that are also expressed more abundantly in the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is required to repress the zzso gene in zzso and the zzso zzso shown in the zzso zzso are due to the combination of zzso of genuine zzso components and other zzso zzso
