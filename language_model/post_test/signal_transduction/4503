The zzso factor zzso is essential for lineage zzso in early B cell zzso In this study, we demonstrate by conditional zzso that zzso is required for B cell commitment, zzso cell development, and subsequent transition to the zzso cell zzso Later in B cell development, zzso was essential for the generation and maintenance of several mature B cell zzso Marginal zone and zzso B cells were lost, whereas zzso zzso and zzso center zzso B cells were reduced in the absence of zzso zzso of the B cell zzso resulted in impaired zzso zzso proliferation and survival of zzso zzso B zzso zzso responses were severely reduced upon zzso zzso as zzso were formed but not zzso zzso and zzso of zzso B cells identified zzso genes that zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso regulators implicated in B cell zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso efficiently induced the development of zzso cells at the expense of conventional B zzso These zzso and zzso analyses uncovered novel important functions of zzso in controlling B cell zzso
