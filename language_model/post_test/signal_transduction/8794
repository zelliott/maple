zzso 1 zzso a zzso gene for major mental zzso regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult zzso Here, we show that zzso suppression in newborn zzso of the adult zzso leads to zzso signaling of zzso another schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso an zzso binding partner that enhances zzso signaling in the absence of zzso and zzso binding to zzso prevents zzso zzso in zzso zzso multiple genetic zzso to enhance zzso signaling in zzso zzso in zzso exhibit similar defects as zzso suppression in zzso development that can be rescued by pharmacological zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso an zzso downstream zzso Our study identifies the zzso signaling zzso as a critical zzso target in regulating zzso development and provides a framework for understanding how multiple zzso genes may functionally zzso onto a common zzso in contributing to the zzso of certain psychiatric zzso
