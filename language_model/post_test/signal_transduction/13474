In this study we have used mature, primary cultured mouse zzso zzso cells zzso to initiate our studies on the mechanisms governing zzso trafficking of zzso receptors zzso zzso the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between the cell surface and cell interior was zzso Cell surface proteins were modified with a zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The proportion of unmodified zzso and modified zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso We found that 51% of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were expressed at the cell surface, thus identifying a zzso zzso pool of zzso in contrast to the low levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso This was paralleled by an increase in the zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso was increased at the cell surface and in the cell interior, zzso was increased almost exclusively at the cell surface whilst zzso was increased almost exclusively in the cell zzso The zzso pool of zzso was not zzso Thus, zzso zzso are subject to zzso regulated trafficking, zzso yet greater scope for zzso diversity and zzso
