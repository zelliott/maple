zzso zzso family 1 member C1 zzso zzso the conversion of zzso into inactive zzso It is suggested that zzso expression in the zzso prevents from the zzso effect of zzso on zzso during late zzso The aim of the study was to determine whether the zzso zzso administered during late pregnancy zzso of zzso or before zzso zzso of zzso influences zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were measured using real-time zzso and western zzso zzso zzso of zzso within zzso was also zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso expression only during the zzso period in zzso zzso protein was zzso in the zzso and zzso cells of zzso and maternal part of zzso at both stages of zzso Following zzso treatment, the intensity of zzso was higher zzso on day 108 of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso expression seems to be regulated by an zzso zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso survival by preventing the zzso effect of zzso
