Food intake is activated by zzso zzso zzso Y zzso which is mainly under the dual control of zzso and zzso zzso zzso arthritis zzso similarly as human zzso arthritis, is associated with zzso caused by yet unknown zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso under the conditions of zzso changes in zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso is involved in the central induction of zzso we studied its expression in the zzso as zzso 

AA was induced to Lewis rats using complete zzso zzso On days 12, 15 and 18 after complete zzso zzso injection, the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso or zzso The zzso expressions for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso from isolated zzso 

In AA rats, decreased zzso body mass and zzso fat stores positively correlated with reduced circulating and zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso plasma levels were zzso In zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in AA zzso AA rats showed zzso of zzso for zzso in zzso while zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

During zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso along with enhanced plasma zzso and lowered zzso levels zzso zzso food intake indicates a zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso suggests its role in keeping zzso anorexia in zzso The reduction in zzso may also contribute to zzso zzso
