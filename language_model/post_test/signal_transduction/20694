The efficacy of two structurally and functionally unrelated protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso C, was assessed in intact human zzso by studying zzso zzso in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, both zzso increased zzso in response to zzso but decreased zzso in response to zzso To further explore this phenomenon, gel zzso of zzso proteins from zzso or zzso zzso in the presence and absence of the two putative zzso zzso was zzso Although neither zzso nor zzso C proved to be effective zzso zzso in intact human zzso a strong correlation between the zzso of a 68 zzso protein and the rate of zzso zzso was zzso From these results, the indiscriminate use of zzso zzso in whole zzso is questioned and attention is drawn to the role of protein zzso in zzso zzso The 68 zzso protein was the major zzso zzso in resting zzso zzso acid increased zzso of this band, indicating active zzso group turnover under resting zzso
