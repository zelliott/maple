The zzso are a family of nine related proteins which function as signaling zzso for the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso of zzso To discern the in zzso functions of one of these zzso zzso we generated mice harboring a targeted disruption of this zzso zzso zzso mice, although smaller than zzso zzso are viable, survive to adulthood, and exhibit an early zzso of zzso zzso To study the cellular functions of zzso we generated zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso have lost the ability to form zzso DNA binding complexes and are unable to induce zzso from the zzso promoter zzso zzso Using the primary zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso is integral for induction of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We subsequently demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are partially resistant to zzso zzso effect, thus firmly establishing a role for zzso in zzso growth zzso We next examined cells in which zzso is most highly zzso specifically cells of immune zzso Although no specific zzso zzso was detected in the immune system of the zzso zzso mice, a functional zzso was observed in the ability of zzso to inhibit the proliferation of zzso activated by specific zzso In addition, primary zzso display defects in zzso repression of zzso zzso These data, taken together, establish a role for zzso in zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso as a potential zzso for zzso in modulating immune system zzso
