zzso is an immediate precursor of cholesterol in the Bloch zzso of zzso synthesis and an abundant membrane zzso in specific cell zzso The significance of the difference between the two zzso an additional double bond at position zzso in the tail of zzso is not zzso Here, we provide evidence that the zzso and functional characteristics of the two zzso differ and that this is because the double bond at zzso significantly zzso the zzso ordering zzso In model zzso zzso was significantly weaker than cholesterol in promoting the formation or stability of ordered zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso associated less avidly than cholesterol with zzso zzso Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations showed that the double bond gives rise to additional stress in the tail, creating a rigid structure between zzso and zzso and favoring tilting of zzso distinct from zzso zzso effects of zzso in cell zzso were assessed upon acutely exchanging approximately zzso of cholesterol to zzso This led to impaired zzso signaling via the insulin zzso whereas zzso protein zzso was not zzso We suggest that the choice of cholesterol synthesis route may provide a zzso mechanism to zzso zzso functions in zzso
