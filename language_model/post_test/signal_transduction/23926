It is well known that zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and produce zzso oxide zzso In addition, these cells possess plasma membrane zzso zzso receptors which can be responsible for an zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the zzso of zzso receptors zzso the expression of the different spliced forms of zzso zzso and the zzso mechanisms involved in this zzso In zzso cells, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso whereas the other two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso directed against the zzso zzso of the external domain common to both the long and short form of rat zzso zzso and the selective zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso reduced both zzso and zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso but to a greater extent for the beta zzso zzso In line with these results, zzso (1 and 10 zzso added to the incubation medium increased to a greater extent the expression of zzso form than of the zzso The zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevented both zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso induced a zzso of protein zzso B zzso zzso that was prevented both by the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and U zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the expression of the two zzso forms of zzso zzso by zzso zzso was mirrored by the increased synthesis of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of both zzso and zzso proteins via a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This action may represent the molecular mechanism by which zzso exerts the zzso feedback on its own zzso
