zzso immunity against bacterial and zzso pathogens is zzso by Toll and immune zzso zzso zzso but little is known about the zzso response in zzso Here, we demonstrate that an zzso interference zzso protects adult flies from infection by two zzso diverse zzso Our work also describes a molecular framework for the viral zzso in which viral zzso zzso produced during infection acts as the pathogen trigger whereas zzso zzso and zzso act as host sensor and zzso zzso These findings establish a zzso model for studying the innate immunity against viruses in zzso
