zzso has been proposed as a component of the zzso zzso entry zzso zzso However, neither the molecular mechanism of zzso nor the role of zzso in this process is yet zzso We have examined possible molecular interactions involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso and report here for the first time that zzso is assembled in signaling complex associated with zzso zzso raft zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in low density zzso of zzso zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of plasma membrane cholesterol increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso influx, but not internal zzso release, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso provide a scaffold for zzso assembly of key zzso signaling proteins into a complex and zzso coordination of the molecular interactions leading to the zzso of zzso zzso we have shown that zzso is also localized in this zzso where it interacts with one or more components of this complex, including zzso This finding is potentially important in zzso the zzso function of zzso
