Pacific salmon are particularly susceptible to copper zzso zzso injuries that can ultimately inhibit zzso critical to zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso impairment remain poorly zzso In the present study, we conducted a short-term zzso exposure at levels relevant to urban zzso zzso 25 and 50 zzso , and investigated the roles of impaired zzso signal zzso and induced zzso as underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso Increased cell death in the zzso zzso was evident in zzso receiving zzso zzso to 25 and 50 zzso zzso zzso of zzso marker protein zzso a marker of mature zzso sensory zzso also decreased at 50 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a loss of type 3 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at all levels of zzso exposure, suggesting an zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso Accompanying the loss of zzso in zzso zzso were reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso these results support a linkage among the initial steps of zzso signaling in zzso salmon zzso injury, and suggesting that monitoring zzso zzso levels may aid in the assessment of salmon zzso zzso
