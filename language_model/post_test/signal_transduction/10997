The triggering molecular mechanism of zzso injury zzso which in clinical settings results in excessive and zzso inflammatory responses, remains zzso This study analyzes the role of the zzso system in an established zzso model of liver warm zzso followed by zzso By contrasting in parallel zzso knockout mice with their zzso counterparts, we found that zzso but not zzso was specifically required in initiating the zzso zzso as zzso by liver function zzso zzso zzso zzso pathology, and local induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We then investigated the downstream signaling zzso of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso regulatory factor 3, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to liver inflammation and zzso zzso This study documents the selective usage of zzso in a clinically relevant zzso disease model, and identifies a triggering molecular mechanism in the zzso of liver zzso
