zzso zzso zzso or chemical stimuli evoke pain through zzso of the peripheral terminals called zzso and many kinds of zzso and zzso receptors are involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel that serves as the molecular target of zzso zzso can be activated not only by zzso but also by noxious heat (with a zzso threshold zzso degrees zzso or zzso zzso all of which are known to cause pain in zzso Studies using zzso mice have shown that zzso is essential for selective zzso of pain sensation and for zzso zzso One mechanism underlying inflammatory pain which is initiated by tissue zzso and characterized by hypersensitivity is zzso of zzso In addition to zzso there are five zzso zzso channels in zzso all of which belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso super zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These channels exhibit distinct zzso zzso thresholds zzso 52 degrees C for zzso zzso approximately zzso degrees C for zzso zzso approximately zzso degrees C for zzso zzso approximately zzso degrees C for zzso and zzso 17 degrees C for zzso and are expressed in primary sensory zzso as well as other zzso Some of the zzso zzso channels are likely to be involved in zzso zzso since their zzso thresholds are within the noxious range of zzso
