zzso respond to viral infection through induction of zzso innate immune response pathways that lead to induction of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso as well as the direct induction of some zzso genes that mediate specific zzso or zzso zzso To assess the classes of genes induced directly upon treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso a mimic of viral infection, we made use of a zzso human cell line defective in responsiveness to zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were generated from a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso after extensive zzso with the zzso agent zzso We now demonstrate that zzso cells are defective in zzso and induced expression of zzso zzso zzso which may contribute to their zzso zzso After zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were largely responsive to a zzso challenge, as assessed by zzso of zzso and zzso regulatory factors zzso and induction of zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were assessed for global zzso responsiveness in zzso gene array studies alongside parental zzso and zzso zzso Several distinct patterns of gene induction in response to zzso challenge were identified, including genes expressed in a zzso manner, genes that required an intact zzso feedback for zzso and zzso genes that appeared not to require zzso for zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso is an important zzso of cellular responses to external zzso and demonstrate distinctions in the zzso of zzso genes induced when the zzso loop is present or absent in zzso
