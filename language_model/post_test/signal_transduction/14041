Although clinical benefit can be achieved after cardiac transplantation of adult zzso or zzso cells for zzso repair, these stem cells lack the zzso capacity unique to zzso cardiovascular stem zzso zzso the molecular basis for this age-related zzso in function could potentially transform cardiovascular stem cell zzso In this report, zzso populations of human zzso and adult cardiovascular zzso cells were isolated and zzso revealing the existence of a novel zzso of zzso cardiovascular stem cells that persist throughout life and zzso both zzso and zzso zzso profiling identified 41 zzso whose expression was significantly altered with age in zzso zzso These differences were correlated with reduced proliferation and a limited capacity to invade in response to growth factor zzso despite high levels of growth factor zzso on zzso isolated from zzso Further understanding of these differences may provide novel therapeutic targets to enhance cardiovascular zzso zzso
