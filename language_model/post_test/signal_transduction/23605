zzso zzso zzso stimulation can promote beta cell zzso proliferation and zzso However, beta cells lose their insulin zzso function in response to zzso zzso and zzso when cultured with zzso proteins for a long zzso zzso is a provisional zzso protein that is capable of maintaining beta cell function, yet the mechanisms by which this occurs is zzso The present study examined how zzso interacts with zzso receptors to promote beta cell cluster formation, proliferation and zzso The rat zzso cell line, zzso was cultured on zzso zzso or with zzso or 3-D zzso gels for up to 4 zzso zzso cultured with zzso formed zzso clusters and showed direct contacts with zzso determined by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso cells also had significantly increased zzso insulin zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels was observed in zzso zzso cells, which was associated with significantly increased cell proliferation and decreased cell zzso zzso zzso blockade affected zzso cell spreading on zzso gels, and resulted in significantly decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso promotes beta cell function, proliferation and survival via zzso zzso zzso
