The zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso form stable zzso that associate with the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to form an zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso binding to the zzso domain of a given zzso zzso triggers a zzso zzso change transmitted through the zzso to its zzso zzso control zzso a long zzso bundle that binds and regulates zzso zzso The zzso control module comprises three functional zzso the adaptation region possessing the zzso adaptation sites, a zzso region that zzso signals between other regions, and the protein interaction region possessing contact sites for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso On the basis of the spatial zzso of known signal zzso zzso zzso and engineered zzso bonds, this study develops the zzso hypothesis for signal transmission through the zzso control zzso This hypothesis proposes that signals are transmitted through the zzso bundle via changes in zzso packing and that the zzso packing changes in the adaptation and protein interaction regions are tightly and zzso zzso Specifically, strong zzso packing in the adaptation region zzso the zzso on state, while strong zzso packing in the protein interaction region zzso the off zzso To test the zzso hypothesis, zzso zzso likely to strengthen specific zzso contacts via zzso packing interactions were identified in the adaptation, zzso and protein interaction zzso For 32 zzso the zzso side chain was truncated to Ala to weaken the zzso packing and thereby destabilize the local zzso interaction provided by that zzso We term this approach a zzso zzso zzso Of the 32 zzso zzso 28 yielded stable zzso zzso analysis of the signaling state of these receptors revealed seven zzso zzso zzso all located in the adaptation region, that trap the zzso in its zzso signaling state zzso zzso activity, high zzso zzso Also revealed were five zzso zzso zzso all located in the protein interaction region, that trap the zzso state zzso zzso activity, low zzso zzso These findings provide strong evidence that a zzso zzso mechanism generates concerted, zzso zzso packing changes within the adaptation and protein interaction regions during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that stabilize local zzso interactions play a central role in this zzso in the on state, zzso are formed in the adaptation region and disrupted in the protein interaction region, while the opposite is true in the off zzso
