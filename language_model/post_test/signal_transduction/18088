The zzso zzso has been described as the consensus sequence for the zzso that directs zzso gene zzso Many zzso factors bind to this element and regulate the expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral zzso We have shown that zzso factor decoy zzso zzso the growth of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso was accompanied by changes in cell zzso and zzso To zzso the molecular zzso of the growth zzso by the zzso zzso we investigated the zzso signaling zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso treatment results in an increase in the zzso protein level in zzso human breast cancer cells that express zzso zzso The zzso protein levels were also increased in the zzso zzso treated cells accompanying a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso experiments reveal that the zzso zzso was due to increased stability of the zzso The decoy zzso treatment also enhanced the zzso zzso zzso in zzso along with the increase in zzso zzso zzso complex zzso Thus, the stabilization and zzso of zzso may have contributed to the growth zzso induced by zzso factor decoy zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso This decoy zzso approach offers great promise as a tool for defining cellular regulatory processes and treating cancer and other zzso
