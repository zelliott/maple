The human zzso cell line zzso responds to a reduction of ambient zzso to levels at and below zzso zzso by a twofold increase in zzso zzso of their zzso zzso signals sensed zzso across the zzso aspect of zzso cells, are rapidly (4 zzso zzso via zzso zzso into up to zzso increases in zzso zzso This suggests the presence of a zzso membrane zzso zzso similar to that described by Brown et zzso zzso in zzso and kidney zzso By zzso we were able to amplify a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso identity to a part of the coding region for the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates zzso protein at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso Our results imply that the zzso zzso is a potential zzso for the zzso of low zzso zzso into tumor promoting signals in human zzso
