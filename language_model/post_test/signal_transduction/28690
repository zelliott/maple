A critical issue in understanding zzso zzso zzso signaling is the individual contribution of diverse signaling pathways in regulating cellular growth, survival, and zzso We generated a functionally and zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacked the binding sites for seven early signaling zzso zzso the zzso family zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso restored cellular survival and migration but only partially rescued proliferation and was associated with the rescue of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, restoring the zzso zzso binding site in the zzso zzso did not affect cellular proliferation but resulted in a modest correction in cell survival and migration, despite a complete rescue in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, restoring the binding sites for zzso zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on cellular growth or survival, migration, or zzso of any of the downstream signaling zzso These results argue that zzso play a unique role in the control of multiple cellular functions and in the zzso of distinct zzso pathways via zzso
