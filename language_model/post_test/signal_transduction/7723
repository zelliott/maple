The zzso couple is a general death zzso whose activated signals lead to zzso zzso and zzso in adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso and cell death is a protective mechanism modulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso Met are known to mediate cell survival in developing zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly zzso We show here that Met zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary embryonic zzso and cell survival zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso treatment prevents degradation of zzso triggered by zzso zzso In contrast to this, Met zzso does not zzso zzso levels and its stability in zzso cells, thus showing the specificity of this regulatory mechanism for embryonic zzso zzso zzso down zzso expression zzso the ability of Met to inhibit zzso zzso death, demonstrating the functional requirement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso By combining genetic and pharmacological approaches, we also demonstrate that the zzso zzso is required in embryonic zzso to prevent zzso zzso degradation and zzso Thus, Met acting on zzso and zzso ensures high levels of zzso and disruption of this zzso contributes to zzso zzso and possibly to zzso liver zzso
