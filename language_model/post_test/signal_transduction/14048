zzso acts via zzso zzso receptors to control energy zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Y zzso zzso produce zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and express the long signaling form of the zzso zzso zzso Despite progress in the understanding of zzso signaling and function, the zzso zzso of zzso in target zzso has not been determined, primarily due to lack of sensitive zzso zzso Here we applied light zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso to investigate zzso zzso and signaling in mice expressing a zzso zzso selectively in zzso or zzso zzso We report that zzso receptors exhibit a zzso expression zzso We further show that zzso activates zzso zzso in zzso fibers within several zzso and zzso zzso of zzso mice and rats, and specifically in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice and in zzso zzso mice expressing zzso in a zzso specific zzso We did not find evidence of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso serial zzso of zzso segments from zzso and zzso zzso indicates a high density of zzso zzso In addition, we found that the zzso activates zzso signaling in proximity to zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso exhibits a zzso expression pattern in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling may therefore play an important role in zzso central effects on energy balance, possibly through zzso of synaptic activity via zzso zzso
