The use of zzso zzso zzso to express zzso zzso of growth factors represents a powerful strategy for studying zzso functions of growth factor pathways in experimental zzso Indeed, a single zzso injection can produce characteristic high-level and persistent plasma expression of soluble zzso zzso or zzso protein antagonists, allowing highly stringent conditional zzso of target pathways in zzso In this review, we describe our experience using zzso Ad to zzso growth factor pathways in zzso and discuss their advantages and zzso Using our studies on vascular zzso growth factor and zzso systems as examples, we further describe how zzso Ad can unveil previously unknown zzso roles of signaling zzso Finally, we discuss the potential zzso and therapeutic relevance of our zzso
