zzso is an important zzso protein with tightly controlled expression in activated T and zzso zzso Three potential zzso binding regions have been recognized within the zzso promoter: 1) an zzso zzso binding site at zzso zzso 2) a newly identified zzso zzso binding element at zzso zzso and 3) zzso zzso and zzso binding to an zzso element in zzso T zzso However, functional zzso of these sites remains zzso In this study we demonstrate zzso zzso of the newly characterized zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso signaling of human zzso results in zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, whereas zzso of the zzso zzso site zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso but little zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso site, as determined by competition and zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso occurs independent of zzso Western and zzso analysis shows increased zzso following zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding to the zzso zzso site in a zzso zzso This report is the first to describe zzso zzso of zzso and supports zzso involvement in regulation of zzso zzso
