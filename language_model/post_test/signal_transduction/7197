The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in several cancer zzso is a potential zzso marker in prostate cancer, and zzso zzso can suppress zzso in breast and prostate zzso zzso can zzso with activated zzso or Ras to enhance zzso It does so by regulating the activity of proteins that are essential for gene expression and cell zzso Several targets of zzso such as zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso At the zzso level, emerging evidence indicates that zzso also regulates zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso specific protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso To understand how zzso may affect zzso abundance on a zzso scale in zzso cells, we used zzso along with DNA zzso to identify genes whose abundance is significantly altered in response to a zzso zzso zzso scoring of zzso expressed genes showed that zzso gene targets control cell zzso zzso migration, the zzso signaling system and DNA zzso Several zzso whose abundance was significantly altered by zzso zzso contained zzso element zzso sequences in their 3' untranslated zzso We identified zzso and zzso as zzso interacting zzso proteins in zzso zzso was also found to stabilize all core zzso zzso in this study, thereby zzso our results from a previously published zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso may target the zzso of essential zzso that are inherently unstable and have short to medium zzso Thus, this study shows that an important biological role of zzso is to regulate zzso abundance and stability by interacting with specific zzso proteins that may play a role in cancer zzso
