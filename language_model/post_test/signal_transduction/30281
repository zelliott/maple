Visual and auditory hallucinations accompany certain zzso disorders, such as zzso and they also can be induced by the use or abuse of certain zzso The zzso zzso 2A receptors zzso are molecular targets for drug-induced zzso However, the cellular mechanisms by which the zzso mediates these effects are not well zzso Drugs acting at the zzso can trigger diverse signaling pathways that may be directed by the chemical properties of the zzso zzso are zzso proteins that bind to zzso receptors and represent a point where such zzso in zzso functional signaling could zzso Here we compare the zzso zzso zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice lacking zzso as well as in cells lacking zzso In mice, we find that zzso zzso a head zzso response by a zzso zzso However, zzso zzso the behavior independent of zzso The two structurally distinct zzso elicit different signal zzso and trafficking patterns upon zzso of zzso which hinge on the presence of zzso Our study suggests that the zzso interaction may be particularly important in zzso function in response to zzso zzso levels, which could have major implications in drug development for treating zzso disorders such as depression and zzso
