We undertook genetic and zzso approaches to investigate the relationship between zzso maintenance and zzso zzso as well as to uncover a possible link between a known zzso of cellular aging and senile bone zzso Using mouse models of disrupted zzso maintenance zzso including zzso in the zzso zzso zzso ), zzso zzso ), and zzso zzso double zzso predisposed to accelerated bone loss, we measured zzso zzso zzso zzso and markers of zzso differentiation in zzso zzso cells zzso We found that zzso maintenance is directly and significantly related to zzso zzso with dysfunctional zzso associated with impaired differentiation independent of proliferation zzso zzso defects in zzso differentiation are associated with increased zzso expression and zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice do not have substantial zzso dysfunction and spontaneously differentiate into zzso These results suggest that critical zzso dysfunction may be a prominent mechanism for age-related osteoporosis and limits zzso differentiation into zzso cells via the zzso zzso
