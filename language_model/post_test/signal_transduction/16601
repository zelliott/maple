zzso zzso produce zzso oxide zzso to modify proteins at zzso and zzso sites, thereby regulating vital cell zzso The majority of NO produced is widely assumed to be neutralized into supposedly zzso zzso products including zzso zzso Here we show that zzso also ubiquitous in dietary sources, is remarkably efficient at zzso the same protein sites, and that zzso zzso zzso account for the zzso levels of these modifications in zzso We further find that zzso readily affects zzso zzso production, zzso zzso activities, and heat shock protein 70 and zzso zzso expression in a variety of zzso These cellular activities of zzso combined with its stability and abundance in zzso suggest that this zzso has a distinct and important signaling role in zzso biology, perhaps by serving as an zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be of great importance to NO zzso
