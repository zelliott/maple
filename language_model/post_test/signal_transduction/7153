zzso is the most effective inhibitor of zzso release, and zzso was recently identified as one of the primary zzso factors in zzso In this study, we analyzed the possible zzso zzso pathways that are involved in the mechanisms induced by zzso and zzso to regulate zzso zzso Using a pharmacological approach, the blockade of the zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso of zzso release but did not affect the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced the zzso release induced by two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reversed both the zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso release evoked by zzso and zzso were completely abolished by zzso The blockade of the zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso release but had minimal effects on the zzso actions of zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso did not modify the zzso or zzso regulation of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso release is zzso by both the zzso and the zzso pathways and not by the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso is zzso by both the zzso and the zzso pathways and is independent of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
