The early zzso events that may ultimately contribute to the assembly and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso in guinea-pig zzso zzso were investigated in response to zzso B4 zzso zzso promoted a zzso transient and zzso increase in the rate of zzso generation that was zzso by R 59 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating protein zzso C zzso in the genesis of this zzso This conclusion was supported by the finding that the zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated (by about zzso the peak rate of zzso zzso generation under conditions where the same response evoked by 4 zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by more than zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso doubled the amount of zzso produced by zzso which may relate to the ability of zzso to inhibit cell zzso through zzso C zzso Indeed, zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso and the duration of the zzso transient in zzso zzso designed to assess the relative importance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso D zzso did not play a major zzso Thus, although zzso generation was abolished by zzso this was apparently unrelated to the zzso of zzso as zzso failed to stimulate the formation of zzso in zzso zzso Rather, the zzso was probably due to the ability of zzso to increase the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso mechanisms were implicated in zzso generation, as zzso elevated the zzso content and zzso free zzso concentration in intact cells, and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso did not affect zzso zzso production at zzso at which it abolished the respiratory burst evoked by zzso in human zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso activates the zzso zzso in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms that involve zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso of additional pathways that do not require zzso is also suggested by the finding that zzso evoked a significant respiratory burst in zzso zzso
