In certain types of cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso by viral zzso zzso zzso death, likely engaged into the elimination of zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso on cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso (a synthetic analogue of viral zzso results in the induction of surface zzso zzso however, the zzso effect of such signaling has not been zzso In this study, zzso zzso were found to suffer severe detachment from zzso and subsequent zzso a phenomenon suggestive of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the comparative analysis of zzso lines derived from primary zzso syndrome zzso patients zzso and zzso controls had revealed that zzso are particularly susceptible to zzso zzso as it was triggered by zzso low zzso of zzso This finding correlated with significantly higher zzso surface zzso expression by zzso a feature indicative of their intrinsic zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso appears to extend beyond the induction of innate immune responses and to involve the zzso of zzso death via zzso In the same context, the increased vulnerability of zzso to the zzso effect of zzso zzso is likely associated with the intrinsic zzso processes that apparently operate in the zzso of SS patients, and a feature of key zzso importance for the zzso
