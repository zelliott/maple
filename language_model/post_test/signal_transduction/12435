Recent results have suggested a role for zzso in acute brain injury but an involvement in zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso is a regulated process essential for cellular zzso it may represent an additional type of cell death zzso This study employed a modified zzso zzso rat model under guidance by zzso pressure monitoring to investigate whether zzso zzso is involved in the early brain injury following zzso zzso control rats underwent an identical procedure without vessel zzso zzso zzso was performed to examine the zzso changes in neural cells after zzso Additionally, zzso protein light zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso there was a marked increase in zzso and zzso in zzso at Day 1 following zzso Although zzso could be detected in zzso control rats, the conversion of zzso to zzso was significantly increased at Day 1 zzso and Day 3 zzso The zzso of zzso expression paralleled the zzso zzso zzso expression was also elevated at Day 1 zzso zzso study with zzso against zzso and zzso showed numerous positive stained cells after zzso especially in deep layers of the zzso zzso Double zzso revealed zzso expression predominantly in zzso This present study showed that the zzso zzso is activated in zzso in the acute phase after zzso
