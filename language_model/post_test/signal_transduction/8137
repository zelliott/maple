In zzso primary cultures of rat zzso stress leads to cell shrinkage and activates zzso zzso channels as the main mechanism of regulatory cell volume zzso The process is found to employ the zzso zzso of channels into the plasma membrane and (in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso but not zzso zzso are part of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso stress leads to the formation of stress zzso and significantly alters the activity of zzso zzso and zzso These latter effects, however, are likely to reflect the restoration of cell shape rather than the regulation of cell volume, both most probably zzso at the level of focal zzso and zzso
