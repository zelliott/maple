This study aimed to explore the role of high mobility group zzso box 1 zzso and its zzso toll like zzso 4 zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We constructed zzso zzso and control zzso mouse models of zzso zzso injury and subjected the mice to 30 zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Light microscope was used to observe structural changes in the zzso zzso levels were measured using quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso levels were analyzed via zzso zzso zzso studies, quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrated that fewer zzso infiltrated in the zzso of zzso mice after zzso zzso and that zzso zzso markedly decreased the zzso injury caused by zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and zzso all of which were zzso by zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays a central role in recruiting zzso during zzso zzso leading to worsened zzso zzso zzso This recruitment mechanism is possibly due to its inflammatory and zzso functions based on the zzso zzso
