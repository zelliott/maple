zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso that stimulates zzso T cells resulting in zzso calcium zzso increase in a zzso toxin zzso zzso We have examined the zzso role of the zzso in T cell activity by comparative investigation of zzso signaling pathways accompanied with zzso T cell zzso with a well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited both of zzso and zzso zzso T cell zzso indicating that zzso and zzso zzso activity were required for the zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso but not zzso T cell zzso It indicates that zzso zzso signaling is necessary for only zzso by zzso One of the well-known cellular molecules involving zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was activated by zzso but not by zzso ruling out a possible role of zzso on the zzso zzso These results indicate that the synthetic zzso zzso stimulates T cell zzso showing unique signaling and provide a useful tool for the study of T cell zzso zzso
