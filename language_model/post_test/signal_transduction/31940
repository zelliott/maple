The vascular response to pregnancy has been frequently studied in zzso artery models by investigating zzso cell zzso and smooth muscle cell zzso responses to mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso and pharmacological stimuli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is unclear to what extent these pathways contribute to normal zzso zzso across species, zzso and/or zzso age and at which zzso level pregnancy affects the zzso We performed a zzso on responses to mechanical and pharmacological stimuli associated with zzso zzso of zzso arteries and included 55 zzso zzso out of 398 zzso Most included studies zzso were performed in zzso and zzso rats zzso and compared late gestation versus zzso controls zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso in all investigated zzso Only in zzso pregnancy additionally stimulates both zzso zzso sensitivity zzso reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso increase in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso We conclude that 1) pregnancy zzso zzso zzso at term among all investigated species, and the contribution of additional vascular responses is species and strain specific, and 2) late pregnancy mediates zzso through changes at the zzso level for the substances zzso The initial steps of zzso in early pregnancy remain to be zzso
