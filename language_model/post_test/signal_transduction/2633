zzso of zzso to cells of the zzso zzso zzso growing on a zzso carbon source triggers a zzso transient increase in the zzso zzso The occurrence of this zzso spike appears to be correlated zzso with the zzso state of the zzso This was also observed for the zzso zzso which is deficient in zzso repression and which displayed the zzso signal zzso When cells of the zzso zzso were starved for nitrogen on a zzso zzso they rapidly lost zzso similarly to zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso arrest of the zzso zzso under such conditions was zzso zzso zzso a typical feature of cells entering the stationary phase zzso was very short-lived in the zzso zzso under the same zzso These results are in agreement with the presence of continuous zzso zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso cells on a zzso zzso zzso In the course of these experiments a spontaneous zzso zzso zzso (for zzso of zzso was isolated which survived nitrogen zzso on a zzso medium much better than the zzso zzso It also showed normal zzso arrest and much longer zzso of zzso The zzso zzso also caused inability to grow on zzso carbon sources and absence of zzso depression, and it was zzso to zzso for these characteristics zzso The isolation of this zzso depression zzso supports the idea that the zzso in zzso repression of the zzso zzso is the cause of its rapid loss of viability during nitrogen zzso on a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
