Globally, gastric cancer is the second most common cause of zzso death, with the majority of the health burden borne by economically zzso zzso 

Here, we report a genetic characterization of 50 gastric zzso samples, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso as well as zzso sequencing of the coding regions of zzso genes belonging to various pathways known to be altered in other zzso 

zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso cell cycle, DNA damage and zzso zzso 

The data suggests targeted therapies approved or in clinical development for gastric zzso would be of benefit to zzso of the patients zzso In addition, the novel zzso detected here, are likely to influence clinical response and suggest new targets for drug zzso
