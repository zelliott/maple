Chemical zzso is the main mechanism by which biological function is controlled at all levels, from the single cell to the whole zzso Chemical recognition is the function of zzso which, in addition to zzso zzso chemical signals, are also the target of many important experimental and therapeutic zzso zzso therefore, lie at the heart of zzso This article describes the way in which the zzso concept originated early in the 20th century, and evolved through a highly innovative stage of quantitative theory based on chemical zzso to the point where receptors were first isolated and later zzso until we now have a virtually complete zzso of all the receptors present in the zzso Studies on signal zzso are revealing great complexity in the events linking zzso binding to the zzso or therapeutic zzso Though some simple quantitative rules of zzso zzso are still useful, the current emphasis is on zzso the pathways that link receptors to responses, and it will be some time before we know enough about them to embark on the next phase of zzso zzso
