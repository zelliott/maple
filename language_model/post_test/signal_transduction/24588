A rat vascular zzso zzso zzso has been zzso expressed into Chinese zzso zzso cells and the resulting zzso zzso zzso has been functionally zzso This zzso binds zzso zzso II with an affinity of zzso zzso and the displacement of this zzso by a series of zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso II to this zzso causes a rapid increase in zzso zzso production, whereas this effect is not observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso II and at a lesser extent zzso I are also able to produce an increase in zzso zzso More importantly, the actions of zzso II on cell division were clearly demonstrated in this model, since zzso II is able to stimulate DNA synthesis by zzso and double the cell population of the zzso cells in 36 hours in the absence of any other growth factor, whereas no effect is observed in zzso zzso
