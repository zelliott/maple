The nuclear zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso has been shown to play pivotal roles in preventing zzso toxicity and zzso zzso These protective roles of zzso have been attributed in part to its involvement in the induction of Phase II drug zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso through the zzso response element zzso signaling zzso This review summarizes the current research status of the identification of zzso drug metabolism zzso zzso especially Phase II zzso and Phase III drug zzso In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated regulation of Phase II zzso and Phase III zzso will also be discussed based on findings published in the zzso
