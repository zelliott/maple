zzso evidence shows that zzso stress is a major cause in development of brain zzso Low activity of the zzso oxygen species zzso system as well as high levels of zzso damage markers have been observed in brain tissue of patients with neurodegenerative and other brain diseases to a larger extent than in healthy zzso Many studies aimed to develop effective and safe zzso strategies for the therapy or prevention of brain zzso Nevertheless, it became clear that rigorous suppression of zzso is deleterious for normal cell zzso Thus, approaches that can regulate the zzso levels over a wide range, from zzso to zzso will be a powerful tool for zzso A most prominent target for such zzso management is the family of zzso zzso receptors zzso All three members zzso zzso and zzso of this nuclear zzso zzso form a tightly connected zzso For individual zzso zzso zzso properties have been well zzso Their involvement in regulation of zzso production and degradation zzso the therapeutic zzso Nevertheless, the current zzso of the involvement of zzso in zzso therapy ignore such zzso of zzso and aim at zzso effects of individual zzso zzso but do not take into account the necessity of careful regulation of zzso zzso The present review zzso summarizes the data, which support the concept of the zzso zzso in brain, zzso demonstrates that usage of the zzso zzso allows the regulation of zzso genes over a wide range, from zzso to zzso and zzso summarizes the known data concerning the zzso zzso involvement in regulation of zzso Our report opens new directions in the field of zzso zzso zzso
