zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso inherited zzso disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and zzso caused by zzso in zzso zzso bleeding is a recognized complication and cause of mortality in zzso There are multiple case reports of zzso vessel abnormalities and other vascular anomalies in zzso The objective of this study was to characterize the nature and spectrum of vascular anomalies in zzso 

zzso chart review of 268 individuals with zzso was zzso Twenty-five patients zzso had zzso vascular anomalies or zzso Sixteen patients had documented structural vascular zzso Two had zzso artery zzso 7 had internal carotid artery anomalies, and another had a middle cerebral artery zzso zzso disease was described in 1 zzso Three of the 16 patients had zzso zzso and 2 had zzso zzso One of the patients with a zzso artery aneurysm also had zzso of the zzso One of the individuals with an internal carotid artery anomaly also had zzso artery zzso Nine more patients had zzso events without documented vessel zzso zzso accidents accounted for zzso of the mortality in this zzso 

The vascular anomalies described in our cohort of zzso individuals identify an underrecognized and potentially devastating complication of this zzso It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, accounting for zzso of the zzso We have also reviewed the body of evidence supporting a role for zzso and the zzso signaling zzso in vascular zzso
