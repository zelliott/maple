zzso zzso of zzso G proteins have been shown to be important for the zzso of zzso proteins to zzso The involvement of zzso in those signaling processes zzso by small zzso proteins of the zzso family was studied using zzso zzso We showed specific binding of bovine brain zzso to immobilized zzso fusion zzso In addition, brain zzso but not zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso binding to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was also decreased by brain zzso whereas zzso binding to zzso was not zzso We conclude that zzso zzso may participate in the process of membrane attachment and/or other regulations of zzso and zzso
