To investigate the role of zzso signaling in bone zzso we analyzed the bone zzso of female zzso knockout zzso zzso We found that zzso bone mass was significantly increased in 6- and zzso zzso zzso mice and that bone formation rates were also significantly increased in zzso zzso zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies were performed using bone zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and differentiation were significantly increased and zzso formation was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso protein levels were significantly increased in zzso cells derived from zzso zzso zzso In zzso deletion of the zzso gene under zzso zzso background significantly reversed the increased alkaline zzso activity and the expression of zzso marker genes observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were significantly increased in zzso cells derived from zzso zzso zzso The chemical compound zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for in zzso signaling studies in which zzso zzso and zzso expression was measured in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso mice and infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and these effects were significantly inhibited in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and marker gene expression were zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso marker gene expression was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso is a key negative regulator in bone zzso in adult mice and regulates zzso differentiation through the zzso signaling zzso in zzso
