Human zzso zzso is a widespread pathogen that zzso up to zzso of the human population and causes severe complications in zzso zzso zzso expresses four seven zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso - zzso zzso zzso and zzso - that show close zzso to human zzso zzso While zzso was shown to bind several zzso and to zzso activate multiple signaling zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the viral life cycle have not yet been zzso Here we investigated the possible zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and the functional consequences zzso We provide evidence that these receptors not only zzso but also zzso with zzso in zzso While the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso C zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to silence zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso we provide evidence that these orphan viral receptors have an important regulatory capacity on the function of zzso and as a consequence, may ultimately impact on the viral life cycle of zzso
