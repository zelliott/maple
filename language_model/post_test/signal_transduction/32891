zzso and zzso act at the end of a zzso signaling cascade that mediates numerous cellular responses for zzso To determine the role of zzso in different zzso we isolated and characterized a series of zzso zzso point zzso for their ability to zzso a zzso zzso activate zzso undergo zzso arrest, form zzso select partners, mate, and zzso All the zzso lie in zzso that are zzso among zzso zzso and are predicted to affect either zzso activity or binding to zzso or zzso The data argue that zzso regulates the various zzso zzso through the zzso of multiple zzso Different levels of zzso function are required for individual zzso with the most function required for zzso formation, the terminal zzso The ability of zzso to promote zzso formation strongly zzso with its ability to promote zzso arrest, suggesting that the two events are zzso zzso promotes recovery through a mechanism that is distinct from its ability to promote zzso arrest and may involve a mechanism that does not require zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inactive zzso zzso the ability of active zzso to activate zzso and zzso recovery without blocking zzso arrest or zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that in the absence of sustained zzso of zzso zzso inactive zzso blocks further differentiation by restoring zzso zzso Finally, suppression analysis argues that zzso contributes to the overall zzso response in a zzso strain, but that zzso is the critical zzso for all of the zzso zzso
