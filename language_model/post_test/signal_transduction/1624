In zzso the direct communication of zzso cells is zzso by gap zzso which are composed of zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso Studies of the few known zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso have shown that zzso zzso which are structurally analogous to the zzso in zzso play a major structural role as gap zzso core components in electric signal zzso We show that zzso zzso 2 zzso display a feeding zzso that originates from a failure of zzso cells to migrate and zzso during zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso organ that regulates food passage from the zzso into the zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso 2 is functionally required to establish a primordial structure of the zzso the zzso during the zzso of the embryonic zzso tube, which is under the control of zzso and zzso zzso Our genetic zzso and zzso studies, and experiments in zzso tissue culture cells provide strong evidence that zzso 2 is a target gene of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that an zzso gap junction gene controls zzso tissue and organ zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
