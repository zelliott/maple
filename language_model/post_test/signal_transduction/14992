Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is a newly found infectious disease that is caused by a novel human zzso SARS coronavirus zzso Because the mortality rate of SARS patients is very high, understanding the pathological mechanisms of SARS not only in zzso but in zzso is important for the prevention of zzso zzso of signaling pathways caused by zzso infection leads to the zzso and zzso of downstream zzso Two conflicting cellular programs, zzso to eliminate zzso cells and survival to delay zzso by producing zzso zzso occur in SARS zzso Recent studies regarding SARS and zzso have clarified that zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso of zzso expression and zzso both in zzso and in zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are keys for determination of cell survival or death in zzso cells in zzso Agents being developed to target these signaling zzso may be important for the design of zzso zzso This review highlights recent progress regarding zzso biology, especially signal zzso in zzso zzso
