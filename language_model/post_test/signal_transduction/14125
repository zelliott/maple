zzso are exquisitely adapted to transform light stimuli into electrical signals that zzso neurotransmitter zzso These cells are organized into several compartments including the unique outer segment zzso Its whole function is to absorb light and zzso this signal into a change of membrane zzso Another compartment is the inner segment where much of metabolism and regulation of membrane potential takes place and that connects the zzso and zzso The zzso is the compartment where changes in membrane zzso are relayed to other zzso in the zzso via release of zzso The composition of the plasma membrane surrounding these compartments varies to accommodate their specific zzso In this chapter, we discuss the organization of the plasma membrane emphasizing the protein composition of each region as it relates to visual zzso We also point out examples where zzso in these proteins cause visual zzso
