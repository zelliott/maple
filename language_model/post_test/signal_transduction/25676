The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso They exert their effects through G zzso receptors zzso most notably via zzso and zzso zzso The roles of the zzso zzso are beginning to zzso Both zzso and zzso are potent zzso for the zzso zzso however, zzso is rapidly converted to zzso which is also the main zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A selective and potent zzso at the zzso zzso would facilitate studies to discern between zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso a metabolically stable zzso zzso is a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso Two expression systems were used to evaluate the functional activity of zzso at human and/or mouse zzso and zzso zzso Through the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was almost zzso to zzso at zzso receptors but was the least zzso at zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso can couple with zzso and zzso is slightly more potent for zzso zzso binding compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso is nearly inactive in this zzso compared with its weak partial zzso activity in the zzso zzso In a vascular leakage zzso zzso is potent and active in mice zzso zzso zzso in zzso whereas the response is zzso in zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso selective zzso for the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso and it will be useful to zzso its biological zzso
