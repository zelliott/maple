The interaction between cardiac mechanics and coronary flow is highlighted zzso Left zzso zzso structure and geometry are related to coronary flow dynamics and used in the analysis of experimental coronary flow zzso The important role of the collagen mesh in the generation of the zzso pressure zzso the pressure in the zzso fluid, at a wide range of loading conditions is zzso The calculated zzso based on a structural model of the zzso zzso can explain most of the observed coronary zzso characteristics under a variety of loading and zzso zzso A more general zzso function, the zzso zzso pressure zzso is suggested to define coronary zzso and is presented here based on the dynamics of the coronary inflow under constant zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to be affected by fluid transport and the zzso zzso of coronary zzso and zzso zzso
