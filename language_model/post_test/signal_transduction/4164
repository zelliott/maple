The insulin resistance of skeletal muscle plays an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso syndrome and diabetes zzso Type zzso zzso of the signal transmission from the insulin zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso transport system was shown in insulin resistant zzso A reduced zzso zzso contributes also to insulin zzso We investigated the mechanisms of zzso of zzso function in isolated cell systems which are zzso with human insulin zzso Action of zzso alpha and acute zzso effects were studied in zzso Acute zzso gives rise, in the isolated cell system, to zzso of the zzso zzso activity of the insulin zzso within a few zzso This zzso effect seems to be zzso by zzso and zzso of various zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C probably leads to zzso of the zzso of the insulin zzso at zzso zzso The zzso of the insulin zzso which are responsible for the zzso effect of zzso do not seem to be localized either in the C zzso or in the zzso region of the insulin zzso The zzso effect can be antagonized in the isolated cell system both by protein zzso C zzso and so-called insulin zzso such as zzso Similar zzso effects, as induced by zzso can also be zzso by administration of the zzso zzso zzso As zzso alpha is probably increasingly expressed in zzso the zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso alpha could be an important factor for insulin resistance in zzso
