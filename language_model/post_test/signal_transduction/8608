Cooperation between different innate signaling pathways induced by zzso receptors zzso on zzso cells zzso is crucial for tailoring zzso immunity to zzso Here we show that zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso tailored zzso production in response to distinct zzso zzso was zzso associated with a zzso complex consisting of the scaffold proteins zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and human zzso virus type 1 zzso induced the recruitment of zzso proteins to the zzso zzso to activate zzso whereas zzso pathogens such as zzso zzso actively zzso the zzso complex from the zzso zzso This dynamic regulation of the zzso by zzso and zzso pathogens led to the enhancement or suppression of zzso responses, zzso Our study reveals another level of plasticity in tailoring zzso immunity to zzso
