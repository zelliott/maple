This work has been conducted to assist theoretical zzso of the different stages of the blue light zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport activity across plant zzso Ion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been measured continuously before and during unilateral zzso zzso 

Changes in zzso zzso at the illuminated zzso and zzso zzso sides of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied using a zzso zzso zzso technique zzso The zzso response was also measured zzso and correlations between the changes in various zzso zzso and zzso response have been zzso For each zzso the difference zzso between the zzso of flux at the light and dark sides of the zzso was zzso 

Plants that demonstrated a zzso zzso response also demonstrated zzso influx into the light side approximately 20 zzso after the start of zzso zzso This is regarded as part of the perception and zzso stages of the zzso signal zzso The first 10 zzso of zzso were associated with substantial influx of zzso zzso and zzso into the light zzso side of the zzso 

The data suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso stage of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso response is linked to changes in the transport of zzso zzso and zzso
