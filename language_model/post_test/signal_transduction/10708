Most zzso cells when placed in culture will undergo a limited number of cell divisions before entering an unresponsive zzso state termed zzso However, several pathways that are activated zzso or in concert can allow cells to bypass zzso at least for limited zzso These include the zzso zzso required to maintain zzso ends, the zzso and zzso pathways required to direct zzso in response to DNA damage, zzso zzso and zzso signals, and the zzso growth zzso zzso that may regulate lifespan and cell zzso In this review, we zzso recent findings related to these pathways in embryonic stem zzso cells and suggest that zzso cells are zzso because these pathways are tightly zzso
