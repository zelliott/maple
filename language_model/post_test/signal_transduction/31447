zzso regulatory systems play a central role in zzso bacterial responses to diverse zzso These systems can be studied in progressive zzso from input signals to the final zzso At the input stage, zzso factors zzso can be classified by their zzso from zzso or zzso zzso in zzso coli, up to three-quarters of regulators are estimated to respond directly to zzso signals through zzso and zzso zzso At the processing stage, the signals feed into a densely connected zzso The zzso regulators form most of the connections between zzso and, by zzso zzso zzso they coordinate and distribute the appropriate responses for distinct cellular zzso At the output stage, network motifs (which are specific patterns of zzso within a small group of zzso and target zzso determine the precise zzso zzso of gene expression zzso Eventually, these components of the regulatory system could be assembled to describe complex bacterial zzso at the level of whole zzso
