The Ras zzso zzso has major roles in normal cell function and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor for members of the Ras family of zzso We generated a mouse strain with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso died of vascular defects around zzso due to zzso and vascular integrity zzso zzso supporting cells did not develop zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso zzso exhibited cell zzso defects and lacked zzso and zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso cell zzso formed zzso These results show that zzso is required for zzso vascular zzso zzso the formation of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso normal response to zzso necessary for vascular zzso
