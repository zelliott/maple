zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a critical role in signal zzso and is a target for a novel class of zzso agents that aim to inhibit zzso cancer cell zzso Previous studies have demonstrated a zzso zzso repeat zzso in zzso 1 of zzso ranging from 14 to 21 repeats, that has been suggested to regulate zzso zzso The longer zzso with 21 repeats showed an zzso reduction of gene expression compared with the shorter zzso with 16 zzso zzso the evaluation of the zzso distribution of this zzso in populations of various ethnic origins will be crucial to understand the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We evaluated the influence of ethnicity on this zzso by zzso individuals of Caucasian zzso zzso zzso African-American zzso zzso zzso and Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The frequency of one of the longer zzso zzso 20 is significantly higher in Asian individuals zzso compared with zzso in zzso P zzso 2 zzso zzso In confirmation of prior studies, the shorter zzso 16 was the most common zzso in Caucasians zzso and African-Americans zzso but its frequency was significantly lower in Asians zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso 

Major zzso differences in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Our results may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying ethnic differences in drug response and may be helpful for future strategies of individualized therapy with zzso zzso
