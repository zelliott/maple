Cell cycle regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso are appealing targets for multiple myeloma zzso therapy given the increased zzso rates of zzso cells in advanced versus early stages of zzso We hypothesized that a zzso zzso inhibitor with a different spectrum of activity compared to existing zzso zzso could trigger distinct molecular zzso with therapeutic implications for zzso We therefore studied the small zzso zzso compound zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest and eventual zzso cell death of zzso cells, even at zzso zzso spared zzso cells, and overcame the protection zzso to zzso cells by zzso or zzso of the bone zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso triggered decreased zzso of zzso signatures associated with zzso drug resistance and stem cell renewal, including signatures of zzso of key zzso factors for zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients whose zzso had high baseline expression of genes suppressed by zzso had significantly shorter zzso and overall survival than those with low levels of these transcripts in their zzso zzso These observations provide insight into the biological relevance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
