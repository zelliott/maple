zzso zzso Pfizer, New York, zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used to treat zzso by improving penile blood flow via zzso of zzso However, its effect on zzso circulation is controversial and whether retinal zzso are responsive to this drug remains zzso In this study, the direct reaction of retinal zzso to zzso was examined and the signaling zzso underlying this zzso activity was zzso 

zzso zzso from zzso eyes were isolated, zzso and zzso without zzso zzso changes in response to zzso were recorded using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso dose zzso to zzso (1 zzso to 1 zzso This zzso was inhibited by the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso channel blocker zzso zzso and the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel blocker zzso The zzso zzso by the NO donor zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso but was insensitive to zzso In the presence of zzso the addition of zzso (1 zzso produced modest zzso and the inhibited zzso response was subsequently zzso The restored zzso was insensitive to zzso but was blocked by zzso 

zzso of NO zzso through zzso zzso leading to NO production and subsequent zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel opening is the major zzso zzso for zzso in retinal zzso Moreover, the elevated zzso from zzso or zzso zzso plays a zzso role for zzso to exert zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso
