zzso systems zzso comprise zzso zzso and their zzso response regulators and allow bacteria to sense and respond to a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso their zzso response regulators zzso in response to zzso In general, these reactions appear to be highly specific and require an appropriate association between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes one of the largest zzso of signaling proteins in bacteria zzso open reading frames zzso including at least zzso zzso and at least 143 zzso Of these, 27 are bona fide zzso response regulators, 21 of which are zzso adjacent to their predicted zzso zzso Using zzso profiling methods, we determined that the zzso zzso pairs display a kinetic preference during both zzso and zzso functions, thereby defining zzso signaling systems in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso pairs interact with zzso zzso zzso of approximately 1 zzso while zzso pairs had no measurable zzso Lastly, a zzso generated between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso specificity dictate binding zzso thereby establishing discrete zzso interactions which prevent cross zzso The data indicate that binding affinity is a critical zzso governing zzso signaling zzso for bacterial signal zzso zzso 

Using in zzso zzso and zzso profiling zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have taken a zzso approach to demonstrate specificity for a family of zzso signaling proteins in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that previously identified specificity zzso dictate binding affinity and that zzso specificity follows zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that preferential binding affinity is the basis for signaling zzso in bacterial zzso zzso
