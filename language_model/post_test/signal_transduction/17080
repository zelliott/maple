zzso T cells are responsible for inducing several zzso diseases, including type 1 zzso We have developed a strategy to induce zzso in these cells by zzso the zzso zzso recognized by the T cell zzso By introducing zzso acid zzso into the zzso zzso at zzso that bind to the zzso the half life of the zzso complex is severely reduced, thereby resulting in zzso T cell zzso and zzso By treating a zzso zzso T cell population with an zzso zzso zzso the cells are rendered unresponsive to the wild type zzso as measured by both proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of T cells with zzso zzso peptides results in minimal zzso zzso or cell zzso zzso zzso stimulation effectively zzso a signaling program dominated by sustained zzso zzso activity, including elevated zzso zzso These negative signaling events result in an zzso zzso in which the T cells are not competent to signal through the zzso zzso as evidenced by a lack of zzso zzso and zzso despite high expression of the zzso zzso This unique negative signaling profile provides a novel means to shut down the zzso zzso
