zzso promoter binding protein zzso genes zzso a family of zzso zzso factors and play many crucial roles in plant zzso In this study, 27 zzso gene family members were identified in the apple zzso zzso zzso 15 of which were suggested to be putative targets of zzso Plant zzso were classified into eight groups according to the zzso analysis of zzso zzso Gene structure, gene zzso location and zzso analyses of zzso genes within the apple zzso demonstrated that tandem and zzso zzso as well as whole zzso zzso have likely contributed to the expansion and evolution of the zzso gene family in zzso Additionally, zzso analysis between apple and zzso indicated that several paired zzso of zzso and zzso genes were located in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso genes in apple demonstrated their diversified zzso expression zzso Most zzso zzso zzso which had relatively high transcript levels in zzso leaves, zzso buds and some floral zzso exhibited a more differential expression pattern than most zzso zzso zzso Finally, expression analysis of zzso genes in leaves upon various plant hormone treatments showed that many zzso genes were responsive to different plant hormones, indicating that zzso genes may be involved in responses to hormone signaling during stress or in apple zzso
