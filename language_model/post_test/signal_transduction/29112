zzso et zzso proposed decades ago that pressure zzso played a major factor in zzso injury due to zzso In the late 1950s, their experiments on concussion demonstrated that the principal factor in the production of concussion in animals was the sudden increase of zzso pressure accompanying head zzso They reported the increase in pressure severity correlated with an increase in zzso zzso resulting in animal zzso More recently, Hardy et zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of transient pressure zzso with impact zzso These studies indicate that short duration zzso should be further examined as a mechanism of traumatic brain injury zzso In the present study, we designed and zzso a zzso that simulated zzso noted in various head injury zzso We tested the effect of zzso on zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and survival genes were examined at 24, 48 and 72 h zzso zzso At 24 zzso we found elevated levels of zzso and survival gene zzso By 48 zzso a decreased expression of zzso genes was zzso This study reinforces the hypothesis that transient pressure acts to zzso the cellular response displayed following zzso
