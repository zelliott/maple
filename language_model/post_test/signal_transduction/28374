zzso zzso cells form structures containing approximately 20,000 zzso The size regulation mechanism involves a zzso counting factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso these in turn affect whether a group stays together, loses cells, or even breaks zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces a wide variety of zzso to the corresponding zzso including converting zzso to zzso The levels of this zzso previously appeared to be regulated by zzso We find that zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso results in the loss of zzso zzso and zzso protein and a decrease in the ability of cell zzso to reduce both zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grow normally and have decreased zzso levels compared with parental zzso The zzso cells form long zzso zzso and huge zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells causes cells to form normal zzso bodies, indicating that zzso affects group zzso zzso cells have normal zzso but a reduced zzso and computer simulations suggest that this could indeed result in the formation of large zzso zzso cells zzso low levels of zzso and zzso two components of zzso and this could partially account for why zzso cells form large zzso zzso cells are responsive to zzso and are partially responsive to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso but does not completely block the zzso signal zzso zzso Gas zzso zzso indicates that the zzso of several zzso are altered in zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso affects several zzso pathways in addition to converting zzso to zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso affects zzso zzso causes many effects on cellular zzso and has a major effect on group zzso
