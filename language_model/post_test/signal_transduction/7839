zzso disease zzso is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a zzso zzso repeat expansion in the gene zzso the protein zzso The most studied model of zzso the zzso transgenic zzso replicates many features of the zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso zzso these mice exhibit a progressive disruption of zzso zzso This is accompanied by an altered expression of the zzso clock genes in the zzso zzso zzso the principal zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are highly expressed in the zzso and zzso signaling plays an essential role in maintenance of ongoing zzso zzso We found a marked reduction in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso as well as a decrease in zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso These changes were coupled to a disruption of zzso zzso We observed no loss of zzso in the zzso and therefore suggest that the changes in zzso and zzso zzso are due to their decreased zzso In conclusion, we propose that impaired zzso signaling is an additional candidate mechanism for disruption of zzso rhythms in zzso zzso
