Treatment of advanced, poorly zzso tumors in animal models, considered the closest simulation available thus far for conditions observed in cancer patients, remains a major challenge for cancer zzso We reported previously that established tumors in mice receiving an zzso zzso to the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to enhanced tumor zzso zzso T zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that several poorly zzso tumors, including zzso zzso zzso lung zzso and zzso melanoma, once established as solid tumors or zzso are zzso to treatment by zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso rather than zzso or zzso of tumor zzso zzso during the progressive growth of tumors prevents zzso by zzso zzso Breaking zzso ignorance by zzso with a tumor zzso zzso although insufficient to stimulate a zzso zzso response, is necessary for zzso zzso to induce a zzso response leading to the zzso of established zzso Our results suggest a new approach for zzso of human zzso
