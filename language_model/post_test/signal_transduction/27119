The present study has examined the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of different zzso pathways for the generation of zzso activated killer cells, zzso It has previously been shown that the zzso promoted zzso cell response is zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is susceptible to zzso zzso and resistant to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso with zzso to induce zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso cell response was zzso as assessed by its resistance to zzso zzso These findings suggest a zzso in the pathways leading to zzso cell zzso To further determine whether zzso zzso a different zzso zzso to activate the T cells, we studied its effect on protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells in a zzso fashion, and resulted in increased levels of a number of zzso zzso Of particular note was the increase of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The changes in global protein zzso zzso were correlated with the zzso by zzso of zzso cell zzso activity, and the production of zzso zzso zzso specifically blocked all the effects which were induced by zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of zzso cells as well as the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso to the zzso level of zzso cells cultured in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso in pathways for zzso and zzso zzso generation, zzso had no effect on the generation of zzso cells cultured in zzso zzso Thus while zzso is primarily involved in the generation of zzso zzso cells, zzso appears to be required for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
