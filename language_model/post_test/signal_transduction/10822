zzso zzso results in primary zzso of the zzso horn with zzso zzso of spared zzso zzso zzso Because descending zzso systems are thought to mitigate zzso transmission from the periphery and because zzso zzso can result in zzso pain, we sought to determine whether the zzso zzso response could be further zzso Because zzso molecules mask zzso plasticity of zzso zzso and because zzso signaling occurs through the zzso pathway, we inhibited zzso signaling after cervical zzso zzso in zzso An increase in the density of zzso and zzso zzso fibers was seen in the zzso horn 1 week after zzso zzso and zzso density continued to increase for at least 1 zzso One week after zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso increased the density of both fiber types over zzso zzso To examine behavioral effects of both cervical zzso and ROCK zzso we examined responses to evoked zzso mechanical and zzso zzso and cold zzso in the zzso were examined after single, zzso and quadruple zzso of zzso roots of the zzso zzso The most notable behavioral outcome was the development of cold zzso in the affected zzso after zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso both attenuated cold zzso and induced zzso plasticity after zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso signaling both promoted the zzso of intact zzso zzso fibers and alleviated pain after zzso zzso
