zzso zzso receptors zzso are members of the zzso of G protein coupled receptors zzso zzso receptors are relatively abundant in the central nervous system and in the peripheral zzso nervous zzso Several studies have suggested that zzso receptors also mediate some cellular events in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells contain zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso receptors changes cell zzso We examined the effects of several compounds on cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso These included a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso C inhibitor zzso the zzso 1-2 inhibitor zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we also investigated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso caused a decrease in DNA synthesis in zzso cells supplemented with zzso fetal bovine serum after zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso and zzso antagonized the zzso effect of zzso suggesting that zzso C and zzso calcium are involved in zzso zzso of proliferation in zzso zzso Our data also suggest that the regulatory roles of protein zzso C and the zzso pathways in zzso cell proliferation are independent of zzso zzso
