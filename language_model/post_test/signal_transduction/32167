The multiple biological responses to zzso are mainly zzso by the classical zzso receptors zzso and zzso which act as zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts a main role in the development of breast zzso therefore, the zzso zzso tamoxifen has been widely used although its effectiveness is limited by de zzso and acquired zzso Recently, zzso a member of the zzso G zzso zzso family, has been implicated in zzso the effects of zzso in various normal and cancer zzso In particular, zzso triggered gene expression and zzso responses induced by zzso and even zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso Likewise, additional zzso zzso showed the ability to bind to zzso zzso zzso and, in some cases, opposite actions through the two zzso We zzso a novel compound zzso zzso referred to as zzso and investigated its properties zzso through zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso binding experiments and functional zzso were performed in order to evaluate the biological action exerted by zzso through zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso displayed the ability to act as an zzso zzso for zzso and zzso as it zzso zzso effects on gene zzso and growth effects by binding to both receptors in breast cancer zzso Moreover, zzso was required for zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso as zzso by using zzso and performing gene zzso zzso 

Our findings provide novel insights on the functional zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the exclusive zzso activity exerted by zzso on zzso and zzso could represent an innovative pharmacological approach targeting breast zzso which express one or both receptors at the beginning and/or during tumor zzso zzso the simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso may guarantee major therapeutic benefits in respect to the use of a selective zzso zzso zzso
