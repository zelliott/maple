zzso is a key regulator of pancreatic zzso cell differentiation in zzso essential for the generation of all mature hormone producing zzso It is zzso by zzso signaling that prevents pancreatic cell differentiation by maintaining precursors in an zzso zzso 

We show that, in zzso zzso is not expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso do not display any apparent zzso zzso The control of zzso cell fate is instead fulfilled by two basic zzso factors, zzso and zzso that are both zzso by zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso zzso just after zzso and is required for the generation of the first pancreatic zzso precursor zzso zzso is expressed afterwards in the pancreatic zzso and pursues the zzso cell differentiation program initiated by zzso Their complementary role in zzso differentiation of the zzso bud is demonstrated by the loss of all zzso cells following their simultaneous zzso This zzso is due to a zzso of the initiation of zzso cell zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso is not the unique pancreatic zzso cell fate zzso in zzso A general survey of zzso cell fate zzso in the whole zzso system among zzso indicates that they all belong to the zzso family but not necessarily to the zzso zzso The identity of the zzso factor involved depends not only on the organ but also on the zzso One could, therefore, consider zzso stem cells into zzso cells without the involvement of zzso but via another zzso zzso
