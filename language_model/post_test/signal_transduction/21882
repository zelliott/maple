zzso K zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso expressed in zzso and is thought to play a key role in zzso degradation during bone zzso It is shown that the zzso maturation of Cat K was prevented by the zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso an zzso zzso zzso rather induced Cat K processing and maturation in zzso Furthermore, to determine whether Cat K processing and maturation signaling involves protein zzso C zzso mouse total bone cells were treated with zzso C, a specific inhibitor of zzso however, no effect was observed, indicating that zzso zzso C did not affect to zzso Cat K processing and maturation in zzso Thus, it is indicated that the zzso signaling zzso regulate Cat K maturation in zzso Since zzso zzso have the potential to zzso the cell via zzso zzso to prevent this possibility, we tested zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the absence or presence of zzso zzso of Cat K processing by zzso zzso or zzso was observed in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso resulted in enhanced potency of zzso zzso and zzso which zzso inhibited in zzso bone zzso with potency similar to that observed for zzso of Cat K zzso
