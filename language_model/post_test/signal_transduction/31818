Human zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso to dramatically diminish cardiovascular zzso zzso and its signaling zzso may provide targets to address cardiac zzso Here, zzso relationship, transcript, zzso zzso and zzso data indicate the presence of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso identified that zzso was essential for activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso antagonized the effect of zzso in cellular and integrated cardiac zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were amplified from zzso and zzso Maintenance of the zzso transient when zzso impaired zzso zzso indicated the zzso was its primary downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso detected after zzso treatment but absent in zzso cells was consistent with this zzso zzso zzso C zzso but not zzso inhibitor diminished the influence of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso targeting this zzso may help address cardiovascular zzso
