zzso growth factor beta zzso which generally stimulates the growth of zzso derived cells but zzso the growth of zzso cells, has been proposed as a possible target for cancer zzso However, concerns have been raised that whereas zzso of zzso signaling could be zzso for zzso in which zzso promotes tumor development and/or zzso systemic zzso blockade of this signaling zzso could also promote the growth of zzso zzso 

We examined the effect of a zzso inhibitor on zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso tumors in zzso rats, which are genetically predisposed to develop these tumors with a high zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling with the zzso I zzso R zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso significantly decreasing tumor zzso and zzso and reducing the size of these zzso zzso However, zzso was also zzso and zzso for zzso cells in the kidney and exacerbated the growth of zzso zzso present in the zzso of these zzso 

Although zzso zzso of zzso signaling with zzso may be zzso for zzso tumors, zzso of this signaling zzso seems to promote the development of zzso zzso
