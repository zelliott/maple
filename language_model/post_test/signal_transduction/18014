The rare diseases zzso zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso breakage syndrome zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso share a variety of zzso abnormalities such as zzso instability, radiation sensitivity and defects in zzso checkpoints in response to zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein zzso that is activated by zzso radiation or zzso drugs, whereas zzso is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA zzso zzso Here, because of the similarities between AT and zzso we evaluated the functional interactions between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso radiation and induction of zzso responses in zzso cells indicated that zzso may not be required for zzso to zzso after zzso zzso However, zzso was zzso on zzso zzso in an zzso manner in zzso and in zzso after zzso zzso A zzso construct zzso at the zzso zzso site zzso an zzso checkpoint induced by zzso radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional zzso in zzso zzso These observations link zzso and zzso in a common zzso zzso and provide an explanation for zzso similarities in these two zzso
