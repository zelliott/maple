A central process in the maintenance of zzso patterning in the adult zzso is the head zzso zzso zzso the potential to form a secondary zzso which is zzso in the head and is graded down the body zzso Earlier evidence suggested that this zzso was based on a single zzso Using transplantation experiments, we provide evidence that the zzso the zzso part of the head, has the characteristics of an organizer in that it has the capacity to induce host tissue to form most of the second zzso By contrast, tissue of the body column has a zzso capacity, but not an zzso zzso That the zzso capacity is confined to the zzso is supported by experiments involving a zzso zzso The zzso but not the body column, zzso a zzso leading to the formation of a second zzso In addition, variations of the transplantation zzso and zzso zzso provide evidence for several characteristics of the zzso The zzso capacity of the head and the zzso capacity of the body column are based on different zzso Head zzso zzso signal produced in the head and transmitted to the body column to prevent head formation, zzso the effect of the inducing signal by interfering with formation of the zzso These results indicate that the organizer characteristics of the zzso of an adult zzso are similar to those of the organizer region of zzso zzso They also indicate that the zzso model provides a reasonable framework for the mechanisms that zzso the organizer and its zzso In addition, the results suggest that a region of an zzso or adult with the characteristics of an organizer arose early in zzso zzso
