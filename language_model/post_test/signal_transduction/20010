zzso cold preservation frequently causes delayed zzso graft function resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso downstream from protein zzso C zzso may reduce zzso zzso injury and zzso zzso graft zzso We therefore evaluated the effect of zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso acid zzso on rat zzso transplants with prolonged cold zzso 

zzso zzso from male Lewis rats were cold stored in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 zzso before zzso zzso zzso received zzso (30 zzso twice daily), zzso (20 zzso or vehicle through zzso starting 1 zzso after zzso Renal function was evaluated by serum zzso and zzso on day 2 zzso zzso and day 7 zzso zzso after zzso zzso inflammation was determined by real-time zzso chain reaction of zzso genes and zzso Signaling mechanisms were studied by Western zzso and zzso 

zzso enhanced immediate transplant function, attenuated zzso injury, and accelerated zzso function recovery compared with zzso Despite the stronger zzso capacity of zzso only zzso treatment achieved significant cellular protection with zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso both involved in cellular stress and zzso were likely the responsible mechanism of zzso 

The zzso inhibitor zzso effectively ameliorated zzso organ damage and promoted zzso in a clinically relevant model of extended zzso cold preservation followed by zzso zzso targeting of zzso may be beneficial for recipients receiving zzso transplants at risk for delayed graft zzso
