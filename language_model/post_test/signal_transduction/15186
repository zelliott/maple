zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs more often in men than in zzso Male zzso carriers usually have higher viral zzso which is a well-known risk factor for zzso Whether and how the male zzso axis regulates zzso zzso and replication is investigated zzso We used zzso transgenic mice to evaluate any sex disparity of serum zzso B surface zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso effect on this zzso Compared to zzso zzso transgenic male mice showed higher zzso B surface zzso and viral zzso which were lessened by zzso of the zzso In a cell culture system, zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the effect of the zzso zzso on viral zzso and zzso We found the zzso zzso could increase the zzso of zzso zzso through its zzso zzso zzso A zzso region within zzso zzso I was identified that is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso The results from zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso further demonstrated a direct binding of zzso to this region, in a zzso zzso Two zzso element motifs in this region were identified, and their zzso can significantly abolish the zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated that the zzso zzso can increase the zzso of zzso through direct binding to the zzso element sites in viral zzso zzso This may explain a higher zzso zzso in male carriers and an increased risk of zzso
