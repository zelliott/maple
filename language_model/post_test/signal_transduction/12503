We have recently shown that the zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso by the zzso zzso Me zzso zzso zzso leads to an increase in zzso zzso zzso activity and an induction of zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso which does not induce zzso zzso zzso fails to activate zzso We report here that zzso zzso of zzso stimulates production of zzso oxygen molecules via zzso zzso zzso stress was measured with the fluorescent probe zzso zzso and the role of zzso was assessed by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and by zzso interfering zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso contributes to zzso production of zzso oxygen species, zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso (like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly induce zzso zzso synthesis via zzso signaling zzso whereas zzso that do not induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso (like zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to activate zzso synthesis in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the regulation of zzso zzso formation by zzso
