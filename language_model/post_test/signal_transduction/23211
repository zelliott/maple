Spinal zzso injury zzso frequently causes zzso persistent central zzso pain that responds poorly to conventional pain zzso zzso zzso factor zzso signaling appears to contribute to central zzso and zzso behaviors in certain animal models of chronic pain through effects zzso in part by the alternatively spliced truncated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linking zzso to zzso chronic central pain are zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso in central zzso pain after spinal zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso in mice significantly reduced zzso mechanical zzso locomotor dysfunction, zzso volumes, and white matter zzso Whole zzso analysis, confirmed at the protein level, revealed that cell cycle genes were zzso in zzso but not zzso spinal zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice showed increased cell cycle protein expression that was significantly reduced in zzso from zzso mice that express neither full-length zzso nor zzso Administration of zzso which selectively zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso locomotor deficits, and zzso horn zzso zzso changes after zzso similar to zzso zzso without altering zzso protein zzso In zzso mice, zzso had no zzso These data indicate that zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso and zzso pain through zzso of cell cycle pathways and suggest new therapeutic zzso
