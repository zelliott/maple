Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is the major zzso of zzso zzso family zzso In addition, zzso is known to be involved in the zzso of many zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B specifically interacts with zzso whereas the highly related zzso does zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso potential but not the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to zzso target promoters and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso depletion suggested a nuclear function of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso caused similar zzso However, zzso zzso in response to zzso or zzso was not affected by zzso zzso or zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso shifted zzso signaling to a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso depletion or treatment with zzso induced zzso in zzso multiple myeloma cells, whereas an zzso line was not zzso Thus, zzso support the zzso action of zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso both play pivotal roles, yet at different signaling levels, for zzso zzso and zzso These data also suggest a novel mechanism of zzso zzso
