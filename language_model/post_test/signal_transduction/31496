zzso zzso proteins zzso promote the dynamic interactions between the plus ends zzso of astral zzso and cortical zzso that are required for zzso zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso also associate with zzso pole bodies zzso the zzso equivalent in budding zzso Here, we show that deletion of four zzso zzso of the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, but these zzso fail to position the zzso when targeted to the zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we show zzso complexes in zzso zzso cells contain reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso dynamics is suppressed in zzso zzso cells, but it are restored by deletion of zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso dwelling of zzso in the bud is observed in zzso zzso cells, suggesting defective zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso restores zzso zzso positioning in the zzso zzso zzso reduces cortical zzso and promotes zzso zzso We propose that zzso via the tail of zzso promote the assembly of functional zzso complexes before their deployment to zzso zzso
