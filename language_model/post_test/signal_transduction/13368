Ion channels alternate zzso between two functional states, open and zzso This gating behavior is controlled by membrane potential or by the binding of zzso in zzso and zzso channels, zzso Although much progress has been made in defining the structure and function of the zzso zzso and the zzso sensors, how these zzso couple to channel opening remains poorly zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso interact with both the zzso zzso and the channel zzso It is proposed that zzso functions as a zzso element whose zzso change couples zzso binding with channel zzso Furthermore, zzso acid zzso between zzso zzso zzso segments and the equivalent zzso or zzso segments in zzso channels suggests that zzso channel zzso and gating are both structurally and functionally zzso
