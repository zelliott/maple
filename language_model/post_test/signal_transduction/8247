zzso in zzso triggers a series of periodic rises in zzso zzso that are essential for release from zzso I arrest and progression through zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso are switched off at exit from zzso zzso zzso zzso provided the first demonstration of the positive feedback loop zzso elevated zzso activity maintained these zzso zzso Since then it has been reported that zzso zzso the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and that zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso stop because the forming zzso zzso zzso C zzso that was delivered to the egg by the zzso zzso Here, using zzso we demonstrate in zzso eggs that zzso zzso stops at the correct time in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso factor is therefore not involved in terminating zzso zzso for these zzso Instead we found that zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso extract zzso However, such eggs were still capable of releasing zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso can stop even though the response to zzso remained zzso These data suggest that zzso activity promotes zzso production in the presence of the zzso factor, rather than zzso the zzso releasing machinery to zzso These findings suggest a new link between this cell cycle zzso and the zzso zzso
