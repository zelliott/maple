Exposure of zzso cells to ultraviolet zzso light and other zzso agents triggers the zzso response which is characterized by induction of a large number of genes including zzso zzso and the genes for DNA repair zzso and zzso regulatory proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso Upon DNA damage, the zzso tumor zzso protein zzso signals to restrict zzso zzso thereby allowing time for DNA repair to zzso zzso also respond to zzso stress by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In this report we investigated the effects of zzso of the level of zzso and zzso zzso protein on zzso and zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso rat zzso cell line, which contains a zzso gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso which allows us to regulate the relative level of zzso and zzso zzso protein produced in a zzso We measured the relative levels of zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells by using the immune complex zzso zzso and then zzso the fold induction of zzso after zzso zzso We demonstrated that cells expressing zzso protein in the zzso zzso (when grown at 32 degrees zzso exhibited a very low level of zzso activity that was induced zzso to zzso by zzso zzso When cells were grown at 37 degrees C or 39 degrees C to express predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly higher than at 32 degrees zzso zzso zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso protein resulted in zzso zzso although the overall zzso was only zzso because zzso activity was already high in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso activity, although we again observed a relatively high level of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso protein compared with cells expressing zzso zzso Control experiments confirmed that zzso zzso activity was not affected by temperature zzso Western zzso analysis of cell extracts indicated that expression of zzso zzso protein was significantly higher in cells expressing zzso zzso protein and was associated with low zzso levels of zzso zzso In contrast, cells expressing zzso zzso protein and very low levels of zzso zzso protein were found to have a higher level of zzso zzso zzso We also observed a reduced ability to induce zzso after zzso zzso of several other cell lines with zzso or zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for a novel connection between zzso status and the zzso level of zzso a critical zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, these studies suggest that the presence of zzso zzso protein in a cell not only affects zzso activity of zzso but also affects the ability of a cell to respond to zzso stress by zzso signals via induction or zzso of the zzso zzso
