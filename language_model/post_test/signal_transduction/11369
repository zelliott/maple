The steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso is a zzso zzso which has been found to be amplified in breast zzso We have now investigated the role of the zzso protein in breast cancer cell zzso Although zzso levels of zzso were present in most cell lines, high levels of zzso expression were observed only in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso by western zzso zzso zzso developed zzso zzso zzso were used in several zzso to show an association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the nucleus of zzso positive cell lines as shown by zzso zzso and a functional association of native zzso and zzso in zzso nuclear extracts was shown by zzso zzso zzso also recruited zzso protein from nuclear zzso shown by zzso and by zzso of zzso proteins bound to a zzso DNA zzso Additionally, zzso zzso were able to zzso zzso from nuclear extracts of chemically zzso cells but not from zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrated the presence of zzso and zzso as part of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso do associate physically in zzso breast cancer cell zzso We propose that in zzso amplified breast zzso a heightened zzso association may play a crucial role in the progression of these zzso
