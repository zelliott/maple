zzso zzso is a major strategy to prevent zzso zzso but it is frequently associated with increased bleeding because of impaired primary zzso The zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso VI zzso zzso may serve as a powerful zzso target because its zzso or absence results in profound protection against zzso zzso but no major bleeding in zzso 

Mice lacking zzso or expressing zzso zzso of the other major zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso were injected with the zzso VI zzso zzso and analyzed on day zzso zzso VI treatment resulted in a marked zzso zzso in zzso or zzso mice, as shown by dramatically prolonged tail bleeding zzso zzso zzso to collagen was studied in an ex zzso zzso zzso system under high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation restored defective zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso to zzso This process required the simultaneous zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso as demonstrated by use of the respective knockout zzso zzso zzso of zzso production by aspirin severely compromised zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso but not control zzso 

zzso VI therapy may result in defective zzso in patients with reduced zzso levels or zzso aspirin zzso These observations may have important implications for a potential use of zzso zzso zzso in the prevention of cardiovascular zzso
