zzso control of sister zzso separation is essential for the accurate transmission of genetic zzso Sister zzso must remain linked to each other from the time of DNA replication until the onset of zzso zzso when the linkage must be promptly zzso Recent studies suggest that the machinery that is responsible for the destruction of zzso zzso also degrades proteins that play a role in maintaining sister zzso linkage, and that this machinery is regulated by the zzso zzso Studies on these problems in budding zzso are hampered by the inability to resolve its zzso by light or electron zzso 

We have developed a novel method for visualizing specific DNA sequences in fixed and living budding zzso zzso A tandem array of 256 copies of the zzso operator is integrated at the desired site in the zzso and detected by the binding of a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso fusion expressed from the zzso zzso Using this method, we show that sister zzso segregation precedes the destruction of zzso zzso In mad or zzso cells, which lack the zzso checkpoint, sister zzso separation can occur in the absence of zzso The expression of a zzso form of the zzso zzso which can bind zzso operators on two different DNA zzso can hold sister zzso together under conditions in which they would normally zzso 

We conclude that sister zzso separation in budding zzso can occur in the absence of zzso forces, and that protein complexes that can bind two different DNA molecules are capable of holding sister zzso zzso
