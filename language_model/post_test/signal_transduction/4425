zzso growth factor zzso a conventional zzso factor, acts as a zzso factor on several types of zzso in the central nervous zzso We found that zzso prevented the death of rat cerebral cortical zzso cultured in a 50% oxygen zzso This zzso cell death showed features of zzso cell death, which was blocked by zzso of zzso or protein zzso zzso prevented the zzso death of the cultured cortical zzso in a zzso zzso Basic zzso growth factor zzso also prevented this cell death, although there was no apparent additive effect of zzso and zzso Among the cultured cortical zzso we observed zzso possessing the zzso zzso and cells expressing zzso protein in response to zzso The cortical zzso were cultured in the presence of zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso of that of the corresponding zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the cultured cortical zzso is thought to be due to a direct zzso We also examined zzso zzso in the cultured cortical zzso We found that zzso induced the sustained zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and sustained the zzso of zzso protein zzso in the cultured cortical zzso We suggest that zzso may exert the survival effect through the prolonged zzso of the zzso zzso
