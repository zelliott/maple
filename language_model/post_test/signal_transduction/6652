zzso zzso beta zzso zzso induced zzso synthesis of zzso and zzso of both zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso in cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso beta was able to induce a zzso increase in membrane bound zzso activity in the cells within 1 zzso zzso levels of zzso were however observed only after 4 hours stimulation of the cells while significant levels of soluble zzso activity were observed only after 16 hours stimulation of the zzso zzso with zzso beta of zzso cultures zzso with zzso acid resulted in a loss of label from both zzso and zzso in only 10 zzso which was not observed in control zzso zzso These results are indicative that the two zzso are the principal source of zzso acid for zzso induced zzso zzso
