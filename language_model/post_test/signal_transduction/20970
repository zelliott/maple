The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso When this gene was expressed in the zzso cell line zzso it was found to abrogate zzso zzso dependence of this cell line and to block its ability to terminally differentiate into zzso in response to zzso zzso factor zzso In contrast, a highly related zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to render this cell line zzso independent for growth or to block its ability to undergo terminal differentiation in the presence of zzso The active structural zzso of zzso that are responsible for the zzso of zzso dependence of zzso cells and the mechanisms by which zzso zzso these cells are at present zzso To identify the zzso in zzso which are responsible for this activity, we constructed several zzso zzso between the zzso and the related zzso family member zzso by replacing portions of zzso with corresponding zzso of zzso These zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cells and examined for their abilities to render this cell line zzso zzso Our results show that only zzso containing both the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso were capable of rendering the zzso cell line zzso zzso To understand the possible mechanisms underlying the zzso growth of zzso zzso cells, we examined the zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results show that none of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso by zzso or zzso We then examined the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso family of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and zzso exist in a zzso zzso state in zzso zzso cells, while such zzso zzso is not seen in zzso cell zzso Our results also show that zzso zzso with zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso occurs due to direct association with zzso However, zzso and zzso which also exist in a zzso zzso state in zzso zzso cells, do not zzso with zzso suggesting that these proteins either interact zzso with zzso or are zzso by a mechanism distinctive from that of zzso
