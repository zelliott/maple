zzso disease zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by an absence of zzso cells in the nerve zzso of the lower zzso zzso zzso has a complex pattern of inheritance and is sometimes associated with zzso in genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso which are crucial for development of the enteric nervous zzso 

Using zzso amplification and direct sequencing, we screened for zzso and zzso in the coding regions and zzso boundaries of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of 84 zzso patients and 96 ethnically matched zzso 

We identified 10 novel and 2 previously described zzso in zzso and 4 and 2 novel zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso were detected in zzso of the zzso The overall zzso rate was zzso in females and zzso in males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso was the most prevalent zzso representing zzso of the patients or 37% of the patients with zzso zzso To date, such a high frequency of a single zzso has never been reported in unrelated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were found in four, two, and none of the patients, zzso Two patients with zzso in genes of the zzso zzso also zzso a zzso in zzso Three novel and three reported zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso 

This study identifies additional zzso zzso zzso some peculiar to the Chinese population, and represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of sporadic zzso disease in zzso
