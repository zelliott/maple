We have used the family of human zzso receptors zzso as a model for receptors coupled to G proteins and have shown that genes for certain zzso zzso can behave as potent zzso zzso Furthermore, transforming zzso can zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that in cells expressing zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid and zzso increase in zzso zzso of cellular proteins which are different from those induced by zzso Interestingly, zzso but not zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, growth promoting pathways activated by receptors coupled to G proteins might involve zzso zzso of a small set of cellular proteins previously identified as zzso for zzso zzso zzso
