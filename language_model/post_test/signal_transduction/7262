The purpose of this study was to detect the serum zzso zzso that are zzso expressed in cervical zzso cell zzso zzso patients and negative controls, with a focus on the zzso profiles of the patients before and after zzso The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of these zzso as novel markers for the zzso monitoring of cervical SCC zzso 

A total of zzso serum zzso from 10 cervical SCC patients before surgery, 10 cervical SCC patients after surgery, and 10 negative controls were zzso using a zzso zzso zzso A set of selected zzso expressed zzso were further analyzed in the patients at different zzso zzso including zzso 1 week zzso and one month zzso The results showed that several serum zzso were zzso expressed in the cervical SCC patients compared with the negative controls, including zzso zzso and zzso More importantly, we found that levels of specific serum zzso were zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and these zzso could be useful for zzso monitoring of disease zzso Finally, we depicted a regulatory network of zzso expressed serum zzso and many possible target genes were predicted in the zzso signal zzso supporting the hypothesis that cervical SCC is a zzso zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated that the circulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso could potentially serve as zzso zzso for cervical zzso The levels of these specific zzso might be useful for the zzso monitoring of disease zzso This is the first report showing that circulating zzso could serve as zzso for the therapeutic intervention of cervical zzso
