The ability of zzso to class I zzso zzso zzso or zzso to stimulate human T cell clones alone or in combination was zzso zzso each of these surface zzso with appropriate zzso and goat zzso zzso zzso resulted in a unique pattern of increase in zzso free calcium zzso and different degrees of functional zzso zzso class I zzso molecules provided the most effective stimulus of zzso production and zzso zzso more than one surface zzso induced a compound calcium signal with characteristics of each individual zzso zzso zzso + zzso caused a rapid and prolonged increase in zzso and zzso increased zzso production and proliferation of all zzso zzso zzso + zzso also generated a compound calcium signal and increased zzso production and DNA zzso zzso inclusion of zzso was not required for zzso as zzso zzso + zzso also increased zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso three surface zzso zzso + zzso + zzso resulted in the greatest initial and sustained zzso zzso production, and DNA zzso Although there was a tendency for the various stimuli to increase both zzso and functional zzso neither the magnitude nor duration of the increased zzso correlated with the amount of zzso produced or the ultimate zzso zzso To determine whether zzso required that the various surface molecules were zzso together, experiments were carried out using zzso specific secondary zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of functional responses were noted when class I zzso molecules were zzso and zzso was bound, but not zzso Similarly, zzso through zzso and zzso was observed when zzso was zzso and the zzso complex was engaged by an zzso zzso which was not further zzso In contrast, zzso by class I zzso molecules and zzso was only observed when these molecules were zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso class I zzso zzso or zzso provides a direct signal to T cell clones that can be enhanced when zzso is independently zzso The results also indicate that T cell clones can be zzso without engaging zzso by the combination of signals delivered via class I zzso molecules and zzso but only when these zzso were zzso zzso These studies have demonstrated that these cell surface molecules differ in their capacity to deliver zzso signals to T cell clones and also exhibit unique patterns of positive zzso in signaling zzso
