zzso produced by human zzso cells exerts zzso activity via an zzso mechanism zzso via zzso zzso We zzso that such activity exerted by zzso on normal zzso cells might translate into an zzso action on zzso zzso provided that zzso cells maintain the expression of zzso zzso In this light, here we investigated the possible zzso effects of zzso in an zzso cell line derived from human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cell growth, the zzso effect zzso zzso being achieved after 3 d of treatment with zzso M zzso A decrease in zzso activity, which paralleled tumor growth zzso was also observed in zzso zzso The zzso effect was confirmed by zzso zzso for long-term zzso This effect was zzso in a zzso manner by both zzso zzso and zzso the former also showed intrinsic zzso zzso These findings suggested the involvement of zzso zzso zzso this hypothesis was confirmed by zzso protection analysis showing the expression of human zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso as well as the measurement of zzso zzso suggested the downstream involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso
