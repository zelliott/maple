The increased sensitivity of peripheral zzso zzso or zzso is a major cause of the sensation of pain that follows zzso This plasticity is thought to contribute to the maintenance of chronic pain zzso Although we have a broad knowledge of the factors that stimulate changes in zzso sensitivity, the cellular mechanisms that zzso this plasticity are still poorly understood; however, they are likely to involve changes in gene expression required for the zzso and functional changes seen in zzso zzso after zzso While the regulation of gene expression at the zzso level has been studied zzso the regulation of protein zzso which is also a tightly controlled process, has only recently received more zzso Despite the established role of protein synthesis in the plasticity of zzso cell bodies and zzso little attention has been paid to the role of translation control in mature undamaged zzso In this regard, several recent studies have demonstrated that the control of protein synthesis within the zzso compartment is crucial for the normal function and regulation of sensitivity of zzso Pathways and proteins regulating this process, such as the zzso target of zzso signaling cascade and the fragile X mental zzso zzso have recently been zzso We review here recent evidence for the regulation of protein synthesis within a zzso zzso compartment and its contribution to this zzso zzso We believe that an increased understanding of this process will lead to the identification of novel targets for the treatment of chronic zzso
