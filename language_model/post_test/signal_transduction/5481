The molecular mechanisms governing the biology and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in health and disease are not completely zzso Earlier zzso expression study of zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown differential expression of the zzso zzso integration site family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among healthy individuals and patients with zzso zzso and Barrett zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso 

Seven zzso human donor zzso were zzso for zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate zzso and superficial zzso cells were also dissected by zzso zzso for real-time zzso chain zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were expressed primarily in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso protein 6, zzso zzso protein 1, zzso zzso factor 3, and zzso 3 were expressed highest in LP decreasing zzso zzso toward zzso zzso predominantly expressed in SC was more than zzso greater than other layers zzso zzso was expressed primarily in SC but zzso was opposite with greatest expression in zzso zzso analysis showed zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso predominantly in zzso zzso in SC and zzso and zzso and zzso in LP and BC
