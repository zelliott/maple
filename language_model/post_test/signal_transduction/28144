zzso zzso is a tolerance mechanism defined as a zzso status of zzso T cells upon prior zzso encounter and is believed to play a critical role in the evasion of tumor immunity and the zzso of zzso transplant zzso zzso mechanisms in controlling zzso zzso are less zzso We show here that administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso prevents the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by soluble zzso More importantly, zzso zzso restores the functions of established zzso zzso upon zzso their zzso zzso As a result, infusion of zzso zzso zzso progressive tumor growth that is caused by soluble tumor zzso tolerance in a zzso zzso zzso zzso also restores proliferation and zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso T cells in a bone zzso transplantation zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso delivers a regulatory signal for zzso zzso and zzso manipulation of the zzso zzso as a new approach to break zzso zzso
