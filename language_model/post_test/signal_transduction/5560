All cells respond to signals from the zzso zzso stimuli activate zzso signal zzso pathways that make decisions about cell identity, behavior, and zzso A nascent field aims to design and construct new signaling pathways beyond those found in zzso Current strategies exploit the structural zzso of many signaling zzso which makes them inherently amenable to zzso tactics that exchange their input and output zzso The results reveal a remarkable degree of functional plasticity in signaling proteins and zzso as well as regulatory logic that can be transported to new zzso zzso zzso and scaffold proteins can zzso signal traffic and adjust the response behavior of the zzso zzso These synthetic biology approaches promise to deepen our understanding of existing signaling pathways and spur the development of new cellular tools for research, industry, and zzso
