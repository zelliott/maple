In glaucoma, the zzso nerve head zzso is the principal site of initial zzso injury, and elevated zzso pressure zzso is the zzso risk zzso However, the initial responses of the zzso to elevated zzso are zzso Here the authors use a rat glaucoma model to characterize zzso gene expression changes associated with early zzso nerve zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was produced in rats by zzso vein injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso nerve zzso were graded for zzso zzso Gene expression was determined by zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso altered gene expression was determined by zzso analysis and zzso DAVID gene zzso determined the functional categories of significantly affected zzso 

The Early zzso group consisted of zzso from eyes with zzso zzso zzso By array analysis, 877 genes were significantly regulated in this zzso The most significant zzso gene categories were cell cycle, zzso and immune system process, whereas the zzso categories included zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso of cell zzso genes and leukemia zzso factor zzso and revealed zzso in expression of other zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso including increased expression of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso message levels were zzso and other zzso markers were significantly zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene responses were zzso 

Cell proliferation and zzso zzso gene zzso rather than zzso zzso characterize early zzso zzso zzso
