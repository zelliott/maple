Current therapeutic approaches for advanced breast cancer frequently target receptors zzso cell survival and zzso such as the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso Although these approaches are effective for many patients, treatment resistance is zzso zzso new treatment approaches are needed for patients with advanced breast zzso zzso target of zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso that acts as a major signaling hub that zzso and zzso with cellular zzso survival, and/or zzso signals zzso by zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso signaling occurs in various tumor types, including breast cancer, and has been associated with cancer zzso disease zzso and treatment zzso Recent clinical trials show that combined zzso of zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso represents an effective strategy for treating hormone zzso advanced breast cancer progressing on zzso zzso inhibitor therapy, and data from ongoing trials combining zzso target of zzso zzso with human zzso growth factor zzso therapy are zzso This review focuses on the molecular rationale underlying strategies to enhance sensitivity to treatment in hormone zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso advanced breast cancer, the clinical efficacy of such approaches, and future zzso
