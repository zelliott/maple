zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from the zzso zzso in pea zzso zzso causes a reduction in zzso zzso that do form are zzso having poorly developed zzso and a lack of enlarged zzso Studies using additional zzso double zzso indicate that this results from severe zzso zzso of the roots rather than simply dwarf shoot zzso zzso Double zzso isolated from crosses between zzso and three zzso pea zzso exhibit a zzso zzso but the zzso structures are zzso This suggests that severely reduced zzso zzso are not entirely zzso to zzso zzso but that higher zzso zzso are required for proper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evolve more than double the amount of zzso produced by zzso plants, indicating that low zzso zzso can promote zzso zzso The excess zzso may contribute to the reduced zzso of zzso plants, as application of an zzso zzso inhibitor increased zzso zzso zzso However, these zzso were still zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also form significantly fewer zzso than zzso zzso This suggests that there is an optimum degree of zzso zzso required for zzso formation and that the zzso zzso and not the concentration of zzso zzso per se, is important for zzso
