Dynamic regulation of the intrinsic zzso zzso controls central and peripheral zzso zzso and may interfere with the zzso potency of zzso zzso 2 zzso such as zzso By following a zzso zzso zzso transgenic population of zzso T cells, we found that sensitivity to zzso radically changed during the course of zzso immune zzso zzso activated T cells were fully resistant to zzso during the first days after zzso zzso This phenomenon was caused by a zzso factor of activated T zzso zzso of zzso and was therefore prevented by zzso A zzso As a result, exposure to zzso after zzso recognition induced selection of zzso T cells in zzso whereas in combination with zzso zzso zzso efficiently depleted zzso T cells in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso resistance is not a prerogative of zzso cells, but it zzso occurs in T cells after zzso zzso zzso of this process by zzso zzso opens new pharmacological opportunities to zzso this process in the context of cancer, zzso and zzso
