Stem cell transplantation is a potential therapy for zzso medicine, which aims to restore zzso damaged by zzso aging, and zzso Since its conception in the late 1990s, chemical biology has provided powerful and diverse small zzso tools for modulating stem cell zzso zzso stem cells could be an ideal source for zzso but ethical concerns restrict their development for cell zzso The seminal advance of induced zzso stem cell zzso technology provided an attractive alternative to human embryonic stem zzso However, zzso are not yet considered an ideal stem cell source, due to limitations associated with the zzso process and their potential zzso zzso This is an area of research where chemical biology has made a significant contribution to facilitate the efficient production of high quality zzso and zzso the biological mechanisms governing their zzso In this review, we zzso these advances and discuss the latest progress in developing small zzso zzso Moreover, we also review a new trend in stem cell research, which is the direct zzso of readily accessible cell types into clinically useful cells, such as zzso and cardiac zzso This is a research area where chemical biology is making a pivotal contribution and illustrates the many advantages of using small molecules in stem cell zzso
