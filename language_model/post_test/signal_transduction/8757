Natural killer zzso cells provide innate control of infected and zzso zzso Multiple receptors have been implicated in natural zzso but their individual contribution remains zzso Here, we studied the zzso of primary, resting human zzso cells by zzso cells expressing zzso for receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each zzso was capable of inducing zzso signals for zzso promoting zzso but none induced zzso Rather, release of zzso zzso required synergistic zzso through zzso of zzso shown here for zzso and zzso Although engagement of zzso and zzso was not sufficient for strong target cell zzso collective engagement of zzso zzso and zzso defined a minimal requirement for natural zzso zzso zzso signaling induced by each one of these zzso including zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso binding to zzso Strong zzso signals induced by the combination of zzso and zzso or by zzso could overcome zzso zzso In contrast, zzso induced by these receptors was still subject to zzso by zzso These results reveal multiple layers in the zzso zzso for natural zzso and that steps as distinct as zzso signaling to zzso and signals for zzso release are sensitive to zzso by zzso
