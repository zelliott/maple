The zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of developing zzso rods were zzso The gain of the zzso steps in zzso zzso increased and zzso became more rapid as the rods matured from the zzso to the adult zzso The time to peak was significantly shorter in adults zzso zzso than zzso (2 zzso Moreover, adult rods recovered twice as fast from zzso flashes than did zzso rods without changes of the dominant time constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, determined using zzso steps, increased in adult rods from approximately zzso zzso to zzso zzso 5 s after a zzso flash delivering 6,000 zzso In zzso zzso it increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso 9 s after an equivalent zzso However, the ratio of amplification to the measured dark zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso protein zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were increased in adults compared with zzso Together, these results are consistent with the acceleration of the recovery phase in adult rods via zzso regulation of calcium zzso Despite these large changes, the single zzso response zzso was approximately zzso zzso throughout zzso Reduction of calcium feedback with zzso increased adult single zzso response zzso zzso and reduced its zzso frequency to that observed with zzso zzso Linear mathematical modeling suggests that zzso feedback can account for the observed differences in the power zzso of zzso and adult zzso We conclude that zzso zzso maximize sensitivity at the expense of slower response zzso while adults maximize response zzso at the expense of zzso
