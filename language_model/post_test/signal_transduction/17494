The interaction of the zzso zzso complex with the zzso is associated with early molecular events involved in the process of signal zzso implicating zzso zzso In elderly people, abnormalities in membrane signal zzso pathways are the basis of the immune zzso associated with zzso zzso blood zzso from aging humans and young subjects were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were analyzed in order to determine the fatty acid composition in resting and zzso zzso In aging humans, in resting conditions, the all three zzso zzso appeared more saturated than the corresponding zzso in young zzso Following zzso stimulation a decrease in zzso acid relative zzso content was detected in both young and old subjects, but the zzso acid content in resting conditions greatly differed between the two groups, suggesting a different zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso complex in elderly people, so determining zzso in the early zzso steps of zzso
