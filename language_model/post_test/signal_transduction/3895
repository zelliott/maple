In zzso each zzso zzso is subdivided into two cell zzso the anterior zzso and zzso zzso compartments by the selective activity of the zzso factor zzso zzso in P zzso Under zzso control, P cells zzso but cannot respond to, the zzso protein zzso zzso In contrast, and by default, A cells are programmed to respond to zzso by expressing other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso which organize growth and patterning in both zzso zzso of the A and P compartments do not zzso apparently as a consequence of their having distinct cell affinities that cause them to maximize contact with cells of the same zzso while minimizing contact with cells from the other zzso This failure to mix has previously been ascribed to an autonomous and direct role for zzso in specifying a zzso as opposed to an A, cell zzso However, an alternative hypothesis is that zzso zzso by P cells zzso A cells to acquire a distinct cell zzso ensuring that a stable zzso zzso forms wherever P and A cells zzso Here we show that the affinity boundary that zzso A and P cells into adjacent but zzso cell populations is to a large extent a consequence of local zzso zzso rather than a reflection of an intrinsic affinity difference between A and P zzso
