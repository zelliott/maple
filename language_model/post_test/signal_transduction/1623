The integrity of the zzso is dependent on zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso Proper zzso zzso zzso is, in turn, dependent on the connection between zzso and the cortical zzso zzso zzso small zzso are key molecular switches that control zzso dynamics and zzso function in zzso as well as zzso zzso We show here that a zzso zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso a rapid loss of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells from primary human zzso veins zzso This effect is accompanied by the formation of zzso stress fibers and is dependent on zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso which zzso pronounced stress fiber and focal zzso formation, did not result in a zzso of zzso or an overall loss of zzso zzso In line with this zzso zzso zzso was more efficiently increased by zzso than by zzso The loss of zzso zzso which is induced by zzso occurred in parallel to and was dependent upon the zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso Moreover, zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso of a component the zzso complex, which was identified as zzso The functional relevance of this signaling zzso was further underscored by the observation that zzso cell migration, which requires a transient reduction of zzso zzso was blocked when signaling through zzso was zzso In conclusion, zzso production of zzso represents a previously zzso means of regulating zzso function and may play an important role in the zzso associated with inflammation and zzso damage as well as with zzso cell migration and zzso
