The zzso zzso is a highly successful model system with great promise for zzso zzso Since the late 1800s, zzso have been employed to understand zzso development and since the 1950s, the African clawed zzso zzso zzso has been the zzso of zzso In the past two decades, zzso has led the way forward in, among other things, identifying zzso factors, gene regulatory networks and zzso and zzso signaling pathways that control early development (from zzso through zzso and zzso Perhaps the best measure of how successful zzso has been as a model for early zzso development is the observation that much of the knowledge gleaned from zzso studies has subsequently directly translated to discoveries of similar mechanisms operating in mouse zzso Despite this great success in early development, research on zzso in zzso has lagged behind the zzso However, recent technical advances now make zzso amenable for studies on later development, including zzso Here, we discuss why zzso is well suited for such research and, we believe, permits addressing questions that have been difficult to approach using other model zzso We also highlight how zzso researchers have already begun studying a number of major zzso zzso liver, kidney and heart, and suggest how zzso might contribute more to these areas in the near zzso
