Selective zzso of rod zzso cells in the retinal degenerative zzso mouse prior to their complete maturation is thought to result from elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso to the inherited zzso in zzso To investigate potential signaling pathways which might lead to zzso death of zzso in the zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso family was zzso zzso numbers of zzso zzso zzso were observed in the outer nuclear layer of the zzso mouse beginning at zzso day zzso zzso The peak zzso of zzso cells was observed at zzso by zzso almost the entire population of zzso had been zzso Although zzso zzso was absent in zzso of normal zzso we observed that zzso at around zzso increasing numbers of rod zzso in the zzso zzso exhibited nuclear zzso for zzso zzso While no change in the distribution patterns of other members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso zzso for zzso on zzso The zzso of zzso zzso peaked sharply at zzso 1 day earlier than the peak in zzso Furthermore, the population of zzso zzso was distinct from zzso zzso exhibiting zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso protein in rod zzso immediately prior to their death in the zzso mouse raises the possibility that zzso may be directly or indirectly involved in triggering the zzso zzso Furthermore, the additional finding of zzso induction in zzso zzso suggests that the zzso response to zzso zzso involves both zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
