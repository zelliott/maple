Despite significant advances in treatment, breast cancer is still the second leading cause of zzso deaths in women in the United zzso zzso significant efforts are being given to develop novel strategies for the prevention of breast cancer in recent zzso Our laboratory and others have been studying the effects of a potential zzso agent, zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer cells and found that the induction of zzso processes was partly zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, the precise molecular zzso by which zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer cells has not been fully zzso For the present study, we focused our investigation on important cell signaling molecules such as zzso and zzso during zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso processes in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso parental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso activity and abrogates the zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso gene zzso directly activates zzso and this zzso was completely zzso by zzso zzso In addition, zzso also zzso the zzso zzso of zzso which was zzso via the zzso signaling zzso From these results, we conclude that there is a direct zzso between zzso and zzso pathways and that the zzso of zzso and zzso activity plays important roles in zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso These results also suggest that zzso may be a potential zzso agent by virtue of its selective zzso ability in zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso
