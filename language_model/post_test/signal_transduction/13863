The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a common and complex disease without a clear pattern of zzso zzso hormone zzso has an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are higher in women with zzso than in zzso zzso The elevated zzso levels may reflect abnormalities in zzso zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of the zzso hormone zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in a large cohort of women with zzso and in a healthy control zzso 

A total of zzso Caucasian Greek women with zzso and 309 healthy control women were zzso 

zzso and hormonal zzso were zzso 

zzso levels in women with zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso was more common in women with zzso than in control women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were associated with decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso to zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso in women with zzso as well as with lower zzso levels zzso zzso zzso No other associations related to zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in women with zzso or control zzso 

In this study, the role of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in the zzso of zzso was suggested by the association of the zzso with zzso zzso Thus, further research is needed to zzso a possible association of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso with zzso signaling and impaired zzso function and its clinical significance in women with zzso
