zzso is an important signaling partner for the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso is also associated with poor prognosis in breast zzso To investigate how zzso amplification affects its interactions with the zzso we used a human zzso zzso cell system in which zzso expression was increased zzso by gene zzso We found that amplification of zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso following zzso by zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso was also inhibited by zzso amplification, resulting in enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso The rate of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso but the rate of zzso targeting was significantly zzso In addition, zzso zzso promoted rapid recycling of activated zzso back to the cell surface and decreased zzso zzso from the zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso zzso both its zzso and that of the zzso The net effect is increased signaling through the zzso zzso
