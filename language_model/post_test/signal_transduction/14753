zzso and experimental research on the potential zzso effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields zzso has been performed for a long zzso zzso studies regarding zzso have focused primarily on zzso development due to residential sources in children and adults, and from occupational exposure in adults, but also on other kinds of zzso zzso investigations of zzso have shown contradictory results, a biological mechanism is still lacking that can explain the link between cancer development and zzso Recent laboratory research has attempted to show general biological effects, and such that could be related to cancer development and/or zzso zzso processes which generate zzso and antioxidants can be influenced by environmental factors, such as zzso Increased zzso exposure can modify the activity of the zzso by zzso oxygen species leading to zzso zzso It is well established that free zzso can interact with DNA resulting in single strand zzso DNA damage could become a site of zzso a key step to zzso Furthermore, different cell types react differently to the same zzso because of their cell type specific zzso zzso The zzso of cellular zzso balance by the enhancement of zzso zzso or the zzso or reduction of zzso is discussed in this zzso An additional aspect of free zzso is their function to influence other illnesses such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's zzso On the other hand, zzso of antioxidants by zzso can lower the zzso zzso activity promoting the development of DNA zzso It has also been demonstrated that low levels of zzso oxygen species trigger zzso signals that involve the zzso of genes and leading to responses including cell proliferation and zzso In this review, a general overview is given about zzso stress, as well as experimental studies are reviewed as they are related to changes in zzso and zzso content after zzso exposure inducing different biological zzso Finally, we conclude from our review that zzso on the zzso and zzso level through zzso exposure can play a zzso role in cancer zzso
