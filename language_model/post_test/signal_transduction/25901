During plant development, cell fates are often determined by zzso zzso The vascular system, in which zzso cells continue to provide cells to two zzso zzso zzso and zzso is an excellent model for understanding zzso communication as a zzso zzso Recent studies on vascular development have revealed several novel zzso signaling molecules that regulate vascular cell fates by unique zzso This review focuses on emerging novel concepts such that zzso signaling by a zzso factor and zzso between the stele and the zzso determines zzso cell patterns, and that a small zzso zzso from zzso zzso vascular stem-cell zzso
