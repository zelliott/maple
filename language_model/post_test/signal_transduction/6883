The ability to generate and maintain stable in zzso cultures of mouse zzso cells zzso has great potential for genetic dissection of the numerous zzso involving vascular dysfunction as well as therapeutic zzso However, previous efforts at achieving sustained cultures of primary stable zzso vascular cells have fallen short, and the cellular requirements for zzso maintenance in zzso remain zzso In this study, we have generated vascular zzso from mouse embryonic stem zzso cells and show that active zzso is essential to their survival and propagation as homogeneous zzso in zzso These cells harbor the zzso zzso and functional characteristics of zzso and expand throughout long-term cultures, while maintaining their zzso zzso Moreover, zzso embryonic zzso form functional zzso vessels in zzso that zzso with host blood zzso We provide evidence for a novel function of zzso in stabilizing zzso identity, zzso the activated form of the protein protects mouse zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso These findings identify a role for zzso in regulating the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that active zzso maintains zzso identity in embryonic zzso by interfering with active zzso processes that would zzso usher these cells to alternate zzso
