As changes in zzso free zzso play key roles in zzso responses in zzso it is important to locate and identify zzso storage sites within these zzso Here, recent data is presented which highlights the functional link between zzso structure and cell zzso zzso Fluorescent optical zzso for zzso free zzso have been used, together with zzso specific zzso We present evidence from conventional zzso zzso together with zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso which zzso two cellular locations for zzso within the zzso one within the nuclear zzso and the other towards the cell zzso zzso of these two locations provides a clear insight into how zzso in this cell type is regulated and provides a framework for explaining how specific stimuli act to produce specific zzso
