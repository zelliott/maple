The zzso zzso major zzso targets of the insulin zzso bind to zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we have examined the interaction between these proteins in animal and cultured cell models of insulin zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso from insulin target zzso in zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso proteins in rat zzso muscle was enhanced when insulin resistance was induced in rats by treatment with zzso for 5 zzso Moreover, injection of zzso II into the inferior zzso zzso enhanced the binding in rat cardiac zzso Similarly, increased binding between zzso and zzso was observed in isolated cells incubated with tumor necrosis zzso zzso of zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells reduced the zzso zzso of zzso induced by insulin, with a zzso decrease in zzso association of zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity associated with zzso was also reduced in cells zzso zzso while this activity was increased in cells incubated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate an enhanced interaction between zzso and zzso proteins in models of insulin resistance and suggest a possible mechanism by which increased zzso zzso zzso may contribute to impaired insulin zzso
