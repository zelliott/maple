zzso of zzso zzso zzso including enhanced zzso is a hallmark of inflammatory zzso disease zzso We have recently shown that tumor necrosis factor zzso increases the zzso activity of zzso a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family that is elevated in zzso of zzso patients and that promotes colon zzso cell zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso through zzso converting zzso zzso zzso release and that this zzso is necessary to protect zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso growth factor zzso is required for zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso or genetic zzso of the zzso zzso which mediates zzso release from cells, blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso was also required for zzso zzso activity and zzso binding were required for zzso zzso zzso whereas mouse colon zzso cells expressing zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso or blockade of zzso zzso binding reversed the survival zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso release, thus protecting colon zzso cells from zzso zzso These findings have important implications for understanding how zzso protects the colon from zzso tissue injury in inflammatory conditions such as zzso
