The innate plasticity of zzso zzso is tightly regulated to supply blood cells during normal zzso and in response to stress or zzso We demonstrate that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso zzso and zzso control blood zzso proliferation through a common zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso increases zzso signaling and causes LG overgrowth by increasing the number of actively dividing cells that accumulate high levels of zzso zzso zzso during a critical window of zzso These zzso are associated with increased zzso oxygen species zzso levels in the zzso and scavenging zzso in zzso is sufficient to rescue zzso Blood zzso number is also sensitive to zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso function become apparent at later zzso Loss of zzso autonomously increases zzso and decreases zzso levels, expands the number of intermediate zzso and limits terminal zzso except for a late induction of zzso By contrast, absence of zzso increases zzso and zzso levels and zzso zzso expansion of zzso and crystal zzso This increased zzso is associated with zzso increases in zzso levels within peripheral zzso zzso culminating in their premature release into circulation and demonstrating potential zzso effects of zzso dysfunction on zzso This study highlights zzso differences between zzso and zzso on zzso function and demonstrates the multifaceted roles of a zzso zzso in orchestrating proliferation and differentiation of zzso blood zzso through regulation of zzso levels and the resulting zzso disorder when zzso
