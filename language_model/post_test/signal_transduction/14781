We have developed a bacterial zzso system for the detection of interacting proteins that zzso on the folding quality control mechanism of the Twin zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso export zzso is responsible for the membrane zzso of folded zzso including proteins consisting of more than one zzso only one of which contains a signal zzso zzso zzso Here, one protein zzso is expressed as a fusion to a zzso signal zzso whereas the second protein zzso is fused to a protein reporter that can zzso a zzso only after export into the bacterial zzso zzso Since the zzso fusion lacks a signal zzso it can only be exported as a complex with the zzso zzso fusion that is capable of targeting the zzso zzso Using zzso protein as a reporter, clones expressing interacting proteins can be grown on zzso minimal media or on zzso zzso In addition, we introduce the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Export of a signal zzso complex into the zzso allows zzso of zzso zzso and restores the formation of active alkaline zzso which in turn can be detected by a zzso zzso
