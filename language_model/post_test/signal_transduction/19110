Loss of transforming growth factor zzso signaling has been implicated in zzso transformation of various zzso zzso plays a central role in the signal zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso has been described in a number of zzso This study was aimed to investigate a potential role of zzso in leukemia including its expression and location in blast zzso The zzso cells were separated from bone zzso of leukemia zzso The samples, blast cells of which were more than zzso in zzso cells, were zzso The expression and location of zzso protein were analyzed by zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso protein located mainly in nucleus, part of this protein located in zzso the expressions of zzso were not detected in 6 out of 9 ALL patients, in 7 out of 24 zzso patients and in 1 out of 2 zzso zzso these leukemia patients, in whose cells the expression of zzso was not zzso included one zzso and one zzso four zzso one zzso one zzso two zzso one zzso one zzso one zzso and one zzso In conclusion, the zzso protein was mainly in nucleus, the deletion or functional change of zzso may related with the zzso of human zzso
