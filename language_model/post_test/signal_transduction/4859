The zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso and cancer, and is regulated by different zzso pathways zzso through soluble factors, zzso reorganization and zzso factor zzso Because the zzso (also called zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso family member 5) is highly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso understanding how zzso expression in zzso is regulated is zzso We explored the mechanisms that induce zzso expression and whether impaired zzso pathways for zzso expression inhibit the acquisition of zzso cell features, using human and mouse normal zzso We found that zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso caused zzso expression and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity following zzso treatment abolished acquisition of zzso suggesting a link from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were abolished by zzso suppression or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in the absence of serum, and zzso zzso zzso or zzso depletion abolished zzso zzso and zzso cell marker zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso using zzso or small compounds also blocked zzso expression and/or zzso These results indicate that zzso and growth zzso zzso activities mediate zzso expression leading to acquisition of zzso cell features, suggesting that zzso induction may be involved in the development of liver zzso
