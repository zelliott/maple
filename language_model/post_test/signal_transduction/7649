zzso tissue growth factor zzso and bone zzso protein zzso are both produced and zzso by zzso Both proteins have been shown to have independent effects in regulating zzso zzso maturation and zzso However, how these two proteins interact during zzso differentiation remains zzso In this study, we zzso two cell culture model systems, zzso derived from zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso infected with an zzso which zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso development and function in zzso zzso to a previously published report, zzso maturation and zzso were similar in zzso cultures derived from zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso and zzso zzso cultures zzso with zzso the zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso zzso This increase in zzso differentiation was accompanied by increased protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels of bone zzso protein zzso zzso We also examined zzso differentiation in cultures that were infected with an zzso zzso zzso and in zzso Continuous zzso of zzso resulted in decreased zzso maturation and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation in cultures zzso zzso was accompanied by decreased protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the data from these studies demonstrate that zzso acts to zzso regulate zzso induced signaling and zzso zzso and warrant additional studies to determine the precise zzso responsible for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2013 zzso zzso zzso
