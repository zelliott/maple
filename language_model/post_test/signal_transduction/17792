The rapid generation of zzso by zzso plant cells was investigated in cultured tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The starting point for the generation of zzso has been located at the cell plasma membrane using zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso and zzso both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prevented the generation of zzso induced by zzso These data suggest the involvement of an zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso production through zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso To investigate the implication of zzso channels in a zzso zzso burst, different zzso of zzso channels were zzso Only zzso totally inhibited the generation of zzso induced by zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso channels, were not zzso zzso or a zzso protein zzso is also implicated in the signal zzso zzso based on the results obtained with two types of zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso However, zzso an inhibitor of the zzso cycle, did not inhibit the generation of zzso induced by zzso suggesting mainly an induction of the zzso burst zzso by zzso and/or zzso zzso
