We tested the hypothesis that zzso is an enteric neurotransmitter that acts at zzso zzso zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso to evoke zzso zzso zzso in the guinea zzso zzso chamber methods for studying zzso zzso zzso were used to test the zzso Application of zzso evoked zzso increases in short circuit current zzso indicative of stimulation of zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso responses in a zzso manner with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso or a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed or abolished the zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso responses evoked by electrical field stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso were not suppressed by zzso zzso nor selective zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in responses to zzso corresponded to regional differences in the expression of zzso transcripts for the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso for the zzso responses involved stimulation of zzso C and an zzso zzso C signaling zzso Our evidence suggests that zzso is released as a neurotransmitter to stimulate zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso receptors expressed by zzso zzso zzso
