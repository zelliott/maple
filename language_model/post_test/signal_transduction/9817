Using knockout and transgenic technology, genetically modified animal models allowed us to understand the role of zzso zzso in zzso Mice with a global deletion of the zzso zzso gene zzso were designed using gene zzso The zzso of zzso mouse provided important clues about the role of zzso in zzso growth, pancreatic development and zzso and zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso was associated with: zzso zzso zzso poor zzso growth and increased zzso zzso zzso altered zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso altered zzso zzso and hormonal zzso zzso reduced gastric zzso zzso altered body composition and protection from zzso zzso zzso altered energy state; zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso altered zzso response to prolonged zzso and exercise and zzso prevented development of diabetes in zzso zzso In contrast, mice zzso the zzso on pancreatic zzso displayed an increase insulin zzso pancreatic insulin content and zzso mass, and partially protected against zzso and impaired zzso tolerance when fed a high-fat zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso plays a significant role in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Treatment options designed to block zzso zzso may have negative implications in the treatment of zzso
