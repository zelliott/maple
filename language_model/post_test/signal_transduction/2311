zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in zzso metabolism and it is thought also to play a role in the zzso of zzso such as zzso The aim of our study was to investigate if changes in gamma zzso activity would alter total zzso zzso zzso as well as more specific zzso via the gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso Forty-eight hours after their isolation, rat type II cells were exposed to 30, 60 or 125 zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso 200 or 800 zzso zzso zzso for 40 zzso 10, 100 or 1000 zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso and 60 or zzso zzso for 48 zzso The gamma zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso gamma zzso were measured immediately after the exposure to zzso or 24 zzso after treatment with zzso zzso or zzso From previous studies, it is known that these experimental conditions increased zzso 200 zzso zzso or decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso There was a strong correlation between the changes in gamma zzso activity and the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These findings support the hypothesis that gamma zzso partly regulates the zzso of zzso one of the zzso required for cell growth and zzso
