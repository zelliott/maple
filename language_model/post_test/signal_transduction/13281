During the human zzso cycle the circulating levels of zzso B, a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a fashion distinct from that of zzso A, the zzso zzso This suggests that human zzso zzso are each regulated in a distinct manner in human zzso zzso cells by zzso and local zzso We have previously shown using cultures of human zzso zzso cells that zzso stimulate the steady state zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso but not those of the zzso which, on the other hand, are zzso by, for instance, zzso and zzso zzso We recently identified the zzso beta gene family member bone zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso growth factor, but whether zzso or other structurally related zzso regulate human zzso cell zzso production is not zzso We show here that zzso cells express zzso for distinct zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso and zzso signaling proteins zzso zzso and zzso involved in the mediation of cellular effects of zzso zzso we determined in zzso cell cultures the effects of distinct members of the zzso family previously found to be expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner the expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells without affecting the levels of zzso or zzso zzso zzso has a similar, but weaker, effect than zzso whereas zzso and its close zzso zzso (also known as growth differentiation zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells was previously shown to abolish the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso levels, and here zzso is also shown to suppress the effect of zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulates zzso cell zzso zzso zzso B levels in a zzso zzso Depending on the experiment, zzso increases in zzso B levels of 6- to zzso above zzso levels were detected during a zzso culture zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells stimulates zzso zzso zzso levels and leads at the protein level to a dramatic stimulation of zzso zzso B zzso Our results are consistent with the suggestion that in addition to the distinct zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso the zzso zzso is likely to be implicated in the complex regulation of zzso in the human zzso
