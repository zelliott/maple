In the developing zzso zzso and its zzso zzso regulate zzso differentiation and zzso formation, but their role in repair of zzso zzso in diseases such as multiple sclerosis remains zzso To address this question, we generated a mouse model in which we targeted zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso using zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso development, zzso differentiation was zzso in zzso zzso zzso in adults, zzso of zzso zzso was also accelerated, at the expense of proliferation within the zzso zzso zzso in zzso confirmed that zzso signaling was zzso for zzso expansion but inhibited differentiation and zzso zzso These studies also revealed that zzso exposed to zzso restricted zzso maturation via zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling is one of the mechanisms regulating zzso differentiation during zzso zzso Thus, zzso may represent a potential zzso avenue for zzso repair in zzso zzso
