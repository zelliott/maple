The human protein zzso zzso zzso exists as two zzso an zzso zzso zzso form zzso and a nuclear zzso form zzso Although targeted to the nucleus, zzso can exit in response to specific stimuli to zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of insulin zzso zzso signaling by zzso In response to insulin zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed stable complexes with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, in response to insulin zzso the zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso of cells zzso the zzso and in part zzso with the zzso zzso at the cell zzso These results indicate that the zzso may serve as a cellular zzso for both zzso and zzso In immortalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso were enhanced relative to the values in zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso or zzso to zzso levels suppressed the enhanced zzso signaling in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso localized zzso of zzso may zzso the zzso and zzso zzso signaling in zzso
