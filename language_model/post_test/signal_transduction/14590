zzso zzso is a zzso protein concentrated at zzso spines of zzso zzso that is involved in synaptic plasticity through the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso features a central zzso motif that mediates binding to zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso distribution of zzso and found that it associates to cellular zzso in rat zzso In zzso binding zzso revealed that zzso selectively binds to PA zzso zzso and that this interaction is prevented by zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso and a zzso with an internal deletion zzso we have shown that zzso binding to PA and to cellular zzso is zzso by its zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells accumulates at peripheral regions of the plasma membrane and zzso at zzso zzso that can be clearly zzso following zzso zzso This distribution was affected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that zzso binding to PA may be involved in zzso zzso at zzso spines and that zzso could zzso PA zzso in the zzso zzso
