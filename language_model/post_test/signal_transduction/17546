In this study we investigated the release of zzso in brain zzso after zzso loading by the zzso or by the zzso zzso The results show that in zzso loaded with zzso by the zzso zzso (5 zzso released 21 zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso and that in the zzso loaded with zzso by the zzso zzso zzso released 28 zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso These results suggest that receptors of zzso may be zzso with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso membrane or that there are zzso receptors in the plasma membrane where the zzso zzso is normally present, or zzso We also found that zzso inhibited the zzso by zzso but that it had no significant effect on the zzso zzso
