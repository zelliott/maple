Treatment with peptides based on the zzso determining regions zzso of zzso and human zzso zzso zzso that bear the common zzso zzso Id, ameliorates disease manifestations of mice with either induced or spontaneous zzso zzso expression and function of the zzso zzso zzso are associated with active zzso zzso we examined the effect of treatment with a zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso manifestations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated increased expression of zzso and the zzso active form of its zzso element zzso zzso in conjunction with reduced zzso and unchanged zzso as compared to healthy zzso zzso of zzso manifestations following treatment with zzso was associated with a diminished expression of zzso zzso zzso mainly in the T cell population that also exhibited reduced rates of zzso Thus, zzso therapy ameliorates zzso at least in part, via zzso of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso
