zzso of Ras family play an important role in regulation of cell growth and zzso and their zzso can lead to growth zzso proliferation due to zzso activity of various signal zzso zzso In the present work, we studied the activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso cells transformed with zzso zzso and zzso These transformed cells are characterized by a high and zzso activity of zzso factor zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso Since zzso of zzso depends on the activity of relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we zzso the expression of zzso forms of the zzso and their zzso state in zzso + zzso cells using zzso specific to zzso and zzso zzso It has been established that transformed cells contain higher amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus zzso a reduced degradation of these and other proteins in the zzso The content of zzso zzso forms studied in Western zzso with zzso was shown to be also higher in zzso growing zzso + zzso zzso But serum stimulation of the starved cells gave insignificant rise to an increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, an in zzso zzso zzso performed with the zzso either zzso by zzso or bound to zzso zzso enabled us to show a certain level of stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in serum zzso zzso + zzso zzso Thus, the obtained results show that transformation of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responsible for a high and zzso activity of zzso zzso factors, in particular zzso
