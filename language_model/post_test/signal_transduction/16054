The zzso of small zzso specific zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso is expressed at high levels in adult human excitable zzso including the brain, heart, and skeletal zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso is specifically expressed in the adult mouse zzso and zzso and that zzso of this protein can result in zzso and zzso zzso This finding prompted us to explore the expression of zzso in other zzso which share common zzso ancestry to the nervous system, specifically the zzso zzso Using zzso analysis specific for zzso protein zzso we observed the highest zzso expression of zzso occurring in the zzso layer and zzso lens fibers of the late-stage mouse zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso lens zzso and throughout the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso rabbit lens zzso cells induced lens fiber differentiation as reflected by cell zzso and zzso formation, as well as a strong increase in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of lens zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso promoter activities that is in part dependent on the nuclear zzso of zzso Furthermore, pharmacological zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso lens fiber differentiation and zzso expression in ex zzso mouse lens zzso These results demonstrate for the first time a role for zzso in lens cell differentiation and mouse eye zzso Moreover, zzso regulation of lens differentiation and eye development occurs through a zzso zzso
