Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women zzso Various therapeutic approaches have been proposed, among which zzso therapy has recently become popular due to the high sensitivity of breast zzso to steroids such as zzso and zzso The underlying mechanisms of steroid regulation in breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance, however, remain largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has attracted much attention because it is an important zzso and plays a pivotal role in modulating the zzso activities of steroid nuclear zzso zzso research has established a strong correlation between zzso and the pathological progression or zzso features of breast cancer, which supports its potential as a target for specific therapeutic intervention in the clinical management of breast zzso In addition, a diverse group of downstream molecules have also been shown to participate in various functional pathways related to zzso regulation of breast zzso These downstream molecules are also considered promising therapeutic targets, providing additional options for targeted zzso In this review, the expression of zzso in breast cancer and the close relationships between zzso and the cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance of breast cancer will be discussed, followed by a brief summary of its putative functional mechanisms with an emphasis on the potential therapeutic role of zzso
