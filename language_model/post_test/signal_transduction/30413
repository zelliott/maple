How can a zzso adapt to a variety of environmental conditions despite the existence of a limited number of signal zzso zzso We show that for any growing cells whose gene expression zzso zzso the zzso cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even without a specific signal zzso network for zzso In general, changes in protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and degradation, both of which are zzso to the rate of cell zzso In an zzso state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and zzso Under the presence of noise in gene zzso the zzso state is less affected by zzso since both the synthesis and dilution terms are large, while for a zzso state both the terms are smaller so that cells are easily kicked out of the original state by zzso zzso escape time from a cellular state and the cellular growth rate are zzso zzso This leads to a selection of zzso states with higher growth rates, and model simulations confirm this selection to take place in zzso The results suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to zzso process that requires no specific mechanisms for sensory zzso The present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular zzso responses including the zzso flux zzso for zzso cell zzso
