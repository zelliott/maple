zzso show a remarkable capacity for perfect repair after zzso zzso of embryonic skin triggers rapid zzso of zzso sweeping and zzso contraction tissue movements that bear striking zzso to several naturally occurring zzso tissue movements, but very little is known about the early molecular signals that might initiate such zzso Here, we describe the rapid and transient zzso of two immediate early zzso zzso and zzso after wounding of the embryonic zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that these signals are zzso but of longer zzso in the zzso and adult wound zzso To further test the roles of these zzso factors in zzso we performed wound healing studies on zzso lacking either zzso or zzso Despite the dramatic zzso of these genes in response to injury, our studies reveal that neither of them on their own is essential for zzso
