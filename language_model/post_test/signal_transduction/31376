Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from tomato zzso zzso have been cloned and functionally expressed in zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in leaf tissue and zzso in zzso fruit and flower zzso zzso expression was induced in leaves by zzso zzso zzso zzso and mechanical wounding in wild type tomato but not in the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the salicylic acid zzso transgenic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression could be induced in leaves of wild type tomato plants by zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso was not induced in leaves by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso We show that zzso of the zzso volatile zzso zzso zzso zzso with expression of zzso An exception was zzso which resulted in induction of zzso but not in zzso of zzso We show that there is an additional layer of regulation, because zzso zzso catalyzing the first dedicated step in zzso zzso was induced by zzso but not by zzso
