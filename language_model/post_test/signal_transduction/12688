Although zzso zzso zzso zzso play a pivotal role in the development and maintaining the zzso of the body, zzso or zzso of zzso often zzso zzso or zzso To mimic the function of zzso we developed two fusion receptors consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso or zzso based on previously constructed zzso zzso zzso The expression of these zzso receptors in the zzso cell line zzso and zzso cell line zzso resulted in the zzso of receptors themselves, downstream signaling molecules and cell proliferation in response to zzso zzso leading to selective expansion of zzso cells up to almost zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso could activate the zzso receptors even though the zzso zzso zzso were switched to the zzso zzso This is the first study to show that our zzso genetically modified cell amplification zzso system could be applied to zzso cells by utilizing zzso zzso
