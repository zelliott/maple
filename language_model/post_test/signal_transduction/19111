Reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity in response to moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may be partly zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, the precise mechanisms by which ethanol zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso which plays a central role in zzso remain zzso The goal of this study was to investigate zzso changes in zzso function and clarify the underlying mechanisms including zzso and zzso activity and zzso dynamics in zzso 

zzso zzso increase in zzso calcium zzso and release of zzso factor 4 and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were assessed in the presence or absence of zzso 

Ethanol exposure inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not an increase in zzso In contrast, ethanol had no effect on high-dose zzso (10 zzso zzso or the zzso zzso Ethanol did not significantly inhibit zzso release of zzso factor 4 and zzso Ethanol reduced zzso zzso but did not affect the spike form of zzso zzso In contrast, ethanol inhibited the increase in zzso as well as the zzso in response to zzso and resulted in delayed zzso peak zzso Furthermore, ethanol inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso factor 4 and zzso zzso 

These data suggest that ethanol zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso signaling and subsequent zzso of zzso influx and zzso zzso This phenomenon may contribute to the reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity in response to consumption of alcoholic zzso
