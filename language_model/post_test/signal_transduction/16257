zzso precursor protein zzso a key protein in zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso is a type I zzso protein which can be zzso by zzso and zzso to release the zzso zzso peptides zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso While zzso has been widely believed to initiate zzso zzso culminating zzso the zzso functions and regulations of zzso remain zzso In present study, zzso zzso was demonstrated to be increased by zzso zzso zzso Instead of due to zzso activity, enhanced zzso expression was found due to the increased protein stability by zzso zzso was demonstrated to be an zzso partner of zzso capable of promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso Investigation by zzso zzso proved that zzso a previously identified zzso binding partner, is not involved in this zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso is stabilized and the zzso zzso zzso activity is promoted by zzso zzso signaling independent of zzso
