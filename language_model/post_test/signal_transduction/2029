Signal zzso through zzso growth factor receptors zzso is essential for the growth and development of zzso zzso A genetic screen for regulators of zzso signaling has led to the identification of zzso a cell autonomous inhibitor of zzso signaling that is zzso induced by the zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso exerts its zzso effect remain largely zzso Here we have used transient expression in human cells to investigate the functional properties of human zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed full-length zzso and zzso induce the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso containing the highly zzso zzso zzso domain inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of the full-length zzso proteins on zzso signaling is zzso by the zzso domain and results from the zzso of zzso which in turn leads to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso can function both as a negative and positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso signaling in a zzso zzso A dual function of this kind could provide a mechanism for achieving proper balance between the zzso and repression of zzso zzso
