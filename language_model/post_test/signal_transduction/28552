In acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, protective ventilation strategies reduce mortality and zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that some of the side effects of mechanical ventilation are caused by the excessive release of zzso capable of causing pulmonary inflammation and tissue destruction zzso Selective zzso of this process might be used to minimize the side effects of artificial mechanical zzso This study was designed to identify the cell types and specific signaling mechanisms that are activated by ventilation with increased zzso zzso In isolated zzso mouse zzso zzso caused nuclear zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and enhanced expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso type II zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso prevented nuclear zzso of zzso and the subsequent release of zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in rats in zzso where zzso prevented zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso These findings show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso type II cells contribute to the zzso release of zzso zzso and that selective zzso of this process is possible without zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso
