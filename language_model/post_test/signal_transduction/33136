Physical exercise can cause marked zzso in the structure and function of human skeletal zzso However, little is known about the specific signaling molecules and pathways that enable exercise to zzso cellular processes in skeletal zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso cascade is a major signaling system by which cells zzso zzso signals into zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that a single bout of exercise activates the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso muscle were taken from nine subjects at rest and after 60 zzso of cycle zzso zzso In all subjects, exercise increased zzso zzso and the activity of its downstream zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, exercise increased the activities of the upstream regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When two additional subjects were studied using a zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso activities were increased only in the exercising zzso These studies demonstrate that exercise activates the zzso cascade in human skeletal muscle and that this stimulation is primarily a local, zzso phenomenon, rather than a systemic response to zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso may zzso cellular processes that occur in skeletal muscle in response to zzso
