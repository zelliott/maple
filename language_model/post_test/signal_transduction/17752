zzso of zzso zzso to peripheral zzso zzso zzso is a zzso process dependent on the sequential engagement of zzso which mediates zzso rolling along the zzso surface of high zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso through zzso Within zzso zzso B and T zzso then migrate toward specific zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is playing an important role during this process, as its zzso zzso zzso and zzso can trigger rapid zzso zzso under flow in addition to inducing a zzso response, which may participate in zzso and/or zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso family zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso response of primary mouse zzso to zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited rapid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and under zzso flow, whereas zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso zzso in mice, we found that zzso transferred zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly less in zzso compared with control cells, although zzso rolling was similar in both zzso Finally, we observed rapid zzso zzso in zzso primary mouse zzso Thus, our study suggests a role for zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso
