In zzso growth takes place during the zzso stages until the formation of the zzso zzso delays zzso to allow prolonged zzso ensuring that the animal reaches an appropriate size to form a fertile zzso zzso is induced by a peak of the steroid hormone zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso after larvae have reached a certain body zzso Local zzso of the zzso growth factor signaling zzso activity in the PG interferes with zzso production, indicating that zzso activity in the PG couples the nutritional state to zzso However, the underlying mechanism is not well zzso In this study we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a growth inhibitor in zzso is involved in this zzso zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso peptides by direct binding and is expressed by specific cells in the brain, the ring zzso the gut and the fat zzso We demonstrate that zzso is required to regulate and adapt zzso timing to nutritional conditions by regulating zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso expression at its zzso sites using an zzso driver delays zzso while zzso zzso exhibit a slight acceleration of zzso These effects are strongly enhanced by zzso and are accompanied by massive zzso of zzso production resulting most likely from increased zzso production by zzso directly zzso the PG and not from elevated zzso levels in the zzso Taken together our results suggest that zzso zzso sense the nutritional state of zzso larvae and coordinate dietary information and zzso production to adjust zzso timing under zzso zzso
