Cell migration is a key event in many biological processes and depends on signals from both zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso During zzso plaque development, vascular smooth muscle cells migrate from the zzso media to the zzso through a basement membrane and zzso zzso zzso and zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso have previously been implicated in zzso formation and in this study smooth muscle cell zzso and migration on zzso collagen have been zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso to native intact collagen type I and to its first degradation zzso 3/4 zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso at 35 degrees C to mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a fourfold stimulation of smooth muscle cell zzso on the collagen 3/4 zzso whereas no increase in smooth muscle cell zzso on collagen type I was zzso Cell migration on collagen type I was zzso by zzso zzso whereas zzso migration on the 3/4 collagen zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in clusters concentrated at the leading and trailing edges of the cells and was only expressed when cells were exposed to the 3/4 collagen zzso zzso A9, an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, resulted in complete abolition of migration of zzso treated cells on collagen type I and 3/4 zzso These results strongly support the hypothesis that the cellular migratory response to soluble zzso can be regulated by zzso modification of the zzso zzso
