zzso zzso zzso is decisively involved in protecting zzso cells against zzso effects of zzso zzso We zzso regulation of zzso expression after exposing rat zzso zzso cells to various zzso zzso zzso that damage DNA such as zzso hydrogen zzso ultraviolet or X-ray exposure, as well as restriction zzso introduced into cells by zzso or arrest of replication by zzso significantly induced zzso zzso zzso to zzso Slight induction (up to zzso was observed after heat shock or zzso zzso No or only a very weak induction (less than zzso was observed after treatment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA, depletion of zzso by feeding with zzso or zzso serum zzso and feeding of starved cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso On the other hand, an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso prevented induction of zzso by zzso The data indicate that DNA breaks are an ultimate signal for zzso zzso induction and that protein zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso
