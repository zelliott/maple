zzso provides zzso that enhances zzso T cell differentiation upon binding of its zzso zzso During chronic immune zzso zzso is zzso expressed on activated immune cells, and this zzso T zzso disruption of zzso zzso responses via an unknown zzso We used zzso mice to investigate the effect of zzso expression of zzso on T zzso B cell zzso zzso induced zzso of the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on T cells, enabling not only zzso but also zzso T cells to zzso the B cell zzso zzso mice failed to develop productive zzso center formation and displayed impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso center B cell differentiation was critically dependent on zzso zzso signaling in T cells, and involved zzso impairment of zzso center B cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso enables T cells to terminate B cell responses, thereby compromising durable zzso zzso Our findings imply that the zzso and zzso zzso axis may be involved in shutdown of B cell responses before clearance of zzso Because zzso is expressed zzso in chronic viral infections such as zzso infection, this mechanism may also contribute to defects in zzso immunity associated with this zzso
