The zzso control of zzso maturation in fish has proven to be a valuable model for investigating zzso zzso steroid actions at the cell zzso zzso progress has been made over the last decade in identifying and characterizing zzso membrane receptors zzso these actions in fish, in understanding the hormonal regulation and zzso roles of these receptors in zzso zzso in zzso the signal zzso pathways they zzso and in determining their zzso Recent advances on these topics are briefly zzso New data demonstrating the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in induction of zzso maturation by the zzso steroid zzso in zzso is also zzso In addition, the cloning strategy to isolate the zzso zzso gene from spotted zzso zzso and the characteristics of a novel gene and protein discovered by this approach are zzso Current evidence suggests this zzso zzso protein is the long sought after zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation of zzso zzso
