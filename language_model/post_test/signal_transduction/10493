zzso growth factors play important roles in zzso but their functions in zzso remain poorly zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is essential for development of the zzso system by specifying zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso target zzso zzso zzso of zzso in blood vascular zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso which we also found to be the major zzso of zzso expressed in zzso This zzso zzso is zzso by a direct binding of zzso to newly identified zzso elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso newly formed zzso vessels during zzso and its zzso expression is maintained throughout zzso We also found that zzso and zzso promote zzso migration, and survival of cultured zzso without involvement of vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso We show that zzso binds to low- and zzso receptors on zzso and is efficiently zzso and zzso Moreover, functional zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is an initial target of zzso during the zzso cell fate zzso and that zzso signaling may play an important role in zzso vessel zzso
