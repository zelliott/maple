zzso zzso limit zzso outgrowth and plasticity during development and in the adult zzso zzso zzso a functional domain of the zzso inhibitor zzso signals through the zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso The signaling zzso mobilized by zzso engagement of zzso is not well zzso We identify a critical role for the scaffold protein Plenty of zzso zzso in relaying process outgrowth zzso downstream of zzso and zzso zzso the function of zzso or two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in cortical zzso leads to release from zzso and zzso zzso We also observed zzso zzso of process outgrowth by zzso and suppression analysis with the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso operates downstream of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso in zzso function were zzso to the zzso action of zzso indicating that a zzso mechanism operates to inhibit zzso outgrowth in different types of zzso zzso These studies delineate an zzso signaling zzso for process outgrowth zzso by zzso comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso complex as a potential therapeutic target to enhance zzso outgrowth and plasticity in the injured zzso
