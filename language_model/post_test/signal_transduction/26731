It has been proposed that sustained zzso expression in chronic inflammatory immune conditions, such as zzso and allergy, contributes to symptom zzso Therefore zzso of zzso gene expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy for such immune zzso However, the precise molecular mechanisms controlling zzso gene expression remain poorly zzso In this study, we explored zzso factors involving in zzso gene expression and examined their roles in a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and other zzso molecules zzso zzso expression on T zzso We identified an zzso site zzso within the zzso promoter region and demonstrated zzso actually binds to zzso upon zzso zzso Meanwhile, we found several zzso could zzso zzso expression on both zzso and zzso T cells in a manner independent of zzso zzso These zzso stimuli induced zzso binding to zzso Together, our results indicate zzso zzso factors are involved in zzso gene expression downstream of both zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso and suggest zzso zzso via zzso zzso signaling may be one of the mechanisms maintaining high level zzso expression in chronic inflammatory immune zzso
