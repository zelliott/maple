The proteins zzso zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso that act as zzso sensors to constantly adapt metabolism to the supply of, and demand for, zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex is a central component of the regulatory response to zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso plays a central role in the regulation of energy zzso at the cellular as well as the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been described as central zzso of a zzso network for stress and energy zzso In this study, zzso analysis established zzso as the major zzso zzso both in isolated cells and zzso In order to zzso the function of zzso in zzso zzso transgenic plants zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular analyses of these plants revealed that zzso is implicated in sugar and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the starch and soluble sugar content were observed in the zzso transgenic zzso Our studies also revealed modifications of the activity of essential zzso such as nitrate zzso or zzso zzso and of the expression of several zzso zzso confirming the central role of the protein zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso
