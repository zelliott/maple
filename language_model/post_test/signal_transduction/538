zzso belongs to the B7 zzso a group of molecules that zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although it was shown that zzso could inhibit zzso responses, several studies - most of them performed in zzso systems - found zzso to act in a zzso zzso In this study, we have specifically addressed a potential functional zzso of human zzso by assessing the effect of this zzso under varying experimental conditions as well as on different zzso zzso We show that zzso does not zzso human T zzso In the presence of strong zzso signals, zzso zzso and consistently zzso human zzso zzso This zzso effect was evident when zzso proliferation and zzso production and affected zzso as well as zzso T zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso interaction is zzso by an early suppression of zzso and that zzso zzso can be reverted by zzso zzso Since the triggering zzso expressed on zzso cells like transcript 2 zzso has been recently described as zzso zzso of zzso zzso we have extensively zzso interaction of human zzso with zzso In these experiments we found no evidence for such an zzso Furthermore, our data do not point to a role for zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso
