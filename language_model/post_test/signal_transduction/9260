The zzso intense stimulation of spinal zzso zzso causes zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso and zzso of zzso root zzso leading to an induction of synaptic reorganization underlying zzso in which innocuous zzso stimuli cause intense zzso The zzso signal also zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso root zzso and zzso in the zzso horn, underlying mechanisms for characteristic zzso zzso in zzso sensory zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso at the early stage after nerve injury and zzso zzso zzso Thus, both the zzso and zzso receptors play key roles in the initiation step using a zzso system for zzso zzso
