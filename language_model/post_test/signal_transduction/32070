zzso signaling and zzso zzso in particular DNA zzso are involved in regulation of gene expression in breast zzso Here we investigated a potential regulatory zzso between these two pathways by identifying their common target genes and exploring underlying molecular mechanisms in human zzso breast cancer zzso Gene expression profiling revealed that the expression of approximately 140 genes was influenced by both zzso zzso and a zzso agent zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso analysis suggests that these genes are involved in zzso signaling zzso regulation of cell proliferation and zzso Based on previously reported association with breast cancer, zzso signaling and/or DNA zzso zzso island prediction and GO analysis, we selected six genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for further zzso zzso reverses the effect of zzso on the expression of all selected zzso suggesting that they are direct targets of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso the expression of all selected genes in a zzso zzso zzso zzso island zzso status analysis revealed that only the promoters of zzso and zzso genes are zzso with zzso inducing zzso suggesting DNA zzso directs repression of these genes in zzso zzso In a further analysis of the potential interplay between zzso signaling and DNA zzso zzso treatment showed no effect on the zzso status of these zzso Additionally, we show that the zzso recruitment occurs at the zzso promoter in an zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we identified a set of genes regulated by both zzso signaling and DNA zzso However, our data does not support a direct molecular interplay of zzso of zzso and zzso signaling at promoters of regulated zzso
