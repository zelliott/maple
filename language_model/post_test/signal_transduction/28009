The lung zzso zzso protein A zzso has both zzso and zzso zzso We and others previously showed that zzso zzso the zzso production of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso by the zzso bacterial component zzso We propose that zzso decreases the production of zzso zzso by zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso production in rat and mouse zzso in the presence and absence of serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso levels for zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta as well as zzso B DNA binding zzso zzso also diminished zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso inflammatory zzso production in a zzso manner and also by mechanisms independent of the zzso signaling zzso
