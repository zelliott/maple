The cellular innate immune response is essential for recognizing and defending against viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso immune zzso is critically involved in zzso innate immune zzso Here we demonstrate that the complement zzso interacts with different zzso zzso components and enhances zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso responsive element zzso and nuclear zzso reporters and zzso transcription, but not zzso regulatory zzso and inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso zzso In addition, zzso can counteract the function of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results reveal the important role of complement zzso in the innate immune zzso
