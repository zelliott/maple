The zzso zzso controls organ size by multiple mechanisms that ultimately regulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to tissue zzso due to zzso zzso of target zzso whereas zzso of the zzso triggers zzso in developing zzso However, the mechanism underlying cell death induced by zzso zzso is not zzso We found that zzso of zzso leads to induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso can zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity strongly suppressed the overgrowth caused by zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso zzso restricts zzso zzso zzso cell death requires the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in genetic mosaics leads to cell survival and increased cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso is zzso suppressed in zzso zzso cells or cells zzso for other zzso zzso components like warts zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso target of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso connection has implications in control of overall organ size and other growth regulatory mechanisms like zzso proliferation and cell zzso
