zzso cells and supporting cells of the zzso zzso terminally differentiate during zzso Recent in zzso evidence suggests the presence of hair cell zzso in the zzso zzso zzso properties of these cells and factors that promote their ability to generate spheres in zzso cultures have not been zzso We define an in zzso system that allows zzso cells harvested from the early zzso zzso to develop into zzso These spheres contain zzso zzso and zzso positive zzso cells that can divide and generate new hair zzso cells, zzso zzso for specific hair cell zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ability to zzso zzso We demonstrate that reducing zzso signaling with a gamma zzso inhibitor decreases the number of spheres generated following treatment of the zzso cell zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso by an zzso soluble form of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes sphere formation and the sensory potential of cochlear zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso signaling plays a role in maintaining a population of zzso sensory zzso cells in the zzso zzso
