The production of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and other stimuli was studied in bovine zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in a zzso zzso at 2 zzso and zzso manner zzso half zzso increase, zzso zzso 61 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited such a rise in zzso with a half zzso zzso concentration zzso of 231 zzso 55 zzso The zzso increase in zzso was also inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso and by the absence of zzso zzso Other agents that strongly increased zzso calcium concentration zzso as zzso did, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also caused a rise in zzso in cultured bovine zzso zzso zzso an zzso of sodium channels, produced a slowly developing calcium increase and no significant zzso zzso The zzso zzso failed to increase zzso zzso and was the weakest zzso of zzso zzso zzso formation, induced by sodium zzso zzso 100 zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso was inhibited by zzso by increasing zzso with zzso This zzso was abolished by zzso (30 zzso and by the absence of calcium in the zzso zzso In conclusion, bovine zzso cells zzso zzso oxide zzso to activate zzso zzso in response to several zzso which increase zzso Moreover, the increase in zzso also stimulates a zzso zzso which could zzso the levels of zzso in these zzso
