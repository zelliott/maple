To investigate the effects and the molecular mechanisms of zzso a major zzso found in edible zzso on zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso Cell cycle and zzso were evaluated using flow zzso zzso zzso was detected with zzso orange zzso and transient zzso of the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso expression was detected with Western zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso for 48 h caused zzso zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, and 40 zzso zzso induced zzso arrest, but did not change the zzso of zzso zzso The same zzso of zzso zzso increased the protein expression of zzso II (the zzso zzso and zzso 1 (the initiation factor for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso decreased the levels of zzso zzso and its downstream proteins zzso zzso and zzso and increases the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso (5 zzso blocked the zzso effect of zzso as well as zzso zzso 

zzso exerts zzso zzso effect in zzso cells via zzso of zzso signaling zzso
