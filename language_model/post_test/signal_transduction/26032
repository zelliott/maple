zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes bacterial zzso a severe disease of forage grasses such as Italian zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to gain a more detailed understanding of the genetic control of resistance mechanisms and to provide zzso for marker assisted selection, the partial zzso of two Italian zzso zzso one resistant and one susceptible to bacterial zzso were compared at four time points after zzso zzso A zzso zzso developed from a perennial zzso zzso zzso expressed sequence tag set consisting of zzso unique genes was used for zzso analysis in Italian zzso An average of zzso zzso of the perennial zzso sequences spotted on the zzso zzso were detected by zzso to Italian zzso zzso analyses of the resistant versus the susceptible zzso revealed substantial gene expression differences zzso indicating that great gene expression differences between different Italian zzso zzso exist which potentially contribute to the observed zzso divergence in zzso resistance between the two zzso In the resistant zzso several genes zzso expressed after zzso zzso were identified which revealed similarities to zzso changes triggered by zzso molecular patterns in other zzso zzso These genes represent candidate genes of particular interest for the development of tools for marker assisted resistance zzso
