Although the zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso functions as an important signaling complex in many cellular zzso the role of zzso in zzso derived from embryonic stem cells zzso has been less zzso Here, using a modified protocol to differentiate mouse zzso zzso into almost uniform zzso zzso we explored the importance of zzso in the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed zzso embryonic bodies than the wild type and failed to undergo zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso starting at the point when zzso precursors began to differentiate from zzso caused the gradual loss of zzso shrinkage of zzso and a decreased ratio of zzso length to cell number over 48 to zzso of zzso This change was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso protein 1 zzso zzso of zzso during zzso differentiation from zzso also resulted in gradual loss of zzso and shrinkage of cell zzso Loss of zzso density resulting from zzso treatment could be reversed by zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in the differentiation and survival of zzso derived from zzso
