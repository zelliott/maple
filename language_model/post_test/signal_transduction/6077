Since little is known about the function of zzso growth factors as regulators of multiple cell cycles, we compared the ability of zzso zzso and serum to induce a second round of DNA synthesis in Swiss zzso cells previously exposed to either zzso zzso or serum during the first cell cycle using zzso and zzso in a double labeling system to distinguish between the first and second cell zzso Surprisingly, we observed that cells exposed to either zzso or zzso in the first cell cycle were unable to zzso DNA in response to zzso or zzso in the second cell zzso yet these cells responded well to serum as a second cycle zzso Interestingly, while cells exposed to either zzso or zzso in the second cycle displayed normal zzso signaling and expressed zzso D and zzso they, like zzso zzso and zzso cells, failed to express zzso A, and the continuous exposure of cells to either zzso or zzso resulted in a decrease in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, an increased association of this complex was observed with zzso zzso in an zzso manner as well as with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Lastly, the zzso of zzso expression using an zzso strategy was able to partially rescue the zzso response of Swiss zzso cells to zzso in the second zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may limit their zzso effect to a single cell cycle, zzso entry into the second round of replication is serum dependent and zzso the zzso nature of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
