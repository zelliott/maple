zzso zzso are characterized by high invasive potential and strong zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream target zzso are crucial for tumor zzso We investigated the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso suppressed tube formation of zzso cells in human zzso vein zzso cell zzso cell zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso suppressed gene and protein expressions of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and the DNA binding activity of zzso zzso a key downstream zzso factor of zzso zzso also suppressed the migration of zzso in zzso Thus, it is suggested that the zzso effect of zzso may be due to the combination of ROCK zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, an in zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso mouse model demonstrated that zzso suppressed zzso and tumor zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso has a therapeutic potential as an zzso agent against zzso zzso
