As our understanding of the zzso of biological effects caused by zzso expands, we become witnesses to another miracle of nature that has endowed the simplest zzso with functions seemingly ubiquitous to every zzso zzso A decade after the discovery of the zzso family zzso zzso the field has gained unimaginable impetus explaining the biological effects of zzso and zzso acid zzso The discovery of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster refined this picture and added complexity to our concepts of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso targets - identified and not yet identified - make us realize the dual zzso and second zzso roles of zzso In this paper we provide new data obtained concerning zzso responses using cell lines naturally lacking or intentionally knocked out of many of the known zzso zzso widely used by investigators in the field as cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso Our observations raise caution about the lack of zzso responsiveness in these cells and underline the unprecedented complexity and zzso of zzso cellular zzso
