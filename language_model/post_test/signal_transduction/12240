zzso changes in the expression of regulator of zzso 1 zzso affects cell zzso This has been linked to the suppression of zzso factor of activated T cells signaling by zzso Here, we describe a novel role of zzso zzso 4 in proper expression of Ras protein and its zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso attenuated growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso reduced Ras levels and its translation zzso and led to a reduction of zzso initiation factor zzso in the initiation complex and a slight repression of global protein zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso of zzso A demonstrated that these effects were zzso Our findings reveal a previously unknown role of zzso in protein zzso which may be relevant to cell zzso
