zzso diseases such as asthma involve increased airway smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso via enhanced zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso factor zzso well-known in the nervous system, can regulate zzso zzso and interact with zzso in contributing to airway zzso In this study, we determined whether and how zzso regulates human zzso cell proliferation in the presence of zzso thus testing its potential role in airway zzso zzso were treated with 10 zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso or zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso with zzso of cell cycle proteins predicted to change with zzso Forty-eight hours of zzso enhanced zzso proliferation to zzso 50% of that by zzso or zzso zzso with small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso B zzso abolished zzso effects on zzso whereas zzso 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso of different components of zzso and zzso pathways blunted zzso or zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with electron mobility shift zzso confirmation of zzso binding to consensus DNA zzso These results demonstrate that zzso such as zzso can enhance human zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso pathways and a versatile zzso factor such as zzso which are common to zzso and growth factors involved in zzso
