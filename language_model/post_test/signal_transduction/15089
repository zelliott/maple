zzso zzso cells respond zzso to zzso waves of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that guide cell zzso toward a signaling zzso In this process, a large number of cells are zzso resulting in the formation of zzso territories that are essential for zzso body zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso a crucial component of the signaling system, breaks down the external zzso and can be either zzso or zzso The existence of two such forms is unusual in cell biology, and it remains to be determined why they have both been maintained through zzso Here, using a model of the zzso signaling system, I show that colonies can successfully organize into zzso over a wider range of initial cell zzso when both forms of zzso are present in an appropriately tuned ratio than when only a single form is zzso The model indicates that zzso zzso maintains zzso integrity in colonies with high initial cell density, whereas the zzso form is important for wave propagation at low cell zzso Thus, the ultimate retention of both forms can increase territory zzso These findings have implications for other excitable media, including zzso propagation in cardiac cells and propagation of electrical zzso in nerve zzso since these systems have similar features of spatial zzso zzso and zzso of the relevant zzso
