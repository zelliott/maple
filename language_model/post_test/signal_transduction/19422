zzso fusion is a highly regulated process that is key for forming skeletal muscle during development and zzso in zzso Much remains to be understood about the molecular regulation of zzso zzso Some molecules that influence zzso muscle fusion display specific cellular zzso during zzso Such molecules can be localized to the contact region between two fusing cells either in both cells or only in one of the zzso How distinct zzso of molecules contributes to fusion is not zzso Further complexity exists as other molecules are functionally restricted to zzso at later stages of zzso to regulate their fusion with zzso zzso This review examines these three categories of molecules and discusses how spatial and functional restriction may contribute to the formation of a zzso zzso zzso how and why molecules become restricted in location or function is likely to provide further insights into the mechanisms regulating zzso muscle zzso
