Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso increases the lifespan of organisms from zzso to zzso In contrast to the lifespan extension effect in lower organisms, it has been reported that zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso the zzso zzso of zzso gene 1 zzso zzso premature zzso in human zzso zzso we assessed whether the zzso of zzso would genuinely induce premature zzso in human zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso or zzso membrane protein 2 zzso by zzso zzso or infecting cells with a virus containing zzso zzso resulted in a zzso state in two strains of primary human zzso zzso zzso cells induced by zzso impairment exhibited the zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso cells, such as increased zzso associated zzso zzso activity, zzso oxygen species zzso generation, and zzso of zzso In addition, expression levels of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso in the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 1 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were decreased in both the zzso and the zzso zzso prematurely zzso zzso Furthermore, it was found that zzso scavenging by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso using zzso respectively, delayed zzso zzso premature zzso and restored the expression levels of components in the zzso and zzso zzso 

Taken together, we concluded that zzso impairment zzso premature zzso through a zzso and zzso manner in primary human zzso
