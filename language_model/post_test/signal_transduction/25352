zzso of zzso cell zzso activity in the setting of chronic viral infection is important for determining viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso cell surface is a surrogate marker for zzso zzso release and zzso zzso cell zzso We have developed a convenient, zzso whole blood flow zzso zzso for measuring zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso a surrogate for zzso cell zzso activity ex zzso which can be performed using small volumes of patient whole zzso Using this zzso we show that zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso is triggered in zzso but not zzso zzso cells, requiring zzso zzso zzso activity, and that there is a significant correlation between zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso We compared whole blood from zzso zzso patients with zzso and zzso zzso control subjects and found a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Reduction of both correlated strongly with reduced zzso surface expression on zzso cells of zzso individuals zzso These data suggest that zzso is inhibited in zzso cells from zzso zzso individuals at the level of early events in zzso signal zzso associated with low zzso zzso and our method is a useful and reliable tool to detect pathological defects in zzso cell zzso
