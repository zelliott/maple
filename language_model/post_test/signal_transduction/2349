The tumor zzso gene zzso is expressed in the contrasting cell fates zzso and zzso We examined whether the zzso of the zzso target zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on the cause of zzso induction in human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Both zzso triggered by the zzso analog zzso zzso and growth stimulation by the zzso zzso zzso induced a comparable level and time course of zzso zzso zzso Both stimuli led also to an increase of zzso protein zzso The zzso agent, but not the zzso led to zzso of zzso and zzso within 18 zzso zzso was followed by zzso of zzso of the zzso within 48 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso which also have a dual function in proliferation and zzso showed an early induction by both zzso and zzso These results add further evidence that growth stimulation and DNA zzso zzso share early gene zzso pathways in normal zzso However, since zzso does selectively translate into zzso of target genes depending on the cause of zzso this function of zzso seems to be regulated by additional factors, which are closely related to the ultimate fate of the zzso
