Superior cervical zzso zzso cells from zzso rats underwent zzso upon treatment with zzso a zzso zzso Western zzso and activity zzso showed that zzso was indeed zzso but its zzso inhibitor zzso neither suppressed nuclear fragmentation nor rescued the zzso from cell zzso zzso the general inhibitor of zzso prevented nuclear fragmentation and delayed the cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented nuclear fragmentation and provided zzso protection as zzso The combination of both zzso and zzso provided a long-term zzso protection zzso zzso whereas neither one alone could do so, suggesting that there are both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also likely to act upstream of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso microscopic observations demonstrated that zzso suppressed nuclear fragmentation and improved zzso zzso but failed to prevent zzso formation, which resulted in a zzso zzso More importantly, zzso effectively blocked this abundant zzso formation along with suppressing zzso zzso Thus, the combination of both zzso a nearly normal zzso which is consistent with the results of cell survival zzso These findings clearly indicate that zzso zzso zzso plays multiple roles in zzso and zzso pathways of zzso cell death, and suggest a novel mechanism underlying a zzso zzso involving zzso swelling and zzso zzso
