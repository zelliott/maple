zzso growth zzso zzso has been linked with several human zzso however, its role in breast cancer progression is not zzso We found that zzso expressing breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso are more invasive compared to cell lines with little or no expression of zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso low expressing zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso showed increased cell proliferation while zzso the expression of zzso by zzso in zzso high expressing zzso and zzso cells showed decreased cell proliferation and increased zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was positively correlated with the expression of zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso markers zzso and zzso with zzso decreased expression of zzso marker zzso Since zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso signaling as well as in zzso transition and tumor zzso we determined the DNA binding activity of zzso and our findings are consistent showing that zzso zzso led to increased DNA binding activity of zzso while it was found to be decreased by zzso of zzso These results were also consistent with the expression and activity of zzso and zzso as well as invasive zzso Further, forced expression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on zzso activity and zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso plays an important role in breast tumor aggressiveness and this process is mechanistically linked with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
