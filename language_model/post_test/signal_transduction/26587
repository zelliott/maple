zzso of zzso growth, guidance, and branching is essential for constructing a correct zzso zzso zzso a zzso small zzso has essential roles in zzso formation and zzso During zzso formation, zzso activates a series of zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso of a zzso zzso response zzso zzso However, signaling molecules linking zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso remain zzso Here we identify zzso an zzso protein harboring Ras association zzso zzso as an zzso of zzso inducing zzso branching through zzso zzso We observe zzso interaction of zzso with zzso in cortical zzso during the stage of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso increases zzso branch number, and the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso binding domain are required for this zzso zzso interference zzso experiments reveal that zzso of zzso zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso branching in cultured cortical zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that active zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso to the membrane and inducing zzso development in zzso zzso Overall, our findings demonstrate a novel signaling zzso downstream of zzso that controls zzso zzso
