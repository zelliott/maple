The zzso zzso is expressed on activated T and B zzso zzso cells, and zzso A zzso motif in the zzso zzso tail can bind different zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso family zzso and zzso zzso To analyze zzso signal zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso deficient in these zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which required zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso domain protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required zzso and zzso was zzso regulated by Lyn and zzso but was zzso zzso Lyn directly zzso zzso in zzso but the zzso zzso did not depend on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso revealed stages of zzso differentiation where these molecules are expressed alone or zzso Signaling studies in zzso disease cell lines showed that zzso is linked to the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso B zzso Our data support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso are zzso during a narrow window of zzso maturation and zzso may be involved in regulation of zzso differentiation via switching of zzso signaling zzso
