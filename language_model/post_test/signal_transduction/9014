zzso regulates zzso growth, and zzso of zzso and mediates zzso depletion in zzso zzso promotes zzso signaling zzso by zzso but also activates zzso pathways such as zzso zzso zzso the latter requires the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso Whether the opposing activities zzso by zzso proteins and zzso involve molecular zzso is zzso Here, we report that zzso early zzso of the zzso zzso zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that the zzso region of zzso interacts directly with the zzso tail of the zzso zzso type I zzso in a zzso manner and that the interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso with the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and resistant to zzso growth zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso cells were zzso and hypersensitive to zzso zzso In zzso to determine the effects of reduced zzso or zzso gene dosage on zzso zzso and zzso characteristic of zzso transgenic mice, we generated zzso transgenic mice deficient for zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso ameliorated zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased both zzso zzso and zzso These data define distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways that arise from zzso independent interactions with the zzso and that mediate opposing signals for zzso death or zzso
