The zzso zzso of insulin signaling proteins is altered by various stimuli such as insulin, zzso growth factor I, and zzso stress and is thought to be an important mechanism that can influence zzso signal zzso and cellular zzso This study examined the possibility that exercise may also alter the zzso zzso of insulin signaling proteins in human skeletal zzso Nine untrained males performed 60 zzso of cycling exercise zzso zzso peak pulmonary zzso zzso Muscle zzso were sampled at rest, immediately after exercise, and 3 h zzso Muscle was zzso by zzso into the following crude zzso zzso zzso and a high-speed zzso containing membrane and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for protein content of insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant change in the protein content of the insulin signaling proteins in any of the crude zzso after exercise or 3 h zzso Exercise had no significant effect on the zzso of zzso zzso in any of the zzso In contrast, exercise increased zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso fraction zzso In conclusion, exercise can increase zzso of downstream insulin signaling proteins specifically in the zzso fraction but does not result in changes in the zzso zzso of insulin signaling proteins in human skeletal zzso Change in the zzso protein zzso is therefore an unlikely mechanism to influence signal zzso pathways and cellular function in skeletal muscle after zzso
