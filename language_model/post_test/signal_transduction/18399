In an effort to understand the role of zzso signaling in chronic liver injury, zzso deficient zzso and zzso control zzso mice were subjected to zzso duct zzso zzso for 12 zzso This maneuver causes chronic zzso stress and liver injury, fueling sustained zzso zzso and zzso zzso By 12 weeks after zzso zzso mice develop significantly higher total serum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the majority zzso show zzso gallbladder zzso compared to zzso mice zzso P zzso zzso The zzso mice also cannot sustain the zzso liver mass increase commonly seen with chronic zzso zzso because of less zzso zzso despite a rate of zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice show a more advanced stage of zzso zzso and a higher mortality rate than the zzso controls zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso These zzso changes in the zzso mice are associated with decreased expression and zzso of zzso and the zzso factor zzso compared to zzso zzso Daily treatment with zzso zzso zzso for 3-6 weeks starting at 6 weeks after zzso significantly lowers the serum total zzso in both zzso In the zzso mice, zzso zzso treatment also increases the level of zzso protein expression and completely reverses the loss of liver mass by increasing the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso appears to contribute to zzso tree integrity and maintenance of zzso mass during chronic zzso
