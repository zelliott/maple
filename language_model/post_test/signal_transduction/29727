Previous studies have shown that zzso can regulate the zzso zzso Neonatal zzso exhibit a period of adrenal zzso to stress in the first 2 zzso of life, and we determined the role of zzso as a zzso of this zzso We examined the direct effects of zzso on zzso adrenal zzso responses to zzso under zzso conditions and after zzso maternal zzso In isolated zzso cells from as early as zzso d 5 zzso and throughout the zzso period, acute zzso zzso incubation with zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso maternal separation and the resulting rapid decline in plasma zzso levels increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in isolated cells, but did not modify the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso steroid production in zzso zzso separation in zzso zzso increased adrenal expression of zzso acute regulatory protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins as well as all zzso zzso measured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso body weight, zzso replacement during maternal separation did not affect zzso zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein expression induced by zzso zzso challenge (20 or 80 zzso body weight, zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at least through a rapid reduction in the expression of zzso and zzso protein in the zzso adrenal zzso As zzso zzso in zzso are controlled to a large extent by the maternal diet, these results emphasize the key role of zzso to mediate the maternal influence on the zzso axis of the zzso
