The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso family, which couples zzso stimuli to gene zzso The in zzso function of zzso is not zzso Here, we investigated the potential involvement of zzso in cardiac zzso In adult mouse zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso 7 days after zzso zzso a mechanical load that zzso zzso and expression of transforming growth factor zzso An zzso zzso of zzso expressed in zzso of transgenic mice was sufficient to produce zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cardiac zzso zzso fibrosis, severe zzso dysfunction, zzso gene zzso zzso and early zzso Thus, zzso activity is induced as a delayed response to mechanical stress, and can suffice to elicit zzso zzso and zzso heart zzso
