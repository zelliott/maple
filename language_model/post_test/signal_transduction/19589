zzso are an essential component of the zzso and recent evidence points to an increasing diversity of their zzso zzso molecular pathways that mediate distinct zzso functions, is key to understanding how the nervous system operates in the intact and pathological zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso pathway, well known for its roles in the developing zzso is active in zzso of the mature mouse zzso in zzso Using multiple genetic approaches, we show that regionally distinct zzso of zzso receive zzso zzso indicating a molecular diversity between specific zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso as a source of Sonic zzso zzso in the adult zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso by targeted removal of zzso an zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and cellular zzso specifically in zzso populations regulated by zzso zzso zzso our findings demonstrate a role for zzso zzso in regulating specific populations of differentiated zzso
