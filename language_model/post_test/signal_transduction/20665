zzso zzso zzso deficient mice zzso accumulate zzso zzso zzso in zzso proteins until their death due to zzso at approximately 45 zzso Previous studies have shown that these mice have zzso activated insulin signaling in their zzso and that these brains are zzso larger than those from zzso zzso zzso To determine whether insulin zzso zzso and brain enlargement is responsible for the fatal seizures, we administered zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso that zzso an early step in the insulin zzso zzso zzso reduced the average brain size in the zzso animals to within zzso of the zzso zzso administered controls, and nearly doubled the lifespan of zzso at zzso survival of the original zzso zzso revealed significant decreases in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice and zzso and zzso in zzso animals upon treatment with zzso These data suggest zzso of the insulin zzso and its resulting brain enlargement contributes to the early death of zzso mice, but is not solely responsible for the early death observed in these zzso
