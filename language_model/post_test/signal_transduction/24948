zzso growth zzso zzso can cause cell cycle arrest, terminal zzso or zzso in most normal zzso cells, whereas most zzso cell lines are resistant to zzso zzso of resistance to zzso caused by zzso of cell cycle regulators and/or zzso of components of the zzso signaling zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have been demonstrated in human pancreatic cancer and zzso cell zzso cell zzso But, this has not been shown in zzso zzso To investigate the potential association between loss of sensitivity to zzso and expression status of transforming growth factor zzso II zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines derived from zzso cancer, the expression levels of these genes were examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso were used as zzso zzso of T beta zzso was zzso in all of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso was decreased in ten cell lines and nine cell lines zzso zzso compared to normal zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cell lines as determined by zzso in nude mice, and only in zzso zzso of zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in any of these cell zzso The loss of sensitivity to zzso of cell lines derived from zzso zzso may be related to zzso a decreased expression of zzso which mediates zzso induced growth zzso and/or zzso an zzso of zzso This zzso zzso with increased zzso of zzso cancer cell zzso The loss of sensitivity to zzso is not associated with a lack of T beta zzso
