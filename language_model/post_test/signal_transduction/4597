This review will focus on the recent advances in molecular zzso and targeted therapies for zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso in which rearranged during zzso zzso zzso are the most important zzso events, in sporadic zzso the genetic or molecular zzso are yet to be zzso 

zzso molecular therapies that inhibit zzso and other zzso zzso receptors involved in zzso have shown great promise in the treatment of zzso or locally advanced zzso and are under zzso In addition, the recent findings of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso sporadic zzso and the zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso suggests that additional or alternative genetic events are important for zzso zzso 

Recently, zzso zzso an inhibitor of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso 2 and zzso 3, zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso was approved for the treatment of adults with symptomatic or progressive zzso zzso advantages for zzso over zzso were seen in terms of response rate, disease control rate, and zzso response in a phase III zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso 1 and zzso 2, zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso was associated with partial response and stable disease in 29 and zzso zzso
