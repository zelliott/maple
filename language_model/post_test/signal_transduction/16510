zzso of cell proliferation is dependent on the integration of signal zzso systems that are activated by external signal zzso such as growth factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso on these signal zzso networks, the cells decide in the zzso phase to continue proliferation or, zzso to stop zzso progression and undergo zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways have been demonstrated to play an essential role in these zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso has been demonstrated to mutually interfere with signal zzso In addition, it has been indicated that the zzso zzso factors are involved in these decisions, as zzso zzso has been demonstrated to play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso Because of its properties as a structural zzso zzso is essential in zzso and in cell spreading and, thus, is involved in zzso zzso As an intermediate factor in signal zzso zzso is likely to be involved in zzso regulation induced by external signal zzso And, finally, zzso has been demonstrated to play a direct role in zzso These observations indicate a prominent role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
