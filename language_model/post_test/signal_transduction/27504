The zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The essential role of the zzso zzso domain, consisting of 86 zzso zzso in signal transmission has been well zzso zzso the zzso zzso region containing 48 zzso zzso is essential for the association with and zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso On the other hand, little is known about the role of the rest of the zzso zzso region consisting of the zzso 38 zzso zzso 

We show that a truncated zzso form of zzso which lacks the zzso 48 zzso acids is still capable of inducing the zzso of zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso zzso This zzso region can also mediate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso events are completely zzso when zzso are introduced into the zzso motif in this zzso 

In this study, we identified a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso region of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso motif in this region plays a critical role in this zzso zzso The present study may provide further insight into the mechanism of cellular responses zzso by zzso and other zzso which zzso the zzso for their signal zzso
