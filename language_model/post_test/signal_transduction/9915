In the adult zzso brain, zzso zzso factor zzso is critically involved in long-term synaptic zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling contributes to pain zzso We show that zzso zzso in the zzso gray zzso the central structure for pain zzso project to and release zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a relay between the zzso and spinal zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso are zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso which is dependent on zzso receptors zzso In zzso studies with zzso slices show that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso via a signal zzso cascade involving zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso signaling represents a previously unknown mechanism underlying the development of persistent zzso Our findings also caution that application of zzso for recovery from zzso disorders could lead to zzso central zzso
