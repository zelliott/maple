zzso zzso are zzso essential for many zzso processes in zzso In this work, fundamental mechanism of hormone perception by zzso zzso has been studied by performing zzso simulations, revealing a new zzso channel of zzso and a novel hormone perception mechanism involving only one zzso state of zzso The novel hormone perception mechanism demonstrated here is remarkably different from the previously zzso mechanism zzso et zzso Nature 2008, zzso zzso involving two zzso states zzso and zzso of zzso According to the new perception zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso rather than the previously speculated zzso zzso to induce the recognition of protein zzso by zzso The novel zzso insights obtained in this study provide a new starting point for further studies on the detailed molecular mechanisms of zzso interacting with zzso and various hormones and for zzso rational design of novel, potent growth regulators that target crops and ornamental zzso
