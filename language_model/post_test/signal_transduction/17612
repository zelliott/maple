Fetal exposure to high doses of zzso as used to aid lung maturation in the therapy of Respiratory zzso Syndrome, causes growth zzso and interference with development of zzso zzso cell zzso The current study examined whether lower levels of steroids might instead play a positive zzso role in zzso zzso zzso rats were given zzso at or below the threshold for growth impairment zzso zzso on zzso days 17, 18 and 19, and the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was evaluated in membrane preparations from heart and zzso The zzso response to zzso was compared with effects on: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso by zzso which zzso the zzso and zzso development of zzso binding capabilities, assessed with zzso In the heart, prenatal exposure to zzso produced a zzso enhancement of zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso however, both zzso and zzso activity were also increased and zzso binding was relatively zzso These results suggest that enhanced responsiveness was occurring at the level of the zzso itself, rather than by effects on receptors on their zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso were zzso at the low dose of zzso without any evidence of growth zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
