zzso signaling is involved in zzso guidance during development, but it may also regulate zzso development after the zzso has contacted the target zzso Here we report that the zzso of zzso reverse signaling in the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso and functional maturation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling increased the number of zzso zzso and stabilized the zzso zzso of retinal zzso zzso It also enhanced zzso synaptic transmission and zzso long-term zzso zzso of zzso zzso The functional effects were caused by a rapid enhancement of zzso zzso release and a delayed increase in the zzso zzso zzso The facilitated zzso induction occurred during the early phase of enhanced zzso release and appeared to be zzso related to the zzso zzso maturation via an zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso maturation supports the notion that the zzso protein families have multiple functions in neural zzso
