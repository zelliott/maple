Although zzso T4 zzso zzso has been analyzed in some detail, there is little information available on the spatial arrangement and associations of its 150 zzso We have therefore carried out the first analysis of its zzso interactions by using the zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the zzso complexes that have been identified in the zzso arms or wedges and also in zzso structures called rings consisting of six wedges but lacking the central zzso both of which are zzso from T4 gene zzso zzso zzso Thirty different complexes were identified, of which about half contain zzso of a single species and half contain two different zzso In general, the complexes reflect and support the assembly zzso derived by Kikuchi and King zzso Kikuchi and zzso King, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but broaden its scope to include such complexes as zzso zzso and zzso which locate the zzso binding site over the inner edge of the ring but outside the central zzso The data also supports the view that wedges are assembled from the outer edge inward toward the central zzso zzso contact in rings was zzso primarily by zzso and zzso the absence of which dramatically zzso the zzso equilibrium in favor of zzso Although no zzso complexes containing zzso were identified, zzso contacts unique to rings were observed with both zzso and zzso
