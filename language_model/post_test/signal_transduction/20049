The zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in the control of fundamental cellular zzso Despite extensive research, how this zzso can process a myriad of diverse zzso zzso into zzso specificity to determine biological outcomes is not fully zzso It has been established that the zzso zzso is an zzso point in the control of the zzso function exerted by various zzso zzso In addition we previously established that the zzso Ras and zzso play a key role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso or the zzso zzso zzso In this report, using the zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, we show that both zzso and zzso tightly control the zzso dynamic of activated zzso with different magnitude and zzso zzso we provide the first evidence of a differential control of zzso and nuclear pools of activated zzso by the zzso Ras and zzso Ras is required for nuclear magnitude and duration of zzso zzso zzso whereas it is required for both zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso is exclusively involved in zzso zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, consistent with the control of the nuclear pool of activated zzso by the zzso we observe the same differential role of Ras and zzso on zzso nuclear zzso triggered by zzso or zzso Together these findings identify Ras and zzso as zzso partners in shaping nuclear and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso which in turn should control zzso zzso
