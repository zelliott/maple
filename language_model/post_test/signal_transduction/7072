The zzso factor zzso member of the zzso gene family, encodes for two main zzso zzso and zzso with distinct functions on zzso zzso and zzso Recently, we discovered that zzso is essential for in zzso zzso and heart development in zzso zzso is expressed by embryonic zzso and acts on cardiac zzso by a zzso zzso In the present study, we search for zzso zzso factors that could be regulated by zzso and, by zzso analysis, identified zzso zzso also named zzso or zzso We demonstrate that zzso is necessary for cardiac commitment of embryonic stem cells zzso and its regulation depends on zzso zzso zzso directly activates both zzso and zzso during zzso zzso while these zzso factors zzso zzso gene expression by a feedback loop zzso The molecular zzso controlled by zzso on zzso signaling zzso and thus on zzso emphasizes the importance of zzso during early cardiac zzso
