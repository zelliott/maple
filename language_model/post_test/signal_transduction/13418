Analysis of the recently completed zzso zzso sequence indicates that approximately zzso of the predicted genes could not be assigned to functional categories, as they do not show any sequence similarity with proteins of known function from other zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous and zzso zzso zzso interacts with a wide variety of cellular proteins and zzso their zzso in regulating diverse cellular zzso However, the primary zzso acid sequence of the zzso domain in different zzso proteins zzso is not zzso One way to identify most of the zzso in the zzso zzso is by zzso zzso screening of expression libraries with zzso Here, using a mixture of zzso zzso zzso from zzso we screened several expression libraries prepared from flower zzso zzso or zzso treated with hormones, an zzso or a zzso zzso analysis of 77 positive clones that interact with zzso in a zzso manner revealed 20 zzso including 14 previously unknown zzso In addition, by searching the zzso zzso sequence with the newly identified and known plant or animal zzso we identified a total of 27 zzso Among these, 16 zzso are represented by families with zzso members in each zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso are expressed zzso Our data suggest that zzso has a large number of zzso including several zzso zzso Although zzso is highly zzso between plants and animals, only a few zzso are common to both plants and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed the presence of a variety of interesting zzso Our analyses identified several hypothetical proteins in the zzso zzso as zzso targets, suggesting their involvement in zzso signaling zzso
