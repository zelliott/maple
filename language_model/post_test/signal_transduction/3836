We examined the role of zzso zzso in zzso long-term zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso of zzso slices with zzso zzso had no effect on zzso synaptic transmission, short-term zzso or zzso induced by several trains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso however, showed significant deficits in zzso induced by either zzso stimulation zzso or zzso Slices exposed to the same number of inducing zzso delivered either as TBS or as a single 100 zzso zzso only exhibited zzso zzso when TBS was used, indicating that the zzso pattern of stimulation determines the zzso zzso The late phase of zzso zzso zzso was also significantly impaired in slices zzso with zzso zzso or a zzso The application of a zzso 30 zzso after zzso induction caused previously zzso synaptic transmission to return to baseline levels, indicating that zzso zzso are required to maintain zzso for up to 1 zzso after zzso Taken together, these results indicate that both the zzso patterns of synaptic activity and the different zzso zzso of synaptic enhancement are important in determining the zzso dependence of plasticity in the zzso
