The zzso pathogen zzso zzso coli zzso is responsible for significant infant mortality and zzso particularly in developing zzso zzso zzso relies on a type III zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso into host zzso zzso zzso host cell survival and zzso although the zzso signaling pathways have not been well zzso We therefore examined the effect of zzso on the zzso growth factor zzso zzso a known upstream zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells within 15 zzso zzso with zzso zzso being observed at 4 zzso zzso zzso of zzso cultures also zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso contributes to this zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by the pharmacological inhibitor zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso had no effect on bacterial zzso zzso recruitment to sites of attachment, or zzso zzso barrier function zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the zzso of infected zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also curtailed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso the production of the zzso zzso zzso by infected zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso is a key zzso signaling zzso during zzso zzso
