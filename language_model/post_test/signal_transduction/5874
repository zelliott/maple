zzso is a potent cerebral zzso but excessive exposure to zzso oxygen zzso can reverse this zzso by stimulating brain zzso oxide zzso production, which increases cerebral blood flow zzso predictor of zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso blockers, specifically zzso and zzso increase zzso in zzso and accelerate seizure zzso To estimate changes in cerebrovascular responses to zzso zzso was measured by hydrogen clearance in zzso rats, either control animals or those zzso with one of these blockers, with the NO inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso with the NO donor zzso zzso or with a blocker combined with zzso Animals were exposed to zzso zzso at 1 zzso absolute zzso zzso or to zzso zzso at 4 or 6 zzso zzso spikes indicated central nervous system zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso blockade varied as a positive function of ambient zzso In air, zzso did not increase significantly, except after zzso with zzso However, at 6 zzso zzso mean values for zzso increased and values for seizure zzso zzso both zzso zzso with zzso abolished these zzso zzso rats treated with zzso before zzso were also more susceptible to zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by significantly shortened zzso zzso zzso in regional zzso reflect net zzso in the brain regions zzso since mean zzso pressures remained constant or increased zzso Thus zzso zzso oppose the protective zzso that is the initial response to zzso zzso decreasing the safety of zzso by zzso onset of zzso zzso zzso
