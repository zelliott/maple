Small tumor vessels are composed of zzso cells zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso These cells have been shown to communicate with each other via zzso signaling during zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso beta zzso zzso leads to induction of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in human colon zzso zzso As zzso play a role in regulating zzso function, we hypothesized that zzso beta may mediate zzso survival by induction of zzso in a zzso zzso We investigated the effects of zzso beta on zzso expression in human zzso zzso and the signal zzso pathways that may be zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso beta induced zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner and increased both the zzso promoter activity and the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso beta induced the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso within 5 zzso but did not activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso or zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso beta to induce zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso media from zzso zzso with zzso beta prevented zzso of zzso an effect that was partially zzso by zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso beta may induce zzso in zzso and suggest that this zzso signaling pathway, may zzso in part, zzso of zzso
