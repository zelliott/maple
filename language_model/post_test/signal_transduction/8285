zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso where they zzso zzso from various zzso due to their higher affinity for this compound, and return it to their specific outer membrane zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso of the zzso zzso assumes multiple functions which require various energy zzso zzso of zzso and, of zzso or zzso zzso is zzso zzso transfer from the zzso to the outer membrane zzso is also zzso In contrast, zzso transport and zzso release require zzso or high levels of zzso and zzso motive force, zzso In addition, zzso is a component of a signaling zzso regulating expression of the has zzso via specific zzso and zzso factors zzso by genes clustered at the has zzso The signal is the zzso landing on zzso in the presence of the zzso in its zzso zzso The has system is the only system thus far characterized in which the zzso factor is submitted to the same signaling cascade as the target zzso zzso zzso of the has system, combined with negative regulation by the zzso zzso permits bacterial adaptation to the available iron zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso inactive zzso factor is accumulated and can be activated as soon as the zzso source zzso zzso zzso the has system, instead of being submitted to amplification like other systems regulated by zzso zzso factors, functions by zzso triggered by zzso zzso
