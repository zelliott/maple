zzso zzso is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in the hospitalized zzso zzso zzso spores are infectious and are a major factor contributing to zzso zzso The zzso response regulator is the master regulator for zzso initiation and can influence many other cellular zzso Using the zzso gene knockout system, we zzso genes zzso zzso and a putative zzso sensor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in an zzso zzso whereas zzso of the zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso capacity by zzso suggesting that this zzso also has a role in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of either zzso or the zzso resulted in a marked zzso in zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso and the signaling zzso that zzso its activity appear to be involved in regulation of toxin synthesis in zzso zzso In addition, zzso was directly zzso by a putative zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso initiation in zzso zzso is controlled by a zzso signal zzso system rather than a zzso zzso The implications of these findings for zzso zzso zzso zzso and transmission are zzso
