zzso 3A zzso is a zzso factor known to guide zzso growth and zzso zzso We found that it also acts as a polarizing factor for zzso development in cultured zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso zzso to localized zzso suppressed its differentiation into zzso and promoted zzso formation, resulting in zzso formation away from the zzso source, and bath application of zzso to polarized zzso promoted zzso growth but suppressed zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso imaging showed that zzso elevated the zzso but reduced zzso and protein zzso A zzso activity, and its zzso suppression is attributed to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling in rat embryonic cortical zzso via in zzso zzso of zzso against the zzso zzso zzso also resulted in polarization defects zzso Thus, zzso regulates the earliest step of zzso zzso by polarizing zzso zzso
