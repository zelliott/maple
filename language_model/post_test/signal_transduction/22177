zzso zzso can activate the zzso and zzso signal pathways and induce zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso expression in specific cell zzso However, the relationship between those zzso proteins expression and signal pathways remains unknown at zzso Thus our experiments were designed to determine the exact relationship in zzso cell zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and zzso were both able to activate zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso increased zzso expression of zzso and zzso and had no influence on zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso expression were zzso while zzso signal zzso was blocked by zzso And zzso was zzso after zzso signal zzso being blocked by zzso These findings indicate that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso signal pathway, and zzso signal zzso has a negative regulatory effect on the expression of zzso and no significant effect on zzso and zzso
