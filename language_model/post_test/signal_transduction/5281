The zzso is composed of three major zzso zzso zzso intermediate filaments and zzso These are vital for numerous normal cellular processes including cell spreading and migration, zzso zzso zzso mechanical strength, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso components can lead to cells developing several zzso zzso for example increased migration and zzso defects in cellular zzso and genetic zzso due to errors in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a protein with well established roles in regulating zzso zzso zzso survival, zzso cell migration, invasion and zzso to zzso transition, and is therefore essential to normal cell zzso In addition, zzso is zzso or zzso in a number of human zzso and when zzso zzso leads to the acquisition of a number of zzso zzso some of which, such as increased cell migration, are zzso Here we shall focus on the recent finding that zzso also regulates the zzso zzso and is involved in zzso zzso zzso Therefore its deregulation may also lead to errors in cell division causing zzso instability, potentially further contributing to cancer zzso In light of these findings, the therapeutic potential of the zzso effects of genetic or pharmacological zzso of zzso will also be zzso
