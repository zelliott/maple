zzso is a plant zzso and a zzso active agent that has been isolated from several plant zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso immune zzso has not been fully zzso One of the possible mechanisms of its protective effects is the zzso of inflammatory zzso In this study, we used cells from the human mast cell line zzso to investigate this zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso on the production of inflammatory zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated the zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso In activated zzso cells, zzso inhibited the zzso plus zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso degradation, and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by decreasing the zzso zzso level and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a potential regulatory effect on inflammatory reactions that are zzso by mast zzso
