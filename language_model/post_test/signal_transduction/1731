1 zzso and zzso mediate their effects on zzso and zzso in part through increased activity of protein zzso C zzso For both cell types, 1 zzso exerts its effects primarily on more mature cells within the zzso whereas zzso exerts its effects primarily on relatively immature zzso Studies using the rat zzso cartilage growth plate as a model indicate that the two zzso increase zzso activity by different zzso In growth zone cells zzso zzso cell zzso 1 zzso causes a rapid increase in zzso that does not involve new gene zzso 1 zzso binds its membrane zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and the rapid release of zzso acid, as well as zzso of zzso zzso C, resulting in formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to release of zzso zzso from the rough zzso zzso and together with zzso the increased zzso activates zzso zzso is then zzso to the plasma zzso where it zzso a zzso zzso ultimately zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso increases are zzso at 9 zzso and zzso increases are zzso at 90 zzso in these zzso By contrast, zzso increases zzso through zzso of zzso D in resting zone zzso Peak production of zzso via zzso zzso is at 90 zzso as are peak increases in zzso Some of the effect is direct on existing plasma membrane zzso but most is due to new zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso acid and its zzso also play differential roles in the mechanisms, stimulating zzso in growth zone cells and zzso zzso in resting zone zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso activity and zzso production, thereby overcoming this potential zzso zzso which may account for the delay in the zzso zzso Ultimately, zzso is zzso zzso zzso activity zzso some, but not all, of the zzso responses of each cell type to its respective vitamin D zzso suggesting that the membrane zzso and nuclear zzso may function zzso to regulate proliferation and differentiation of musculoskeletal cells, but different pathways are involved at different stages of zzso zzso
