A relatively small number of signaling pathways govern the early patterning processes of zzso zzso The architectural changes over time to these signaling pathways offer unique insights into their zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso two very divergent mechanisms of zzso zzso have zzso In zzso signaling relies on trafficking of zzso zzso components to zzso specialized primary zzso In contrast, zzso do not use zzso of any kind for zzso signal zzso How these divergent lineages adapted such dramatically different ways of zzso the signaling zzso is an unanswered zzso Here, we present evidence that in the sea urchin, a zzso zzso zzso zzso are required for embryonic zzso signal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso during active zzso zzso This is the first evidence that zzso signaling requires zzso zzso and the first case of an zzso requiring zzso outside of the zzso zzso
