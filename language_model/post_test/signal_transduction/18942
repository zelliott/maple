To identify transcripts related to high egg production expressed specifically in the zzso and zzso zzso of the chicken, two zzso zzso libraries were zzso Two zzso selected strains of Taiwan Country zzso zzso B zzso line) and zzso zzso line) were zzso they had originated from a single population and were further subjected (since 1982) to selection for egg production to 40 zzso of age and body zzso size, zzso A total of 324 and 370 clones were identified from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso libraries, zzso After sequencing and zzso 175 and 136 transcripts that represented 53 known and 65 unknown zzso sequences were characterized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to screen the zzso expression levels of 32 randomly selected transcripts in another 78 laying zzso from five different zzso These strains included the two original strains (B and zzso used to construct the zzso zzso libraries and an additional three commercial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso White zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression levels of 16 transcripts were significantly higher in the zzso than in the B strain, whereas the zzso expression levels of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in two high egg production zzso zzso and zzso zzso this indicated their usefulness as molecular markers of high egg zzso
