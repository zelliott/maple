The zzso and toxicity profile of zzso zzso which blocks the zzso zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso In the current study, 30 monkeys (five monkeys per sex per zzso received an intravenous dose of zzso zzso 22, or 50 zzso once weekly for 6 zzso An additional five monkeys per sex received saline zzso and served as zzso zzso exposure to zzso was dose zzso and similar for both zzso Multiple dosing resulted in moderate zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was clinically well tolerated in zzso with no drug-related laboratory zzso changes or target organ toxicity observed, including a lack of zzso zzso changes, which were zzso and related to the zzso included zzso zzso reduction in the size and number of zzso zzso centers of the zzso and zzso zzso and minimal reductions in serum zzso zzso No zzso specific for zzso were detected during the treatment zzso There were no changes in peripheral blood or zzso zzso zzso or indications of zzso zzso infection, or zzso including zzso zzso zzso recovery of the immune system was noted at all doses by a robust zzso response to zzso zzso zzso following zzso 2 months after the last zzso dose was zzso Thus, zzso was well tolerated in monkeys treated for 6 months at weekly doses up to 50 zzso which represented a zzso increase above zzso achieved by the approved maintenance dose in kidney transplant zzso These findings support the zzso safety profile and demonstrate that zzso does not result in adverse zzso zzso
