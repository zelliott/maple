We investigated the role of zzso and zzso receptors in regulating zzso zzso from zzso isolated from rat zzso zzso In zzso experiments, we derived affinity values zzso from zzso zzso analysis for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso is similar to its affinity value zzso zzso constant from competition studies zzso zzso zzso determined from zzso competition zzso In contrast, the zzso for zzso is between its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso In separate zzso experiments, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a rightward shift in the zzso curve to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso effect of zzso appears specific for zzso zzso zzso since the toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso sites and does not inhibit zzso induced by zzso zzso Additional pharmacological studies indicate zzso receptors do not function through putative neural elements within isolated zzso Our combined results are consistent with both zzso and zzso receptors directly regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and indicate zzso receptors alone are insufficient to induce a zzso zzso zzso
