Recently, it has been shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid and transient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a clear indication that the alpha zzso zzso zzso is able to associate with the plasma zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso which are zzso zzso highly zzso membrane zzso play an important role in zzso induced signal zzso zzso can accumulate zzso molecules zzso thus, they may have a regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso from previous experiments have shown that zzso treatment decreased the number of surface connected zzso significantly in zzso smooth muscle cells and also zzso the expression of zzso In addition to providing further evidence that zzso interacts with zzso in zzso smooth muscle cells, this study also shows that the interaction between zzso and zzso is actually facilitated by zzso One of the signal zzso components found to accumulate in zzso is zzso zzso in an amount that increases simultaneously with increases in the amount of zzso Upon zzso treatment, zzso zzso is zzso zzso which, in turn, stimulates zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso can drive zzso to pinch off from the plasma zzso thereby decreasing the amount of plasma zzso zzso This loss of zzso activates the signal cascade that triggers cell zzso
