In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso zzso zzso on isolated zzso rat hearts that had been subjected to a protocol of zzso and zzso zzso We also examined whether the zzso zzso 2 and signal zzso and zzso 3 of zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a role in the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso rat hearts were subjected to 60 zzso of zzso followed by 60 zzso of zzso The hearts were exposed to zzso zzso during the first 10 zzso of zzso in the absence or presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso treatment zzso a zzso effect, and the treated hearts demonstrated an improved zzso cardiac functional recovery, a decreased zzso zzso size and decreased zzso zzso release in the coronary flow, a reduced number of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso AG blocked the zzso zzso by zzso the zzso signaling pathway, as reflected by the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso can zzso zzso injury through the zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which zzso a survival signal to the zzso
