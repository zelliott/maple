zzso factors are essential for blood cell zzso Mice expressing low levels of zzso zzso have an increased number of bone zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso In contrast, mice engineered to express low levels of zzso zzso in the zzso lineage exhibit zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and defective terminal differentiation leading to zzso These seemingly opposite roles may affect zzso turnover and thus be of clinical zzso 

To determine how these two zzso factors act together to control zzso and zzso zzso 

We used a combination of cellular and molecular in zzso zzso to examine the ability of bone zzso cells from mice expressing low levels of both zzso and zzso zzso to as zzso to produce zzso and zzso 

zzso cells, or those with low zzso levels in which zzso is zzso deleted, lack the zzso capacity of zzso cells, allowing the cells to proceed towards more committed zzso that are, however, impaired in their capacity to produce fully differentiated cells, as confirmed by the abundance of zzso zzso cells that lack the ability to form zzso 

zzso and zzso act in concert to achieve correct zzso zzso zzso regulates both the proliferation of zzso zzso and their terminal zzso zzso also acts at the level of the zzso by influencing its commitment to zzso but in contrast to zzso it does not have any effect on the process of terminal zzso
