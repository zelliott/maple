zzso acid zzso zzso and signal zzso pattern after zzso growth factor zzso stimulation were examined in freshly isolated zzso from zzso fetuses and zzso zzso zzso induced a transient increase of zzso transport after 10 zzso only in adult zzso the observed zzso of fetal liver is not dependent on a lack of zzso receptors which are present though to a lesser extent on the plasma membrane in this zzso As far as the production of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is concerned, substantial differences were zzso zzso increased zzso production in adult zzso whereas it had no effect in fetal zzso Moreover, the addition of zzso induced a calcium transient in zzso from adult animals, while there was no increase in fetal zzso The lack of zzso effect on zzso acid transport in fetal cells could be due to its inability to produce both zzso and calcium zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso is not activated during fetal zzso
