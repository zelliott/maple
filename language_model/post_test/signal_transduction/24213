Eighty percent of patients newly infected with the zzso C virus zzso develop chronic infection, suggesting that zzso can develop effective strategies to escape the unspecific and specific immune response of the zzso Because zzso molecules have been recognized to be powerful zzso of zzso signaling via the zzso pathway, zzso expression of these molecules should be an efficient instrument to counteract the cellular response toward zzso zzso an essential part of first line zzso immune zzso This study shows that zzso of zzso core protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso With the use of a zzso fusion zzso further evidence is given that zzso core is capable to inhibit nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was accompanied by the induction of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso core protein zzso zzso signal zzso via induction of zzso zzso zzso core protein was competent to partially rescue growth of a genetically engineered influenza A virus lacking its own zzso zzso These zzso properties of the zzso core protein may be part of the molecular basis of zzso zzso in about one-half of chronically infected zzso
