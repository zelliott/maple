We identified the gene responsible for three zzso zzso zzso of zzso rice zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis and database searches indicated that the zzso gene zzso encodes a novel and unique protein zzso and that rice has no zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and advancing the previously reported results on zzso zzso we found the zzso zzso zzso is impaired, but only zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso is totally absent from zzso zzso zzso zzso roots of zzso zzso show normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso manner in zzso shoot zzso zzso zzso leaf sheath zzso and zzso zzso and is little expressed in zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso zzso is zzso zzso from that absent from zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso of zzso found in zzso zzso does not occur in zzso zzso Based on the genetic and zzso evidence zzso it is concluded that zzso is specifically involved in shoot zzso and that zzso and zzso signaling pathways occur in zzso It is further concluded that, in zzso only the zzso gravity signaling involves zzso distribution of zzso between the two lateral halves and is required for zzso
