zzso the zzso attachment of zzso to target zzso has emerged as a ubiquitous zzso modification zzso whose function extends far beyond its original role as a tag for protein degradation identified three decades zzso Although sharing parallel properties with zzso zzso zzso itself in important zzso Nevertheless, the interplay and zzso between zzso and zzso events have become a zzso theme in cell zzso zzso zzso how these two major zzso intersect to regulate signal zzso is an important research zzso In this review, we first discuss the involvement of zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso highlighting the interplay between zzso and zzso in this zzso system and addressing open zzso The roles of zzso in pathways zzso to zzso zzso will then be zzso In the final part of the review, we demonstrate the rich and versatile dynamics of zzso between zzso and zzso by using quantitative zzso and analysis of network motifs commonly observed in cellular zzso We argue that given the overwhelming complexity arising from zzso zzso a quantitative framework based on systems biology and mathematical zzso is needed to efficiently understand their roles in cell zzso
