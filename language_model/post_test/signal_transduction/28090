zzso are essential for many aspects of polarity in zzso organisms, ranging from the zzso distribution of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to the transient polarity generated in zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit permanent cell polarity characterized by zzso and zzso surface zzso of distinct protein and zzso composition that are zzso by tight zzso They are also endowed with a zzso network that reflects the asymmetry of their cell surface: zzso zzso face the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the formation of distinct surface zzso during zzso differentiation is accompanied by the zzso of zzso from a uniform array focused at the zzso to the zzso network that zzso along the zzso polarity zzso The significance of this coincidence for zzso zzso and the signaling mechanisms that drive zzso zzso in developing zzso remain major unresolved questions that we are only beginning to zzso Studies in cultured polarized zzso cells have established that zzso serve as tracks that facilitate targeted zzso zzso Novel findings suggest, moreover, that zzso transport promotes protein zzso and even the generation of transport carriers in the zzso and zzso zzso
