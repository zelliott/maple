zzso zzso expansion of skin zzso stem cells has long attracted great interest because of the potential zzso in transplantation and gene zzso The use of cultured stem or zzso cells was limited by the lack of zzso zzso system with both satisfactory expansion efficacy and well suppressed differentiation ex zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathways are responsible for cell growth and differentiation zzso We investigated the function of zzso inhibitor zzso in the ex zzso expansion of skin zzso zzso cells by comparing media with or without addition of this zzso Our results showed that the zzso medium with zzso zzso zzso layers added with 10 zzso zzso was more effective in promoting zzso growth of human skin zzso zzso or stem cells than the conventional medium without zzso The clone initial day in cells treated with 10 zzso zzso came 2 d earlier with higher colony formation zzso The skin zzso zzso cells treated with 10 zzso zzso formed clones that were zzso smaller in size, longer in sustained zzso shorter in clone doubling time, higher in zzso cells percentage, and lower in levels of differentiation markers such as zzso along with higher levels of zzso markers such as zzso zzso and zzso than those cultured in the conventional zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso zzso pathways inhibitor zzso can be used as a culture medium additive that helps to achieve more effective ex zzso expansion of skin zzso zzso zzso
