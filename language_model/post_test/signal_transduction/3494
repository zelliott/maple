During zzso induction of zzso zzso is crucial to ensure proper energy zzso Such induction is zzso in type 2 diabetes, resulting in the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso adaptation during zzso is zzso predominantly by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in concert with various other zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain 2) interacts with many of these zzso the role of this protein in the regulation of zzso zzso was previously zzso Here we show that zzso is required for the regulation of zzso zzso through zzso The abundance of zzso was increased in the zzso of mice by zzso and in cultured zzso by zzso zzso A zzso zzso and the amount of zzso in liver was higher in mice with type 2 diabetes than in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by blocking its interaction with the zzso general control of zzso acid synthesis zzso 2 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in an increase in its zzso zzso activity and an increased expression of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was disrupted by insulin in a manner that was dependent on zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso functions as a zzso of zzso and insulin signaling in the regulation of zzso activity that is associated with the zzso control of zzso and that this function is zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We also found that loss of zzso zzso function suppresses zzso in diabetic mice, suggesting it as a therapeutic target for zzso
