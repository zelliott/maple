Natural helper zzso cells, a member of zzso group 2 innate zzso cell zzso are characterized by the expression of zzso factors zzso and zzso and production of large amounts of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso stimulation or a combination of zzso and zzso We have studied the signal zzso pathways critical for the zzso expression and development of zzso zzso Either stimulation with zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso cells, and the zzso form of zzso bound to the zzso and zzso zzso All these events were blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso also blocked zzso zzso The mature zzso cells lacking zzso were impaired in the proliferation and production of zzso and zzso but not zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso are critical for the proliferation and production of zzso and zzso and that the mechanisms downstream of zzso differ between zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso cells lacking zzso showed no impairment in the proliferation and zzso production, indicating that zzso but not zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso functions of mature zzso zzso However, deletion of either zzso or zzso in zzso stem cells severely blocked the development into zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the important roles of zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso
