zzso drugs differ in their rank order of potency to produce analgesia versus other central nervous system zzso We propose that these differences are due to unique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibit different affinities for individual zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we have used zzso resonance zzso zzso a sensitive method that can provide direct information about zzso and zzso zzso and can detect zzso changes in zzso zzso A zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso was expressed in insect zzso cells, zzso and zzso using zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso was incorporated into a zzso zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso exhibit high affinity zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly however, these structurally different zzso zzso shifted the zzso zzso in opposite directions, indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding leads to different zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments also indicated that these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit slightly different affinities to an zzso G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), whereas they zzso differ in their ability to activate this G protein zzso
