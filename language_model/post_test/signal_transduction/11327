zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that are key zzso of the allergic inflammatory zzso The receptors for these three zzso consist of a zzso alpha zzso chain and a shared common beta zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso of these zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso degradation of the zzso but not the zzso zzso domain, resulting in termination of signal zzso and yielding a truncated zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso domain was also a prerequisite for zzso and zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso termination of signaling induced by one zzso zzso resulted in cellular zzso to signal zzso by subsequent stimulation with another zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence for zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso domain, and they establish a novel mechanism for zzso zzso of shared zzso zzso zzso
