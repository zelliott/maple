zzso zzso zzso zzso differ zzso in their responses to mechanical stress including the ability to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso into the cellular events induced by mechanical stress on zzso zzso have shown that an early cellular response is a significant and rapid synthesis of zzso zzso This burst of radical production zzso displays a zzso zzso pattern over time with zzso of generation at 2 and 5 zzso A zzso consequence of the generation of these free zzso is elevated levels of zzso modified zzso zzso Both radical generation and protein modification vary between zzso but both are directly zzso to the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts of mechanically stressed zzso zzso fragments, and zzso products generated from cell walls are able to induce zzso generation in zzso zzso indicating the participation of a biologically active factor that zzso a further a phase of radical zzso
