After zzso zzso from pancreatic cancer zzso tissue of diabetic patients, we verified whether this zzso alters PC cell growth and invasion and/or insulin release and zzso zzso of insulin zzso cells and/or insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso cell growth, and invasion were assessed in the absence or presence of 50, zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line) culture zzso insulin and zzso were measured at 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, and zzso and zzso zzso were monitored zzso for zzso Five hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth only and dose zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso Five hundred zzso zzso induced a rapid insulin release and enhanced zzso zzso zzso after both one zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso in zzso culture medium significantly decreased with respect to control cells zzso zzso zzso did not counteract insulin induced zzso of the insulin zzso zzso and zzso but it independently activated zzso and zzso signaling in PC zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts a mild effect on PC cell growth, while it reduces PC cell invasion, possibly by zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso and insulin release, probably by inducing zzso influx from the zzso space, but it does not interfere with insulin zzso
