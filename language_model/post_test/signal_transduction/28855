Both the zzso growth factor zzso and the vascular zzso growth factor zzso pathways are associated with zzso cancer, and therapeutic approaches targeting either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso signaling have recently been approved for patients with advanced zzso zzso The zzso mouse is a zzso in zzso model of zzso zzso and animals with this genetic zzso develop zzso zzso zzso from approximately 6 weeks of zzso Previous work in the zzso mouse has shown that therapeutic approaches targeting either zzso or zzso signaling affect predominantly the size or number of zzso zzso In this study, we have assessed the effect of zzso both these key pathways simultaneously using zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso To assess the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso disease, treatment was initiated in 6- and zzso zzso mice for 28 zzso zzso markedly reduced both the number and the size of zzso when administered at either an early or a later stage of zzso zzso This reduction in both zzso number and size resulted in a total reduction in tumor burden in the small zzso of nearly zzso in both studies zzso zzso zzso The current data build on the concept that zzso tumor cell proliferation and zzso zzso and survival are distinct key mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso zzso of both signaling pathways has significant zzso effects at both early and late stages of zzso zzso zzso targeting both zzso and zzso signaling may be a beneficial strategy in early zzso zzso
