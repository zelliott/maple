zzso zzso zzso responses of smooth muscle were studied in zzso in guinea-pig small zzso Application of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso evoked a small initial relaxation followed by a marked zzso response in zzso zzso smooth muscle preparations from small zzso The extent of the zzso zzso response was zzso and the response was blocked by zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso contraction and the remaining part was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso in addition to the classical direct smooth muscle relaxing effect, causes zzso of zzso zzso via a zzso utilizing soluble zzso zzso which leads to a smooth muscle zzso
