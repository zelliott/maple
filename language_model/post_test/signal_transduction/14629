Only a subset of zzso stage zzso in the zzso zzso is competent to contribute cells to the zzso zzso vegetal zzso do not form zzso even when provided with zzso factors or transplanted to the most zzso position of the zzso These results suggest that zzso maternal factors in the vegetal region repress the ability of zzso to form zzso zzso we provide three lines of evidence that two zzso maternal factors zzso zzso which are known to promote zzso zzso zzso regulate which cells are competent to express anterior neural and retinal zzso First, both molecules can repress the ability of zzso zzso zzso to form zzso converting the lineage from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Second, reducing the zzso levels of either factor in zzso zzso zzso expands expression of zzso genes and zzso the zzso The zzso repression of zzso fates by zzso and zzso is likely zzso by zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso and zzso likely exert their effects on zzso fates through at least partially independent pathways because zzso can reverse the effects of zzso and zzso but not those of zzso or zzso Third, reduction of zzso zzso and/or zzso in zzso vegetal zzso can induce a neural fate, but only allows expression of a retinal fate when both zzso and zzso signaling pathways are zzso zzso
