During early stationary phase, zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso and zzso and then degrades it during late stationary zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of this strain successively zzso zzso from the zzso end, to yield both zzso and zzso This zzso was specifically zzso during the stationary phase through zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso gene by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso into zzso Da fragments, but not any further, indicating that the capsule zzso is first internally zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso into zzso Da zzso then zzso into zzso via zzso Due to its inability to generate the zzso from the zzso the zzso zzso zzso more frequently than the zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso has a powerful zzso zzso activity that zzso in capsule zzso degradation to supply zzso cells with constituent zzso
