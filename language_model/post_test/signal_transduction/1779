zzso cells zzso are a target in zzso and the death of zzso is regulated by various zzso Although intravenous zzso zzso preparations are known to be beneficial therapeutic agents for the treatment of zzso diseases and systemic inflammatory disorders, their mechanism of action have not yet been completely zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible role of zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrate zzso that zzso induced the zzso of human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, using a proportion of cells with zzso DNA, DNA zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso expression of zzso proteins of the zzso family zzso and zzso while zzso increased the zzso expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased the zzso production of zzso oxygen species and decreased the zzso membrane potential zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The present results show a novel action in which zzso can induce the zzso of zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the clinical use of zzso preparations may thereby regulate the cell death of activated zzso in zzso
