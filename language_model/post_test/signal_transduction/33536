zzso center zzso B cells undergo zzso zzso class switch zzso and rapid zzso expansion to produce zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso because it can repress DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso B and T cells can make transient direct physical zzso T cells were observed to be associated with dead zzso zzso We thus hypothesized that one function of zzso signaling from T cells within this zzso could be to zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling rapidly zzso the ability of zzso to recruit the zzso zzso complex by excluding it from the nucleus, leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso and zzso of zzso target zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to emulate transient zzso contact permitted zzso target gene zzso levels to return to their zzso levels, demonstrating that this is a zzso process, which could allow zzso that pass quality control to either continue proliferation or undergo terminal zzso These data suggest that transient zzso signaling in the zzso might allow T cells to weed out heavily damaged zzso while at the same time promoting survival of intact B cells, which could undergo differentiation or additional rounds of zzso
