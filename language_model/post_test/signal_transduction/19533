zzso acting through zzso receptors reduces anxiety and stress sensitivity in zzso In zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, however, zzso zzso is altered only in a zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether stress causes a delayed change in the zzso zzso of female zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was assessed with the elevated zzso zzso test and zzso zzso with the forced swim test zzso These zzso tests were also used as experimental stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not differ between zzso control and zzso zzso One week after the zzso locomotion was reduced in control animals but unchanged in zzso mice, whereas zzso zzso remained zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical in zzso control and zzso mice but, 1 week after the zzso test, was attenuated in zzso mice relative to control zzso Our data show that zzso female zzso mice do not zzso differ from female control animals in their locomotor and zzso zzso Exposure to the stress associated with zzso testing, however, leads to delayed zzso differences in locomotion and zzso zzso These findings attest to a role of zzso zzso zzso in the control of stress coping and/or zzso
