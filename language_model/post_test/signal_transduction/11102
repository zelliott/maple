zzso zzso is the major cause of zzso pneumonia and one of the most common causes of death by infectious disease in zzso zzso Little is known concerning the mechanisms of target cell zzso in this zzso The present study shows that zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways contribute to zzso synthesis by lung zzso cells in response to zzso In infected lungs of mice zzso stimulate expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, as well as activate zzso zzso Human zzso zzso was chosen as a cellular model, because it establishes the first barrier against zzso and little is known about its function in innate zzso zzso infection zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso factor as well as zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso and zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso In mouse lungs in zzso as well as in cultured cells, zzso activate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by chemical zzso or by zzso interference targeting zzso reduces zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso activity did not affect zzso nuclear zzso and recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso but did reduce the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and inhibited zzso recruitment of zzso zzso II to zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso by modulating zzso zzso zzso
