Previously it has been reported that neural stem cells undergoing zzso stress have increased levels of zzso precursor protein zzso and increased zzso expression results in zzso zzso zzso activity was also shown to be required for zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that is expressed early during zzso The binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso expression of novel zzso factor zzso protein zzso zzso expression subsequently leads to cell zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso factors have the ability to induce neural zzso zzso we investigated if zzso expression leads to differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expression increased zzso zzso acid protein zzso expression and also caused distinct zzso changes, both indicative of zzso zzso Similar results were observed with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression decreased in response to zzso Instead, we found zzso activity regulates expression of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso signaling pathways significantly reduced zzso effect on zzso and zzso These data demonstrates the role zzso has in zzso differentiation of zzso cells through zzso zzso It is possible that increased zzso expression after zzso injury could play a role in zzso production, possibly promoting zzso zzso at injured zzso
