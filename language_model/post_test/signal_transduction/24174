We previously reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso generates zzso signals and stimulates zzso zzso in the zzso small cell lung zzso zzso cell zzso The current study was undertaken to determine the frequency of functional zzso expression among different zzso cell lines, and to test the ability of zzso to generate zzso signals in different zzso cell zzso The potential role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was also zzso Exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso robust zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso dye zzso in three zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso modest zzso zzso in one zzso cell line zzso and no zzso zzso zzso in two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso cell lines responding to zzso zzso with zzso for four hours significantly zzso zzso zzso in three of the four zzso cell lines expressing functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but does not significantly alter zzso zzso in the other zzso cell lines zzso These results indicate that zzso cell lines often express functional zzso which elicit zzso signals when zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso active zzso or dominant negative zzso zzso to green fluorescent protein zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso active zzso exhibit increased zzso zzso in comparison to cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso active zzso but not zzso or zzso accumulates at zzso junctions in zzso zzso These results indicate that activated zzso increases zzso zzso zzso consistent with the possibility that zzso zzso contributes to increased zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso may play a significant role in regulating the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso The demonstration by other investigators that zzso is expressed by a variety of cells in the airways supports the possibility that zzso may activate zzso expressed by zzso cells in primary zzso
