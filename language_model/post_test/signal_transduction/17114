zzso zzso electrical stimulation zzso has been used as an endurance exercise zzso This study aimed to test whether zzso zzso increases the zzso of anabolic signaling molecules and zzso skeletal muscle zzso as seen with zzso zzso Using zzso rats, 1 bout of exercise (with dissection done immediately zzso and 3 h zzso after zzso and another 6 sessions of training were zzso All experimental groups consisted of zzso and zzso stimulation zzso 100 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to investigate type II fiber zzso and western zzso analysis zzso was conducted to examine whether zzso leads to anabolic zzso zzso At first, we examined the acute effect of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso depletion occurred in both type I and type II zzso zzso results demonstrated that zzso zzso was significantly increased by zzso but there was no significant difference with zzso In contrast, zzso 1/2 zzso was increased by zzso at zzso In the zzso training, the wet weight and zzso protein were significantly increased by both zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso has a similar anabolic effect for skeletal muscle zzso as zzso but the zzso signaling zzso might zzso
