In most animals, longevity is achieved at the expense of zzso but queen honey bees do not show this zzso Queens are both zzso and zzso whereas workers, derived from the same zzso are both relatively short-lived and normally zzso It has been suggested, on the basis of results from workers, that zzso zzso best known as a zzso protein zzso in the abdominal fat body, acts as an zzso to promote longevity in queen zzso We explored this hypothesis, as well as related roles of zzso signaling and juvenile zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and head fat body cells in an zzso manner, with old queens showing much higher expression than zzso In contrast, zzso expression in worker head was much zzso Queens also were more resistant to zzso stress than zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso differences in zzso expression are involved in queen zzso zzso with predictions from zzso old queens had lower head expression of zzso zzso and its putative receptors than did old zzso Juvenile hormone affected the expression of zzso and zzso signaling genes in opposite zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso mechanisms interact to regulate queen bee longevity without sacrificing zzso
