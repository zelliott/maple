The biological clock regulates a wide range of zzso processes in zzso Here we show zzso variation of the zzso zzso responses to electrical zzso The biologically closed zzso circuits in the leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso which regulate its zzso were analyzed in zzso using the charge stimulation zzso The zzso was provided with different zzso and electrical zzso Resistance between zzso zzso in the leaf of zzso zzso was higher at night than during the day or the following day in the zzso The biologically closed electrical circuits with zzso gated zzso channels in zzso zzso are activated the next day, even in the zzso zzso zzso zzso daytime and zzso At continuous light, zzso zzso recognizes nighttime and increases the input resistance to the nighttime value even under zzso These results show that the zzso clock can be maintained zzso and has zzso zzso which can activate zzso gated zzso channels in biologically closed zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gated channels depends on the applied zzso electrical charge and speed of transmission of electrical energy from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We present the equivalent electrical circuits in zzso zzso and its zzso variation to explain the experimental zzso
