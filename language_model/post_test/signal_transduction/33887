zzso zzso is a key protein responsible for skeletal muscle growth and development, thus zzso in the zzso gene can have major economic and breeding zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate myostatin gene expression and zzso profile in skeletal muscle of zzso zzso bulls carrying a zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene zzso zzso at position zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed significantly lower zzso expression in muscle of bulls with the zzso zzso as compared to zzso and zzso zzso The direct comparison of skeletal muscle zzso profiles between the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso resulted in identification of zzso of which at least some can be putative targets for zzso Using zzso zzso we identified 43 common genes (including zzso with significantly different expression in skeletal muscle of bulls with the zzso zzso as compared to zzso and zzso zzso 15 of which were zzso and 28 were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of molecular function of zzso expressed genes revealed the highest number of genes involved in the expression of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso factors zzso The biological functions of the largest number of genes zzso protein metabolism and modification zzso signal zzso zzso cell structure zzso and zzso processes zzso The main identified signaling pathways were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nicotine zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso We identified previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso components of the zzso complex zzso zzso and proteins with some other molecular function in skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
