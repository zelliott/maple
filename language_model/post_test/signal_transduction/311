The question of whether zzso responses to zzso zzso require B cell intrinsic signaling via the main zzso zzso zzso has become embroiled in zzso In part this may be related to the methods used to analyze B cell intrinsic zzso We have used a mixed bone zzso zzso model to generate mice in which the B cell compartment is completely deficient in zzso zzso while the other zzso lineages are largely zzso These mice were zzso with zzso zzso or infected with zzso We found that the zzso zzso primary response was absolutely dependent on zzso signaling to B cells, while other zzso classes were not zzso and zzso or much less so zzso zzso The zzso zzso mice exhibited an impairment of development of zzso zzso T cells, a likely zzso factor in the lack of zzso We also found that B cell intrinsic zzso signals are required for the production of natural zzso The data emphasize the zzso role of B cells as programmers of T cell differentiation in zzso
