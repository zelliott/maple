Although the agents responsible for production of zzso have not yet been clearly identified, the author reviews the molecular mechanisms involved in development of zzso mainly based on the experimental data in a canine zzso zzso 

The blood products after zzso zzso most likely stimulate many cell membrane zzso such as G zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso to activate the zzso zzso zzso of the vascular smooth muscle zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is associated with continuous zzso of zzso zzso levels and zzso of zzso the former may result mainly not from zzso release but from zzso influx from outside the zzso The increased zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso to zzso zzso light chain continuously during zzso A topical application of zzso zzso zzso acid, or various zzso zzso channel zzso likely zzso reversal of zzso as a result of a decrease in zzso zzso zzso The blood products also activate the zzso zzso zzso during zzso most likely via G zzso zzso and the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso at its zzso zzso to induce zzso development of zzso The enhanced generation of zzso acid during zzso may also contribute to zzso of zzso zzso at least in part, through the zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso in zzso can also be inhibited by activated protein zzso C independently of the zzso zzso pathway, but the zzso may play a minor and transient role in zzso zzso The protein levels of thin zzso zzso zzso and zzso are progressively decreased in vasospasm, whereas their zzso levels are zzso Both changes probably contribute to the enhancement of smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso proteins appear to be zzso in zzso by zzso with activated zzso suggesting that the zzso devices responsible for zzso contraction are severely zzso in zzso 

It remains to be determined the extent to which zzso and zzso zzso regulations, zzso and zzso of thin zzso zzso and degradation of zzso and zzso proteins are involved in the development of zzso
