Two types of rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified and shown previously to exhibit similar binding and zzso signaling activity via the zzso zzso zzso Since mouse zzso exhibits zzso (or zzso or zzso signaling activity, we compared zzso signaling by zzso and zzso zzso signaling was measured as zzso reporter gene induction via different zzso zzso We found that zzso exhibited higher zzso signaling activity than zzso via pathways zzso by zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was directly dependent on the level of zzso expression and was inhibited by zzso a specific inverse zzso of zzso zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso exhibit distinct zzso zzso in the zzso it is possible that zzso zzso signaling is more important in zzso in which zzso is expressed and less important in zzso in which zzso is zzso
