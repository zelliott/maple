In cultured rat zzso zzso zzso elevated the zzso activity of zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso through zzso when the zzso were incubated in zzso zzso and this response was blocked by specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso the transient zzso of protein zzso C zzso from the zzso to the membrane zzso This effect was not blocked by zzso zzso zzso but was partially blocked by zzso zzso or zzso produced a similar effect on the zzso of zzso In the experiments with zzso cells, the zzso of zzso protein 2 and zzso I, as well as zzso of zzso zzso II, were found to be zzso by exposure to zzso These results suggest that zzso can activate zzso zzso II through the zzso zzso zzso which in turn increases the zzso of zzso protein 2 and zzso zzso zzso was activated through the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
