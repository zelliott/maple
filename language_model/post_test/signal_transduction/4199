To explore the zzso by which the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso we have studied the function of various zzso zzso in B cells made zzso deficient by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso and zzso C zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso release, and zzso zzso A possible explanation for this requirement was provided by findings that recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta requires both zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in which the putative zzso site zzso of zzso was changed to zzso was also defective in signal zzso however, this zzso did not affect recruitment to the zzso zzso family zzso zzso motifs zzso These findings not only confirm that both zzso zzso are necessary for zzso binding to zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta but indicate that this binding is necessary for zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso This sequence of events is apparently required for zzso the zzso to most cellular protein zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso of zzso 2, and to zzso zzso
