zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis enables zzso of the zzso locations of protein interactions in living zzso Using fragments of different fluorescent zzso we investigated the zzso resolution and the quantitative accuracy of zzso zzso We determined the zzso of zzso complex formation in response to the zzso interaction between the zzso binding protein zzso and the zzso binding domain zzso zzso of yellow fluorescent protein fused to zzso and zzso produced zzso zzso complex zzso 10 zzso after the addition of zzso and a zzso increase in the mean zzso intensity in 8 zzso The zzso zzso of the Venus fluorescent protein fused to zzso produced zzso zzso complexes with several zzso fragments fused to zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing zzso from Venus and yellow fluorescent protein produced either zzso or zzso zzso complexes depending on the temperature at which the cells were zzso The zzso of zzso required for zzso induction of zzso complex formation by all fluorescent protein fragments tested were consistent with the affinities of the zzso for unmodified zzso and zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor of zzso interaction prevented the formation of zzso complexes by zzso and zzso zzso but did not disrupt existing zzso zzso zzso zzso before the addition of zzso formed zzso complexes with the same efficiency as did newly zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis attenuated zzso complex formation independent of their effects on fusion protein zzso The zzso at which they inhibited zzso complex formation suggests that they prevented association of the fluorescent protein fragments, but not the slow maturation of zzso complex zzso Agents that induce the unfolded protein response also reduced formation of zzso zzso The effects of these agents were suppressed by cellular adaptation to protein folding zzso In zzso zzso analysis enables detection of protein interactions within minutes after complex formation in living cells, but does not allow detection of complex zzso zzso zzso complex formation depends on the folding efficiencies of fluorescent protein fragments and can be affected by the cellular protein folding zzso
