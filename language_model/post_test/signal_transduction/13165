zzso express multiple G zzso receptors that are simultaneously or zzso activated by zzso The consequences of zzso one zzso on signaling and trafficking of another zzso are zzso We examined the effects of selective zzso of the zzso 1 zzso zzso on signaling and trafficking of the zzso and vice zzso Selective zzso of zzso and zzso induced membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso negative zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso Whereas an zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso with zzso in the same zzso thereby depleting them from the zzso zzso did not prominently zzso with the activated zzso and rapidly returned to the zzso In cells zzso both zzso prior zzso of the zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso which was zzso reversed by zzso of zzso Similar results were obtained in enteric zzso that naturally zzso the zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso did not affect zzso zzso or zzso Thus, the zzso and prolonged interaction of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and limits their role in zzso and zzso of the zzso Because zzso are critical for zzso zzso and zzso signaling of many zzso this zzso is likely to have important and widespread zzso
