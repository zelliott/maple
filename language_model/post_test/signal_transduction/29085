zzso signaling pathways regulate numerous processes in zzso cells, including migration, zzso and zzso The regulatory zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two distinct classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso the type I and II zzso Although numerous zzso functions have been identified for type I zzso little is known about the functions and regulation of type II zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we identified an interaction between the type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain zzso a nuclear zzso protein that recruits zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact and zzso at nuclear zzso in zzso cells, and zzso mediates the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Additionally, stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso activity of zzso toward multiple zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso increases the cellular content of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may stimulate zzso activity through a zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso that generate zzso dramatically zzso zzso activity and was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, these data define a novel mechanism zzso the zzso zzso leads to stimulation of zzso zzso zzso activity and also zzso zzso as a key regulator of this signaling zzso through its association with the zzso zzso
