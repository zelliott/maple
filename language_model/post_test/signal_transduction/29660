zzso zzso is an zzso zzso cell interaction zzso the role of which in controlling cell fate choices has been studied zzso Recent studies in both zzso and zzso revealed additional functions of zzso in proliferation and zzso zzso We provide evidence for an essential role of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso cell movements required for the formation of the zzso zzso organ in the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso zzso occurs in two rows of boundary cells in the zzso zzso The boundary cells zzso a population of zzso zzso cells that zzso into the zzso zzso layer during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires the expression of its zzso Delta in the zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the boundary zzso We further show that the movement of the zzso cells is dependent on the short stop gene that encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and is a zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso short stop is zzso activated in response to the zzso zzso zzso in boundary cells and we demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity depend on short stop zzso Our results provide a novel link between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso controlling cell movement during the development of zzso zzso
