zzso of zzso by zzso cells is critical for the induction of peripheral zzso As zzso zzso the entry of zzso into the zzso pathway, we sought to prevent the development of zzso diabetes by inducing pancreatic beta cell zzso before disease zzso zzso young zzso diabetic zzso mice injected with a single low dose of zzso zzso a drug zzso for beta cells, exhibited impaired T cell responses to zzso zzso and were protected from spontaneous zzso Furthermore, beta cell zzso was necessary for protection since zzso did not protect zzso transgenic zzso mice in which beta cells expressed the zzso inhibitor zzso Our results support a model in which zzso of pancreatic beta cells zzso the development of regulatory cells leading to the zzso of zzso T cells and protection from zzso
