zzso are zzso cells in the central nervous system zzso that play key roles in brain zzso controlling zzso such as zzso brain energy metabolism and synaptic zzso Recently, immune functions have also been demonstrated in zzso influencing zzso survival in the course of zzso zzso In this regard, zzso zzso is a protein zzso with an outstanding role in zzso Our previous findings indicating that zzso regulates zzso calcium channels as well as zzso zzso imply that this zzso controls multiple zzso pathways within zzso including those implicated in zzso of immune zzso The present study applies zzso to investigate new protein targets of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cultures infected with an zzso that expresses zzso active zzso were compared with infection zzso zzso gel zzso clearly detected zzso spots in cultured zzso and analysis of differential protein expression revealed 18 spots regulated by zzso zzso identification by mass zzso zzso showed that zzso targets molecules with zzso functions, including zzso zzso components and proteins implicated in metabolism and zzso These results support the notion that zzso is involved in zzso zzso also suggesting that multiple zzso processes are regulated by zzso including those associated to zzso
