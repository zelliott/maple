Recent information from several laboratories suggest that power frequency fields may stimulate cell differentiation in a number of model zzso In this way, they may be similar to zzso electromagnetic fields, which have been used zzso However, the effects of power frequency fields on zzso or zzso expression have not been zzso This study describes the ability of power frequency fields to accelerate cell differentiation in zzso and describes dose relationships in terms of both zzso and exposure zzso No change in proliferation or cell content were zzso A clear dose relationship, in terms of both zzso and duration of exposure, was determined with the zzso biological response occurring at zzso zzso and 7-9 zzso Because this study was designed to explore biological activity at environmental exposure levels, this exposure range does not necessarily define optimal dosing conditions from the therapeutic point of zzso This study reports the stimulation by power frequency fields of transforming growth zzso an important zzso zzso known to regulate cell zzso The hypothesis is raised that the stimulation of regulatory zzso by electromagnetic fields may be an zzso mechanism by which these fields have their biological zzso
