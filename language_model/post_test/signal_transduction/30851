To test the hypothesis that zzso supplementation would enhance the anabolic responses of muscle cell signaling and gene expression to exercise, we studied nine subjects who received either zzso or a zzso zzso for 5 days in a zzso fashion before undergoing muscle zzso at rest, immediately after exercise (10 zzso 10 repetitions of zzso extension at zzso 1 repetition zzso and 24 and 72 h later (all in the morning after zzso zzso zzso supplementation decreased the zzso state of protein zzso B zzso on zzso at rest by zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso initiation factor zzso protein on zzso zzso by zzso 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso for collagen 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain I at rest by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso immediately after exercise by zzso (all P zzso zzso Immediately after exercise, and independent of zzso zzso for muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso were zzso zzso P zzso zzso the zzso state of zzso both in the zzso and nucleus were increased zzso and zzso zzso both P zzso zzso zzso the zzso states of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased by 50% and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso hours zzso zzso myostatin, and zzso zzso expression decreased below zzso values zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso increased zzso 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and at no other zzso In conclusion, 5 days of zzso supplementation do not enhance anabolic signaling but increase the expression of certain targeted zzso
