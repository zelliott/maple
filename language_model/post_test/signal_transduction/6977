zzso dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease zzso The underlying mechanisms and strategies to repair it remain zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time the direct consequences and potential mechanisms of zzso functional defects associated with abnormal zzso dynamics in zzso Using zzso hybrid zzso zzso with incorporated zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso human subjects into zzso DNA zzso zzso cells, we observed that zzso zzso cells had significant changes in zzso and zzso such changes associate with altered expression and distribution of zzso protein zzso and zzso 2 zzso Treatment with zzso protects against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso zzso and function but also restores the zzso zzso and fusion zzso These effects suggest a role of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and fusion zzso Further, blockade of the zzso zzso protein zzso by a genetic manipulation with a dominant negative zzso zzso its expression with zzso or zzso of zzso division with zzso zzso zzso functional defects observed in zzso zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into zzso dysfunction resulting from changes in the zzso zzso machinery and signaling zzso The protective effect of zzso and zzso of zzso signaling on maintenance of normal zzso structure and function holds promise as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for zzso
