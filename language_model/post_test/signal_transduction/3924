Nuclear protein import requires a nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso and at least three other zzso zzso The alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cohort 1 zzso enters the nucleus, probably in a complex with the beta zzso of the zzso as well as other import factors and the import zzso To learn more about which factors and/or events end the import reaction and how the import factors return to the zzso we have studied zzso shuttling of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso or zzso cells was found primarily in the zzso zzso injected into the nucleus was rapidly exported in a zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso of zzso lacking the first 243 zzso accumulated in the zzso of zzso cells after zzso zzso After nuclear injection, the truncated zzso was retained in the nucleus, but either zzso zzso zzso or a zzso nuclear export zzso but not a zzso form of zzso zzso restored nuclear zzso Loss of the nuclear transport factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso temperature in the zzso zzso cell line zzso caused nuclear zzso of zzso zzso injected into the zzso However, free zzso injected into zzso of zzso cells at the zzso temperature was zzso These results suggested that zzso acts at an earlier step in zzso recycling, possibly the zzso of an import complex that contains zzso and the import zzso zzso with this possibility, incubation of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and import zzso prevented assembly of zzso complexes or zzso their zzso
