The present study investigated the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso growth factor zzso stimulation of zzso transport zzso in the rabbit zzso convoluted zzso zzso zzso zzso M, bath and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, blocked the zzso effect on zzso consistent with a role for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Both zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C, blocked the zzso stimulation of zzso indicating that protein zzso C is involved in zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso were measured in zzso zzso using zzso zzso to determine whether changes in zzso were also part of the signaling zzso After addition of 3 zzso zzso there was no change in zzso suggesting that stimulation of protein zzso C is not from zzso zzso by zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso is involved, the inhibitor zzso was zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso had no direct effect on zzso transport but blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso activity, assessed as free zzso acid release from zzso zzso in suspension, increased by zzso with 3 zzso zzso Thus the stimulation of zzso by zzso is zzso via a zzso zzso involving zzso zzso protein zzso C, and zzso
