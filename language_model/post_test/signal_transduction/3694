The beta and gamma zzso of the zzso G proteins remain tightly associated throughout the signaling cycle as the zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso A zzso structure involving zzso segments at the N zzso of the beta and gamma zzso contributes to the zzso interface and has been implicated in zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was performed to examine the effect of point zzso on zzso assembly and zzso signaling in zzso cell zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso described zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were found to block zzso association, as evidenced by the failure of the zzso zzso to undergo zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Although none of 14 zzso point zzso prevented the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, the zzso point zzso enhanced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso These findings zzso the zzso region of zzso in zzso zzso provide further evidence that the structural features of the zzso complex zzso zzso regulation may differ among zzso and identify single zzso in the zzso beta zzso where zzso might yield a zzso of defective signal zzso
