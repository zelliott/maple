The adapter protein zzso is required for T cell development and zzso signal zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso cells, yet zzso populations of zzso cells develop normally in zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso upon cellular zzso through studies of zzso function in zzso zzso This study presents evidence that zzso populations in both zzso and liver of zzso mice remain zzso Natural zzso responses of zzso zzso proceed in a manner comparable to those of zzso control zzso Similar to controls, zzso zzso exhibit enhanced survival and zzso zzso capacity after in zzso culture with zzso zzso zzso zzso also retain normal zzso cellular zzso and the ability to zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso These results indicate that, unlike events zzso by zzso engagement, signaling zzso engaged by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso (which mediates zzso cellular zzso and by natural zzso receptors on zzso zzso cells can occur independently of zzso
