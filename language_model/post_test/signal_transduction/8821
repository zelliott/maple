zzso hormone zzso is the major regulator of zzso but other factors zzso its action, including members of the transforming growth factor zzso beta zzso The intersection of signal zzso pathways that integrate the zzso response to zzso remains to be zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso a critical zzso zzso the zzso zzso family zzso in zzso development and the expression of zzso zzso We found that zzso stimulation could not induce normal zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could not stimulate early zzso growth in zzso mice in in zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso animals had reduced cell division rates following zzso treatment compared with zzso cells derived from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Whole zzso and isolated zzso cells from zzso animals had lower zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso hormone treatment of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not increase these zzso in zzso zzso zzso When zzso was introduced into zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso responsiveness was zzso and zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with a zzso zzso binding element in the zzso promoter, and zzso can activate promoter zzso containing this zzso zzso these observations establish an essential role for zzso in regulating the response of zzso zzso to zzso
