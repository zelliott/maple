zzso growth factor zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in at least zzso of breast zzso This high expression zzso with a poor prognosis in patients with breast zzso Experimental and clinical findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso pathway, play a zzso role in the development of zzso resistance in breast zzso Recent zzso and clinical evidence shows that zzso of growth factor signaling pathways suppresses the growth of zzso cells without serious zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso enhances the zzso effect of zzso therapy, a promising signal zzso inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to human breast cancer zzso Our experimental results have revealed that zzso zzso enhances the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells under zzso zzso An additive increase in the protein expression level of a zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a key role of this additive zzso zzso The rationale and future perspectives of the combined use of zzso with zzso therapy in breast cancer are zzso
