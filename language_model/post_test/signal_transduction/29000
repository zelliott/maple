The steroid hormone zzso regulates the normal function and development of the zzso nervous zzso Many of zzso effects are zzso via the nuclear hormone zzso receptors zzso and zzso In addition to regulating zzso gene zzso zzso also acts in an immediate and zzso fashion to regulate various zzso signal zzso zzso The goal of this review is to develop a contextual framework to understand the generalized function of zzso during development of brain regions not known to be sexually zzso However, it is first important to build this framework on the more well-developed foundation of zzso zzso zzso zzso As a result, a discussion of known and proposed mechanisms of zzso actions in zzso and other zzso will be zzso Building upon this information, a review of our research group's recent in zzso and in zzso studies that have focused on zzso the mechanisms of zzso actions in zzso of the zzso specialized zzso will be zzso While the full spectrum of zzso action during normal zzso development remains zzso results of recent studies have revealed a zzso role for zzso and zzso receptors in zzso common pediatric brain tumors that arise from zzso zzso zzso zzso The potential use of zzso signaling agents as zzso therapy for zzso is proposed based on those zzso
