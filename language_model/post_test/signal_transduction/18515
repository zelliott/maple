zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso is common in aggressive breast tumors and zzso with poor zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso breast zzso progression remain incompletely zzso To examine the role of the signaling and zzso zzso beta 4 zzso during zzso zzso we introduced a targeted deletion of the beta 4 signaling domain into a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso Loss of beta 4 signaling suppresses zzso tumor onset and invasive zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that beta 4 forms a complex with zzso and enhances zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso contributes to disruption of zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is required for zzso Finally, deletion of the beta 4 signaling domain enhances the efficacy of zzso zzso These results indicate that beta 4 zzso promotes tumor progression by amplifying zzso signaling and identify beta 4 as a potential target for molecular therapy of breast zzso
