The neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso elicits a wide array of zzso effects by binding to several zzso zzso The zzso family of receptors belongs to a large group of zzso zzso receptors and includes three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are linked to zzso C, promoting the zzso of membrane zzso and a subsequent increase in the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that transcripts zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso editing events in which zzso zzso zzso zzso are converted to zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of complementary DNA zzso from dissected brain regions have indicated the zzso expression of seven major zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alters the zzso coding potential of the predicted second zzso loop of the zzso and can lead to a zzso reduction in the efficacy of the interaction between receptors and their G zzso These observations indicate that zzso editing is a new mechanism for regulating zzso signal zzso and suggest that this zzso modification may be critical for modulating the different cellular functions that are zzso by other members of the zzso zzso zzso
