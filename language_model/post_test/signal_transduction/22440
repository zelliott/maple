cardiac dysfunction is a critical manifestation of severe zzso shock and is responsible for high mortality due to zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso factors have a protective effect on zzso organ zzso Heat shock protein zzso zzso is a newly discovered gene that is essential for zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso would induce protection against zzso cardiac zzso 

to evaluate this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice zzso the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso served as zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso and cardiac function was measured after 6 zzso zzso treatment caused cardiac dysfunction in zzso zzso In contrast, cardiac function was significantly preserved in zzso mice following zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso of zzso also prevented the zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso abolished the protection of zzso against zzso cardiac zzso 

these results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso cardiac dysfunction and that the mechanisms involve the preserved zzso of zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso
