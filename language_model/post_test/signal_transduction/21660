zzso regulation is a crucial feature in many biological systems, with zzso leading to zzso or zzso The recent discovery of counting factor zzso in zzso zzso will lead to a greater understanding of how the system regulates the size of a group of zzso In this paper we zzso model the known effects of zzso using two different models: a cellular zzso model and a discrete zzso hybrid zzso With the use of these models we are able to understand how zzso of zzso and zzso forces by zzso can facilitate stream zzso In addition, the zzso suggests a new possible mechanism for stream breakup involving the frequency of cell zzso
