What do zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso protein zzso C, zzso C, zzso and zzso protein have in common? These proteins are zzso that is, they bind zzso zzso to membrane zzso and this process regulates their zzso zzso functioning in zzso of signals generated in cell zzso are commonly regulated by zzso In this review, the strategies zzso by zzso proteins to bind to zzso and to regulate their membrane affinity are zzso The recently solved structures of binding pockets for specific lipids are zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Regulatory switches that control membrane affinity include zzso of the membrane zzso zzso and modification of the protein itself by zzso zzso zzso or zzso How does membrane binding zzso the zzso zzso Two mechanisms are zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso or downstream target, and zzso zzso of the protein by a zzso zzso This paper also addresses the issue of specificity in the cell membrane zzso for zzso
