The close zzso of zzso and zzso in bone and their interaction during bone development and zzso suggest that they may each regulate the other's growth and zzso In these studies, zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso with both direct and indirect zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was enhanced using soluble factors produced from the zzso and the differentiation level of the zzso influenced the differentiation level of the zzso In addition, the zzso regulated differentiation of the zzso zzso using soluble factors and direct zzso These data support the possibility of zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso in a variety of normal processes and further suggest that it may be necessary to account for this signaling in the zzso of complex zzso zzso cartilage and zzso zzso
