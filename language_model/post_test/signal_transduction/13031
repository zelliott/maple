Experimental evidence indicates that various zzso zzso zzso are altered in zzso zzso Among these, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso active in a significant percentage of human zzso zzso considerable effort has been directed at finding compounds that inhibit its zzso 

We review the recent progress in establishing novel approaches to interference with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by various novel agents zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed agents, zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso Some of the developed agents have been tested in clinical zzso promising results were zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by small molecular zzso has confirmed its involvement in zzso zzso Thus, molecular and/or pharmacological zzso of the components that are critically involved in the zzso zzso of this zzso are expected to improve the treatment of human zzso
