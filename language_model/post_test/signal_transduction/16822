An emerging view on zzso zzso zzso zzso considers zzso zzso zzso as a key factor in synaptic impairment and zzso spatial memory zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso we report that zzso an zzso zzso zzso protects from zzso and synaptic zzso induced by zzso zzso Interestingly, nicotine prevents both early zzso impairment and late zzso damage induced by zzso zzso through the zzso zzso signaling zzso On the other hand, a zzso between zzso and the zzso signaling zzso was revealed by the following facts: zzso nicotine zzso zzso in a zzso manner; zzso nicotine prevents zzso loss of zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter indicates that this zzso is a new zzso target zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that nicotine prevents memory deficits and synaptic impairment induced by zzso zzso In addition, nicotine improves memory in young zzso transgenic mice before extensive zzso deposition and senile plaque development, and also in old mice where senile plaques have already zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and its zzso with the zzso signaling zzso might well be therapeutic targets for potential zzso zzso
