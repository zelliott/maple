To understand the mechanism of the zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cultured rat cortical zzso subjected to zzso deprivation zzso and zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed by Western zzso An interaction between zzso and zzso was detected using zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso causes protein zzso B zzso zzso and protects primary cortical zzso from zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and form an zzso zzso stimulation zzso significant zzso zzso via a zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso this stimulation provides a zzso effect in cortical zzso zzso leads to sustained zzso of zzso regulated zzso 1 and 2 zzso in cortical zzso but only to transient zzso in zzso zzso zzso The response to the zzso zzso is zzso primarily through zzso zzso that is dependent on zzso toxin zzso zzso protein and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso effect in primary cortical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play pivotal roles in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
