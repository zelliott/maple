zzso is known to be critical in skin development and zzso however, how it triggers proliferation and inflammation in zzso remains to be zzso Here, we find that induced zzso expression in skin of transgenic mice zzso results in a zzso zzso coupled with inflammatory zzso In zzso zzso cells include zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso T zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type zzso zzso profiling of zzso skin revealed increased gene expression involved in inflammation and immune responses, including zzso zzso and zzso These genes were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in zzso mouse skin and human zzso zzso with zzso zzso Thus, our findings unveil a missing link connecting zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and type 2 zzso and zzso and host infiltrates during skin inflammation and zzso Our findings provide a missing link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of potential relevance to the zzso of zzso zzso
