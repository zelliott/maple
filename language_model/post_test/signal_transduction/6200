zzso growth factor zzso proteins are important regulators of zzso arch zzso zzso of zzso function in chick and mouse and zzso function in zzso have demonstrated a role for zzso in the differentiation and survival of zzso neural crest cells zzso that give rise to the zzso zzso Here we describe, in zzso an earlier, essential function for zzso and zzso in regulating the zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso form by the directed lateral migration of discrete clusters of zzso zzso In animals doubly reduced for zzso and zzso the migration of zzso zzso cells is zzso and zzso fail to zzso zzso and pharmacological experiments show that zzso and zzso are required in the neural zzso and zzso zzso during early zzso stages to promote first zzso zzso In addition, we show that animals doubly reduced for zzso and zzso have severe reductions in zzso zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso By examining early zzso and later cartilage zzso in individual animals zzso for zzso function, we find that zzso in zzso structure correlate with later cartilage zzso We present a model in which zzso signaling in the zzso and segmented zzso organizes the zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso Moreover, we argue that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso is critical for the later patterning of zzso zzso
