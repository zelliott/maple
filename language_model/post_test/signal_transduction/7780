zzso containing zzso zzso A structures exhibit reduced abilities to activate the human zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and function as potent zzso against zzso bearing zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso has emerged as a novel mechanism zzso by microbial pathogens to zzso host innate immune zzso zzso zzso zzso are prime therapeutic candidates for combating Gram negative bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso functionally antagonize zzso zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso Here, the molecular mechanism by which these zzso zzso act at zzso is zzso We present evidence that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso are capable of direct binding to zzso These zzso zzso can zzso at least two distinct mechanisms to block zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso The main mechanism consists of direct competition between the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso for the same binding site on zzso while the secondary mechanism involves the ability of zzso zzso complexes to inhibit zzso coli zzso complexes function at zzso It is also shown that both zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso recognition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso at the zzso zzso
