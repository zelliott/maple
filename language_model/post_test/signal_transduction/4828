zzso mechanisms operate to stabilize synaptic zzso however, we know little about how they are zzso zzso zzso zzso we have uncovered a critical role for the target of zzso zzso in the regulation of synaptic zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso a retrograde zzso enhancement in neurotransmitter release that is normally triggered by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso form of zzso zzso protein zzso a common target of zzso can trigger a strong retrograde increase in neurotransmitter zzso Interestingly, zzso for zzso a critical component of the zzso protein complex, blocks the retrograde signal in all these zzso Our findings suggest that zzso translation under the control of zzso plays a critical role in establishing the activity dependent zzso response at the zzso
