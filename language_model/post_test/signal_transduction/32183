The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a well-established role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso How zzso contributes to zzso zzso is less well zzso Here, we demonstrate that the potent suppressing effect of clinically used zzso zzso on tissue zzso zzso generation is linked to diminished zzso zzso responses and zzso zzso zzso The same zzso suppress these responses in zzso zzso with collagen and zzso zzso zzso whereas added zzso zzso these zzso In zzso spreading on zzso zzso zzso signaling similarly enhances zzso zzso rises and zzso zzso These responses are reduced in zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso Furthermore, the contribution of zzso to tissue zzso zzso zzso rises, zzso exposure and zzso generation in plasma are fully dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirms a key role of zzso zzso which is largely but not exclusively dependent on zzso zzso It is concluded that the majority of tissue zzso zzso activity of zzso relies on zzso zzso and ensuing zzso signal generation, and zzso that a considerable part of zzso zzso relies on zzso zzso These results hence point to a novel role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
