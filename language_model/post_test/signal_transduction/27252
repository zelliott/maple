I have shown how the approaches of zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso and protein zzso have identified a series of related proteins that function in DNA repair and in DNA damage zzso The fact that one member of the family is a DNA damage activated protein zzso suggests how these factors might function in zzso the DNA repair apparatus and in triggering DNA damage zzso zzso Interestingly, several members of the family also have key roles in zzso best examples being provided by zzso which is essential for zzso zzso Major goals for future research will be to determine precisely how zzso and its relatives function at the molecular level and to identify and characterize other components of the DNA repair and DNA damage zzso zzso Perhaps most significantly from the perspective of cancer research, however, defects in zzso lead to enhanced zzso zzso in the zzso This raises the exciting prospect that deficiencies in other members of the zzso family will zzso individuals to cancer and that further research into this group of zzso will provide important insights into the mechanisms of zzso
