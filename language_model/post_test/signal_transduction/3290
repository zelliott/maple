zzso zzso zzso is caused by exposure to zzso Because zzso has a zzso period, short survival time, and has a poor response to current therapeutic zzso long-term preventive strategies are required to suppress the advance of pathological states after zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism by increasing zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Several studies have indicated that the zzso of zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso Because high zzso levels correlated with a worse prognosis and survival rate in zzso we examined whether the zzso zzso suppresses zzso cell growth through the zzso zzso In zzso dietary fish oil (a potential promoter of zzso decreased the growth rate of zzso which was accompanied by an increase in zzso and zzso levels, and a decrease in zzso zzso In zzso zzso significantly impaired the cell proliferation rate of zzso cell zzso These effects partly involved induction of growth arrest and zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells expressed both zzso receptors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso at zzso and proteins zzso These receptors were functional, because zzso activated zzso zzso treatment also significantly zzso protein levels of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso Finally, zzso analysis of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso suggests that zzso enhances zzso activity and zzso the cell proliferation rate of zzso cells, mainly via zzso These findings suggest that the induction or supplementation of zzso is an important tactic for developing therapeutic strategies against zzso
