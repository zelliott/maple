zzso a cell surface zzso found on B zzso and other zzso presenting cells, can, when engaged by zzso zzso zzso induce gene zzso and zzso zzso We report here that zzso is also expressed on zzso and on up to 50% of peripheral T cells from zzso prone strains of zzso In normal animals, zzso is present on a small population of T cells and zzso zzso is expressed on most T cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso engagement on peripheral T cells, T cell zzso and zzso results in altered zzso zzso That induced expression of different zzso results from the activity of the zzso gene is implied by the observation that zzso does not induce zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso Total cell numbers remained unchanged between zzso treated and zzso populations of zzso or T cells indicating that treatment does not induce cell proliferation or cell zzso The data presented here suggest a mechanism by which self zzso T cells accumulate peripherally and independently of selective processes of the zzso
