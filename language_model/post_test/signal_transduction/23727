Progress in the last decades indicated that zzso might be a universal fact of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain a major challenge in zzso Our relatively long life span and huge variations in lifestyle make detailed studies of zzso in humans difficult to zzso In contrast, the relatively simple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been a critical model in the field of zzso research for zzso Systems biology has contributed to the zzso field by mapping complex regulatory networks and resolving the dynamics of signal zzso zzso In this review we first review the current understanding of zzso in zzso then highlight the recent zzso systems and system biology approaches that could be used to further our understanding of zzso in zzso
