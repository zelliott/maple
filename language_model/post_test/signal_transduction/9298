Target identification remains challenging for the field of chemical zzso We describe an zzso chemical zzso and zzso approach combining the use of zzso active zzso of small zzso zzso with stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell zzso affinity enrichment, followed by subsequent testing of candidate targets using zzso zzso gene zzso We applied this approach to characterizing the natural product zzso and its ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso zzso factor signaling and zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso 1) is a relevant target of zzso and that the loss zzso zzso trafficking and expression zzso evidence for a previously zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similar strategies should lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic zzso
