Through simultaneous interactions with zzso and zzso via separate zzso repeat zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso has been proposed to play a critical role in the transfer of client proteins from zzso to zzso However, no prior zzso analysis demonstrating a critical in zzso role for the zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso We used zzso zzso of the zzso zzso combined with a genetic screen to isolate zzso that disrupt zzso zzso A single zzso acid zzso in zzso disrupted zzso interaction in zzso but did not significantly affect zzso However, deletion of a zzso zzso in zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso domain completely disrupted zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso in zzso previously shown to interact with zzso were not sufficient to disrupt in zzso functions unless combined with zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso have redundant or overlapping in zzso zzso We further examined the genetic and physical interaction of zzso with a zzso form of zzso providing insight into the importance of the zzso domain of zzso in regulating zzso zzso
