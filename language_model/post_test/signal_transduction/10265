zzso of cell zzso takes place during zzso processes such as cell migration and cell zzso zzso of proteins involved in membrane zzso including zzso and zzso disrupt zzso To understand the function of zzso structures zzso in zzso we have expressed a green fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein of zzso light chain a zzso in zzso zzso cells and recorded images of dividing cells near the zzso surface with a spinning disk zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent dynamic appearance and disappearance throughout the zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso between separated zzso migrated toward the zzso and subsequently disappeared in the equatorial zzso zzso outside separating zzso were mostly random, similar to what was observed in zzso zzso zzso movements toward the zzso were dependent on both zzso filaments and zzso while the zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso filaments but not on zzso These results suggest that zzso are involved in zzso the plasma membrane along the zzso during zzso zzso structures may also play a role in transporting signaling or structural components into the zzso zzso
