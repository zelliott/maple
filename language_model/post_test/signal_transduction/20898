zzso and zzso of protein zzso C is a key event in the regulation of T zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of human peripheral blood zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the T cell zzso zzso led to a zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso The immediate zzso and zzso of the protein zzso C zzso zzso was followed by zzso and zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso after 90 zzso of zzso zzso of the cells with zzso toxin for 90 zzso completely abolished zzso of protein zzso zzso In sharp contrast, zzso and zzso of protein zzso zzso was not influenced by the bacterial zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso of different protein zzso C zzso are regulated by distinct mechanisms of zzso zzso coupled to the T cell zzso zzso zzso The expression of high affinity zzso receptors was completely inhibited by zzso zzso while zzso synthesis and zzso were not influenced in zzso zzso human zzso zzso control experiments have shown that the effects of zzso toxin were not zzso by its B zzso and were independent of zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso toxin zzso with a zzso zzso leading to zzso of protein zzso zzso which could be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was substantiated by the finding that upon introduction of zzso against protein zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was completely zzso The results suggest, that protein zzso zzso might be the major protein zzso C zzso of a signal zzso cascade regulating zzso zzso expression in zzso human zzso
