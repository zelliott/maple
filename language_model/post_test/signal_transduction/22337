We examined the roles of a zzso zzso in both inducing zzso and zzso acquired tumor immunity using mouse zzso tumor transplantation zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively induced zzso in zzso cells originating from a zzso zzso Three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso tumor immunity against viable zzso cells in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso zzso The acquired immunity was zzso cell specific and was zzso zzso with zzso zzso We next examined the involvement of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which is released during zzso in the acquisition of tumor zzso A zzso zzso that produces a zzso zzso zzso prevents the formation of a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor immunity was significantly reduced when the zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso zzso as the vaccination zzso These data suggest the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso acquired zzso
