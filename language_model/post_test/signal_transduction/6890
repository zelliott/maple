The zzso zzso is a critical stem cell regulator and plays important roles in zzso cells during early zzso However, the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso a major neural stem cell population expanded by zzso remains poorly zzso This study shows that genetic zzso of zzso with zzso mice zzso zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and intermediate zzso are found in the zzso zzso during late zzso Increased zzso and divergent zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zone are also observed in the zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso proliferation and zzso as well as zzso by cortical zzso zzso or by zzso neural stem cells are significantly defective in the zzso zzso layer patterning is not apparently altered, while zzso is zzso increased in the zzso At the molecular level, the expression of the zzso factor zzso is dramatically diminished in the cortical zzso zzso and the zzso neural stem cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso complex binds to zzso promoter and zzso its zzso zzso The forced expression of zzso through zzso zzso partially zzso the defective proliferation and zzso by zzso neural stem zzso Thus, zzso is a novel downstream target of the zzso pathway, and zzso signaling plays critical roles in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso stem cells during zzso zzso
