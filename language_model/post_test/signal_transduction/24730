We have previously suggested a possible involvement of zzso and/or the putative zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso responses to zzso and zzso In this report, we examined the effect of zzso interaction upon zzso proliferation by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso and showed that zzso zzso and/or zzso on T cells resulted in significant zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In most cases, zzso of zzso alone or together with zzso receptors on peripheral blood zzso zzso resulted in more potent suppression of zzso proliferation than that caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso of potential zzso mechanisms revealed that zzso zzso and zzso does not reduce cell viability or the expression of zzso markers that are important for zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso production and rendered zzso unable to zzso zzso added human zzso zzso zzso Further examination of possible signal zzso that might be associated with zzso zzso and/or zzso receptors indicated a marked reduction in the magnitude and duration of zzso calcium zzso released in response to zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation by a zzso mechanism that zzso zzso production and/or zzso
