zzso zzso is the zzso genetic mechanism for zzso zzso However, there are documented examples of zzso by alternate mechanisms, for example gene dosage increase, though its prevalence is zzso Here, we answered the fundamental question of the contribution of DNA amplification as a molecular mechanism driving zzso Comparing 104 cancer lines representing diverse tissue origins identified genes residing in amplification zzso and discovered an unexpected frequency of genes activated by this zzso The zzso zzso identified represent approximately 10 per zzso and approximately 36 per zzso cancer zzso Many zzso amplified zzso were previously known to be activated only by zzso zzso The 135 hotspots identified contain 538 unique genes and are enriched for zzso zzso and zzso zzso reflecting functions advantageous to tumor zzso zzso gene dosage with expression data validated the downstream impact of the novel amplification events in both cell lines and clinical zzso For example, multiple downstream components of the zzso pathway, including zzso zzso and zzso are zzso as a direct result of gene amplification in lung zzso Our findings suggest that amplification is far more common a mechanism of zzso zzso than previously believed and that specific regions of the zzso are hotspots of zzso
