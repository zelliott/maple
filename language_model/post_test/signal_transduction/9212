zzso zzso a key element in zzso immune system, plays pivotal roles in host zzso against infection and excessive zzso Its protective effects range from direct zzso activities against a large panel of zzso including bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso cells zzso generated in the presence of bovine zzso zzso fail to undergo zzso by zzso zzso zzso and major zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, these cells are weak zzso of T cell proliferation and retain zzso zzso zzso zzso with an impaired zzso zzso primed T zzso exhibit a functional zzso characterized by reduced expression of zzso and impaired expression of zzso and zzso The observed zzso effects correlate with an increased expression of molecules with negative regulatory functions zzso zzso transcript 3 and programmed death zzso 1), zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso produce zzso and exhibit zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso exposure of already differentiated zzso completely fails to induce zzso and partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso likely account for the distinct response zzso by zzso in zzso versus immature zzso providing a zzso base for its multiple zzso These results indicate that zzso exerts a potent zzso activity by skewing zzso differentiation into zzso with impaired capacity to undergo zzso and to promote zzso zzso Overall, these zzso effects may represent a strategy to block excessive DC zzso upon zzso zzso adding further evidence for a critical role of zzso in directing host immune zzso
