zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in cell zzso The zzso system of zzso has received little attention so far, and our study has been addressed to the characterization of zzso properties in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso showed a zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso in the presence of 5 zzso zzso in the absence of zzso it was poorly affected by zzso while it was zzso by zzso and zzso up to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to other zzso the zzso activity was scarcely zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso activity, and the pharmacological profile of the zzso zzso was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was assessed in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso which reduced the zzso activity only at the highest dose tested zzso zzso Our data indicate the presence of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso coupled to zzso proteins and to a specific class of zzso zzso Such receptors show a pharmacological profile slightly different from that reported for zzso zzso receptors cloned so zzso
