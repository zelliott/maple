The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises more than 20 zzso zzso proteins that are structurally related in their zzso zzso and specifically activated by the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso Members of this zzso zzso are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial biological processes such as zzso and zzso development, innate and zzso zzso and maintenance of cellular zzso A remarkable zzso of the zzso zzso is the ability of these receptors to induce the opposing effects of gene zzso for cell survival, zzso and differentiation and of zzso cell zzso The zzso signaling proteins known as zzso zzso associated factors zzso are the major signal zzso for the cell survival effects, while the zzso proteins mediate cell death zzso This review summarizes recent zzso zzso and functional studies of these signal zzso and proposes the molecular mechanisms of the zzso signal zzso
