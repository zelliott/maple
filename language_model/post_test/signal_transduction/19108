zzso signaling events regulate cellular zzso Cancer stimulating signals trigger cellular responses that evade the regulatory control of cell zzso To understand the mechanism of signaling regulation in cancer, it is necessary to identify the activated pathways in zzso We have developed zzso a zzso zzso that explores the activated signaling pathways in zzso The zzso zzso zzso an assembled protein interaction network associated with DNA damage response, with the gene expression profiles derived from the zzso zzso Based on the observation that zzso proteins often exhibit correlated gene expression profiles, it identifies the activated signaling pathways in cancer by systematically searching the zzso for proteins with significantly correlated gene expression zzso zzso the gene expression profiles of breast cancer, we found distinct similarities and differences in the activated signaling pathways between the samples from the patients who developed zzso and the samples from the patients who were disease free within 5 zzso The cellular pathways associated with the various DNA repair mechanisms and the zzso checkpoint controls are found to be activated in both sample zzso One of the most intriguing findings is that the pathways associated with different cellular processes are functionally coordinated through zzso in the zzso sample group, whereas such functional coordination is absent in the samples from patients who developed zzso Our analysis revealed the potential cellular pathways that regulate the signaling events in breast zzso
