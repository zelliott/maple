Previous studies have shown that DNA zzso death of primary cortical zzso occurs in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The manner by which these signals zzso death is zzso Nuclear zzso zzso is a group of zzso factors that potentially interact with these zzso zzso we show that zzso is activated shortly after induction of DNA damage in a manner independent of the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso Acute zzso of zzso via expression of a stable zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso or pharmacological zzso zzso significantly protected against DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso transcripts and zzso activity as measured by the zzso messages, zzso and zzso implicating the zzso tumor zzso in the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression still zzso death in the presence of zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts downstream of zzso Interestingly, zzso cultured from zzso or zzso zzso mice were not resistant to death and did not show diminished zzso activity, suggesting zzso processes attributable to zzso deficiencies, which allow zzso zzso still to zzso In contrast to acute zzso zzso prolonged zzso zzso caused zzso death in the absence of DNA zzso These results uniquely define a signaling paradigm by which zzso serves both an acute zzso zzso function in the presence of DNA damage and an zzso function in zzso normal zzso
