zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso are both regulated by changes in cellular zzso zzso state and zzso to the nucleus zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Previously we showed a novel mechanism for zzso zzso zzso survival through zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso In addition, we showed zzso zzso to the plasma membrane zzso and zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso Because zzso is an zzso that regulates zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso regulates zzso zzso and function that might affect zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treated with 10 zzso zzso inhibitor zzso were protected from zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso lost the protective effect of zzso zzso suggesting a protective role for zzso Using zzso cell zzso analysis, and plasma membrane sheet zzso zzso was shown to zzso to the plasma membrane after zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction was decreased on zzso treatment, suggesting zzso as a novel regulator of zzso zzso and zzso 

These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism of zzso by zzso to mediate zzso of plasma membrane signaling and cell zzso
