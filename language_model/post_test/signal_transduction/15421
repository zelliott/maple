Hard metal or cemented zzso consists of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and metallic zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be potentially zzso to zzso However, no comparison of the adverse effects of zzso zzso particles is available to zzso In the present study, we compared the ability of zzso and zzso zzso particles to form free zzso and propensity to activate the zzso factors, zzso and zzso along with stimulation of zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways in a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso generated a higher level of zzso zzso induced greater zzso stress, as evidenced by a decrease of zzso levels, and caused faster zzso zzso cell zzso than observed after exposure of cells to fine zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso and zzso more efficiently in zzso cells as compared to fine zzso zzso using zzso reporter transgenic mice confirmed the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso particles also zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso with significantly higher potency of zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso cells with zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus suggesting that zzso stress is involved in zzso toxicity and zzso zzso
