zzso diseases zzso are zzso disorders due to impaired respiratory chain function causing defective zzso zzso Although the disruption of zzso zzso is central to the MD zzso other factors may contribute to these zzso We investigated the expression and the cellular zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso in muscle zzso from 15 patients with zzso respiratory chain zzso Our data zzso demonstrate that zzso is expressed in muscle fibers with abnormal focal zzso of zzso so-called ragged red zzso and is delivered to zzso where both receptors are zzso zzso zzso receptors are zzso regulated in patients' muscle in which the expression levels of zzso zzso are decreased and those of zzso zzso are increased compared with zzso These findings suggest for the first time that zzso could exert a direct effect on zzso via its zzso
