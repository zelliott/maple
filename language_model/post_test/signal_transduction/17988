An zzso B cell response can be induced by low zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas high zzso are zzso Two explanations have been proposed for the latter zzso In the first, specific surface zzso focuses zzso to the B cell zzso where high local zzso of the zzso become zzso for B cell zzso In the alternative, transmission of an zzso signal at higher zzso of zzso zzso actively zzso the development of zzso zzso cells zzso In the present paper, the zzso zzso A zzso was used to attempt to distinguish between these two zzso zzso A did not block the zzso effects of goat zzso zzso on development of zzso induced by zzso and therefore was zzso for testing between the two zzso However, surprisingly, in the presence but not the absence of zzso even low zzso of zzso became zzso for zzso B cell zzso Thus, a zzso signal could inhibit both B cell proliferation and the development of zzso In contrast, the zzso signal induced by zzso required high zzso of zzso for triggering and enhanced the zzso zzso response without affecting development of zzso Evidence is presented that these two signals are regulated zzso suggesting that together they may transmit information about the physical form of an zzso to the B zzso
