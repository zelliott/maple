zzso is a spliced zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso By difference with zzso zzso which is mainly present at the plasma zzso zzso is localized in zzso zzso The zzso event generates a novel zzso region in zzso which is necessary for its zzso zzso The role of zzso is presently unknown, although its zzso zzso might zzso a possible role in the regulation of trafficking of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso complexes with zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso The zzso complex is readily observed in zzso studies using specific zzso for both proteins on mouse zzso zzso which identify zzso bands of zzso zzso suggesting zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex in the absence of zzso stimulation is mostly found in zzso zzso areas in primary zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso results into diffusion of zzso and zzso zzso throughout the cell and into zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso could regulate availability of zzso receptors at the cell zzso The formation of zzso complex is zzso through the interaction of zzso with the third zzso loop of zzso As functional consequence of the zzso interaction, we observed a reduction of zzso binding sites at the plasma zzso when the two proteins are zzso in zzso zzso zzso these studies identify zzso as a zzso interacting protein involved in the regulation of zzso at the membrane through a zzso zzso zzso
