The present study analyzed the zzso and spatial expression of zzso zzso and activated zzso and zzso during zzso zzso wound repair, using chick cornea by zzso zzso zzso showed low-level zzso zzso Following zzso zzso expression was strong in the zzso layer zzso zzso expression was confined to zzso cells in the zzso and zzso regions, and was not detected in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment zzso the proliferation of cultured zzso zzso Our present findings seem to suggest that the zzso signal may be required for zzso cell zzso zzso expression was strong in zzso and zzso zzso cells, many active zzso zzso at the wound edge, zzso cells and zzso membrane zzso Although both nuclear zzso and zzso zzso was observed in many zzso zzso cells, zzso positive cells were zzso with zzso positive zzso zzso it seems likely that the zzso signal may affect zzso cell proliferation in healing zzso Both zzso and zzso expression were also observed in zzso zzso Interestingly, many active zzso over the whole zzso in early wound healing at day 2 expressed nuclear zzso but little if any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and distribution of the three zzso zzso as well as concerted zzso of both zzso and zzso appears to be a key aspect of zzso zzso wound healing in the zzso
