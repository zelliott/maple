Using zzso zzso data sets of the zzso Genome Project, we demonstrate a closer zzso relationship between zzso cells and T cells than between any other zzso distinguished by their shared expression of genes zzso molecules with similar signaling zzso Whereas resting zzso cells are known to share expression of a few genes with zzso zzso T cells, our zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso extend to hundreds of zzso many zzso molecules with unknown zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrate a zzso state compared with zzso T cells, which allows zzso cells to respond more rapidly to viral zzso zzso our data provide a global context for known and previously unknown molecular aspects of zzso cell identity and function by zzso the zzso repertoire of gene expression of zzso cells in various zzso
