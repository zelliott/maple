zzso is an zzso zzso factor controlled by two principal signaling zzso and plays pivotal roles in diverse zzso processes including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling was detected in skin of zzso mice and can be diminished by an zzso zzso However, in zzso studies demonstrated that zzso activates zzso signaling by forming a linear zzso chain assembly complex with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The inconsistency between in zzso and in zzso findings about zzso function on zzso zzso could be partially due to zzso potential interactions with downstream molecules of zzso zzso In this study, 17 zzso zzso zzso including zzso were identified by mass spectrum analysis among zzso zzso mouse zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso 12 cells suggesting their interaction with zzso zzso between zzso and zzso confirmed previous zzso two zzso reports that zzso was one zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso which can be partly compensated by zzso of zzso These data suggested that other than zzso zzso signaling by forming zzso zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso may also zzso associate with zzso zzso via interactions with other zzso members, such as zzso
