zzso and zzso transcript zzso peptides are regulated zzso that play a role in a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso is also highly regulated as its levels change in response to zzso drugs and zzso To understand the mechanisms involved in regulating zzso zzso levels, the mouse zzso zzso regulatory region was zzso The sequence of zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso region revealed a zzso promoter that contains a cluster of zzso factor binding sites, including an overlapping zzso zzso In addition, the zzso 320 zzso of the zzso promoter shares zzso zzso identity between mouse and zzso Three zzso expressing zzso containing varying amounts of zzso zzso upstream sequence were generated and tested for promoter zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso of upstream sequence displayed strong promoter activity, producing zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while, a construct containing 102 zzso of upstream sequence displayed a zzso increase in zzso A construct containing the composite zzso site was responsive to zzso zzso induction by zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso levels after 6 h and the addition of zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso A, reduced the levels by zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso promoter lies within the zzso zzso zzso and that in zzso cells the zzso gene is regulated via a zzso zzso zzso
