Development, survival, and zzso of B zzso are controlled by signals emanating from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has an autonomous signaling function also known as zzso signaling that allows for long-term survival of B cells in the immune zzso Upon binding of zzso to the zzso the zzso signal is amplified and zzso leading to zzso in gene expression and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso intimately zzso with the signaling zzso of the zzso and plays a central role in the amplification and diversification of zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which zzso activity is inhibited and activated at the zzso zzso zzso acts not only as a zzso that zzso downstream zzso but also as an adapter that can bind to a diverse set of signaling zzso Depending on its interactions and zzso zzso can signal opposing cell fate decisions such as proliferation or differentiation of B zzso
