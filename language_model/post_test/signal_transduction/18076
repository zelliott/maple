At the onset of zzso the zzso apparatus, which consists of several zzso zzso throughout the cell to be zzso into daughter zzso The molecular mechanisms of this process are now beginning to be zzso To investigate the zzso requirements and zzso of zzso zzso membrane dynamics in polarized cells, we have zzso the zzso of the zzso apparatus by introducing zzso egg extracts into zzso zzso canine kidney zzso zzso We used green zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cells to analyze the zzso changes of the zzso membrane in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and electron zzso showed that the zzso zzso can be dissected into two elementary processes zzso In the first process, the zzso zzso stacks break into zzso structures, zzso which are comprised of zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In the second process, the structures zzso more thoroughly or substantially relocate to the zzso Our analyses further showed that zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are differently involved in these two zzso the first process is mainly regulated by zzso and the second mainly by zzso
