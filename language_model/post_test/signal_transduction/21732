zzso zzso which include zzso zzso zzso are required for DNA replication and have been linked to replication checkpoint zzso A direct role for zzso in checkpoint control has been difficult to zzso however, because of the requirement for replication in generating the DNA structures that activate the zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso zzso egg extracts upon addition of an zzso duplex zzso We show that zzso zzso the requirement for replication in checkpoint zzso We take advantage of this zzso checkpoint system to determine the role of zzso in the zzso We find that zzso is essential for zzso checkpoint signaling and that it functions to promote zzso of zzso bound zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso We also identify a zzso zzso of zzso In extracts expressing this zzso replication of zzso zzso occurs zzso however, the checkpoint response to stalled replication zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso functions directly during signal relay from zzso to zzso
