Host cells respond to zzso infectious agents such as zzso including zzso Studies have evaluated the changes associated with virus infection at the zzso and zzso levels of the cellular genes involved in specific zzso While this approach is useful, in our view it provides only a partial view of zzso zzso Recently, technological advances in the expression profiling at the zzso zzso and zzso levels have made it possible to evaluate the changes in the components of multiple zzso To understand the role of zzso and its interplay with host cellular gene expression zzso during zzso infection, we performed a comparative global zzso and zzso zzso using human zzso infected with zzso The zzso were derived from multiple donors and were infected with virus generated from the molecular clone zzso The results showed that zzso infection led to altered regulation of 21 zzso and zzso zzso more than zzso with a statistical significance of zzso Furthermore, the zzso regulated zzso and zzso were shown to be associated with host cellular pathways involved in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and immune zzso We also observed a number of inverse correlations of zzso and zzso expression in infected zzso further confirming the zzso between zzso and zzso regulation during zzso zzso These results for the first time provide evidence that the zzso profile could be an early indicator of host cellular dysfunction induced by zzso
