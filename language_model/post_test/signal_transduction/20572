zzso is a zzso steroid and specific inhibitor of the zzso The relationship between zzso treatment and the unfolded protein response zzso in cells is not precisely zzso zzso we studied the possible effects of zzso on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cells were cultured overnight and then treated with various zzso of zzso zzso to zzso in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso We also used real-time zzso chain reaction to obtain quantitative zzso of expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cell number, zzso and proliferation of zzso cells were monitored with a real-time cell zzso system zzso We show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso program and zzso cell death in zzso tumor zzso zzso at all zzso showed no zzso whereas all zzso were very effective under zzso stress zzso Our findings show that disruption of the zzso during zzso deprivation could be an attractive approach for selective cancer cell killing and could provide a chemical basis for developing zzso drugs against solid zzso zzso use as an adjunct to conventional cancer therapy also warrants vigorous zzso
