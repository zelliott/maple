Aging is a result of damage zzso and understanding of the mechanisms of aging requires exploration of the cellular and molecular systems functioning to control zzso zzso mouse prone 10 zzso has been established as an zzso strain exhibiting accelerated aging with an earlier onset of cognitive impairment due to zzso than the zzso control zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso responses of zzso cells are impaired in zzso zzso We injected zzso acid zzso to induce zzso injury and studied how zzso were zzso on Day 3 using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso screening for zzso zzso we performed real-time zzso and zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso zzso interactions in the injured zzso of zzso mice, in which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso and thereby induced expression of zzso and zzso inflammatory protein zzso and activated zzso produced zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the most strongly zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was also strongly zzso in the zzso especially on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was zzso reduced in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso On Day 30 after zzso injection, zzso but not zzso mice exhibited zzso layer zzso Since the zzso system is essential for zzso and zzso these findings highlight the defects of zzso mice in zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be associated with the mechanism underlying the vulnerability of zzso mice to age-related zzso
