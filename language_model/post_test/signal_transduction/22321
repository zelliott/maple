zzso B4 zzso ) has zzso properties for activated T cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso This study investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso selective for zzso zzso could protect mice from colitis zzso by specific zzso zzso T zzso zzso 

zzso colitis was induced in zzso mice transferred with zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso mice which are specific to class I zzso zzso of zzso Mice were zzso with zzso zzso cells and colitis was zzso by zzso administration of the zzso Colitis was evaluated by body weight loss and zzso and zzso analysis of zzso In zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso In some experiments mice were treated with a selective zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso cells zzso induced zzso of specific zzso zzso as shown by the presence of zzso zzso T cells in colon draining zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso challenge with zzso induced severe colitis and recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso Treatment with the specific zzso zzso zzso before zzso of colitis reduced the severity of colitis and decreased the frequency of specific zzso 

Colitis can be induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for viral zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso colitis by zzso zzso zzso recruitment in zzso These data illustrate the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso selective zzso in protection from zzso zzso zzso zzso
