zzso plants typically respond to zzso signals by increasing the rate of stem zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso of proteins targeted for zzso In zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus and light exposure causes zzso migration to the zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus under natural or simulated shade, despite the presence of zzso zzso In plants grown under white light, the transfer to zzso conditions triggers an unexpectedly rapid zzso of zzso in the zzso The partial simulation of shade by lowering either blue or red light levels zzso zzso light) caused zzso nuclear zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso is more sensitive to afternoon shade than to morning zzso A residual response to shade was observed in the zzso zzso background, but these zzso showed zzso sensitivity as they responded to morning shade and not to afternoon zzso zzso zzso exaggerated the zzso pattern by enhancing afternoon sensitivity and making morning shade zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso also responded more strongly to afternoon shade than to morning zzso These results are consistent with a zzso role of zzso in shade zzso We propose a function of zzso in setting the daily patterns of sensitivity to shade in the fluctuating light environments of plant zzso
