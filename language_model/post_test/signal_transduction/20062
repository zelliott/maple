During zzso zzso the precise balance between zzso proliferation and differentiation is zzso and temporally regulated through a number of intrinsic factors and zzso signaling zzso Moreover, there are complex gene regulatory network interactions between these intrinsic factors and zzso zzso which ultimately function to determine when zzso exit the cell cycle and terminally zzso We recently uncovered a cell zzso role for the intrinsic zzso factor, zzso in regulating zzso proliferation and zzso with zzso zzso containing an abundance of zzso zzso and an absence of terminally differentiated retinal zzso and zzso Here, we report that zzso function is necessary and sufficient to limit zzso zzso activity during zzso zzso zzso possess elevated levels of zzso zzso component gene zzso while zzso zzso zzso possess reduced expression of zzso zzso component zzso zzso of zzso signaling activity by zzso or by zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to rescue both the zzso and differentiation defects in zzso zzso In addition to regulating zzso zzso activity, through a novel zzso and differential gene expression analysis of zzso zzso we identify a number of additional intrinsic and zzso regulatory zzso components whose expression is regulated by zzso These data highlight the integral role played by zzso in the gene regulatory network governing the transition from zzso proliferation to terminal differentiation during zzso zzso
