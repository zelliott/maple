zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso channels zzso zzso are crucial in cardiovascular zzso zzso via zzso are enhanced by hormones and zzso operating via zzso such as zzso II zzso and zzso zzso It has been proposed that these zzso are zzso by protein zzso C zzso However, reports on effects of zzso zzso on zzso channels are zzso zzso and/or enhancing effects have been zzso Attempts to reproduce the enhancing effect of zzso in zzso expression systems zzso We previously found that zzso zzso of the channel depends on zzso zzso zzso only a long zzso zzso zzso was zzso Here we report the zzso of the zzso and zzso enhancement of the zzso zzso of zzso expressed in zzso zzso The current initially increased over several minutes but later declined to below baseline zzso Using different zzso deletion zzso and human zzso and zzso zzso of the channel, we found the initial segment of the zzso to be crucial for the zzso but not for the zzso zzso Using zzso of zzso and of zzso C zzso and a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso we demonstrate that the signaling zzso of the enhancing effect includes the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso present in both zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and zzso but not zzso as only zzso levels of zzso were zzso zzso of zzso and zzso effects in zzso zzso will advance the study of molecular mechanisms of these zzso important zzso
