Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is a zzso factor that is involved in a variety of biological zzso It is essential for the signal zzso of zzso zzso and related zzso In response to zzso stimulation zzso becomes zzso and zzso into the nucleus where it binds to zzso sequences of target zzso We found that activated zzso is enriched in zzso structures within the nucleus, which we termed zzso nuclear zzso To examine the dynamics of zzso nuclear body formation, a fusion protein of zzso and yellow fluorescent protein zzso was zzso Studies in living cells have shown that the appearance of zzso nuclear bodies is zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso of zzso Furthermore, we show by zzso recovery after zzso zzso analysis that zzso within nuclear bodies consists of a highly mobile and an immobile zzso zzso studies provided evidence that these bodies are accompanied with zzso binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are markers for zzso active zzso Moreover, zzso nuclear bodies in zzso cells are not zzso with zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso neither is a zzso of activated zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso nuclear bodies are either directly involved in active gene zzso or they serve as reservoirs of activated zzso
