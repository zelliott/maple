zzso stress may cause zzso dysfunction and vascular zzso It has been shown that NO protects zzso cells zzso against zzso zzso In addition, it is known that NO within cells zzso a zinc release from proteins containing zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zinc released zzso by NO plays a signaling role in the zzso protection against zzso in rat zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso protection toward zzso depends on the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso de zzso zzso Moreover, NO increases the synthesis of the zzso zzso by inducing the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc abrogates the zzso increase of zzso and of cellular zzso zzso As a consequence, the zzso protection against zzso toxicity is zzso We also show that under zzso conditions, both cellular NO synthesis and zzso zzso zinc are required to maintain the cellular zzso zzso Using zzso interference and laser scanning zzso we found that the zzso expression of zzso depends on the zzso of the zzso factor zzso but not on the activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso These findings show that zzso zzso zinc plays a signaling role in the protective activity of NO and could explain why maintenance of an adequate zinc status in the zzso is important to protect from zzso stress and the development of vascular zzso
