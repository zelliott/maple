The complex functions played by beta 2 zzso in zzso a large variety of adhesive interactions of zzso are highly zzso This regulation results in transient zzso permitting physical and functional recycling of these receptors during zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structural definition of these adaptations will lead not only to a better understanding of how these receptors are regulated in zzso but also shed valuable light on how these zzso integrate diverse zzso signals into zzso and zzso coordinated cellular zzso
