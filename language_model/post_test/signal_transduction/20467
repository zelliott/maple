Bone zzso proteins zzso belong to the zzso zzso and were first discovered as potent bone zzso regulators for their ability to induce zzso bone formation, zzso bone formation and fracture zzso A zzso role of zzso signaling in zzso control of cell type zzso differentiation and zzso is also well zzso More recently, a role for zzso in adult tissue zzso has started being zzso Thus, new studies show that zzso regulate many cellular processes such as zzso zzso differentiation and migration in many zzso and zzso As a consequence, zzso of zzso activity can have pathological consequences, and there is mounting evidence for the involvement of zzso in different human zzso In this review, we have focused on zzso the present knowledge on the relevance of zzso in liver physiology and zzso from the zzso role in liver development to the emerging contribution to the function and dysfunction of the adult zzso While no doubts seem to rise about the regulatory activities of zzso on zzso pathways in the liver, potential zzso and zzso and zzso actions will likely be a matter of debate during coming zzso zzso the work here presented provides the basis to consider zzso as potential targets of intervention in liver zzso
