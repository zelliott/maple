Recognizing the presence of invading pathogens is key to mounting an effective innate immune zzso zzso cells express different classes of zzso pattern recognition receptors that monitor the zzso and zzso compartments of host cells for signs of infection and that activate several zzso zzso zzso An efficient immune response often requires the sequential detection of a pathogen by different receptors in different zzso zzso which results in a complex interplay of downstream zzso zzso In this Review, we discuss the recent identification of previously unknown pattern recognition receptors and how they complement the repertoire of established zzso
