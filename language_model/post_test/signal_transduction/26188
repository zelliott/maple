In order to zzso the feature of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso from acute zzso leukemia zzso the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain genes in zzso T cells were analyzed using real-time zzso zzso T cells sorted from peripheral blood of 10 zzso patients and 10 healthy donors were used in the zzso zzso lower expression levels of all four zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain genes were found in the zzso zzso The expression pattern of the four zzso chains was zzso in zzso T cells from zzso samples, which was different from the healthy control zzso In conclusion, the results provide a global gene expression profile of zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains in zzso zzso zzso of all four zzso gene expression levels might represent the feature related to zzso zzso
