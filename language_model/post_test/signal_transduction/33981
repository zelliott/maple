Here we show that zzso signaling is necessary and sufficient for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso markers of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso but cannot induce the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso approaches using zzso of zzso zzso and zzso designed against zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that zzso signaling is critical for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso This activity is not simply a result of embryonic zzso as markers for zzso zzso are not zzso We further show that zzso cells of either zzso or zzso character do not form when both zzso and zzso signals are zzso Overall, this report strongly suggests that zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso
