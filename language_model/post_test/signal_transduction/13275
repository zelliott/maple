The involvement of zzso in zzso spreading and zzso was investigated in the compound zzso zzso zzso The number of spreading cells was significantly reduced when zzso occurred in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso The significant decrease of the fraction of spreading cells in the presence of zzso blood plasma suggests the presence of zzso molecules in the blood of our zzso The increase in the same index when blood zzso slides as well as zzso and zzso zzso were used, fits with the above zzso zzso in the presence of zzso leads to a consistent zzso of the zzso zzso in agreement with the known role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was greatly reduced by zzso in the incubation zzso but not by zzso and was significantly increased by coating zzso cells with zzso or blood zzso Both spreading and zzso capability were severely inhibited by zzso suggesting the importance of zzso in zzso signal zzso in zzso
