We previously showed that the zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in the plasma zzso The zzso of zzso receptors by zzso zzso receptors eventually leads to zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of zzso wild type zzso rats after zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate in the zzso zzso expression system that delivery of zzso protein to the plasma membrane depends on the small zzso zzso This zzso zzso trafficking requires zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and the generation of zzso In line with this mechanism we could show zzso zzso expression in the zzso of wild type zzso mice and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso slices with the zzso inhibitor zzso revealed reduced zzso zzso synaptic zzso Furthermore, treatment of primary zzso zzso with zzso altered the zzso expression pattern towards reduced synaptic expression of zzso Our findings demonstrate for the first time an involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso synaptic zzso zzso This new regulatory zzso of zzso may contribute to synaptic plasticity and zzso
