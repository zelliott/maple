The transforming growth zzso zzso family member zzso promotes zzso but the mechanism is unclear despite the relevance of zzso family proteins for zzso zzso and zzso 

To determine the zzso of zzso family members during stem cell zzso 

zzso embryonic stem cells were engineered with a zzso active human type I zzso zzso zzso to mimic zzso by zzso and found to zzso a zzso signal that promotes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso studies identified the factor as zzso Both zzso and zzso induced early zzso zzso in embryonic stem cell cultures at day 0 to 2 of zzso However, zzso expression declines by day 4 due to feedback zzso whereas zzso zzso At later stages zzso zzso zzso suppresses the formation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso while promoting the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and both stimulate the formation of zzso cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso however, becomes uniquely responsible for controlling subsequent lineage segregation by stimulating vascular smooth muscle and zzso lineages and simultaneously blocking zzso zzso
