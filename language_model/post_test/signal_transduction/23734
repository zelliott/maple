We recently demonstrated that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso is switched from zzso to zzso during neural differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells zzso and that this switching has a major impact on cell zzso In this study, we report a zzso determination mechanism in which zzso zzso zzso regulates the nuclear import of certain zzso factors to maintain zzso zzso The nuclear import of zzso and zzso was inhibited via the formation of a zzso complex of the cargo bound to a nuclear zzso signal binding site in zzso zzso Unless this zzso effect was zzso upon zzso zzso inappropriate cell death was zzso We propose that although certain zzso factors are necessary for differentiation in zzso these factors are retained in the zzso by zzso zzso thereby preventing zzso factor activity in the nucleus until the cells undergo zzso
