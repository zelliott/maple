Mice deficient for the B zzso zzso factor zzso show a zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso step of zzso heavy chain gene assembly even though the expression of the zzso zzso is not diminished in zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso is limiting for zzso to zzso zzso we generated transgenic mice which express zzso in developing zzso We show that enforced expression of zzso in zzso results in a partial block in T cell development due to defective zzso signaling in zzso Moreover, our results demonstrate that expression of zzso in early zzso is sufficient to induce zzso to zzso zzso in zzso T cells and lead us to suggest that zzso may play a direct role in the zzso regulation of zzso heavy chain gene zzso
