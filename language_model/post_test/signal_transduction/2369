zzso We zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso changes, using zzso as an zzso of individual vascular smooth muscle cells and zzso cells within intact rat tail arteries by zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso objective, we focused on zzso and smooth muscle cell layers alternately to obtain zzso images of their zzso In the presence of 1 zzso zzso zzso individual zzso cells responded with intermittent increases in the zzso zzso zzso At the same time, the frequency of zzso zzso in smooth muscle cells induced by electrical stimulation of the zzso sympathetic nerve was greatly zzso zzso A zzso rise during the zzso in the zzso cells zzso in the form of a wave along the long axis of the zzso zzso In the presence of a NO zzso zzso no significant zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso in the vascular smooth muscle cells was zzso although the zzso zzso in the zzso cells zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the frequency of zzso zzso in the vascular smooth muscle cells was zzso by 1 zzso sodium zzso a NO zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso waves and zzso in vascular zzso cells regulate NO production, which zzso vascular tone by decreasing the frequency of zzso zzso in smooth muscle cells activated by sympathetic zzso
