zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso signaling have been implicated in antipsychotic drug zzso This study examines the effects of acute antipsychotic treatment using typical zzso and zzso zzso agents on zzso signaling in zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso levels were measured to evaluate antipsychotic drug zzso Nuclear zzso levels increased in the zzso zzso after zzso and zzso zzso In zzso prefrontal cortex, zzso produced zzso decreases in zzso and zzso zzso The differential effects of typical versus zzso antipsychotic agents on zzso and zzso in zzso and cortical regions illustrate the zzso actions of these agents on zzso zzso
