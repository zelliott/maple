Signaling by the zzso zzso zzso profoundly influences the growth and gene expression of cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso binds to zzso a family of zzso proteins of the zzso zzso a focal point in the zzso of human zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso the functions of zzso such that zzso signaling was enhanced in zzso muscles of mice that do not express zzso As a consequence of inappropriate zzso zzso mice with a zzso zzso in zzso showed an excess of slow skeletal muscle zzso The absence of zzso also activated a zzso gene program, despite the absence of zzso and enhanced the cardiac growth response to pressure zzso In contrast, cardiac adaptation to other zzso zzso such as chronic zzso stimulation or exercise, was not zzso These findings show important roles for zzso as zzso of zzso signaling and the transmission of a specific subset of stress signals leading to cardiac zzso in zzso
