The zzso envelope zzso of human zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso but it is not known whether zzso activates zzso signaling zzso in the same manner as its natural zzso zzso We assessed the effects of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that interacts with zzso but not zzso on zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso Under both experimental conditions, the interaction of zzso and zzso resulted in their zzso zzso Both molecules were zzso into early zzso whereas neither protein could be detected in late zzso zzso of zzso to zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso and an induction of zzso activity, demonstrating that this interaction has functional zzso Interestingly, however, whereas zzso activated the zzso zzso pathway, this cascade was not induced by zzso Together, these results suggest that the pathology of zzso infection may be modulated by the distinct signal zzso zzso zzso by zzso upon its interaction with zzso
