zzso act as potent buffers of zzso zzso in many cells, but a more active role in modulating the generation of zzso signals is not well zzso We have investigated the ability of zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso entry in zzso zzso T cells and human T zzso using zzso imaging zzso zzso of the zzso zzso store with zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso channels in T cells, and the ensuing influx of zzso loads a zzso zzso store that by several criteria appears to be zzso zzso of this store is prevented by zzso cyanide zzso or by zzso A1 + zzso agents that are known to inhibit zzso zzso import by dissipating the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso export from zzso enhances store zzso In addition, we find that zzso labels zzso in T cells, and it reports changes in zzso levels that are consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso store is sensitive zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid zzso within 8 zzso and does not readily zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso indicating that zzso sense zzso zzso near zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso depletion prevent the ability of T cells to maintain a high rate of zzso zzso entry over prolonged periods of zzso zzso Under these conditions, the rate of zzso influx in single cells zzso abrupt transitions from a high influx to a low influx zzso These results demonstrate that zzso not only buffer the zzso that enters T cells via zzso zzso channels, but also play an active role in modulating the rate of zzso zzso zzso
