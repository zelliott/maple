The means by which zzso and zzso defense mechanisms are linked have expanded greatly in recent zzso It is now clear that the process of zzso does more than just degrade zzso zzso but also helps coordinate the actions of the innate and zzso immune zzso This review will discuss the means by which zzso zzso signaling pathways are coordinated around the processes of zzso zzso trafficking and zzso and how these signaling pathways influence zzso zzso In this regard, we propose that at the zzso level, zzso represent the smallest zzso unit that links innate and zzso zzso
