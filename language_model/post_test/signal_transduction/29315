zzso muscle zzso is characterized by zzso or type II muscle fiber zzso illustrated by decreased fiber zzso area and reduced zzso protein zzso Muscle zzso in particular through the zzso zzso system zzso is considered to play a major role in the zzso action of zzso The stimulation by zzso of the UPS is zzso through the increased expression of several zzso zzso involved in zzso such as zzso and zzso two zzso zzso involved in the targeting of protein to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso also exert an zzso action by zzso muscle protein zzso These changes in protein turnover may result from changes in the production of two growth factors which control muscle mass, namely zzso and myostatin respectively anabolic and zzso toward the skeletal zzso The decreased production of zzso as well as the increased production of myostatin have been both demonstrated to contribute to the muscle zzso caused by zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso by zzso through the zzso pathway, the activity of the zzso factor zzso a major switch for the stimulation of several zzso These recent progress in the understanding of the zzso muscle zzso should allow to define new therapies aiming to minimize this zzso Promising new therapeutic approaches for treating zzso muscle zzso are also presented in this zzso
