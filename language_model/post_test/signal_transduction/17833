zzso produced from zzso acid by the action of zzso zzso play a pivotal role in the regulation of both inflammatory and immune zzso Because zzso B4 zzso a product of zzso zzso pathway, can exert numerous zzso and zzso activities, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso release from zzso cells zzso and from zzso zzso In zzso manner, zzso and zzso inhibited the production of zzso from DC, but not from zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso The same effect was observed with zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso The decreased release of zzso was associated with an enhanced level of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso synthesis by zzso was significantly reversed by zzso suggesting the involvement of an zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso suppresses the production of zzso from DC by zzso zzso protein expression without any effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest links between DC zzso and zzso pathways during the inflammatory response, and zzso is a key target for the zzso zzso zzso
