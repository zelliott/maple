The zzso zzso body is formed by a combination of the zzso movements that shape the head and anterior trunk and zzso specific cell zzso Here, we investigated whether genes that regulate cell movements during zzso zzso tail zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interact to regulate zzso body zzso Both zzso and zzso double zzso zzso exhibit synergistic trunk and tail zzso by early zzso Gene expression analysis in the compound zzso indicates that zzso zzso patterning is largely normal and that the tail zzso defects are not due to failure to specify or maintain zzso zzso Moreover, zzso interacts with zzso and zzso to zzso regulate the zzso expression of the gene zzso bone zzso protein 4 zzso but not of other known zzso zzso zzso growth factor genes or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells indicates that impaired tail zzso is not simply due to decreased cell proliferation or increased cell zzso Cell tracing in zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso derived zzso zzso zzso move into the zzso However, zzso convergence and extension movements and cell movements within the zzso zzso are zzso Furthermore, zzso movements of cells into the zzso are reduced in zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso components zzso and zzso function in zzso partially redundant pathways to regulate zzso body zzso Our work zzso the genetic dissection of zzso body zzso and links genes to specific zzso zzso Moreover, we provide genetic evidence for the notion that tail development zzso a continuation of mechanisms regulating zzso together with mechanisms unique to the zzso zzso
