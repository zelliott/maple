zzso zzso a widely used recreational drug with psychoactive properties, zzso both zzso and zzso release in the zzso However, little is known about its zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso rewarding effects in mice were dependent upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso was a critical region for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we extend these findings by showing that zzso is indeed able to activate zzso zzso zzso within this zzso To identify genes regulated by acute zzso in the mice zzso zzso and selectively controlled by this zzso we performed zzso experiments by using a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the approximately 24,000 genes from the zzso 27 showed altered expression after exposure to zzso and among these, 59% were partially or totally inhibited by zzso zzso Our results showed that the genes regulated by zzso zzso proteins that belong to zzso factors family, signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso and synaptic zzso These early changes, and especially those controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso might play significant roles in the expression of many of the behaviors that occur following zzso zzso
