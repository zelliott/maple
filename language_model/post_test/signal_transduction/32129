The tumor zzso zzso is a primary sensor of stressful zzso controlling a number of zzso zzso The aim of our study was to examine the roles of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Male wild type and zzso mice were fed a zzso and zzso diet for 8 weeks to induce nutritional zzso zzso expression profiles in normal liver samples and liver samples from patients with zzso liver disease zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso signaling was enhanced in the mouse NASH zzso zzso zzso suppressed the enhanced zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso and ameliorated progression of nutritional zzso In primary cultured zzso transforming growth factor zzso treatment increased zzso and zzso zzso leading to exaggerated zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly elevated in human zzso liver samples, compared with results obtained with normal liver zzso Among zzso patients, those with NASH had significantly higher zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso compared with the group with simple zzso A significant correlation between expression levels of zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso in zzso regulates zzso progression by controlling zzso zzso zzso levels, and zzso all of which may be regulated by zzso Moreover, zzso signaling in the liver appears to be a promising target for the treatment of zzso
