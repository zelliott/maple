In zzso zzso the zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso transcripts are incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and direct it to nascent zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso nascent transcripts further recruit the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso to promote zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso 1 is then formed following recruitment of zzso modification zzso zzso is also required for the upstream production of zzso although the mechanism for this has remained zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso recruits zzso to zzso through zzso an zzso factor zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a genetic screen for zzso that alleviate zzso zzso and this zzso was suppressed by zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso failed to bind zzso a direct interaction with zzso was zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with this, deletion of zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate an alternative mechanism for zzso recruitment and explain the essential role of zzso zzso 1 in zzso zzso zzso
