We have constructed a zzso gene consisting of the promoter of the soybean heat shock zzso gene zzso zzso the coding region of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the termination sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene fusion was introduced into tobacco by zzso gene zzso zzso synthesis of zzso was shown by northern zzso and translation of this zzso into a functional protein was indicated by plant growth on zzso media in a zzso zzso One hour incubation at 40 degrees C per day, applied for several weeks, was sufficient to express the resistant zzso in transgenic plants containing the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso resistance gene is functional and faithfully controlled by the soybean zzso zzso The suitability of these transgenic plants for selection of zzso that alter the zzso response is zzso
