In previous studies of zzso animals, we found that fetal zzso T cell precursors give rise to zzso abnormal peripheral T cell zzso Because most peripheral T zzso in newborn mice are the progeny of fetal T cell zzso this result led to the hypothesis that zzso and adult T cells differ in their functional zzso To investigate this issue, the responses of zzso and adult T cells to zzso zzso and zzso stimulation were zzso When zzso with soluble zzso zzso in the presence of adult accessory cells, zzso T cell proliferation was markedly decreased compared with that of adult T zzso This reduction in proliferation was associated with both quantitative and qualitative differences in zzso zzso At 48 h of stimulation with zzso zzso zzso T cells produced at least zzso less zzso than adult T zzso This apparently accounted for their reduced proliferation because the addition of zzso zzso restored their proliferation to the levels achieved by adult T zzso In striking contrast to adult T cells, zzso T cells zzso large amounts of zzso upon primary stimulation in zzso The differences between zzso and adult T cells in proliferation and zzso production were shown to be specific for zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso and adult T cells showed equivalent proliferation and zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso production by zzso or adult T cells was essentially zzso Thus, in response to zzso zzso freshly isolated zzso and adult T cells show similar functional zzso However, when stimulation occurs via the zzso components of the zzso the responses of zzso T cells resemble those of primed T cells from adult zzso
