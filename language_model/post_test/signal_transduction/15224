zzso cell differentiation is precisely regulated by thousands of genes at different zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso a zzso factor belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is progressively induced during the course of zzso zzso especially at the late zzso The zzso zzso can strongly promote zzso development under zzso conditions, as evidenced by zzso gene transfer or transgenic zzso In addition, an enhancement of zzso responses is also zzso in zzso transgenic mice in zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that the enhanced zzso development is at least in part due to substantial zzso of zzso expression zzso by zzso thereby resulting in zzso to zzso zzso
