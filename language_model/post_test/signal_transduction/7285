zzso zzso represents a key zzso response of the cardiovascular system to low tissue oxygen tension, adjusting local blood flow to meet the zzso requirements in zzso zzso occurs by zzso oxide zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso Under zzso NO is formed by the well-known zzso NO zzso zzso system while under zzso NO is generated from zzso We have unraveled the zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells as a major source of NO generation by reduction of zzso zzso under zzso This mediates hypoxic zzso under zzso conditions without direct involvement of zzso and independently of effects on cardiac zzso
