Resistance to chemotherapy remains one of the principle obstacles to the treatment of colon zzso In order to identify the molecular mechanism of this resistance, we investigated the role of the steroid and zzso zzso zzso in the induction of drug zzso Indeed, this nuclear zzso plays an important role in response to zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso Following drug treatments, SXR is activated and interacts with the zzso X zzso zzso to induce expression of some genes involved in drug metabolism such as phase I zzso (like zzso phase II zzso (like zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we have shown that zzso SXR is activated in response to zzso the active zzso of the zzso drug zzso in human colon cancer cell zzso We have found that zzso SXR zzso into the nucleus and associates with zzso upon zzso zzso Using zzso we have demonstrated that zzso SXR, following its zzso binds to the native promoter of the zzso gene to induce its zzso zzso interference experiments confirmed SXR involvement in zzso zzso and permitted us to identify zzso and zzso zzso as SXR target zzso As a consequence, cells zzso SXR were found to be less sensitive to zzso zzso 

Altogether, these results suggest that the SXR zzso is involved in colon cancer zzso resistance in colon cancer cell line via the zzso of select zzso zzso
