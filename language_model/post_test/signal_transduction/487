The Central zzso zzso and zzso Systems zzso are the two major zzso systems which respond rapidly to numerous challenges that are able to compromise zzso The defensive response strictly linking innate to acquired zzso works continuously to limit pathogen invasion and zzso The efficiency of the innate response is crucial for survival and for an optimum zzso of acquired zzso During infection, the immune response is modulated by an integrated zzso network which zzso innate zzso controls potential harmful effects and also addresses zzso and nutritional modifications supporting immune zzso In the last decade much knowledge has been gained on the molecular signals that orchestrate this integrated zzso response, with focus on the systemic zzso which have a crucial role in driving and controlling an efficient protective zzso These zzso are also able to signal zzso and control zzso zzso which may be involved in the persistence and/or zzso of inflammation that may lead to tissue damage and to a negative zzso impact, causing retarded zzso This review aims to describe some important zzso pathways which drive zzso communication between the zzso and zzso Systems during zzso zzso emphasis is placed on zzso zzso zzso hormones such as zzso zzso Growth hormone zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso and zzso as well as nutritional factors such as zzso zzso Finally, the review includes up-to-date information on this zzso zzso in domestic zzso Data in domestic animal species are still zzso but there are several exciting areas of research, like the potential interaction pathways between zzso zzso zzso regulation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are or could be promising topics of future research in veterinary zzso
