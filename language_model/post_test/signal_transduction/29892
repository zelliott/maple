zzso a growth factor that zzso zzso zzso zzso transport through zzso of zzso zzso in an additive manner to insulin, in muscle zzso In this study, we examined the signaling zzso required for a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso required binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso action in both muscle cells and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso abolished both zzso and zzso zzso zzso To assess whether zzso was necessary for the effects of zzso on zzso zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso negative zzso reduced zzso activity and zzso zzso transport but not zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso abolished both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso muscle, zzso induced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso also zzso the activity of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso partially zzso zzso action on zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso or zzso zzso In all, zzso zzso zzso transport in muscle cells by zzso of a zzso that requires zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and that shows zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be considered as an alternative zzso independent of insulin, to induce zzso zzso
