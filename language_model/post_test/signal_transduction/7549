It is well known that zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso due in large part to stimulation of inflammatory zzso zzso a zzso channel zzso has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for diseases such as zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and more recently, kidney zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to zzso zzso zzso in diabetic mice in association with reduced zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso induced inflammation remains zzso In this study, human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were incubated with zzso (2 zzso for 48 h in the presence or absence of zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were studied in zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling molecules zzso zzso and zzso were measured by Western zzso zzso Using zzso patch clamp techniques we found that zzso induced a large zzso zzso that was inhibited by zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso cells compared to control, an effect that was reversed by in the presence of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso significantly reduced the zzso increase in zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso also reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso signaling zzso and expression of zzso The present study is consistent with a key role for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso the zzso induction of zzso expression in zzso cells via zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso
