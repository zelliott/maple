zzso The zzso currents evoked by zzso zzso on isolated and identified zzso of zzso pedal zzso were investigated using the zzso clamp zzso zzso zzso responses were not modified by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso whereas zzso currents induced by the zzso were zzso It follows that zzso currents are independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso with zzso zzso or zzso induced a slowly developing outward current and reduced zzso response zzso zzso itself did not affect the zzso responses but completely prevented the effects of zzso zzso and zzso This indicated that protein zzso C was not involved in the zzso mechanism for the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso The possible involvement of zzso seems to be improbable because the zzso responses were independent of zzso calcium zzso zzso injection of calcium buffer zzso failed to affect any of the zzso zzso although it effectively blocked the zzso following directly evoked action zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso acid zzso zzso did not change the zzso responses of these zzso zzso The failure to demonstrate the involvement of any known secondary zzso systems in zzso response zzso zzso two assumptions: zzso the zzso protein complex controls the zzso channel zzso or zzso some still unknown zzso system is zzso
