zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso dominant skeletal disorder caused by zzso of zzso Based on the similar expression patterns of zzso and zzso we hypothesized a possible functional interaction between these two zzso Using a zzso cell line zzso we investigated the association of zzso signaling pathways with zzso and the zzso changes of zzso cells due to zzso or suppression of zzso Treatment of cells with zzso enhanced zzso protein levels and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was also induced by zzso These effects were blocked by a dominant negative form of zzso zzso 6 zzso and by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was suppressed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells differentiated into zzso more quickly than zzso control cells, whereas cells zzso with zzso showed slower zzso On the other hand, zzso cells showed an increase of zzso along with the zzso of zzso zzso 3 and zzso of zzso whereas zzso cells showed suppression of zzso In conclusion, zzso acts downstream of the zzso signaling zzso and promotes the differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso
