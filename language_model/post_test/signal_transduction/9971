The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso frequency, smooth muscle membrane potential zzso and zzso zzso of guinea pig zzso zzso were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso caused an zzso decrease in the zzso frequency of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso response was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso toxin zzso zzso This action of zzso was also blocked by the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 10 zzso an action that was reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels were all implicated in the zzso zzso response because it was abolished by zzso blue (20 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso concentration or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the smooth muscle zzso an effect inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused a decrease in zzso zzso However, this was no longer blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused smooth muscle zzso an action that was now not blocked by zzso zzso zzso It was most likely zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso and the opening of zzso channels because it was abolished by zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso at low to moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso frequency primarily by the stimulation of zzso receptors coupled to zzso zzso G proteins and the release of NO from the zzso or enhancement of the actions of zzso zzso At high zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso also directly activates the smooth muscle independent of zzso Both mechanisms of zzso ultimately cause the zzso opening of zzso channels and zzso zzso
