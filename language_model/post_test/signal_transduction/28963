zzso zzso zzso produces zzso effects, which result into an impairment of learning and memory and other neurological zzso We examined whether zzso zzso increases in zzso protein zzso which are typically associated with Alzheimer's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative zzso We injected mice with zzso at cumulative doses of zzso zzso zzso which are approximately equivalent to doses generally consumed by zzso zzso enhanced the formation of zzso oxygen species and induced zzso zzso in the zzso without zzso evidence of zzso zzso An acute or 6 d treatment with zzso increased zzso protein zzso in the zzso revealed by both zzso and paired zzso zzso zzso This increase was restricted to the zzso zzso and lasted 1 and 7 d after acute and repeated zzso treatment, zzso zzso protein was zzso as a result of two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso integration site zzso pathway, with ensuing zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the increase in zzso zzso was attenuated by strategies that rescued the zzso zzso or inhibited zzso Finally, an impairment in zzso spatial learning was induced by doses of zzso that increased zzso zzso although the impairment outlasted this zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in the zzso may contribute to the impairment of learning and memory associated with zzso zzso
