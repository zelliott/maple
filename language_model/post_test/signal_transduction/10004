zzso acid zzso has been proposed to antagonize zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso We report, however, that in zzso zzso tobacco zzso zzso plants, where zzso levels were reduced, zzso levels were not elevated during a hypersensitive response zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso with various zzso of zzso and zzso were assessed in tobacco and zzso zzso zzso These suggested that there was a transient synergistic enhancement in the expression of genes associated with either zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso signaling when both signals were applied at low (typically zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed at more prolonged treatment times or at higher zzso Similar results were also observed when adding the zzso zzso zzso acid with zzso zzso effects on gene expression and plant stress were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leakage and Evans blue zzso indicated that application of higher zzso of zzso + zzso induced plant stress or death and zzso the generation of zzso zzso oxygen zzso This was indicated by enhancement of hydrogen zzso zzso zzso suppression of plant zzso using zzso and direct hydrogen zzso zzso Our data suggests that the outcomes of zzso interactions could be tailored to zzso attack by the relative concentration of each zzso
