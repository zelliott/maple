zzso growth factor 2 zzso has been found to play an zzso and/or a zzso role in adult human zzso cartilage via regulation of multiple signaling zzso Upon zzso zzso a molecular zzso between the zzso activated protein zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso pathways are zzso where zzso positively regulates downstream zzso zzso In this study, we explored the relationship between zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso in zzso signaling in human zzso zzso zzso zzso using both chemical zzso and zzso targeting zzso demonstrated that, upon zzso zzso zzso controlled both Ras and zzso zzso which zzso on the zzso zzso No zzso was observed between Ras and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that both Ras and zzso contributed to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss was effectively reversed by individual zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso zzso culture and cartilage organ culture zzso Our findings suggest that zzso interacts with zzso and then activates Ras and zzso which zzso drive zzso signaling to mediate biological effects of zzso Such an integration of dual zzso constitutes a novel mechanism of zzso signaling cascade in human zzso zzso
