zzso receptors display zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso which seems to be regulated by zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso receptors to subsequent zzso zzso zzso signaling of zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso Moreover, zzso zzso converts the neutral zzso zzso and zzso into inverse zzso suppressing zzso zzso whereas zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso remain neutral zzso at zzso under any zzso This study compares the regulation of zzso signaling of zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors after zzso with zzso or zzso zzso in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and related zzso were compared for binding potency and effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso measuring zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate zzso activity for each zzso zzso which is modulated by zzso with zzso Even closely related zzso zzso display distinct patterns of neutral and inverse effects before and after zzso zzso including distinct zzso between zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso with different zzso has varying effects on inverse and neutral activities of some zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso efficacy is zzso possibly accounting for paradoxical pharmacological zzso zzso profiles at the three zzso receptors under different conditions could lead to zzso with optimal clinical properties in treatment of addiction and adverse zzso zzso
