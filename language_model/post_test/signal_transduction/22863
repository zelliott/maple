Treatment of normal human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso causes a zzso increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso indicate that this induction is at least partly due to increased zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso due to the enhanced transforming growth factor alpha zzso expression plays an important role in the induction of zzso by zzso This is supported by the ability of zzso to rapidly induce zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induction by an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicates the importance of the zzso zzso zzso site in the zzso control of this gene by zzso The increase in zzso zzso by zzso requires zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreases the stability of zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso zzso does zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso signaling zzso controls zzso at the level of zzso stability, while the zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso at the level of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso are not very effective in inducing zzso or zzso expression in several zzso zzso cell lines, indicating zzso in both zzso and zzso response zzso
