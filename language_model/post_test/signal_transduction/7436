zzso zzso acid zzso is a natural zzso product that exhibits zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism behind the zzso activity of zzso has not been well zzso In this study, we investigated how zzso zzso zzso in human leukemia zzso Exposure to zzso significantly increased zzso in both human leukemia cell lines and primary human leukemia zzso This increase was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso c release, zzso X protein zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso death promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, attenuated the zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso Bad zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso down zzso expression using a zzso zzso also significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso Bad zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In zzso the tumor growth zzso caused by zzso was also associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a mouse leukemia zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso may zzso induce zzso in leukemia cells by interrupting the zzso pathway, leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso Bad zzso and zzso zzso which culminate in zzso injury and zzso
