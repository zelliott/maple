zzso of either zzso structural gene zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in increased formation of lateral and zzso roots in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso detected by the zzso traps zzso zzso and zzso zzso Upon zzso exposure to the synthetic zzso zzso acid, NO zzso was zzso enhanced in zzso and zzso compared with the wild zzso In all zzso much zzso zzso zzso originated from zzso The zzso are both localized to the zzso zzso and closely zzso However, their expression levels and patterns zzso zzso zzso the minor activity, and zzso zzso zzso was expressed throughout the zzso the zzso expression pattern was more zzso zzso acid increased zzso lateral root numbers zzso lateral roots per primary zzso in the zzso to twice the number in the wild type, consistent with increased internal NO leading to enhanced zzso signaling in zzso In agreement, zzso and zzso showed increased expression of the zzso reporter zzso in root tips, emerging lateral roots, and zzso We propose that zzso or an zzso zzso is a potential NO source and that reduced zzso activity in the zzso results in greater conversion of zzso to zzso thereby zzso zzso action in zzso This model is supported by supplemental zzso induction of zzso roots and increased NO zzso in zzso and zzso versus the wild zzso
