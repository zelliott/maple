The tomato zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso tomato expressing the zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso zzso in disease resistance, eight sites zzso by zzso in zzso were identified by a combination of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sites revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso of a hypersensitive response in the zzso zzso which is the main zzso zzso site and is located outside the zzso zzso domain, was also required for zzso zzso activity and its physical interaction with zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso domain, was zzso for zzso activity and for interaction with zzso However, a zzso at this site resulted in altered zzso interactions with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of unknown function zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso events at zzso zzso and zzso are required for signal zzso by zzso and participate in distinct molecular zzso
