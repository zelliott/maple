Recent advances in zzso and zzso have unveiled numerous cases of zzso spectrum disorders zzso associated with rare, zzso genetic zzso These findings support a novel view of zzso in which many independent, individually rare genetic zzso each associated with a very high relative risk, together explain a large proportion of zzso Although these rare zzso impact diverse zzso there is accumulating evidence that synaptic zzso including those involving synaptic cell zzso are disrupted in some subjects with zzso These findings provide insights into the zzso of zzso and enable the development of model systems with construct zzso for specific causes of zzso In several zzso disorders frequently associated with zzso including fragile X syndrome, zzso syndrome and zzso zzso animal models have led to the development of new therapeutic approaches, giving rise to optimism with other causes of zzso
