In this study, a new zzso zzso zzso zzso having biologically active molecules was isolated from a mushroom zzso zzso to test its zzso activity on human oral zzso cell zzso zzso We focused on the effect of zzso on zzso the zzso death zzso and the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso zzso could induce a dose and zzso zzso in zzso cells as characterized by cell zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso -9 and an increased expression ratio of zzso The zzso membrane potential loss and zzso c zzso zzso release from zzso to zzso were observed during the zzso Moreover, zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso zzso level and increase zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To further investigate the mechanisms, we examined the effects of zzso scavenger zzso zzso and selective zzso for zzso activated protein zzso zzso pathways on the cell zzso The zzso induced cell death by zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, zzso has a synergistic effect with zzso in suppressing the growth of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells through the zzso zzso dysfunction zzso and provides a zzso framework for further exploring the use of zzso against the proliferation of human oral zzso
