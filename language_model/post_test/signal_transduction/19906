zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso head blight zzso which is a destructive disease on wheat and zzso thereby causing huge economic loss and health problems to human by zzso zzso zzso zzso genes can shed light on zzso underlying the interaction between zzso zzso and its plant zzso However, it is difficult to detect zzso genes for this destructive pathogen by time-consuming and expensive molecular biological experiments in zzso On the other hand, zzso methods provide an alternative way to solve this zzso Since zzso is a complicated procedure that involves complex regulations and zzso the molecular interaction network of zzso zzso can give clues to potential zzso zzso Furthermore, the gene expression data of zzso zzso before and after its invasion into plant host can also provide useful zzso In this paper, a novel systems biology approach is presented to predict zzso genes of zzso zzso based on molecular interaction network and gene expression zzso With a small number of known zzso genes as seed zzso a zzso that consists of potential zzso genes is identified from the zzso interaction network zzso of zzso zzso where the genes in the zzso are further required to be zzso expressed before and after the invasion of the zzso zzso zzso the candidate genes in the zzso are expected to be involved in the same biological processes as seed zzso which imply that they are potential zzso zzso The prediction results show that most of the zzso genes of zzso zzso are enriched in two important signal zzso zzso including G protein coupled zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathway, which are known related to zzso in other zzso In addition, several zzso genes predicted by our method are verified in other zzso zzso which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso The results presented in this paper not only can provide guidelines for future experimental zzso but also shed light on the zzso of the destructive fungus zzso zzso
