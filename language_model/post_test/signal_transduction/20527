We present a new method for the detection of gene pathways associated with a zzso quantitative zzso and use it to identify zzso pathways associated with an imaging zzso characteristic of zzso structural change in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso Our method, known as pathways sparse zzso zzso zzso uses group lasso zzso zzso to jointly model the effects of zzso single zzso zzso zzso grouped into functional pathways using prior knowledge of zzso zzso Pathways are ranked in order of importance using a zzso strategy that exploits finite sample zzso Our application study uses whole zzso scans and MR images from 99 probable zzso patients and zzso healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso zzso zzso are mapped to 185 gene pathways from the zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging signatures characteristic of zzso are obtained by zzso zzso patterns of structural change at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways in our study include those describing insulin zzso vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal zzso All of these have been previously implicated in zzso zzso In a secondary analysis, we investigate zzso and genes that may be driving zzso zzso High ranking genes include a number previously linked in gene expression studies to zzso plaque formation in the zzso brain zzso and to zzso related changes in zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other high ranking previously validated zzso zzso genes include zzso zzso and zzso
