A rearranged zzso alpha zzso remains zzso inactive in zzso zzso but can be induced by zzso signals with zzso maturation of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the same signals silence zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso alpha expression is not detected in zzso zzso while, in contrast, zzso beta expression is initiated at the most immature zzso stage and continues throughout zzso zzso zzso alpha expression is first detected at the intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso stage, increases during transition to the more mature zzso stage and is lost at the zzso zzso Thus, although zzso beta and zzso alpha expression are independent, the zzso complex mediates signals controlling the appearance of alpha beta zzso through selective regulation of zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso
