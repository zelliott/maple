The potential health impact of pharmaceutical waste is now a growing zzso zzso steroids are prominent environmental zzso and thus may act as zzso zzso Numerous zzso hamper zzso cells zzso communication which is known to participate in zzso zzso This has been associated with male zzso and zzso zzso We investigated three contraceptive molecules found in the environment for their potential impact on zzso cells gap junction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four other zzso drugs also found in the environment were included in the zzso Communication disruption was analyzed in zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso modulated zzso trafficking and impaired zzso communication through rapid effects apparently acting on the cell membrane but not on zzso zzso The 4 zzso compounds showed no zzso zzso exposure to steroids increased gap junction zzso which was associated in part with zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso did not appear to be involved in gap junction zzso zzso cells are devoid of zzso and only express the zzso beta zzso zzso zzso was not modified by either zzso The threshold level was surprisingly low, around zzso zzso We conclude that zzso pollutants disrupt zzso cells zzso communication in zzso at zzso that can be found in the zzso
