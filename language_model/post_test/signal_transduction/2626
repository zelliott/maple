The zzso zzso and zzso membrane proteins are putative signaling zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Normally, zzso and zzso mediate distinct cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso which normally interacts with zzso in the early zzso can substitute for zzso throughout zzso When expressed under control of the zzso promoter, an zzso zzso can completely rescue a zzso zzso zzso To substitute for zzso zzso must be able to interact with both zzso and zzso receptors and to mediate a variety of cell interactions during zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essentially equivalent in their ability to influence zzso zzso On the basis of this result, we suggest that the existence of zzso zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso does not reflect the evolution of functionally distinct proteins but rather the imposition of distinct controls of gene expression upon functionally similar zzso Finally, we propose that the zzso of distinct cell fates by the zzso zzso zzso relies on activities functioning downstream of the zzso and zzso rather than on specific zzso zzso
