A critical feature of zzso neural precursors is the zzso displacement of their zzso as cell cycle progresses, thus giving rise to a zzso zzso This nuclear behavior, referred to as zzso nuclear migration zzso is translated into the disposition of the cell zzso at different zzso levels depending on the cell cycle stage they zzso The finding that important regulators of zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso undergo zzso changes of expression and function in coordination with the cell cycle and the zzso and that the zzso process zzso with a particular window of the cell cycle, in coincidence with the zzso zzso in the zzso of neural zzso is a novel concept that zzso our understanding of the zzso process in zzso As such, recent data support the notion that the three-dimensional structure of the zzso is crucial for proper zzso zzso In this review, we describe current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the differential expression and function of the zzso and zzso gene products along the cell cycle, and we discuss important consequences for zzso zzso derived from this zzso
