Strategies to increase fetal zzso zzso levels can zzso symptoms and improve the lives of zzso zzso Although most studies have focused on induction of zzso gene expression as an approach to induce zzso we hypothesized that zzso regulation of zzso plays an underappreciated yet important role in controlling zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether increasing zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of protein translation, could enhance zzso zzso in human primary zzso zzso zzso analysis using a known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso revealed that elevated zzso zzso enhanced zzso production without changing zzso gene zzso zzso or cell zzso These results were further supported by the zzso induction of zzso by other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and by genetic zzso of the negative regulators, zzso and zzso Additionally, we found that this novel mechanism of increasing zzso could be combined with clinically relevant zzso zzso of zzso gene expression to zzso enhance zzso Taken together, these findings identify zzso zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso induction that may be zzso targeted, either alone or in zzso in zzso zzso
