zzso zzso is one of the major zzso of zzso following zzso zzso zzso It is generally accepted that zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso are involved in zzso vascular zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which leads to zzso zzso zzso the authors examined whether zzso zzso contributes to zzso vascular contraction in this zzso 

zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso stimulation in rabbit zzso artery zzso vascular zzso cells zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso contraction of rabbit BA zzso A specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contraction of BA rings in a zzso zzso The concentration of zzso required for 50% zzso of the zzso contraction of BA rings was similar to that for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also inhibited zzso BA zzso in zzso 

The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso vascular zzso
