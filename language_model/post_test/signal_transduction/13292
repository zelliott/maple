We undertook an extensive zzso characterization of the zzso zzso cell line in order to further evaluate whether the line expresses components of zzso regulatory pathways common to the zzso zzso nucleus zzso the central zzso clock in zzso We found that differentiated zzso zzso cultures expressed a broad range of putative clock zzso as well as components of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory pathways found within the zzso in zzso The line also exhibits several zzso that are highly expressed in a zzso pattern and/or zzso localized in the zzso relative to other zzso zzso zzso of a broad complement of zzso regulatory proteins and putative clock genes further support growing evidence in recent reports that the zzso zzso cell line is an appropriate model for investigating the regulation of central zzso zzso
