The gene expression profiles of most human zzso have been studied by determining the zzso of whole tissue zzso Due to the solid composition of zzso it is difficult to study the zzso of individual cell types that compose a zzso To overcome the problem of zzso we have developed a method to isolate individual cell types from whole tissue that are a source of zzso suitable for zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1), and zzso zzso cells, respectively, we separated the cell types of the prostate with magnetic cell sorting zzso Gene expression of zzso cell populations was assessed with zzso zzso Analysis of the data provided insight into gene expression patterns at the level of individual cell populations in the zzso 

In this study, we have determined the zzso profile of a solid tissue at the level of individual cell zzso Our data will be useful for studying prostate development and cancer progression in the context of single cell populations within the zzso
