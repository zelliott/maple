zzso changes in zzso zzso triggered by the zzso of zzso play an essential role in the signal zzso zzso The path for the zzso change is determined by molecular dynamics simulation with a zzso constraint directing the system from the known zzso structure (with the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The simulation is done with a shell of water molecules surrounding the zzso In the switch I region, the side chain of zzso which zzso a large zzso moves through the space between loop 2 and the rest of the zzso rather than on the outside of the zzso As a result, the charged zzso zzso and zzso which interact with zzso in the zzso zzso complex, remain exposed during the zzso In the switch II region, the zzso changes of zzso and loop 4 are strongly zzso A transient hydrogen bonding complex between zzso and zzso in the switch II region and zzso in switch I region zzso the intermediate zzso of zzso and zzso the unwinding of a zzso turn of zzso zzso zzso which in turn permits the larger scale motion of loop zzso zzso bond exchange between the protein and zzso molecules is found to be important in the zzso zzso functional implications of the results are zzso
