zzso zzso acid zzso is nowadays considered to be the sole efficient agent for zzso therapy in zzso however, the mechanisms of zzso biological effects remain largely zzso Here we first reported that zzso zzso leukemia differentiation was accompanied with the increased level of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso To explore the functional role of the activated zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cell differentiation were zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso activity obviously promoted the zzso maturation program triggered by zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is not beneficial for zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that the synergistic zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso might be associated with the protection of zzso acid zzso alpha zzso from degradation by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the accumulated zzso was able to enhance the zzso of its target zzso which might also contribute to the enhanced differentiation of leukemia zzso Together, by linking the zzso to zzso zzso our data provide a novel insight into studying the mechanisms of zzso cellular effects and imply the possibility of combination of zzso and zzso zzso in leukemia zzso
