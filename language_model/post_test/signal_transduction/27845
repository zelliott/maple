zzso synthesis of zzso growth factors zzso has been broadly implicated in skeletal muscle growth, zzso and zzso zzso delivered IGF-1 genes induce local skeletal muscle zzso and zzso age-related skeletal muscle zzso restoring and improving muscle mass and strength in zzso Here we show that the molecular pathways underlying the zzso action of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle are similar to those responsible for cardiac zzso zzso IGF-1 gene expression in zzso skeletal zzso activates zzso calcium zzso by inducing zzso transcripts and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso mimics the effects of IGF-1, whereas expression of a zzso zzso zzso or addition of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso Either IGF-1 or activated zzso zzso expression of the zzso factor zzso which accumulates in a subset of zzso zzso where it associates with zzso and a specific zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso Thus, IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso a marker of skeletal muscle zzso which zzso with selected zzso zzso to activate gene expression zzso
