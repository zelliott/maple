zzso Parkinson's disease zzso is most likely caused by a combination of environmental zzso and genetic zzso although there are rare zzso forms of the zzso zzso impairment at complex I, zzso stress, zzso zzso and dysfunctional protein degradation, have been implicated in zzso zzso but how they are related to each other is zzso To further evaluated zzso zzso here, we used in zzso and in zzso models of chronic zzso complex I zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure in zzso caused zzso modification of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the effects become more regionally restricted such that systemic complex I zzso eventually results in highly selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction were also seen in zzso and these effects could be prevented with zzso Thus, chronic exposure to a zzso and zzso toxin brings into play three systems, zzso zzso and the zzso system, and implies that zzso dysfunction and zzso stress link environmental and genetic forms of the zzso
