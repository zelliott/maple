Several psychiatric disorders are associated with white matter zzso suggesting that zzso zzso abnormalities zzso some aspects of these zzso zzso 1 zzso and its zzso zzso are genetically linked with zzso to schizophrenia and bipolar zzso In zzso studies suggest that zzso signaling is important for OL zzso To test whether zzso signaling contributes to psychiatric disorders by regulating the structure or function of zzso we analyzed transgenic mice in which zzso signaling is blocked in zzso in zzso Here we show that loss of zzso signaling leads to changes in OL number and zzso reduced zzso zzso and slower zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, these transgenic mice have increased levels of zzso receptors and zzso and behavioral zzso consistent with zzso zzso These results indicate that defects in white matter can cause zzso in zzso function and behavior relevant to zzso zzso
