The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso organ in which zzso cells, which are most akin to the common zzso zzso in zzso zzso and differentiate into three types of mature zzso crystal cells and zzso functions of which are reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso During the first and early second zzso of zzso development, the zzso zzso contains only zzso whereas in the third zzso a zzso region of the primary lobe of the zzso zzso called the zzso zone contains these zzso and maturing blood cells are found juxtaposed in a peripheral region designated the cortical zzso A third group of cells referred to as the zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells, zzso blood cells respond to multiple stresses including zzso infection and zzso zzso However, how systemic signals are sensed by zzso zzso to regulate zzso determination has not been well zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso are direct targets of systemic zzso and nutritional zzso zzso zzso signals, and that these systemic signals maintain the zzso by promoting zzso zzso in zzso zzso We expect that this study will promote investigation of such possible direct signal sensing mechanisms by zzso zzso zzso
