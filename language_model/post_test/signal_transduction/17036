zzso cells, the major zzso zzso subset in human peripheral blood, represent a zzso subset that displays zzso against microbial agents and zzso The biology of zzso T cells remains poorly zzso We show zzso that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso entry zzso zzso is a major regulator of zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso was strongly expressed at the surface of resting zzso T cells and zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso blockade by zzso zzso resulted in the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso interaction led to a decrease in zzso proliferation by inducing a partial zzso zzso Our data also suggested that zzso might participate in the control of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the proliferation of zzso zzso T cells after zzso to zzso cells was dramatically reduced through zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso interaction with zzso may play a role in zzso by interfering with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso stimulation of zzso T cells appears as a new possible mechanism of immune escape by zzso zzso
