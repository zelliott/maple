To get a better understanding of the role of zzso and zzso zzso during development and in whole animal zzso we have disrupted the mouse zzso and zzso zzso gene by gene zzso Most of the mice with a disrupted zzso zzso gene die within the first hours after birth due to severe lung zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso in the liver is zzso Feed back control of the zzso synthesis via the zzso axis is zzso leading to increased plasma levels of zzso and zzso zzso Increased activity of the zzso axis results in extensive zzso and zzso of the cortical zones of the adrenal and induction of genes involved in steroid zzso The adrenal zzso is zzso and severely reduced in size; cells capable of adrenaline synthesis are zzso zzso zzso deficient mice die around day 10 after zzso Weight loss precedes death of zzso zzso mice and is correlated with an increase in the zzso As a consequence of this zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso II, and zzso are highly zzso
