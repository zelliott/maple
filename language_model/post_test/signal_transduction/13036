zzso formation is thought to be regulated by an unknown zzso mechanism that causes the cells of the zzso zzso to activate and then repress the zzso of specific genes in a cyclical zzso These zzso create zzso of gene expression that repeatedly pass through the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In both the mouse and the zzso it has been shown that the notch zzso is required to create the zzso of gene zzso However, it is not clear if the notch zzso comprises part of the zzso mechanism or if the notch zzso simply coordinates the activity of the zzso among neighboring zzso In the zzso zzso in the expression of a zzso zzso factor, zzso and the notch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study focuses on how the zzso in the expression of these two genes is affected in the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and in double zzso zzso This analysis indicates that these zzso in gene expression are created by a genetic circuit comprised of the notch zzso and the notch target gene zzso We also show that a later function of the notch zzso can create a zzso pattern even in the absence of prior zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
