zzso of zzso cells is regulated by zzso and zzso factors whose actions are zzso by complex interactions of multiple signaling zzso Both vascular zzso growth factor zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso stimulate cell proliferation and activate the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade in bovine brain zzso zzso zzso zzso We have extended these findings to show that both zzso activate zzso via stimulation of zzso zzso of zzso is inhibited by increasing zzso zzso levels zzso or via stimulation of zzso expressed zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso activity are blocked in the presence of zzso or zzso by zzso The actions of increased zzso appear to be zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso since treatment with zzso a the specific inhibitor of zzso reversed the zzso effect of elevated zzso levels on zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso in zzso activity inhibit zzso cell zzso These findings zzso in cultured zzso cells, that the zzso signaling zzso is potentially an important zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso of the zzso cascade and cell zzso
