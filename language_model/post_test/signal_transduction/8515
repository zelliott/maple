To investigate the efficacy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in directly blocking tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso 

The efficacy of a zzso zzso against zzso in blocking zzso differentiation of zzso cells zzso with zzso was zzso In addition, zzso human zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso and zzso formation and bone erosion were assessed in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso dose zzso reduced zzso differentiation and bone zzso in zzso cultures zzso with zzso or zzso plus zzso In human zzso mice, zzso blockade did not inhibit joint zzso but it strongly reduced zzso formation in inflamed zzso as well as bone erosion in zzso Neither the cell influx into zzso nor the zzso expression of zzso and zzso changed with zzso zzso while the zzso expression of zzso was significantly zzso In contrast, zzso systemic bone loss was not inhibited by zzso zzso 

These data suggest that blockade of zzso directly affects zzso formation in zzso and in zzso suggesting a direct and specific effect of zzso therapy on zzso independently of its zzso zzso This effect adds significantly to the zzso potential of zzso blockade of zzso in zzso
