zzso zzso infection of mice with zzso zzso virus zzso results in zzso weight loss, zzso by T cells and gamma zzso zzso Here, we assessed the role of zzso T cells and zzso on immune cell recruitment and zzso zzso production in the central nervous system zzso after zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso mice had decreased recruitment of zzso cells to the zzso and diminished levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso fluid zzso Mice deficient in zzso had decreased zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreased zzso of both resident zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso The effects of zzso signaling on zzso lineage cells was assessed using transgenic mice, called zzso insensitive to zzso zzso zzso mice, that express a zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso mice had decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to controls despite having normal numbers of zzso zzso T cells in the zzso zzso mice also had decreased recruitment of zzso zzso and decreased zzso of both resident zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso mice were significantly protected from zzso anorexia and weight zzso Thus, these data suggest that zzso zzso production of zzso promotes signaling in zzso lineage cells, which control zzso the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso of resident zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso weight zzso
