zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso are widely used in human zzso although their mechanisms of action are poorly zzso Here we report that, in mice, zzso causes cell death and the subsequent release of host cell DNA, which acts as a potent zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that host DNA signaling zzso regulates zzso and zzso production after zzso zzso We suggest that, on the one hand, host DNA zzso primary B cell responses, including zzso production, through zzso response factor 3 zzso zzso On the other hand, we suggest that host DNA also stimulates zzso T helper type 2 zzso responses, associated with zzso zzso switching and peripheral zzso responses, through zzso zzso The finding that host DNA released from dying cells acts as a zzso molecular pattern that mediates zzso zzso activity may increase our understanding of the mechanisms of action of current vaccines and help in the design of new zzso
