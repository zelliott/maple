A zzso relationship study of zzso a previously identified inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by bone zzso protein zzso type 1 receptors zzso 3, and 6, revealed that increased zzso activity could be accomplished by replacing the zzso zzso ring with zzso The activity contributions of various nitrogen atoms in the core zzso ring were also examined by preparing and evaluating zzso and zzso zzso In addition, increased mouse liver zzso stability was achieved by replacing the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso ring with zzso Finally, an zzso compound 13 zzso or zzso demonstrated moderate zzso characteristics zzso plasma zzso following zzso administration in zzso These studies provide useful molecular zzso for examining the in zzso pharmacology of zzso signaling zzso
