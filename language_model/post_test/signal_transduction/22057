zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso agent with high selectivity for zzso zzso Many tumors, however, are resistant to TRAIL zzso Although cellular zzso of zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso are often zzso in zzso their role in zzso TRAIL resistance remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of liver cancer cells is associated with degradation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso remains zzso Lower zzso of TRAIL causing minimal or no zzso do not alter zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso as well as zzso with a second zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (which results in rapid depletion of zzso zzso the cells to zzso zzso loss of zzso and zzso requires zzso zzso In particular, zzso 8 zzso zzso both zzso and zzso while zzso 9 zzso prevents zzso but not zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed zzso is a zzso for zzso 8, with likely multiple zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso proceeds through zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso depletion of zzso by zzso zzso in conjunction with TRAIL may be beneficial for the treatment of human zzso zzso
