Although some genes that zzso sensory or regulatory elements for zzso flowering are zzso between the zzso zzso plant zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plant rice, the gene networks that control rice zzso and particularly flowering under zzso conditions, are not well zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso T 1 zzso the closest zzso to Heading date zzso zzso is a major floral zzso under zzso zzso An zzso fusion protein localized in the shoot zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso is a zzso gene in zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso a rice zzso of zzso zzso OF zzso OF zzso 1 zzso did not flower up to 300 days after zzso under zzso conditions, indicating that zzso which acts upstream of zzso promotes flowering under zzso zzso We propose that both positive zzso and zzso and negative zzso zzso and zzso regulators of zzso form a gene network that regulates zzso flowering in zzso Among these regulators, zzso a zzso floral zzso zzso multiple pathways to regulate zzso leading to flowering under appropriate zzso zzso A rice zzso of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the floral zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso plants, suggesting that zzso is activated by zzso protein in the SAM after the transition to zzso We have thus exposed a network of genes that regulate zzso flowering in zzso
