The zzso zzso system of zzso coli displays a zzso all-or-nothing response at intermediate levels of zzso where the population divides into a fraction zzso the sugar at a high rate zzso and a fraction not utilizing zzso zzso Here we study this decision process in individual cells, focusing on the dynamics of the transition from the zzso to the zzso Using quantitative zzso zzso we determine the time delay between zzso addition and zzso onset of a zzso zzso Through independent characterization of the zzso maturation process, we can separate the lag time caused by the reporter from the intrinsic zzso time of the zzso zzso The resulting distribution of intrinsic time delays scales zzso with the external zzso zzso and is compatible with a simple zzso model for zzso zzso Our findings support the idea that the zzso timing of gene induction is zzso related to a broad distribution of zzso proteins at the time of sugar zzso
