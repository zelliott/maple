zzso evidence suggests a positive correlation between the number of zzso and the risk of zzso vascular zzso The observation that activated zzso induce zzso zzso my provide some biological zzso to the role of zzso in zzso Between other zzso products, zzso G, a zzso released during zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso However, the zzso present in plasma could virtually abolish its zzso zzso it was shown that, when zzso were zzso after interaction with zzso in mixed cell population, zzso zzso zzso may result in the formation of a zzso zzso in which zzso G activity is protected by zzso zzso zzso was also shown to facilitate the zzso metabolism of zzso acid, resulting in increased production of both zzso B2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso to activated zzso in mixed cell suspensions subjected to high zzso rate can be modeled as an zzso cascade involving a zzso recognition step followed by an zzso interaction zzso by the zzso zzso Moreover, an intermediate zzso signal regulating zzso zzso is zzso zzso activated zzso express not only zzso but also different zzso zzso including zzso and zzso Some of the functional responses zzso by zzso on zzso could be prevented by specific zzso to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that this adhesive zzso is able to zzso an zzso signal when engaged by the zzso By using activated zzso zzso zzso cells and soluble zzso zzso zzso was shown to trigger protein zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso function of zzso In conclusion, adherence of activated zzso to zzso may be a key event in the sequence of zzso zzso The recognition of the essential contribution of zzso zzso in addition to zzso in zzso zzso provides an additional evidence to the broad range of function and mechanisms in which zzso zzso are involved and may be potential targets for pharmacological zzso
