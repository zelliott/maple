zzso a process by which new vascular networks are formed from pre-existing zzso is required for tumors to grow, zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso a specific zzso to zzso cells, is a crucial factor for tumor zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso a newly developed zzso zzso could inhibit melanoma growth and improve survival in nude mice by suppressing the zzso zzso We found here that zzso inhibited melanoma growth and improved survival in nude mice by suppressing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited the zzso increase in DNA synthesis and tube formation in zzso cells by suppressing zzso zzso zzso oxygen species generation and Ras zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso decreased DNA synthesis and increased zzso cell death of cultured melanoma cells as zzso Our present study suggests that zzso might suppress melanoma growth and improve survival in nude mice by two independent zzso one is by blocking the zzso signaling in zzso cells, and the other is by inducing zzso cell death of zzso The present study provides a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso
