zzso is an zzso zzso commonly used in agriculture yet classified by the Stockholm Convention in 2011 as a persistent organic zzso zzso Its potential toxicity makes its continued use a major public health zzso Despite studies in laboratory animals, the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso in human liver remain poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso liver zzso First, we found that zzso disrupted the zzso zzso Indeed, cells exposed to zzso were initially zzso to zzso and thereafter recovered their resistance to this zzso This phenomenon occurred in parallel to the induction of the zzso to zzso zzso process, as demonstrated zzso zzso reorganization of the zzso zzso together with zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso induction of Snail and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso induction and reorganization of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso despite the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso failed to zzso This zzso to acquire a zzso zzso could be attributed to a disruption of the interaction between the zzso and the zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso profoundly alters the zzso of liver cells by inducing cell detachment and partial zzso as well as zzso the zzso zzso All these events account, at least in part, for the zzso potential of zzso in zzso
