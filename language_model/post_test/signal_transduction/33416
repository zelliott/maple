It has been proposed that the zzso attack on the pancreatic beta cells leading to zzso diabetes zzso can be caused by the expression of zzso class II molecules on the beta zzso zzso mice expressing normal levels of zzso zzso class II Ak on the zzso surface zzso do not develop either zzso or diabetes, yet these mice are not tolerant to Ak when expressed on normal zzso zzso The authors have zzso T cells from zzso mice in zzso with zzso beta zzso Mice were also primed in zzso in order to facilitate the zzso zzso The authors found that neither zzso positive nor zzso negative mice were able to respond to zzso beta cells, and that in zzso zzso does not overcome this zzso They suggest that beta cells do not act as zzso cells, probably due to inability of delivering zzso zzso This strengthens the notion that zzso class II expression per zzso is not sufficient to induce an zzso attack on the beta zzso
