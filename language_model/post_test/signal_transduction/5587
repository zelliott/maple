zzso zzso zzso have gained considerable prominence as ubiquitous zzso binding zzso however, their precise roles in zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways and mechanisms of regulation remain zzso From experiments with zzso an zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso we derived a complete molecular description of an zzso zzso signaling zzso First, binding of the zzso domain to each of three zzso zzso complexes regulated their zzso activities but did not require zzso zzso However, zzso of a zzso zzso within a zzso zzso motif of zzso triggered its zzso association with the zzso domain of zzso thus blocking its interactions with each of the three zzso The solution structure of this zzso form and further zzso studies showed how a previously unidentified zzso zzso blocked the access of the target zzso to a common zzso interaction surface and how this shared surface zzso three functionally zzso but structurally diverse, binding zzso Thus, our data reveal an zzso versatility in the zzso domain that allows for the transformation of multiple zzso zzso into various downstream regulatory zzso
