During zzso the human zzso invades zzso zzso zzso reducing the zzso connections among zzso cell zzso Since zzso interaction can induce repulsive forces to control cell position and movement, we examined the possible involvement of this system in zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso A zzso on human zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells was examined by zzso zzso and western zzso The effects of zzso zzso A1 on zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells were also examined by western zzso A zzso zzso was performed to determine the effects of zzso A1 on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and A4 zzso were detected in human zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, and zzso A1 was present in human zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso and A4 receptors were expressed on the cell surface region of zzso and zzso zzso cells in human zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso protein in the human zzso was confirmed by western zzso zzso zzso zzso A1 was bound to zzso cells and induced zzso of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso In addition, stimulation by zzso A1 for 20 zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso cells versus control cultures zzso zzso zzso without affecting cell zzso 

This study demonstrated that the zzso A system can promote zzso zzso in zzso cells suggesting an important role in the initial step of zzso zzso by opening the zzso zzso cell zzso
