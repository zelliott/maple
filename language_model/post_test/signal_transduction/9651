zzso zzso gene 2 zzso is one of the key regulatory genes that maintain the zzso and zzso properties in embryonic stem zzso Here we used zzso to analyze the expression of zzso in human prostate zzso and found it contributed to zzso and correlated with zzso grade and zzso zzso We further investigated zzso function in cell growth and zzso process by using a human prostate cancer cell line zzso with zzso zzso or zzso Cell cycle zzso revealed that zzso promoted cell growth and increased the percentage of cells in S zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso experiments in zzso mice further demonstrated that zzso increased the zzso properties of zzso cells with decreased function of zzso zzso entry and reduced expression of zzso at both zzso and protein levels, suggesting a potential mechanism that contributes to the zzso property of zzso To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate zzso function in zzso and zzso of human prostate cancer and to zzso its regulatory effect on the activity of zzso zzso zzso Our results support the concept that zzso has the potential to be a significant marker to evaluate the progression of prostate cancer and serve as a potentially useful target for prostate cancer zzso
