zzso signaling in the nucleus zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso food zzso To further investigate the role of zzso signaling in taste zzso we used a sensory specific zzso zzso paradigm to zzso specific flavors of nutritionally identical food zzso in zzso In the zzso infusion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso selectively increased consumption of a zzso flavor, thus reversing the zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso signaling with the zzso zzso zzso selectively decreased consumption of a recently consumed flavor, zzso the zzso zzso No enhancement of consumption was observed if a delay of 3 h was imposed following the zzso zzso zzso indicating that there were no long-term changes in flavor zzso If a delay was introduced between the initial flavor exposure and the zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso consumption was increased zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that close zzso zzso between flavor experience and zzso zzso action is critical for the zzso effect on flavor zzso In contrast to zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso by local zzso of zzso (a zzso zzso increased consumption of both the zzso and zzso flavors zzso These results demonstrate that zzso released in the zzso during consumption of palatable foods produce a selective and transient increase in preference for a recently sampled zzso
