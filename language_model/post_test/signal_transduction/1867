The family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso signal zzso regulating cell survival and gene zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso on zzso loop zzso zzso and stimulation of its zzso activity, which, in turn, results in zzso of several downstream signaling zzso Recently, the zzso activity of zzso has been found to be subject to negative regulation through various mechanisms including association with zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of the turnover of activated zzso In zzso cells zzso was zzso and zzso or gamma zzso stimulation induced zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was rapidly zzso through zzso By using different zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso on zzso was required for zzso degradation and for zzso zzso of zzso The zzso inhibitor treatment stabilized the zzso protein complex and inhibited the zzso of zzso In zzso these results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which provides an additional mechanism to control zzso of zzso and maintain cellular zzso
