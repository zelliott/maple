The zzso zzso zzso is known to be poorly zzso to the cell surface when expressed in a variety of cell zzso We tested the hypothesis that the surface expression and signaling of zzso might be enhanced by zzso with other G zzso receptors zzso zzso of zzso with more than 25 related zzso revealed that only zzso with the zzso zzso zzso increased the surface zzso of zzso in human embryonic zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso confirmed a physical interaction between the two zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso expressed alone was mainly zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso was predominantly localized to the plasma zzso zzso binding studies revealed a significant increase in zzso binding sites upon zzso with zzso with no apparent change in affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, analyses of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso when zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, substantial zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso was observed when zzso was zzso with zzso These data reveal that zzso can interact with zzso in cells in a manner that regulates zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso
