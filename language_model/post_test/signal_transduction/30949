zzso damage to skin is a key diagnostic and zzso zzso for patients accidentally exposed to zzso Moreover, skin is a target organ for crucial zzso of routine zzso The zzso of the zzso radiation reaction is in many respects still zzso The acute inflammatory radiation reaction of skin has been shown to involve zzso in zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso by cellular zzso zzso 

To evaluate the effect of zzso radiation on zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human skin zzso 

zzso zzso cells, a three-dimensional skin model and skin zzso were investigated for zzso expression after zzso radiation using flow zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells zzso with protein zzso zzso and zzso prior to zzso was zzso by flow zzso 

Using different sources of skin cells, we demonstrated a consistent zzso of both zzso zzso and protein expression by zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso necrosis zzso another zzso zzso does not account for the effect of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was significantly attenuated by zzso to protein zzso C, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso suppressed the effect of radiation on zzso zzso suggesting its usefulness to treat the zzso radiation zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso is a consistent inflammatory zzso of the zzso radiation reaction both in zzso and in zzso that might provide new therapeutic options for diagnosis and treatment of effects of zzso
