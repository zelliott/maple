zzso development in the zzso is characterized by changing expression patterns of zzso and zzso zzso molecules and by changes in zzso and zzso gene zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso signals, zzso progress through zzso zzso such as conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso into intermediate zzso zzso that appear to require zzso changes in zzso expression than can be accomplished by zzso regulation zzso zzso we considered the possibility that zzso stimulation of zzso zzso not only affects zzso gene zzso but also affects zzso zzso zzso Indeed, we found that zzso signals in zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in their rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown for zzso to be dependent on target sequences in the zzso region of the zzso zzso signals also zzso affected zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso terminating zzso gene zzso but only zzso reducing zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso and zzso regulatory mechanisms act zzso in signaled zzso zzso to promote the rapid conversion of these cells into intermediate zzso zzso We suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a mechanism by which zzso expression in developing zzso is rapidly altered at critical points in the differentiation of these zzso
