Rapid tumor growth and zzso require increased zzso zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Both activities are zzso by zzso zzso and are dependent upon protein zzso zzso zzso expression in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular transformation and zzso in part, by stimulating the zzso translation initiation factor, zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso to zzso zzso have markedly decreased tumor growth rates and zzso capacity, without altered zzso growth zzso zzso we demonstrate that in zzso zzso is zzso suppressed resulting in decreased zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso is suppressed in zzso cells indicating that zzso can neither generate nor import the zzso necessary to support rapid tumor zzso These data provide evidence that zzso is the link between zzso zzso and increased zzso metabolism and support the hypothesis that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso
