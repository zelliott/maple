zzso zzso zzso is zzso in most zzso zzso where signaling through zzso contributes to cancer cell proliferation and zzso The limited clinical efficacy of zzso zzso suggests that identification of resistance mechanisms may identify new pathways for therapeutic zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso and activated via both zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we tested the consequences of zzso zzso in zzso zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cancer models to determine whether zzso blockade can enhance responses to zzso zzso 

zzso expression was assessed in human zzso tumors that recurred following zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were treated with a zzso decoy to determine zzso zzso and the effects on zzso target gene expression by Western zzso In zzso zzso included evaluation of zzso efficacy of zzso decoy in zzso and zzso models followed by zzso for zzso target protein zzso 

zzso zzso with a zzso decoy reduced cellular viability and the expression of zzso target genes in zzso inhibitor resistance zzso The addition of a zzso inhibitor to zzso blocking strategies significantly enhanced zzso effects in zzso zzso from zzso tumors that recurred following zzso treatment showed increased zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso contributes to zzso inhibitor resistance both in zzso and zzso cancer where zzso targeting of zzso may represent an effective treatment zzso
