In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals to the nucleus through interactions with zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso is artificially engineered to restrict it to the zzso by fusion with the zzso domain of zzso zzso it efficiently zzso a zzso axis zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso maternal zzso normally zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso Two models have been proposed to explain the zzso activity of zzso 1) that zzso zzso the machinery involved in the turnover of zzso zzso which then accumulates and zzso maternal zzso and 2) that zzso directly acts to inhibit zzso zzso To distinguish between these models, we created a series of zzso deletion zzso of zzso and examined their ability to induce an zzso axis in zzso activate a zzso reporter zzso stabilize zzso and zzso with components of the zzso signaling zzso zzso does not zzso with the zzso zzso component zzso but it does lead to the zzso of zzso and zzso two proteins involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases levels of zzso zzso however, this effect does not completely explain its signaling zzso Although zzso and zzso stabilize zzso to similar zzso zzso activates OT to zzso to zzso higher levels than zzso Moreover, although zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso to activate zzso both suppress the signaling activity of zzso In contrast, zzso suppresses the signaling activity of both zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the zzso of zzso cells by zzso Based on these data, we conclude that, in addition to its effects on zzso zzso interacts with other components of the zzso pathway, perhaps zzso and that these interactions contribute to its signaling zzso
