A growing body of evidence implicates zzso and/or its zzso zzso in the zzso of insulin zzso We have developed a highly specific small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso that zzso a necessary step in the conversion of zzso to zzso In cultured zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso and zzso reversed abnormalities in insulin signal zzso When administered to mice and rats, zzso significantly reduced zzso but not zzso zzso in various zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso their elevated tissue zzso levels, markedly lowered circulating zzso levels, improved oral zzso zzso reduced zzso and improved insulin sensitivity in muscle and zzso zzso beneficial zzso effects were seen in high zzso mice and zzso zzso These findings provide further evidence that zzso zzso of zzso may be involved in zzso the link between obesity and insulin resistance and that interference with zzso zzso might present a novel approach to the therapy of states of impaired insulin action such as type 2 zzso
