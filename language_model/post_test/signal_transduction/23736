Few families of signaling factors have been implicated in the control of zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso and zzso a neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine hormone, as a class of zzso signals in both chick and zzso We show that signals from the anterior zzso are required for the formation of anterior zzso zzso with one of the signals being zzso zzso controls zzso expression of zzso and both peptides regulate zzso in lens and zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso and zzso signaling leads to severe reduction of lens zzso Our findings not only uncover these zzso as zzso signals but also identify a zzso mechanism that zzso zzso in zzso zzso and may explain the ancient evolutionary origin of zzso predating a complex nervous zzso
