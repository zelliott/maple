To understand the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the vascular system, we have generated zzso zzso zzso mice had a moderately decreased zzso blood zzso In response to zzso II they showed an almost complete loss of the sustained blood pressure response, while the initial increase was zzso zzso mice showed a marked reduction in zzso media zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cell proliferation was zzso but there was a marked decrease in zzso zzso zzso Our results establish a role for zzso in blood pressure regulation and vascular zzso II zzso
