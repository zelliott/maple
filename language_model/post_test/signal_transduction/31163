zzso precursor particles are initially assembled in the zzso prior to their transfer to the zzso and export to the zzso In a screen to identify zzso zzso zzso defective in the export of zzso zzso zzso we isolated the zzso zzso In this strain, zzso zzso of the zzso reporter was zzso by zzso (a zzso of the E1 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modifier zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso export zzso A directed analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that many zzso zzso factors are zzso zzso zzso particles along both the zzso and the zzso synthesis pathways were decorated with zzso showing its direct zzso zzso with this, early zzso assembly factors were genetically linked to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the nuclear pore complex zzso was functionally linked to the zzso export factor zzso Together our data suggest that zzso of zzso particles in the nucleus and subsequent zzso at the zzso is necessary for efficient zzso zzso and export in zzso
