zzso bystander effects are now an established phenomenon seen in numerous zzso however it is not known whether the magnitude of the bystander effect is determined by the signal produced by the zzso cells or the response of the exposed zzso The aim of this investigation is to determine the importance of the bystander signal versus the bystander response in three different cell line zzso 

A zzso design experiment using cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was set up to produce zzso cell zzso medium zzso which was used to treat all cell zzso 

For zzso and zzso lines, the response to zzso zzso was significantly different to that when treated with zzso generated from another zzso These lines displayed no response to zzso zzso nor did zzso cells show a significant response to any zzso suggesting that zzso plays a key role in the bystander zzso 

These data suggest, for these cell lines at least, that in the case of cell lines capable of responding to the bystander zzso it is the signal produced by the zzso cell that determines the magnitude of the bystander zzso
