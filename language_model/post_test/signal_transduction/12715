We have previously demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso located in the zzso joint zzso of rats zzso a significantly greater zzso zzso in zzso females than in zzso females zzso zzso serum levels than zzso and zzso These findings indicate that zzso hormones decrease zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate some of the mechanisms by which zzso hormones decrease zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated a significantly lower zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso of intact males than in intact and zzso zzso females and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso Taken together these findings suggest that zzso hormones, especially male zzso hormones, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso in males and zzso These findings suggest that zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso region is zzso by the zzso zzso in both zzso Despite the involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso hormones do not diminish the activity of this zzso to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso they significantly reduce zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso
