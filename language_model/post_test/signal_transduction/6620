Most investigations of the mechanism of regulated zzso have involved the use of zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso In our previous work we have used zzso zzso zzso For zzso to occur from rat mast cells under these latter conditions, a dual zzso system zzso zzso and a zzso zzso are zzso together they are zzso Here we compare the zzso from mast cells zzso in solutions of different zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso had little zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affected the zzso extent of zzso zzso by the dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso but had little influence on the effective affinity for zzso The zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso and zzso permitted zzso to be zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso by 20 zzso zzso whereas the extent of zzso zzso is zzso to the concentration of zzso in mixed zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso due to the single zzso requires zzso zzso zzso and is prevented by zzso of protein zzso zzso These results point to the existence of two parallel pathways for control of zzso in zzso cells, one zzso dependent, the other zzso zzso
