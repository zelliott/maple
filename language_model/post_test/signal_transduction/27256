zzso a cholesterol-lowering drug, has zzso properties that may be related to its zzso of protein zzso We examined the effects of zzso on signal zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso signaling events in a zzso and zzso manner in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso surface expression after zzso stimulation was blocked by zzso although no zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso signaling events, including zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were similarly inhibited by zzso although global protein zzso zzso activity remained zzso In a zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso production but failed to affect zzso zzso zzso zzso at similar doses, also disrupted zzso processing of zzso and inhibited zzso signals, including zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso after zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso properties of zzso may be independent of zzso and could result from zzso protein zzso zzso from distinct signal zzso zzso
