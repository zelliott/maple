We have examined the possible zzso of zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso C zzso in the zzso signaling pathways of various growth factors by the use of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso DNA synthesis varied significantly and systematically in response to growth factors: zzso responses of cells to zzso zzso and zzso were almost completely abolished both in zzso and zzso zzso responses to zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso were reduced to approximately 50% both in zzso and zzso cells compared with native zzso response to basic zzso growth factor zzso was not affected in zzso cells but was inhibited to some extent in zzso zzso Thus, growth factors examined have been classified into three groups with regard to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in their signal zzso zzso zzso of each growth factor to its zzso was not affected significantly by zzso of cells with zzso or zzso zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso on each zzso DNA synthesis were not zzso suggesting that the functions of zzso zzso and zzso lie on an identical signal zzso zzso Although all three groups of zzso activated zzso signaling of each growth factor depends to a varying extent on the function of zzso Our results indicate that a single zzso growth factor such as zzso zzso or zzso acts through multiple signaling pathways to induce cell zzso
