zzso cells are activated in response to brain zzso the mechanisms of this process are not yet zzso One of the important signaling mechanisms that might be involved in zzso zzso is related to changes in the zzso calcium concentration zzso Using zzso zzso we have found that external application of the complement zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso in corpus zzso zzso Similarly, application of complement fragments zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso generates zzso zzso zzso composed of an initial peak followed by a plateau in cultured zzso zzso of zzso cells for 30 zzso with zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso responses, suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso in the signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso solution eliminated the plateau phase and limited the response to the initial zzso The restoration of the zzso zzso concentration within zzso zzso after the beginning of the complement zzso zzso zzso led to the recovery of the plateau zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pumps with 500 zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso and blocked the zzso signals in response to subsequent complement zzso zzso Our data suggest that complement factors induce zzso responses by zzso release from internal pools and subsequent zzso of zzso entry controlled by the filling state of the zzso zzso zzso
