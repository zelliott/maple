zzso zzso pain is a chronic condition that may produce plastic changes in several brain zzso The zzso locus zzso zzso is a crucial component of ascending and descending pain zzso both of which are frequently compromised after nerve zzso 

The objective of the study was to examine whether chronic zzso injury zzso a model of zzso pain, alters zzso activity in the rat zzso 

zzso in the zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso while protein expression was monitored in western blots and by zzso 

The pain threshold had dropped in injured rats 7 days after inducing zzso While zzso mediate activity in the zzso and in its terminal areas, no zzso in either spontaneous zzso activity or zzso zzso levels were observed following zzso Moreover, zzso activity in the zzso of zzso rats remained unchanged after systemic administration of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso were similar in zzso and control animals following local administration of zzso or zzso In addition, there were no changes in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso or the regulators of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso in the spinal cord, zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso nucleus zzso following zzso 

zzso pain is not accompanied by modifications in zzso zzso activity after the onset of zzso This may indicate that the signals from the zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cancel one another zzso
