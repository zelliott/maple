zzso is a small zzso that is a potent zzso zzso for airway smooth muscle zzso and is believed to be involved in the zzso of zzso To understand how zzso stimulates the proliferation of zzso cells in culture, we evaluated the relationship between zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso regulated zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was tightly correlated with the proliferation of rat zzso zzso zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso or zzso zzso was used to establish the role of zzso zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso leading to cell zzso While zzso significantly inhibited the ability of zzso to activate zzso the drug did not appear to effect the zzso activity of an activated zzso zzso or zzso in zzso The data suggest that the mechanism of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells may involve zzso of zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso zzso that culminates in zzso zzso was dependent on protein zzso C zzso since depletion of zzso significantly inhibited the ability of zzso to activate zzso Taken together, the data imply that zzso of zzso is a critical zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso since zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
