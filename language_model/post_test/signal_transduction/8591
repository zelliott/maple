T cell proliferation following zzso is an essential aspect of the zzso immune zzso Multiple factors, such as zzso zzso zzso and signals from zzso each contribute to determine the magnitude of T cell zzso In this report, we examine in detail the role of zzso zzso zzso in promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation of zzso T zzso Using zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice and zzso zzso T cells treated with a small zzso inhibitor of zzso we find that these zzso signals are not required for zzso instead, they are important for the survival of activated T zzso In addition, we show that the percentage of cells entering the cell cycle and the percentage of cells in each round of cell division are comparable between zzso and zzso T zzso Furthermore, cell cycle progression and the regulated expression of key cell cycle proteins are independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings hold true over a wide range of zzso signal zzso However, when zzso zzso signals, but not zzso signals, are limiting, zzso zzso signals become necessary for the proliferation of zzso T zzso Because zzso signaling has been found to be zzso for zzso T cell responses, these data suggest the potential for interfering with zzso T cell responses by zzso of zzso zzso
