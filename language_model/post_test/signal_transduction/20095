To maintain zzso zzso B cells must regulate signal zzso from the zzso and zzso We recently identified that zzso cells and zzso regulate zzso cells during zzso zzso by releasing zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso These zzso selectively repress zzso zzso from zzso but not zzso zzso B zzso How zzso and zzso repress zzso production is zzso In this work, we show that zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso B cells to maintain tolerance through a mechanism involving zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso or zzso We show that acute signaling through zzso or zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso zzso to restrict zzso from the nucleus and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is disrupted in zzso mice where zzso and zzso fail to zzso restrict zzso and fail to repress zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso acute signaling in B cells from zzso mice is intact, but the chronic zzso of zzso emanating from the zzso is zzso zzso chronically active zzso through zzso expression of zzso active zzso restores tolerance upon zzso but not zzso zzso indicating that regulation by zzso requires another signaling zzso These data define the molecular basis for the regulation of zzso zzso B cells during zzso zzso they explain how zzso but not zzso B cells are zzso by zzso and zzso and they identify B cell defects in zzso mice that lead to zzso zzso zzso
