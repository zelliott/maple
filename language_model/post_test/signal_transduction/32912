zzso function is regulated partly by mechanical zzso zzso mechanical stimulation maintains zzso cartilage integrity, whereas abnormal mechanical stimulation results in development and progression of zzso zzso The responses of signal zzso pathways in human zzso zzso zzso to mechanical stimuli remain zzso Previous work has shown the involvement of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso channels that results in membrane zzso of HAC after zzso 33 zzso cyclical mechanical zzso To further investigate zzso pathways in HAC and show that the zzso response to mechanical stimulation is a result of an zzso release of a zzso zzso factor, we used this zzso zzso zzso to zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso alpha inhibit mechanically induced membrane zzso and zzso zzso neutralize the zzso activity of medium from mechanically zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso type I and the common gamma zzso zzso have no effect on zzso zzso induced membrane zzso zzso from zzso knockout mice fail to show a membrane zzso response to cyclical mechanical zzso zzso induced release of the zzso zzso zzso from HAC with subsequent zzso activity is likely to be an important regulatory zzso in the maintenance of zzso cartilage structure and zzso Finally, dysfunction of this zzso may be implicated in zzso
