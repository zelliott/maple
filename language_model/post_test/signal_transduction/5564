zzso studies suggest that zzso exposure to inflammation may prime zzso immune zzso In fetal zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso induced zzso lung inflammation and zzso matured lung zzso to zzso and initiated systemic tolerance of fetal zzso to subsequent challenge with zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso altered the response of lung and blood zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso were given zzso injections of zzso or zzso Blood and lung zzso were assessed after 2 days, 7 days and 2 days and 7 days repetitive zzso injections before delivery at 124 days zzso age zzso 150 zzso zzso of blood and lung zzso to zzso in zzso was assessed by zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso from zzso controls had minimal zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso alpha and hydrogen zzso to all zzso zzso in blood and lung zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso alpha and hydrogen zzso to zzso suggesting zzso zzso to zzso reduced zzso zzso associated zzso zzso Thus, repeated fetal exposure to zzso induced tolerance to other zzso These zzso of fetal innate immunity have implications for host defense and injury responses in zzso zzso
