zzso transport across the plasma membrane of zzso cells is zzso by a family of zzso zzso Each zzso zzso zzso has a specific tissue distribution which relates to that zzso demand for zzso The zzso of pancreatic zzso are known to express a distinct zzso zzso zzso termed zzso 2, which has a high zzso for zzso In this study, we examined the zzso zzso content of normal rat zzso and three beta cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that at the protein level, zzso 2 is the only zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso and that all three cell lines also express zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all three cell lines expressed high levels of zzso 1, but this zzso was not detected in normal zzso Neither the native zzso nor any of the cell lines expressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was detected at very low levels in zzso zzso to our knowledge, this is the only zzso or zzso cell line which expresses this zzso We propose that the elevated level of zzso 1 zzso together with a reduced expression of the high zzso zzso zzso 2, may account for the characteristic zzso patterns of zzso insulin release in cell lines derived from zzso
