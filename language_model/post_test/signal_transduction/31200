T cell zzso is driven by the zzso and zzso by zzso We have studied the dynamics of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in T zzso zzso Thousands of zzso zzso molecules were included in a large T cell zzso at the center of the cellular interface within 1 zzso of cell couple zzso The structure and regulation of this zzso shared numerous features with zzso and zzso Three observations further characterize the zzso and the inclusion of zzso 1) numerous zzso receptors were enriched in and zzso through the T cell zzso none as prominently as zzso 2) dissolution of the T cell zzso and zzso engagement were required for effective zzso T cell zzso and 3) the T cell zzso was uniquely sensitive to the affinity of the zzso for zzso Based on this zzso we speculate that the T cell zzso aided by zzso enrichment, zzso parts of the zzso signaling machinery to reset T cell signaling upon zzso stable zzso zzso
