zzso zzso zzso targets a vast array of zzso located in a number of cellular zzso making the challenge of discriminating among these zzso a daunting zzso However, as a signaling zzso zzso could be targeted to different cellular compartments in response to various stress stimuli such as heat zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA damage and viral zzso This review will be focused on the evidence that the dynamic association of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso targeting of the zzso are a likely point of regulation in response to a variety of signaling zzso We propose that in addition to zzso zzso recognition, regulated zzso zzso to specific compartments should help to provide the exquisite specificity required for robust signal zzso
