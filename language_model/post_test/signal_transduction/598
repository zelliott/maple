The zzso target of zzso zzso complex 1 zzso functions as a zzso environmental sensor that promotes cellular zzso processes in response to growth factors and zzso While diverse zzso stimuli zzso zzso zzso the direct zzso mechanisms underlying zzso regulation remain poorly zzso Indeed, while three zzso zzso sites have been reported, a functional role for zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we identify a new site of zzso zzso zzso by tandem mass zzso and demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso Here we focus on zzso and show that zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data reveal a functional role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso action, as zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso binding protein 1) and cell growth to increased cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso require zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso function and suggest a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and cell zzso
