Previously, our laboratory showed that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the prostate zzso cell line, zzso We now demonstrate that zzso zzso expression is zzso by an indirect mechanism that requires nuclear factor Kappa B zzso synthesis of zzso zzso of protein synthesis with zzso blocked zzso induction of zzso zzso suggesting that synthesis of one or more additional factors is required for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso expression to baseline levels suggesting that zzso zzso activity is zzso zzso of zzso activity attenuated zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity indicating that zzso acts downstream of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis with zzso did not alter zzso induction of zzso zzso indicating that, contrary to the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression does not require new protein zzso zzso zzso with dominant negative zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso zzso synthesis is required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling through zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso
