zzso factor zzso an zzso of blood zzso zzso in cancer progression and zzso We recently found that zzso of zzso zzso both full length zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso activity in breast cancer zzso zzso We explored the possible mechanisms, especially the possible interaction with zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso containing zzso promoter zzso plus zzso reporter gene was introduced into zzso cells to evaluate zzso promoter zzso In order to study the interaction of these zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso as well as the corresponding zzso were used to treat zzso cells, and zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were used to determine zzso zzso One stage zzso zzso were used to measure zzso activity of the zzso zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso promoter activity, and reduced zzso zzso and protein levels due to the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso promoter activity by zzso fold and induced an increase in zzso zzso and protein levels in a dose dependent manner in these zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be involved in zzso zzso expression because the induction was inhibited by zzso zzso Most interestingly, the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso also significantly suppressed zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso protein zzso Similar results were found with zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso levels of zzso were regulated in a similar way to that of zzso in response to the cell zzso 

This study showed a regulatory mechanism in which zzso signals inhibit zzso zzso expression in breast cancer zzso zzso The same regulation was observed in zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed that both zzso and zzso could be regulated in a parallel manner in zzso As the zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso expression in cancer cells, targeting these signaling components is expected to potentially inhibit zzso zzso tumor zzso
