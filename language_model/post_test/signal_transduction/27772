The transfer of a zzso oxide group to zzso zzso on zzso known as zzso is increasingly becoming recognized as a ubiquitous regulatory reaction comparable to zzso It represents a form of zzso zzso in diverse zzso including the zzso An increasing number of proteins have been found to undergo zzso in zzso These proteins are called zzso and may play an important role in many processes ranging from signal zzso DNA repair, host defense, and blood pressure control to zzso channel regulation and zzso This review focuses on the importance of the zzso reaction and describes some recently identified zzso in various fields of zzso
