How individual receptive field properties are formed in the maturing sensory zzso remains largely zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso currents by 2A zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to zzso the critical period for zzso refinement of circuits in visual zzso In mice engineered to maintain prolonged zzso responses by targeted deletion of zzso the sensitivity to zzso deprivation was surprisingly weakened but restricted to the typical critical period and delayed normally by dark rearing from zzso Orientation preference instead failed to mature, zzso further effects of dark zzso Interestingly, a full zzso dominance plasticity (but not orientation zzso was selectively restored by enhanced zzso reflecting an zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Many of the downstream pathways involved in zzso signaling are coupled to the zzso through a variety of zzso interactions and zzso zzso To further investigate a zzso zzso of receptive field properties in the developing visual system, mice carrying a targeted disruption of the zzso zzso zzso density zzso scaffolding protein were zzso Although the development and plasticity of zzso dominance was zzso orientation preference again failed to mature in these zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that the cellular basis generating individual sensory response properties is zzso in the developing zzso
