zzso exposure to a zzso diet zzso altered expression of genes that regulate zzso zzso including zzso The main aim of this study was to investigate whether programmed changes to zzso zzso expression in the rat are zzso zzso were fed zzso diets zzso or zzso throughout zzso The zzso group received zzso zzso the inhibitor plus zzso or vehicle injections over the first 2 weeks of zzso The control group was administered vehicle injections zzso On delivery the animals were transferred to a standard zzso zzso The offspring were weaned at 4 weeks of age on to the same zzso diet and killed for collection of liver zzso The inhibitor of zzso synthesis reversed the zzso effect of zzso diet on zzso zzso expression of both protein and zzso seen in zzso exposed zzso To test if this effect is through direct effect on the zzso promoter, zzso cells were zzso with a zzso reporter construct controlled by the zzso promoter treated with zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso in zzso Together these studies demonstrate that zzso zzso to zzso through indirect zzso play a crucial role in zzso changes in zzso metabolism regulating zzso
