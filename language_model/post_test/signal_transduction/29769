zzso zzso zzso are a universal mode of zzso in both excitable and zzso zzso Here, we study the relationship between zzso zzso and coherent changes in zzso properties by measuring the zzso zzso across zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cell layers grown on a zzso During hormone zzso the zzso is found to zzso reflecting that the cells undergo zzso zzso with high zzso zzso The experiments are supplemented with zzso digital imaging zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In agreement with previous experiments, zzso cells are found to elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to hormone zzso The periods of the zzso zzso and the electrical fluctuations are found to zzso Further, blocking of gap junctions by zzso acid causes a loss of zzso in zzso signals and zzso of zzso zzso emphasizing the importance of gap junctions in the signal zzso zzso 

Based on these observations it is concluded that the zzso adhesive changes in zzso cells are a direct consequence of synchronized zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an efficient way of organizing zzso responses in a zzso A possible functional implication of the structural changes might be to zzso transportation of various substances across the cell zzso
