Signaling by the zzso zzso product results in the zzso of several zzso pathways that in turn zzso the expression and function of molecules involved in cell proliferation and zzso It is well established that forced zzso of zzso results in transformation of zzso cells, and that high levels of zzso in tumors are associated with a more aggressive biological zzso It is also clear that a subset of zzso tumors is dependent on zzso function for proliferation and/or zzso Over the last few years, several elegant studies have dissected the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso This research has provided information about critical functional zzso in zzso that can be targeted with rational molecular approaches, some of which are already being implemented at the zzso This report will focus on one of these zzso signaling zzso
