zzso exhibit a prominent zzso activity, but whether such a zzso profile is influenced by zzso communication is zzso Treatment of primary cultures of mouse cortical zzso with the zzso oxide zzso donor zzso induced a zzso enhancement in the expression of genes zzso various zzso zzso as well as zzso for zzso and zzso Such an effect was shown to be dependent on the zzso factor zzso which is stabilized and zzso to the nucleus to exert its zzso zzso NO action was dependent on both the zzso and zzso signaling pathways and required the zzso of zzso but was independent of the soluble zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, as a consequence of NO treatment, an enhanced zzso production and release by zzso was zzso which was prevented by zzso zzso Several brain cell types represent possible sources of zzso It was found that zzso cells, which express the zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso produced the largest amount of NO in zzso When zzso were zzso with primary cultures of brain vascular zzso cells, stabilization of zzso and an enhancement in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression as well as increased zzso production was found in zzso This effect was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso and was not seen when zzso were zzso with primary cultures of cortical zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso NO zzso to the maintenance of a high zzso activity in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
