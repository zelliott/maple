The decline in T zzso function during zzso has been linked to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso damage has long been thought to be involved in the zzso process and we investigated a link between zzso zzso and T cell zzso focusing on the membrane zzso zzso We investigated the relative sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso and then compared the zzso activity of zzso in blood zzso from elderly and young volunteers and related this to zzso levels of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was particularly sensitive to zzso zzso compared to total zzso T cell zzso zzso The zzso with zzso was 3 zzso for zzso at which concentration there was a minimal decrease in global zzso zzso In normal peripheral blood zzso T cells the zzso was much lower at 54 zzso In a group of elderly healthy individuals, whose T cell responses to zzso were depressed, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was decreased by about zzso compared to young zzso There was no difference in zzso levels of zzso The loss of zzso activity in zzso from the elderly may zzso poor T cell function associated with zzso The relative sensitivity of zzso to zzso damage may result from its location in the plasma zzso where it might be more accessible to zzso zzso
