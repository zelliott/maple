zzso stress is often defined as an imbalance of zzso and zzso which can be zzso in humans as the zzso state of plasma zzso Plasma zzso zzso in humans becomes oxidized with age, in response to zzso stress zzso zzso and in common diseases zzso 2 diabetes, cardiovascular zzso However, data also show that zzso of plasma zzso is not zzso with the larger plasma zzso zzso pool, indicating that the zzso of zzso and antioxidants cannot be defined by a single zzso The major cellular zzso systems, including zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso are not in zzso equilibrium and respond differently to chemical zzso and zzso zzso Individual signaling and control events occur through discrete zzso pathways rather than through mechanisms that are directly responsive to a global zzso balance such as that zzso in the common definition of zzso zzso Thus, from a zzso standpoint, zzso stress may be better defined as a disruption of zzso signaling and zzso zzso of such a definition could redirect research to identify key zzso of zzso signaling and control and lead to new treatments for zzso stress-related disease zzso
