We found a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a patient with a high bone mass zzso In zzso studies suggest that a reduced zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso signaling contributes to the molecular effect of this zzso and its zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the gene zzso LDL zzso protein 5 zzso cause high bone zzso Recent studies revealed that a reduced zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso 1 zzso contributes to the zzso of this disease zzso 

We report on a zzso female patient with a high bone mass zzso zzso of zzso 2-4 of the zzso gene was carried out to screen for zzso zzso in zzso DNA of the zzso The effect of the identified zzso on zzso membrane trafficking was studied by zzso of a truncated form of zzso Additionally, zzso signal zzso in the absence and presence of zzso was assessed using a zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso 

Our patient presents with dense bones zzso zzso zzso and zzso examination showed a generalized zzso of the zzso zzso at the hip and zzso spine significantly decreased through the passage to menopause, indicating no protection to bone zzso Further clinical evaluation revealed zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the presence of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso located in the first zzso domain of the zzso zzso Although protein zzso seemed to be impaired, this zzso was able to zzso zzso signals at levels comparable with zzso zzso We additionally observed a less efficient zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso 

Like all high zzso zzso zzso zzso described thus far, the zzso zzso affects an zzso acid located in the first zzso domain, underlining the functional importance of this region in the zzso of these zzso This zzso most likely alters a region important for zzso zzso by zzso
