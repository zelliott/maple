zzso a specific zzso III zzso and zzso zzso a direct zzso zzso zzso are now being used in critical zzso We investigated whether their therapeutic use provides protection against septic acute lung injury zzso and zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso and puncture zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was continuously given through an zzso pump that was implanted into the zzso cavity immediately following zzso These treatments prevented the zzso development in zzso mice, as indicated by the findings that severe zzso increased pulmonary vascular zzso and zzso lung damage were zzso zzso Furthermore, continued administration of zzso or zzso zzso suppressed zzso induction in septic lungs and improved the survival of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso in septic zzso zzso which zzso the zzso upstream regulator zzso zzso zzso the protective effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso lung inflammation and zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso decoy zzso failed to zzso the abilities of these agents to increase zzso zzso and to inhibit zzso degradation in septic zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso signaling is a critical mechanism contributing to the therapeutic effects of zzso and zzso zzso on septic zzso Moreover, our data also suggest that these zzso zzso agents, by blocking both nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso may represent an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of the septic zzso
