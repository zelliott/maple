The relationship between zzso stimuli and NO in modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso release from zzso cells was investigated in zzso subjects and essential zzso zzso zzso zzso a well-known stimulus for zzso zzso is also involved in the determination of cardiovascular risk in essential zzso However, the existence of zzso between zzso stimuli and NO availability in modulating zzso release is not well established zzso We assessed the release of zzso in the zzso zzso of 58 zzso subjects zzso age: zzso zzso and 44 essential zzso patients zzso age: zzso zzso under specific zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso per zzso induced greater zzso release in zzso subjects as compared with essential zzso patients zzso However, zzso of NO zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso infusion blunted zzso zzso release in zzso subjects zzso but not in essential zzso zzso In zzso subjects, zzso release by zzso was not affected by zzso (8 zzso zzso per zzso zzso and was abolished in the presence of zzso (10 zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso induced a significant increase in zzso release zzso an effect blunted by zzso zzso In essential zzso patients, the response to zzso was impaired as compared with zzso subjects and was unaffected by zzso zzso In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that zzso zzso release is zzso by zzso via a mechanism involving the NO zzso Our results show an impaired zzso zzso release among essential zzso patients, probably zzso via a reduced NO zzso This impaired zzso activity might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk associated with zzso
