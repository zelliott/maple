zzso is a zzso zzso involved in numerous cell signaling pathways that are associated with cell cycle control, zzso zzso and zzso Although substantial knowledge about zzso pathways has accumulated in the past decade, molecular mechanisms of zzso action remain poorly zzso primarily due to limited information about zzso zzso In the present study, we used affinity zzso with a synthetic zzso zzso zzso analogue and zzso to identify potential zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso The zzso resulted in identification of 97 unique zzso The identified proteins are involved in various cellular zzso including zzso cellular stress, cell cycle, cell zzso zzso transcription, translation, protein zzso zzso and zzso
