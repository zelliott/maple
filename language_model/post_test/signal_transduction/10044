zzso is a structural component of zzso zzso where it binds to the zzso domain of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is also a zzso zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, where it binds to zzso family zzso zzso In the absence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in a zzso complex containing the proteins zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso both of which bind directly to zzso The thermodynamics of zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso have been determined by zzso zzso zzso Most of the interactions showed large, zzso zzso changes, consistent with these zzso being zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso present in a sequence motif common to zzso and zzso increased the affinity for zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso revealed that zzso of zzso both enhanced its on rate and decreased its off zzso The effects of the zzso and zzso zzso that flank the zzso zzso repeat domain on zzso binding have also been investigated using zzso lacking one or both zzso zzso to earlier studies that employed less direct binding zzso the tails did not affect the affinity of zzso for tight zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso tail was found to decrease the affinity for the weaker zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that this region may have a regulatory role in zzso zzso
