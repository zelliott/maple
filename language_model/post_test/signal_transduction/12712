The striking difference in evolution of type I zzso genes of fish and zzso poses the question of whether these genes are induced through similar or different zzso pathways in the two zzso zzso Previous work has shown that expression of both Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes is dependent on zzso and zzso elements in their zzso In zzso zzso zzso is induced through the zzso zzso where the zzso protein zzso plays a key role in the signal zzso In this work we show that an Atlantic salmon zzso of zzso zzso mediates zzso of the salmon zzso promoter and an zzso driven zzso zzso shares only zzso identity in zzso acid sequence with human zzso but possesses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in induction of an zzso state in the cells apparently due to induction of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso abolished its ability to activate the zzso promoter and the zzso driven promoter, and thus its ability to induce an zzso zzso zzso is located to zzso similar to human zzso Taken together, zzso plays a key role in the induction of Atlantic salmon zzso which appears to be the first and major zzso induced in host cells upon recognition of viral zzso
