zzso zzso has a peak of expression in the brain in a period of zzso network reorganization and then virtually disappears from the normal adult zzso The aim of our study was to identify zzso zzso induced by chronically blocking zzso zzso We used zzso transgenic mice zzso human soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso We used zzso from litters obtained by mating zzso transgenic zzso and animals with predetermined zzso zzso In zzso the zzso was identified after the experiments had been zzso The mice were tested at the ages of 6 and 12 months with a battery of tests, including zzso zzso zzso analysis, and analysis of motor performance during zzso MR imaging was performed on zzso zzso total and relative volumes of cortical and zzso structures were estimated zzso on the acquired zzso zzso data analysis zzso of the behavioral data showed separation between zzso zzso and transgenic mice at both 6 and 12 months, whereas the zzso displayed a more zzso behavioral zzso The zzso model for brain zzso showed a clear separation between zzso and transgenic mice as well as between transgenic zzso and zzso zzso analysis by means of partial least squares zzso showed that the brain zzso accounts for the behavioral profile in a significant proportion zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso zzso is important for normal development of the brain, and the initial zzso resulting from prenatal exposure to zzso can be recovered provided that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
