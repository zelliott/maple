In normal rat kidney cells protein zzso zzso zzso play a role in attaining zzso growth arrest after stimulation with zzso The zzso inhibitor sodium zzso prevents zzso growth zzso of zzso cells and zzso in that respect the action of zzso beta and zzso zzso However, enhanced zzso activity is not obligatory for maintaining cells in a zzso zzso In contrast to zzso beta and zzso acid, zzso is unable to zzso zzso cells, indicating that different mechanisms are zzso Yet, zzso is strongly zzso the effect of low zzso of zzso beta but not of zzso acid, implicating that zzso zzso is linked to zzso beta action and that zzso may represent a negative control element in the zzso beta signaling zzso
