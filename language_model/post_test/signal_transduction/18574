The regulation of cell polarity plays an important role in zzso zzso a putative zzso exchange factor for small zzso of the Ras family, has been implicated in zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are flat, exhibit strongly increased zzso attachment, and extend many zzso and lateral zzso These cells zzso zzso are severely impaired in zzso most likely due to the induction of many zzso rather than an enhanced zzso The zzso zzso is similar to that of cells zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso activates zzso both in zzso and in zzso but not any of the five other characterized Ras zzso In a screen for zzso zzso we zzso zzso in several zzso defective in zzso or cell polarity and identified zzso as zzso zzso necessary for zzso but not cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso via its Ras association zzso
