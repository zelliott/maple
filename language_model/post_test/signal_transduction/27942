At the molecular level, zzso turns on the gene for zzso in a subset of zzso zzso zzso and turns on the gene for the zzso zzso in other zzso and zzso cell zzso As a result, zzso deposition, whose signal is zzso both through G alpha zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso electrical activity in certain zzso zzso zzso zzso behaviors including those closely associated with zzso behaviors and parental zzso zzso One important aspect of this effect is the preservation of instinctive behaviors associated with zzso in the face of disturbances due to mild zzso
