zzso zzso cells express vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso can direct toxins to tumor vessels through zzso for zzso zzso This study aimed to selectively damage the zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer by zzso fusion protein zzso zzso and the A zzso of zzso toxin which zzso protein synthesis of cells with high zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso receptors was evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso and in normal human zzso cells zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso and zzso tube formation were zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso zzso was induced in nude zzso Animals were treated with zzso fusion protein alone or in combination with zzso Treatment began 3 days or 6 weeks after tumor zzso zzso tumor volume and dissemination were determined after 14 zzso zzso density and expression of zzso and zzso receptors were analyzed by zzso 

zzso did not influence proliferation of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced their proliferation rate and tube formation but not their zzso zzso fusion protein reduced tumor growth and zzso increasing zzso survival zzso up to zzso zzso up to zzso zzso of zzso were comparable with zzso zzso Combination partly increased the therapeutic effects in comparison to the respective zzso zzso density was reduced in all zzso zzso zzso expression was found in zzso but not in tumor zzso 

zzso is toxic for tumor zzso rather than for normal zzso or pancreatic cancer zzso zzso treatment in combination with zzso may provide a novel approach for pancreatic zzso
