zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules play important roles in the survival and differentiation of zzso Mouse natural killer zzso cells usually die within 24 hours once isolated ex zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are required to maintain the survival and activity of mouse zzso cells cultured in zzso Whether and how zzso molecules such as zzso can support the survival of zzso cells remain zzso We demonstrate that zzso just like zzso can maintain survival of mouse zzso cells in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso binds to the zzso on zzso cells, and then zzso recruits and activates zzso zzso can directly interact with zzso and trigger nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the increased expression of zzso protein zzso leukemia 2 zzso which may contribute to the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot maintain the survival of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells in zzso and the number of zzso cells is dramatically decreased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso can maintain survival of mouse zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso
