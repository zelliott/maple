zzso results from the processing of a large number of signals produced at different levels of the central and peripheral nervous system, which are generated in response to stimuli from the environment or from the zzso zzso One of the strategies for generating new analgesics consists in studying the molecular bases that zzso the detection of painful zzso that is to say, the zzso One zzso that plays a very important role in sensory and pain physiology is zzso which is responsible for detecting zzso chemical and zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study is to discuss the structural and functional aspects of the zzso channel, as well as its participation in certain pathological processes and the possible perspectives for clinical zzso 

zzso zzso in sensory zzso generates signals that reach the central nervous system, where they are interpreted as pain, as well as triggering the peripheral release of zzso substances that make other zzso sensitive to subsequent zzso zzso is a zzso that is structurally similar to other zzso zzso channels, with the capacity to detect and integrate several different stimuli from the environment, such as dangerously high temperatures or zzso Furthermore, the activity of this channel is linked to several zzso chains related with inflammatory zzso 

The central role of zzso in the physiology of pain will surely encourage the development of drugs aimed at this zzso which can be used in the treatment of several types of zzso
