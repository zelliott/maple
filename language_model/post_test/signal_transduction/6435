zzso of transforming growth factor zzso or components of its signaling zzso leads to embryonic death in mice due to impaired zzso zzso vascular development before significant smooth muscle cell zzso maturation zzso Thus the role of zzso in zzso development remains zzso zzso stem cell zzso zzso bodies zzso zzso many of the events of early embryonic development and represent a more zzso context in which to study zzso development than most other in zzso zzso The present studies showed induction of the zzso genes smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso within a mouse zzso model zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso associated with fully differentiated zzso was zzso zzso the results showed that zzso of zzso cells exhibited visible zzso activity, suggesting that all regulatory pathways essential for development of zzso zzso were functional in this in zzso model zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso expressing a soluble truncated zzso type II zzso attenuated the increase in zzso gene expression in the zzso as did an zzso specific for zzso Of interest, the results of small interfering zzso experiments provided evidence for differential zzso signaling for an early zzso late zzso marker gene in that zzso promoter activity was dependent on both zzso and zzso whereas zzso activity was zzso zzso These results are the first to provide direct evidence that zzso signaling through zzso and zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso from zzso zzso
