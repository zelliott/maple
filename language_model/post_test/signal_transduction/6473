Biological and technological networks contain patterns, termed network zzso which occur far more often than in zzso zzso Network motifs were suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in the zzso It is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form larger zzso To address this, we present a systematic approach to define zzso zzso families of motifs of different sizes that share a common architectural zzso To define motif generalizations, we first define zzso in a zzso according to structural zzso For example, the zzso loop zzso motif in transcription, zzso and some electronic zzso three roles: an input zzso an output zzso and an internal zzso The roles are used to define possible zzso of the zzso The zzso loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating each of the three roles and their zzso We present zzso for efficiently detecting motif zzso We find that the zzso networks of bacteria and zzso display only one of the three generalizations, the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso network of zzso zzso mainly displays the zzso zzso zzso electronic circuits display a zzso zzso zzso Thus, networks which share a common motif can have very different zzso of that zzso Using mathematical zzso we describe the information processing functions of the different motif zzso in transcription, zzso and electronic zzso
