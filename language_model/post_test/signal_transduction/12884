The ability of G zzso receptors zzso to form zzso and zzso complexes has important implications for the regulation of cellular zzso A notable example of zzso formation is the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with different members of the zzso activity zzso protein zzso family, which results in the formation of two different zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso To analyze the role of zzso in determining zzso zzso we have zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso which provides a zzso system to study the function of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that was able to activate the zzso zzso with pharmacological properties similar to those observed previously in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in a response with the pharmacological properties of an zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso are necessary and sufficient to determine zzso specificity of zzso zzso to observations in zzso cells, the zzso of zzso was not affected by the presence of zzso in zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is not the prime zzso of zzso zzso The first functional zzso of a zzso seven zzso zzso in zzso suggests this zzso as a useful research tool to study the molecular nature of other zzso zzso
