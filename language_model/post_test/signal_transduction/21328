zzso regulates pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso directly by its metabolism to generate zzso in zzso and indirectly via stimulation of zzso release of zzso zzso products, particularly zzso How the cellular zzso of these pathways zzso in the zzso is not well zzso We recently reported the use of the zzso zzso insulin zzso fluorescent zzso mouse to reliably identify zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and characterized their zzso zzso zzso channel properties, showing that zzso zzso channels exhibited a zzso higher sensitivity to zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that insulin exerted zzso regulation of zzso by markedly reducing the sensitivity of zzso zzso channels to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in absence and presence of insulin, zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso channels to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in absence and presence of insulin, zzso zzso effects on both zzso cell zzso channels were blocked by zzso indicating that insulin acted on the insulin zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to also inhibit zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso zzso channel zzso We conclude that a major mechanism by which insulin exerts zzso control on zzso is by modulating its zzso channel sensitivity to zzso zzso This may be an underlying basis for the proposed sequential zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso which becomes distorted in diabetes, leading to zzso zzso zzso
