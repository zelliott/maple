Recent data demonstrated that zzso sensing in different zzso is initiated by an zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso However, the relevance of such a mechanism in zzso disease is not zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether brain zzso hypersensitivity present in obese zzso rats is related to an zzso in zzso zzso 

Brain zzso sensing zzso was investigated in zzso through the evaluation of electrical activity in zzso nucleus, changes in zzso oxygen species levels, and zzso zzso insulin zzso In zzso conditions, modifications of zzso state and zzso functions were assessed through oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities, and zzso zzso 

zzso hypersensitivity to zzso was characterized by enhanced electrical activity of the zzso nucleus and increased insulin zzso at a low zzso zzso which does not produce such an effect in normal zzso It was associated with 1) increased zzso oxygen species levels in response to this low zzso load, 2) zzso oxidized environment coupled with lower zzso zzso activity at both the cellular and zzso level, and 3) zzso of several zzso zzso of the respiratory chain coupled with a global dysfunction in zzso zzso Moreover, pharmacological restoration of the zzso zzso zzso state by reduced zzso infusion in the third zzso fully reversed the cerebral hypersensitivity to zzso 

The data demonstrated that obese zzso zzso impaired zzso regulation in terms of zzso sensing is linked to an abnormal zzso zzso which originates from zzso zzso
