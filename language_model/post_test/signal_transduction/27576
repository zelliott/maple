zzso is a high capacity zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso that forms a zzso complex with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso show marked suppression of zzso zzso release, zzso zzso and premature death by 16 weeks of age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, zzso To investigate whether zzso in zzso zzso trigger changes in the zzso zzso pathway, we studied zzso zzso transgenic mice at 7 and 14 weeks of zzso As assessed by zzso zzso mice at 7 weeks showed mild left zzso enlargement, mild decreased fractional zzso with increased wall zzso By 14 weeks, the zzso progressed to marked left zzso enlargement and severely depressed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice revealed markedly impaired zzso zzso responsiveness in both 7- and zzso week zzso zzso analysis in 7- and zzso mice showed a significant decrease in total zzso zzso density, zzso zzso activity, and the percent high affinity zzso zzso which was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso the development of overt heart failure in this mouse model of progressive zzso
