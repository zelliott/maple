zzso sheep zzso zzso that causes contagious zzso pulmonary zzso zzso in sheep carries an zzso zzso gene zzso which is capable of transforming target cells in zzso and in zzso We cloned full-length zzso zzso zzso into an expression zzso zzso where the zzso was driven by zzso zzso protein C zzso promoter, to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso mice zzso to generate zzso transgenic zzso We obtained two lines of transgenic mice, both of which were capable of developing spontaneous lung tumors from 1 month zzso and the tumor zzso rate was about zzso at the age of 7 months in zzso zzso line 1 and about zzso at the age of 6 months in zzso zzso line zzso We were able to correlate higher tumor zzso rate and zzso in zzso zzso line 2 to higher level of expression of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso line zzso zzso analysis showed that the tumor was primarily composed of type II zzso where zzso promoter is known to be active similar to natural infection of zzso in zzso Analysis of cellular zzso signal zzso pathways revealed significant induction of zzso zzso zzso in the transgenic mice lungs with tumors compared to the lungs from zzso zzso zzso zzso in our transgenic mice pose similarities to human lung zzso and therefore our mice could serve as a model system for evaluating the mechanisms of lung zzso in zzso
