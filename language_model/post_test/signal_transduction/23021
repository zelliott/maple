The coordination of cell shape change and locomotion requires that zzso zzso at the cell zzso be tightly controlled in response to both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex - an zzso filament zzso and organizing factor - appears to be a central player in the cellular control of zzso zzso Recently, a molecular zzso leading from key zzso molecules to zzso filament nucleation by the zzso complex has been zzso In this pathway, the zzso zzso acts in concert with zzso family proteins to activate the zzso zzso These findings have led to a more complete picture of the mechanism of zzso filament generation and organization during cell zzso
