zzso of zzso signaling zzso is a zzso negative regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso causes zzso to various zzso zzso mice spontaneously develop a fatal disease depending on zzso activated zzso Here, we show that partial restoration of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso mice from the zzso fatal disease, indicating that zzso expression in zzso is especially required in zzso However, zzso expression in these zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso was insufficient for proper zzso of its target zzso and these mice spontaneously exhibit zzso of zzso an increase in the levels of serum zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso These zzso resemble those of zzso systemic zzso diseases, models for systemic lupus zzso zzso Interestingly, similar zzso were also observed in adult female zzso mice, indicating that the zzso zzso of these mice can be ascribed primarily to the inadequate expression of zzso In addition, zzso zzso were not observed in zzso mice, suggesting that zzso is dependent on zzso zzso T zzso Our findings also suggest that insufficient expression of zzso results in impaired function of zzso regulatory T cells, which may contribute to zzso zzso of zzso T zzso These findings suggest that dysfunction of zzso can be a zzso factor of systemic zzso diseases such as zzso
