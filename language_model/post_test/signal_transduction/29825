zzso are an integral component of the zzso and innate immune zzso The signaling pathways triggered by the engagement of zzso with their specific cell surface receptors have been extensively studied and have provided a profound understanding of the zzso machinery that translates exposure of cells to zzso to a coordinated biological zzso It has also become clear that cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to prevent excessive responses to zzso In this review we focus on the zzso of zzso signaling zzso family of zzso proteins that completes a negative feedback loop to zzso signal zzso from zzso that act through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins inhibit components of the zzso signaling cascade via direct binding or by preventing access to the signaling zzso The zzso proteins also appear to target signal zzso for zzso zzso zzso of genetically modified mice in which zzso proteins are zzso or deleted have established that this family of negative regulators has indispensable roles in regulating zzso responses in cells of the immune system as well as other zzso Emerging evidence also suggests that disruption of zzso expression or activity is associated with several immune and inflammatory diseases, raising the prospect that manipulation of zzso activity may provide a novel future therapeutic strategy in the management of zzso zzso
