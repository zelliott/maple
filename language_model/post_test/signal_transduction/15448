zzso in zzso often undergo active zzso events and zzso to a zzso zzso state to complete the zzso life zzso The signaling zzso zzso oxide zzso was previously found to trigger zzso zzso in the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso at low, nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Webb, zzso zzso zzso zzso NO was further shown to increase cell zzso and zzso to zzso Recently, numerous studies revealed that increased degradation of the secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso by specific zzso zzso triggers a zzso mode of growth in zzso In this study, the potential link between NO and zzso signaling was investigated by performing zzso zzso inhibitor studies, zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso activity, and zzso direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results suggest a role for zzso signaling in triggering the zzso zzso event induced by zzso as zzso requires zzso activity and addition of NO stimulates zzso and zzso the zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso Furthermore, gene expression studies indicated global responses to low, nontoxic levels of NO in zzso zzso zzso including zzso of genes involved in zzso and energy metabolism and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of candidate genes and zzso characterization of the corresponding zzso strains uncovered that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso response induced by zzso
