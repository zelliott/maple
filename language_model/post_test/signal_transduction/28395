zzso signals generated by nerve growth factor zzso and other zzso promote the survival of appropriately connected zzso during development, and failure to obtain sufficient retrograde signals may contribute to zzso death occurring in many neurodegenerative zzso The discovery over 25 years ago that zzso supplied to the zzso terminals is zzso transported to the cell bodies suggested that zzso must reach the cell body to promote zzso zzso Research during the intervening decades has produced a refinement of this zzso The current hypothesis is that zzso bound to zzso at the zzso terminal is zzso into signaling zzso with zzso in their zzso bound to zzso zzso in their zzso which are zzso transported to the cell bodies, where zzso activates downstream signaling molecules that promote zzso survival and regulate many aspects of zzso gene zzso This model has been zzso to retrograde signaling by all zzso We consider the evidence for this model, focusing on results of experiments with zzso in zzso zzso zzso to date indicate that while the transport of signaling zzso containing zzso bound to zzso may carry retrograde signals, retrograde survival signals can be carried by another mechanism that is activated by zzso at the zzso terminal surface and travels to the cell body unaccompanied by the zzso that initiated zzso It is hypothesized that multiple mechanisms of retrograde signaling exist and function under different zzso The newly discovered potential for zzso in retrograde signaling mechanisms can complicate the interpretation of experimental zzso
