This review summarizes our present knowledge about the composition and function of the plant nuclear zzso Compared with animals or zzso our molecular understanding of the nuclear envelope in higher plants is in its zzso However, fundamental differences in the structure and function of the plant and animal nuclear envelope have already been zzso Here, we compare and contrast these differences with respect to nuclear pore complexes, targeting of Ran signaling to the nuclear zzso inner nuclear envelope zzso and the role and fate of the nuclear envelope during zzso Further investigation of the emerging fundamental differences as well as the similarities between zzso might illuminate why there appears to be more than one blueprint for building a zzso
