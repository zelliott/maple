We have developed a new zzso to identify factors promoting formation and outgrowth of the tail zzso A piece of animal cap filled with the test zzso is grafted into the zzso region of the neural plate of a host zzso With this zzso we show that expression of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso in the zzso neural plate is sufficient to produce an zzso tail consisting of neural tube and zzso The zzso tails express the zzso zzso zzso a marker for the zzso tail zzso zzso will also induce formation of an zzso tail in our zzso We show that an zzso version of zzso zzso will prevent tail formation by zzso zzso showing that zzso is downstream of zzso zzso An zzso version of this zzso zzso specifically blocks tail formation when induced in zzso stage zzso zzso the importance of zzso for tail bud outgrowth in normal zzso zzso containing zzso zzso will only form tails if placed in the zzso part of the neural zzso However, if zzso is also present in the zzso they can form tails at any zzso zzso Since zzso expression is zzso appropriately in the zzso at the time of tail bud formation it is likely to be responsible for restricting tail forming competence to the zzso neural plate in our zzso Combined expression of zzso and active zzso in animal cap zzso is sufficient to induce zzso provoke zzso and form neural zzso Conservation of gene expression in the tail bud of other zzso suggests that this zzso may describe a general mechanism controlling tail outgrowth and secondary zzso
