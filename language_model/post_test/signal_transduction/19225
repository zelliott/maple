zzso of DNA replication initiation arrests human cells in zzso pointing towards an origin zzso zzso We used zzso against zzso zzso to inhibit replication initiation and dissect this checkpoint in zzso We show that the checkpoint response is dependent on three axes coordinated through the zzso factor zzso In arrested cells, zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso and mediates zzso zzso zzso in turn activates expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso and zzso D1 zzso The resulting loss of zzso activity zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depleted of zzso zzso zzso or zzso can bypass the arrest and proceed into an zzso S phase followed by zzso The lack of zzso between the checkpoint axes and reliance on several zzso zzso proteins commonly zzso in human zzso provides a zzso basis for the zzso killing observed with emerging zzso zzso
