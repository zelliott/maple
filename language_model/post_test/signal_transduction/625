zzso zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated in breast tumor zzso And tumor necrosis zzso zzso is a positive regulator of zzso This study was aimed to identify the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso expression regulation in breast cancer cell line zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso and zzso levels of zzso were zzso by zzso whereas other zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso was associated with the formation of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso were elevated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and protein levels of zzso which were significantly reversed by zzso inhibitor zzso Finally using zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso bound to the zzso promoter and regulated zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso expression in breast cancer cells, at least partially via a zzso and zzso dependent zzso
