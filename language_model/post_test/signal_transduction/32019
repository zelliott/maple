zzso zzso is an important zzso pathogen and an emerging zzso agent of zzso and zzso zzso on host immune responses towards zzso zzso and strategies used by this pathogen for zzso of these responses is zzso The objective of this study was to identify the immune receptors involved in zzso zzso recognition by zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso and expression of zzso molecules by zzso were shown to strongly rely on zzso signaling zzso suggesting that zzso recognize zzso zzso and become activated mostly through zzso zzso zzso zzso Supporting this fact, zzso zzso were severely impaired in the release of several zzso and the surface expression of zzso and zzso The release of zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso were found to depend on signaling by both zzso and zzso The release of zzso and zzso were partially dependent on zzso Finally, despite the fact that zzso signaling was crucial for DC zzso and zzso zzso pathways were not implicated in zzso zzso zzso by zzso This first study on receptors involved in DC zzso by zzso zzso suggests a major involvement of zzso signaling zzso mainly (but not zzso through zzso A zzso recognition involving a combination of different receptors seems essential for DC effective response to zzso zzso
