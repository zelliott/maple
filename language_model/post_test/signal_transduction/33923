zzso receptors zzso have ubiquitous roles in zzso zzso signals into cellular zzso zzso the concept that members of this zzso of surface proteins are directly modulated by changes in membrane zzso could have widespread consequences for cell zzso Although several studies have indicated that zzso can be zzso dependent, particularly zzso receptors in the zzso zzso the evidence has been mostly zzso Recent work on zzso receptors has zzso substantial interest in this field by reporting the first zzso charge movements for a zzso An underlying mechanism is proposed zzso a zzso zzso change in the zzso alters its ability to couple to the G protein and thereby influences its affinity for an zzso We discuss the strength of the evidence behind this hypothesis and include suggestions for future zzso We also describe other examples in which direct zzso control of zzso can account for effects of membrane potential on downstream signals and highlight the possible zzso consequences of this zzso
