zzso pain in the zzso system is frequently observed in clinic, but the mechanisms involved are largely zzso In addition, the function of immune cells and related chemicals in the mechanism of pain has been zzso whereas few studies have addressed the potential role of zzso in the zzso system in chronic zzso The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso motif zzso 2 zzso zzso motif zzso 2 zzso signaling in the zzso nucleus is involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso 

The inferior zzso nerve and mental nerve zzso zzso was used to induce zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and western zzso The cellular zzso of zzso and zzso were examined by zzso double zzso The effect of a selective zzso zzso zzso on pain hypersensitivity was checked by behavioral zzso 

zzso induced persistent zzso zzso heat zzso of the zzso region and zzso expression in the zzso division of the zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso expression was increased in the zzso zzso horn zzso from 3 days to 21 days after zzso The induced zzso was zzso with zzso marker zzso but not with zzso marker zzso or zzso marker zzso zzso zzso was also found in the zzso and it started at zzso peaked at 10 days and maintained at 21 days after zzso In addition, zzso was zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso and lasted for more than 21 zzso zzso was mainly zzso with zzso and few cells were zzso with zzso Finally, zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso significantly attenuated zzso heat zzso 

The data suggest that zzso signaling may be involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso pain via zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling may be a potentially important new treatment strategy for zzso zzso
