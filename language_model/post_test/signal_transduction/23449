Leaf zzso is a genetically controlled dismantling zzso that enables plants to efficiently zzso nutrients to new growing zzso It involves substantial zzso zzso whose timing is affected by zzso and environmental zzso Plant hormones have long been known to affect the timing of leaf zzso but they also affect plant development and stress zzso It has therefore been difficult to tease apart how the different hormones regulate the onset and progression of leaf zzso zzso whether they directly affect leaf zzso or affect it indirectly by altering the zzso zzso or by altering plants' response to zzso Here we review research on hormonal regulation of leaf zzso and propose that hormones affect zzso through differential responses to zzso and environmental zzso We suggest that leaf zzso strictly depends on zzso changes, after which zzso can be zzso depending on the type of hormonal and environmental zzso
