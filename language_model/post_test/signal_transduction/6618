During early cardiac development, zzso of the valves and zzso of the heart are formed by an zzso cell transformation of zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that this event is due to an interaction between the zzso and products of the zzso found within the zzso zzso The present study examines signal zzso mechanisms governing this differentiation of zzso canal zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both produced an incomplete zzso transformation of zzso cells in an in zzso zzso for zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked cellular transformation in response to the native zzso or a zzso zzso zzso free calcium concentration zzso was measured in single zzso cells by microscopic digital analysis of zzso 2 zzso zzso of a zzso zzso medium containing the transforming stimulus produced a specific increase in zzso in zzso zzso canal, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso cell transformation was inhibited by zzso toxin but not zzso zzso These data lead to the hypothesis that signal zzso of this tissue interaction is zzso by a G protein and one or more zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso competent zzso canal zzso cells demonstrate an increase in zzso Together, the data provide direct evidence for a regional and zzso regulation of signal zzso processes which mediate a specific zzso zzso tissue interaction in the zzso
