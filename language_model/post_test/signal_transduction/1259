zzso zzso signaling zzso members are potent tumor zzso for many types of zzso We zzso that breast tumors zzso express these genes and that this expression pattern plays a role in the proliferation of breast zzso We examined the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso using real-time zzso in 14 normal breast, five zzso 57 invasive (including 29 with outcome zzso and five zzso breast tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were lower in zzso tumors compared to normal breast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were lower in invasive zzso compared to normal breast zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso provided zzso ability to potentially distinguish between normal and tumor samples, zzso and zzso tumors, and zzso (no recurrence for at least 5 zzso and zzso zzso within 3 zzso outcome zzso zzso zzso levels accurately zzso between normal breast tissue and primary tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso distinguished between zzso and zzso primary tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso between zzso outcome from zzso tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that the differential gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso which are tumor zzso zzso plays a significant role in the proliferation of breast zzso Further investigation is necessary to validate the ability of these genes to discriminate between different populations of breast cancer zzso
