zzso stem cells are found in specialized zzso zzso where they are exposed to diverse systemic and local signals that are integrated with cell intrinsic factors to regulate stem cell zzso In general, systemic signals are zzso to coordinate the response of zzso to acute or long-term changes that affect the whole zzso such as variations in zzso availability or zzso In contrast, local signaling regulates tissue maintenance by balancing stem cell zzso with differentiation under zzso conditions and in response to local zzso In this review, we highlight the role of the zzso zzso in two zzso stem cell systems, the zzso and zzso and compare and contrast how zzso of this zzso leads to tissue maintenance under both zzso conditions and in response to stress or zzso
