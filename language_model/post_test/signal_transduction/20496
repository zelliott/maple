The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso has been shown to activate zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso of zzso zzso play a vital role in regulating the survival and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and target skeletal muscle zzso cells are essential for the maintenance of the function of zzso However, much less is known about the effects of zzso zzso target zzso cells on the expression of zzso receptors in zzso root zzso zzso zzso Here we have tested what extent to the expression of zzso zzso and zzso receptors in primary cultured of zzso zzso in absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this experiment, we found that: zzso zzso promoted expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso in primary cultured zzso zzso zzso target zzso cells promoted expression of zzso but not zzso and zzso in zzso zzso without zzso zzso and zzso zzso and target zzso cells had additional effects on expression of these three zzso zzso The results of the present study offered new clues for a better understanding of the association of zzso and target zzso on the expression of zzso zzso
