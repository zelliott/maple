zzso can adapt to zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which in turn regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso in hypoxic signaling have been suggested to zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso We have recently identified zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in ALS patients, and have shown that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso Here, we show that zzso is sufficient and required to activate zzso in cultured zzso exposed to zzso although zzso expression does not change in a transgenic ALS mouse model or in sporadic ALS zzso Administration of zzso zzso or expression of zzso zzso protected zzso against hypoxic injury, whereas gene zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso cell zzso The previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all showed a reduced zzso activity against hypoxic zzso Our data show that zzso plays an important role in zzso protective pathways of zzso exposed to zzso and suggest that loss of function rather than loss of expression of zzso is associated with zzso
