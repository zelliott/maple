Although zzso zzso zzso are important for cardiac function, their relevant downstream targets in the adult heart are zzso The zzso zzso protein binds specific zzso zzso sites on activated zzso through its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and stimulates downstream pathways through motifs such as zzso sites in its central zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a potential hub for downstream zzso signaling in the zzso 

To define the role of zzso a zzso scaffold, in the adult heart using a zzso knockout of zzso zzso zzso zzso and domain zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice developed a zzso zzso zzso involving impaired zzso function with enhanced zzso zzso This zzso of global heart and intrinsic zzso functions was associated with altered collagen and zzso zzso compliance properties, suggesting disruption of mechanical zzso In zzso dissection of zzso signaling properties revealed that selective zzso of the zzso domain in the zzso had effects resembling those seen in zzso zzso mice, whereas disruption of the zzso domain caused a less severe cardiac zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso sites was zzso for baseline cardiac function but necessary to prevent adverse zzso after zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate a requirement for zzso zzso domain signaling to maintain cardiac zzso In addition, analysis of the zzso domain and zzso zzso sites reveals that zzso mediates zzso signaling in the adult heart through multiple distinct signaling elements that control zzso functions and response to zzso
