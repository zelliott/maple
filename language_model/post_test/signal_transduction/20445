zzso zzso that reduce or abrogate zzso cell expression of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso lead to zzso disease involving zzso zzso skin and bone zzso However, little is known about how zzso regulates zzso zzso Here we examined how zzso zzso causes zzso and bone zzso using the mouse zzso zzso zzso which fails to express zzso and zzso in which zzso is zzso In both models, serum levels of the zzso factor, zzso were elevated and zzso zzso zzso production of zzso by zzso was zzso Treatment of zzso mice with a dual specificity zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased circulating zzso and ameliorated the zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso drives zzso zzso zzso precursors from zzso mice exhibit increased zzso in zzso and were used to probe the structural requirements for zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a functional zzso domain were essential for zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso precursor fusion, whereas interaction with zzso zzso was only required for suppression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as a negative feedback regulator of zzso signaling to suppress inflammation and zzso
