The past 20 years have seen enormous progress in the understanding of the mechanisms used by the enteric zzso zzso coli to promote protein zzso support protein zzso and handle protein zzso zzso from these studies have been exploited to tackle the problems of inclusion body formation, zzso degradation and zzso bond generation that have long zzso the production of complex zzso proteins in a properly folded and biologically active zzso The application of this information to industrial zzso together with emerging strategies for creating designer folding zzso and performing zzso all but guarantee that zzso coli will remain an important host for the production of both commodity and high value added zzso
