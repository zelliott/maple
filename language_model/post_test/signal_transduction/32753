We studied the zzso severity and rate of progression of inflammatory zzso disease zzso induced in zzso mice by the adoptive transfer of low numbers of the following zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso 1) zzso zzso small zzso or large zzso zzso T zzso 2) zzso zzso small, or large, zzso or zzso zzso T zzso and 3) peripheral zzso zzso T cells from zzso zzso The adoptive transfer into zzso host of comparable numbers of zzso T cells was used to assess the zzso potency of these zzso Small zzso zzso T zzso and activated zzso T blasts induced early zzso zzso zzso and severe disease, while small resting and zzso zzso T cells or zzso T zzso induced a zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso mice transplanted with zzso zzso T cells showed a zzso zzso manifest zzso 20 zzso zzso In zzso mice with zzso transplanted with zzso zzso T cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abundantly producing zzso and zzso In zzso mice transplanted with zzso zzso zzso T cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cells produced very little zzso but abundant levels of zzso The zzso appearance of colitis in all transplanted zzso mice was zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso and zzso have zzso potential though of varying zzso
