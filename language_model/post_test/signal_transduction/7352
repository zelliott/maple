A fundamental goal in biology is to gain a quantitative understanding of how appropriate cell responses are achieved amid conflicting signals that work in zzso Through live, zzso imaging, we monitored both the dynamics of nuclear factor zzso zzso signaling and inflammatory zzso zzso in zzso exposed to the bacterial product zzso zzso Our analysis revealed a previously zzso positive feedback loop involving induction of the expression of zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso This positive feedback loop zzso the regulatory network when cells were exposed to zzso above a distinct zzso Paradoxically, this zzso of zzso signaling in zzso (a zzso cell zzso required the zzso factor zzso which promotes the development of zzso zzso zzso modeling and experimental validation showed that the zzso positive feedback overcame existing negative feedback zzso and enabled cells to discriminate between different zzso of zzso to mount an effective innate immune response only at higher zzso We suggest that this switching in the relative dominance of feedback zzso zzso dominance zzso may be a general mechanism in immune cells to integrate opposing feedback on a key zzso regulator and to set a response threshold for the zzso
