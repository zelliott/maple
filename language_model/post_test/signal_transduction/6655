zzso T cell proliferation is regulated in part by the cell surface expression of high affinity zzso receptors zzso The functional, high affinity form of the zzso zzso is comprised of two zzso binding zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso In the absence of the other zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta bind zzso with only low or intermediate zzso zzso The zzso and transient expression of zzso alpha regulates the display of high affinity zzso while zzso beta appears to contribute zzso to growth signal zzso Although the primary structure of both zzso chains has now been zzso the mechanism of growth signal zzso through the high affinity zzso remains zzso Of note, zzso beta belongs to a novel family of zzso receptors including the binding proteins for zzso zzso zzso erythropoietin, and zzso zzso zzso These various receptors may well zzso a common zzso zzso zzso
