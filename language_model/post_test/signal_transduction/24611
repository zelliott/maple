zzso zzso zzso selectively evokes an inward zzso current in cultured lobster zzso zzso zzso zzso and directly activates two types of channels in zzso patches of plasma membrane from the zzso The zzso channels have kinetic properties of zzso channels in the zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso zzso channels in other zzso An zzso directed against an zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes a protein with a molecular weight similar to the zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso selectively increases zzso inward currents and zzso zzso currents in the zzso The data provide further evidence for zzso as an zzso second zzso and zzso at least one and possibly two novel plasma membrane zzso receptors in zzso zzso
