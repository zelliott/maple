zzso oxide zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso involved in diverse plant zzso zzso as well as in the plant response to zzso NO has also been detected at different steps of the zzso between zzso and zzso NO is required for an optimal establishment of the zzso zzso zzso symbiotic interaction, but little is known about the role of NO in mature zzso Here, we investigate the role of NO in the late steps of zzso zzso and pharmacological approaches were conducted to zzso the NO level inside root zzso and their effects on nitrogen fixation and root zzso zzso were zzso An increase in zzso NO levels led to a decrease in nitrogen fixation and early zzso zzso characterized by zzso modifications of the zzso structure and the early expression of a specific zzso zzso By contrast, a decrease in NO levels led to a delay in zzso zzso Together, our results strongly suggest that NO is a signal in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In addition, this work demonstrates the pivotal role of the bacterial NO zzso response in the prevention of early zzso zzso and hence the maintenance of efficient zzso
