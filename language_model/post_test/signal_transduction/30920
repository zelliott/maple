We determined changes in zzso expression in specific zzso involved in the zzso of zzso in human white blood cells via zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by approximately 50% compared with control zzso The treatment did not alter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the specificity of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso data was accomplished via real-time zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso focused on zzso and zzso expression in different blood samples treated with zzso The analysis showed similar changes in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The expression was reduced by 47 zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso finding of a zzso zzso Furthermore, exposure of white blood cells to zzso M zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso and zzso Prior zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso addition zzso zzso zzso activity, demonstrating zzso was initiating its actions via stimulating zzso NO zzso derived NO release via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the past we demonstrated that zzso is involved in zzso zzso to zzso zzso in adrenal zzso zzso In the present study its expression was not found in controls and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso may not be zzso in white blood zzso Taken together, it appears that zzso has the ability to zzso its own synthesis via zzso and zzso zzso
