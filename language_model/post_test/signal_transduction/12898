Signaling between zzso and zzso is important in bone zzso We previously showed that human zzso zzso zzso calcium signals via two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and gap zzso zzso In the current work we identified mechanically induced zzso calcium signaling between zzso and zzso and among zzso zzso calcium responses in zzso required zzso zzso zzso but not gap zzso zzso zzso studies and reverse zzso amplification demonstrated that human zzso expressed functional zzso zzso but, unexpectedly, zzso of zzso did not block calcium signaling to zzso We also found that zzso expressed functional zzso receptors and showed that pharmacological zzso of these receptors blocked calcium signaling to zzso Thus these studies show that calcium signaling between zzso and zzso occurs via zzso of zzso zzso but that different families of zzso receptors are required for calcium signaling in these two cell zzso zzso calcium signaling among bone cells is therefore amenable to pharmacological manipulation that will specifically affect only zzso or zzso zzso zzso receptors may be important drug targets for the zzso of bone zzso
