The zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be involved in signaling by the zzso zzso zzso However, underlying signaling steps are poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso smooth muscle from zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells showed decreased zzso zzso generation and did not produce zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was markedly decreased in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was localized on the plasma membrane in zzso but zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a decreased expression of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the basis of the abnormal zzso zzso we studied zzso expression and zzso The amounts of total zzso and of zzso were not different in zzso mice, but a marked decrease occurred in the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of a zzso zzso restored zzso responses in zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose that zzso zzso oxygen species regulate zzso expression of zzso through mechanisms including zzso zzso The lack zzso zzso expression in smooth muscle could be involved in the decreased blood pressure in zzso zzso
