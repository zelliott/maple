The purpose of our study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to expression of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso in duct cells and the cell differentiation during pancreatic zzso 

The role of zzso in zzso expression and duct cell differentiation with pancreatic zzso in mice after partial zzso zzso was examined using either zzso a pharmacological zzso zzso or zzso zzso directed to the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso and zzso expression were assessed by Western zzso analysis and zzso 

Both zzso levels and zzso zzso were zzso increased in pancreatic ducts after partial zzso and, conversely, blocked by treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso duct cell zzso as assessed by appearance of zzso cells 3 days after partial zzso was effectively reduced by zzso 

The zzso zzso plays a critical role for both zzso expression and pancreatic duct cell differentiation into zzso cells during pancreatic zzso
