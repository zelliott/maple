T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signals cooperate in zzso T cells, although understanding of how these pathways are themselves regulated is zzso We found that zzso and zzso members of the Homer family of zzso scaffolding zzso are negative regulators of T cell zzso This is achieved through binding of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso and by competing with zzso zzso binding was also antagonized by active zzso zzso zzso thereby enhancing zzso signaling via zzso zzso of zzso This corresponded with changes in zzso expression and an increase in zzso T cell populations in zzso mice, which also developed zzso zzso These results demonstrate a further means by which zzso signals are regulated to control zzso
