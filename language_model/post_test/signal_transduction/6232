Small cell lung cancer zzso is an aggressive type of lung cancer, for which zzso chemotherapy appears to have reached its zzso zzso This zzso is characterized by the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso especially zzso The zzso for zzso is stem cell factor zzso In zzso zzso can influence zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso is operational in zzso and can be inhibited by zzso zzso Because the zzso of zzso zzso is one approach used to treat zzso we determined the effects of zzso signaling on zzso zzso A unique zzso of zzso on zzso acid zzso and zzso acid 703 was identified with the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso We demonstrate that with zzso stimulation over 16 hours zzso response zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso positive, zzso zzso a decrease in zzso activity was observed, whereas in zzso zzso cells zzso negative, zzso zzso there was no zzso of zzso activity by zzso Using zzso (5 zzso 16 zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso activity was observed in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Performing viability zzso we show that zzso in combination with zzso zzso by zzso or zzso the active zzso of zzso can zzso inhibit zzso cell viability (but not zzso cell zzso for 72 zzso We also show that zzso does not directly inhibit zzso activity in zzso The combination of zzso with zzso zzso could provide a useful combination in the treatment of zzso
