The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is an important functional marker of neural precursor cells zzso and plays a critical role in zzso and zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions are poorly zzso Using human embryonic stem zzso zzso to model zzso we found that zzso is required to maintain optimal levels of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression rescued the zzso proliferation deficit, as well as the early but not the late stages of the zzso deficit associated with the loss of zzso We found that zzso binds to a zzso site in the zzso promoter region and regulates zzso promoter zzso likely through interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso reduced proliferation and inhibited zzso zzso zzso the loss of zzso In particular, we identified zzso as a novel and potent inhibitor of zzso differentiation that targets zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we discovered the zzso zzso as a unique molecular mechanism governing zzso proliferation and zzso zzso
