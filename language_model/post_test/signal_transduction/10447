zzso transplanted across zzso zzso or human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the recipient by zzso prior to transplantation can prevent this zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso have been shown to function even when the zzso rebound in the zzso We have developed an in zzso model using human zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso the ability of zzso zzso class I zzso zzso to provide signals following binding to zzso class I zzso Using this model, we show that zzso undergo zzso zzso cell death by zzso upon exposure to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, exposure of zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso resistance towards zzso zzso that has been termed zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant increase in the expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the induction of zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent protein zzso A activities that facilitate the zzso of Bad at positions zzso and zzso In conclusion, exposure of zzso zzso of zzso class I zzso results in the induction of signals downstream that zzso resistance to zzso cells against zzso zzso cell zzso Together, the observations made in this study will provide the basis for zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso accommodation and developing strategies to induce accommodation in zzso prior to transplantation in highly zzso zzso
