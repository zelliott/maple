In this study, some of the signal zzso events involved in zzso cell death in tomato zzso zzso zzso suspension cells were zzso zzso treated with 100 zzso zzso showed typical features of programmed cell death zzso such as nuclear and zzso zzso Cell death was effectively inhibited by zzso and human zzso zzso indicating a cell death execution mechanism with similarities to animal zzso Cell death was suppressed by application of zzso and by zzso of zzso C zzso zzso D zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that low zzso of heavy metal zzso stimulate both zzso and zzso zzso pathways leading to the production of zzso oxygen species zzso and subsequent cell death executed by zzso zzso
