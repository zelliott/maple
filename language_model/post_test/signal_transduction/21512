zzso zzso zzso is an inherited disease in which cells from patients exhibit defects in zzso zzso repair zzso XP proteins zzso are crucial in the processes of DNA damage recognition and zzso and patients with XP can carry zzso in any of the genes that specify these zzso In zzso cells, zzso is a dynamic process in which a variety of proteins interact with one another, via modular zzso to carry out their zzso XP proteins are key players in several steps of the zzso process, including DNA strand discrimination zzso in complex with replication protein zzso repair complex formation zzso in complex with zzso zzso in complex with zzso and repair factor recruitment zzso factor zzso in complex with zzso Through these zzso zzso various types of bulky DNA zzso can be recognized and zzso Communication between the zzso system and other cellular pathways is also achieved by selected binding of the various structural zzso Here, we zzso recent studies on the domain structures of human zzso components and the regulatory networks that zzso these zzso Data provided by these studies have helped to illuminate the complex molecular interactions among zzso factors in the context of DNA zzso
