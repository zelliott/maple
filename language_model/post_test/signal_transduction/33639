The collective migration of cells in the form of cohesive zzso is a hallmark of both zzso and zzso The zzso cues that direct these complex zzso usually act by regulating the dynamics of a specific subset of cells, those at the leading zzso Given that normally the function of tissue migration is to lay down zzso structures, such as zzso zzso networks or sensory zzso it is surprising how little is known about the mechanisms that organize cells behind the leading zzso zzso of the zzso lateral line zzso switch from zzso leader cells to zzso zzso that develop into zzso zzso Here, we show that this transition is regulated by an zzso signaling circuit that is active within the zzso zzso Point sources of zzso zzso drive surrounding cells towards a zzso fate by increasing their zzso character, a prerequisite for zzso zzso We demonstrate that the dynamic expression of zzso zzso determines the zzso pattern of zzso underlying sensory organ formation in the lateral zzso Furthermore, this work zzso a surprising link between internal tissue organization and collective zzso
