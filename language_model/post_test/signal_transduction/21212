zzso are an effective zzso therapy for the treatment of zzso The zzso effects of zzso may be due to the zzso of zzso factors that regulate zzso zzso Because of the potential role of the zzso zzso in zzso inflammation and the possibility that this cell may be the main target of zzso zzso we have characterized zzso receptors zzso and zzso signaling in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso binding studies demonstrated that zzso cells have functional zzso that bind to zzso zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso and zzso density of binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were activated by zzso as assessed using a zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso reporter construct followed by zzso zzso treatment resulted in a fivefold induction of reporter gene zzso zzso with a nuclear factor zzso B reporter construct followed by tumor necrosis zzso zzso treatment resulted in a zzso induction of reporter gene zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso both the induced zzso and zzso B zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibited the repressive effect of zzso on zzso zzso B activity by zzso but only zzso the repressive effect of zzso on zzso zzso activity by zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso between zzso and zzso B with zzso may explain the zzso properties of zzso in airway zzso zzso
