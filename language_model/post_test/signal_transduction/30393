Comparative zzso analysis of important signaling pathways in zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals both zzso features and also zzso To build a framework to address the significance of these features we determined the zzso zzso embryonic cell zzso using the tools zzso and zzso We traced both cell divisions and cell positions for all cells through all but the last round of cell division and for selected cells through the final zzso We found the lineage to be remarkably similar to that of zzso zzso Not only did the founder cells give rise to similar numbers of zzso the relative cell division timing and positions were largely zzso These lineage similarities appear to give rise to similar cell fates as judged both by the positions of zzso equivalent cells and by the patterns of cell deaths in both zzso However, some zzso differences were seen, zzso the zzso cell cycle length is more than zzso longer in zzso zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso The extensive conservation of embryonic development between such divergent species suggests that substantial evolutionary distance between these two species has not altered these early zzso cellular events, although the zzso defects of zzso hybrids suggest that the details of the underlying molecular pathways have zzso sufficiently so as to not be zzso
