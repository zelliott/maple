G zzso receptors constitute a large and functionally diverse family of zzso zzso They are fundamental in the transfer of zzso stimuli to zzso signaling pathways and are among the most targeted proteins in drug zzso Recent advances in zzso methods have permitted to resolve the molecular structure of several members of the zzso This chapter focuses on the impact of these structures in the use of zzso modeling techniques for building three-dimensional models of zzso G zzso zzso higher order zzso and their complexes with zzso and signaling zzso
