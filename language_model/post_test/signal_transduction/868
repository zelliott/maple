zzso signaling is active in a variety of tumors and is also involved in the maintenance of normal stem cells in zzso We evaluated the possibility of preferential affection of tumor versus normal cells following zzso of this zzso We applied a cream preparation of zzso (an inhibitor of the zzso zzso onto skin tumors in patients who were scheduled for the zzso of these tumors (four zzso cell zzso and a zzso in four unrelated zzso All of the zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed zzso of the proliferation and highly efficient induction of the differentiation and zzso of tumor cells by a zzso zzso No adverse effects were noted and normal skin tissue and putative stem cells that were exposed to zzso together with tumors were well preserved under the conditions we zzso Our findings show selective and highly efficient induction of the differentiation and zzso of tumor cells in zzso by transient zzso of the zzso zzso signaling and provide a rational cancer zzso
