zzso oxygen zzso zzso play a pivotal role in the hypersensitive response zzso in disease zzso zzso zzso is a major source of zzso however, the mechanisms of its regulation are zzso Rice zzso zzso spontaneously form zzso which resemble those occurring during the HR, suggesting that the zzso affect regulation of the zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells accumulated increased amounts of zzso in response to rice blast zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso was suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso cells, and was also observed in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso have sufficient activities of zzso zzso compared with the wild zzso In addition, zzso zzso cells accumulated higher amounts of zzso when treated with zzso A zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso plants exhibited accelerated zzso of zzso and increased rates of cell death in response to zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are defective in the regulation of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso may give rise to enhancement of the signaling zzso which protein zzso controls, while the zzso zzso affects both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
