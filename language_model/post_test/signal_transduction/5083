zzso selection of a T cell for use in the immune response appears to zzso zzso expansion and terminal zzso differentiation of some cellular zzso while reserving other progeny as zzso memory zzso It has been suggested that zzso cell division may promote initial cell zzso Stem zzso models of zzso immunity might predict that subsequent encounters with a pathogen would evoke zzso zzso zzso division by memory T zzso In this study, we show that zzso memory zzso T cells can divide zzso in response to secondary encounter with zzso Critical regulators of signaling and zzso are zzso to one side of the zzso zzso in zzso memory T cells, and two zzso distinct populations of daughter cells are evident from the earliest zzso Memory T cells may thus use zzso cell division to generate cellular zzso when faced with pathogen zzso
