Although the zzso has been known as the major driving force of zzso new evidence has shown that zzso plays important roles during the zzso under pathological conditions including zzso zzso and zzso In search of zzso zzso zzso zzso we screened a zzso display zzso library with zzso zzso zzso Seven candidate peptides were identified that specifically bound to zzso zzso zzso of which zzso zzso zzso almost abolished zzso binding to zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso fused with zzso zzso inhibited zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso of human gastric cancer cell line zzso in zzso nude zzso zzso analyses showed that necrosis of the implanted tumor was markedly enhanced following treatment with zzso In the severe combined zzso disease zzso mouse model for studying zzso of the human breast cancer cell line zzso synthetic zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth and lung zzso Taken together, our results have demonstrated that zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso fulfilled the zzso and zzso effects by specifically interfering with the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Thus, short zzso zzso may have clinical potential in tumor zzso
