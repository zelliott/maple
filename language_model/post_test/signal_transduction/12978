zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso that is selectively expressed on zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso induce an increase in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso center zzso in zzso These effects are similar to those observed upon direct induction of zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso when the zzso interaction was prevented with zzso zzso zzso that the zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso inhibited the effects of zzso zzso on cell zzso and zzso zzso This zzso with zzso was not reversed by zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso indicating that zzso exerts its effects through a target downstream of this zzso In this regard, zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso affect the organization of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso to the zzso area, suggesting that these agents could inhibit the zzso of zzso by interfering with the zzso network of T zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time an important role for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
