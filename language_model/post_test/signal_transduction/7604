zzso is known to have diverse zzso zzso and nutritional benefits for zzso Nevertheless, the biological influence of zzso extract zzso on the general physiology of zzso cells remains zzso In this study a global zzso analysis was performed to identify genes affected by the addition of GE with zzso zzso as the model zzso 

In response to GE treatment, genes involved in signal zzso were immediately zzso and the zzso zzso sets of genes involved in the core cellular functions, including DNA zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso were generally zzso In contrast, a number of genes involved in zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso zzso functions and signal zzso were zzso Among the zzso genes that are also zzso zzso in the human zzso the expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by northern zzso zzso Based on the functional characterization of some zzso zzso it was found that GE treatment may promote cellular tolerance against a variety of environmental stresses in zzso 

GE treatment affects the expression levels of a significant portion of the zzso zzso zzso that GE significantly affects the general physiology of zzso zzso
