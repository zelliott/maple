zzso sequencing studies revealed that the majority of human and mouse zzso genes have multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have further established that many zzso are expressed in a zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying the zzso expression of most alternative zzso remain, however, to be zzso In this study, we focus on one possible zzso namely the zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulation with alternative zzso We analyzed the zzso and zzso zzso of full-length mouse and human zzso respectively, and found that in zzso units with multiple start sites, the inclusion of at least zzso and possibly up to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the use of specific zzso start sites zzso The vast majority of zzso zzso are zzso between human and zzso yet the conservation is weaker when compared with zzso zzso Additionally, the currently available data only support a weak correlation between the probabilities of zzso association of zzso zzso Our analysis thus suggests frequent zzso of zzso and zzso programs, and provides a large zzso of zzso on which the molecular basis of this zzso can be further zzso
