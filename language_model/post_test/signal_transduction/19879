zzso zzso is a leading cause of zzso To understand the mechanisms involved in protective zzso and pathological inflammatory responses during zzso we have been studying the zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in generating the rapid zzso zzso zzso responses required for the resolution of zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso mice exhibited an impairment in zzso zzso zzso responses similar to that of zzso zzso Moreover, the impairment in the zzso responses of zzso mice or zzso zzso mice zzso with an zzso zzso and death results from septic zzso as evidenced by a zzso systemic zzso response and characteristic organ zzso Since zzso appears to be the major zzso sensor zzso by zzso zzso we hypothesized that during elevated zzso the zzso of zzso sensors of bacteria triggers zzso inflammation in zzso zzso Indeed, blocking the zzso of zzso zzso prevented the induction of inflammatory zzso responses in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso activates the zzso sensor zzso zzso domain 2 zzso zzso deficient in both zzso and zzso have impaired zzso responses to zzso zzso compared to cells lacking zzso alone, and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited improved survival compared to zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is critical for protective immunity and suggest that, during heightened zzso recognition of bacterial components by zzso sensors can lead to pathological inflammatory zzso
