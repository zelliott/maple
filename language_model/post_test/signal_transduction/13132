zzso zzso zzso a toxic zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso agent of various animal zzso Our previous studies indicated the involvement of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso in zzso toxic zzso To further investigate the zzso of zzso alpha production and zzso mice zzso were treated zzso zzso or per zzso zzso with either vehicle or 25 zzso of zzso as a single dose and sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after zzso The zzso alpha expression was increased in liver and kidney after both routes of zzso exposure without any zzso in zzso The zzso zzso treatment caused greater zzso compared to the zzso route, as depicted by increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso level in zzso observed only after zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso at 8 h after zzso treatment correlated with the highest zzso alpha zzso also noted at 8 h after zzso treatment, thus further confirming the involvement of zzso alpha in zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was increased in liver at 4 h after zzso zzso treatment, suggesting a possible combined role of zzso alpha and zzso gamma in their induction and zzso
