The excessive proliferation and migration of zzso are zzso phenomena that play key roles in the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso zzso has been shown to have potent zzso effect in various cancer cells such as breast and prostate cancer zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso on zzso proliferation in primary cultured human zzso zzso zzso by analyzing protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso that are important in cell cycle control, and the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso proliferation was determined by a zzso incorporation zzso Western zzso analysis was applied to examine the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso It reduced proliferation of passage 2 zzso by zzso at 10 zzso and by nearly zzso at 100 zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso proliferation was also observed in passages 4 and zzso zzso zzso the expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso (24 zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso but did not affect zzso of zzso in zzso In addition, the expression of zzso and zzso triggered by zzso was inhibited by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso The zzso action of zzso in zzso was also blocked by zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso exerts the zzso effect of the proliferation of zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Hence we suggest that zzso could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso
