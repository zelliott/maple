To zzso the molecular basis for differential zzso to zzso zzso we compared the zzso of normal zzso zzso from zzso female rats of the resistant Copenhagen zzso strain with those of the susceptible Fischer 344 zzso August zzso Copenhagen Irish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and F1 zzso zzso zzso progeny zzso Gene expression profiles in zzso tissue within each rat strain were remarkably similar, indicating that gene expression was determined by genetic zzso We next identified the subset of genes that were zzso expressed in all susceptible strains relative to the resistant Cop zzso Among these, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its cell surface zzso were significantly elevated in all susceptible zzso The expression levels of several zzso genes were also significantly zzso indicating the presence of increased zzso signaling in zzso zzso of all susceptible zzso zzso analysis of gene expression profiles further identified the zzso zzso zzso among the pathways that most distinguished sensitive rat strains from the resistant Cop zzso To test the hypothesis that reduced levels of the zzso signaling in zzso tissue partially contributed to the genetic resistance to zzso zzso we used the zzso drug, zzso to zzso elevate serum zzso levels in the Cop zzso Whereas Cop rats are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso of zzso Cop females treated with perphenazine and zzso exposure developed zzso zzso with zzso comparable with those of sensitive zzso Together, these finding indicated that in the zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic zzso to zzso zzso include zzso of zzso zzso
