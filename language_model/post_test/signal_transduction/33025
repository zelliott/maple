The zzso growth factor zzso mediates its cellular functions via zzso of its zzso zzso zzso followed by the recruitment and zzso of several signaling zzso These signaling molecules then initiate specific signaling zzso finally resulting in distinct zzso zzso To delineate the zzso signaling zzso responsible for the disruption of gap zzso communication zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and a series of zzso zzso were expressed in zzso rat liver zzso zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso zzso induced disruption of zzso and zzso of a gap zzso zzso zzso zzso which required zzso of zzso protein zzso although involvement of additional factors was also zzso In the F5 zzso lacking binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso protein zzso but failed to affect zzso or zzso indicating involvement of additional signals presumably initiated by one or more of the zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso effects were not zzso via a single signaling zzso This was confirmed by the zzso zzso which showed that restoration of either zzso or zzso binding was sufficient to zzso the zzso zzso actions of zzso Further analysis showed that zzso of zzso is involved in zzso zzso which surprisingly failed to correlate with zzso zzso The results of our study demonstrate that zzso disruption of zzso can be zzso by multiple signaling pathways and requires participation of multiple zzso
