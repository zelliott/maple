zzso zzso infection is recognized as the major cause of zzso and gastric zzso however, its role in the development of zzso zzso disease and Barrett's zzso is zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso may be important in inflammation and zzso in the zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effect of live H zzso or H zzso extract zzso on these factors in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity were assessed by gel shift zzso and zzso by Western zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with live H zzso and zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso activity, and also decreased zzso zzso Treatment with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso The zzso vitamin C inhibited H zzso zzso zzso but increased zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced zzso expression and zzso production, and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that both live H zzso and zzso induce zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The induction of such zzso factors may play a role in the specific immune response within Barrett's zzso and may indirectly cause inflammation of the gastric zzso and the zzso zzso
