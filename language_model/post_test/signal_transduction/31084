zzso zzso is a joint disease that involves zzso of zzso cartilage, limited zzso inflammation zzso by zzso and changes in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is largely unknown, but since it may involve multiple factors, including zzso zzso and genetic factors, it has been difficult to identify unique targets for zzso zzso which are the unique cellular component of adult zzso cartilage, are capable of responding to structural changes in the surrounding cartilage zzso Since the initial stages of zzso involve increased cell proliferation and synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the cartilage, laboratory investigations have focused on the zzso as a target for therapeutic zzso The capacity of the adult zzso zzso to zzso the normal cartilage zzso architecture is zzso however, and the damage becomes irreversible unless the destructive process is zzso Current pharmacological interventions that address chronic pain are insufficient and no proven zzso therapy is zzso Identification of methods for early diagnosis is of key importance, since therapeutic interventions aimed at blocking or reversing structural damage will be more effective when there is the possibility of preserving normal zzso At later zzso cartilage tissue engineering with or without gene therapy with anabolic factors will also require therapy to inhibit inflammation and block damage to newly repaired zzso This review will focus on experimental approaches currently under study that may lead to zzso of effective strategies for therapy in zzso with emphasis on zzso that affect the function of zzso and interactions with surrounding zzso
