zzso zzso occurs in successive zzso First, the skin forms distinct regions zzso Then skin zzso with particular shapes and sizes form within each region zzso zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso formation in feather tracts and individual zzso zzso the importance of zzso and prompted the assessment of individual zzso functions at different zzso levels using the feather zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and 11 initially were expressed moderately throughout the feather tract then were zzso in restricted regions following two modes: zzso 1 and zzso became restricted to the zzso zzso then to the zzso zzso bud zzso zzso zzso and 11 intensified in the zzso region and zzso zzso or zzso respectively, then appeared in the zzso zzso bud zzso Their role in feather tract formation was determined using zzso zzso zzso in zzso at zzso Their function in periodic feather patterning was examined by zzso in zzso using zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso 1 reduced spinal tract size, but enhanced feather zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expanded the spinal tract size, reduced zzso domain zzso and produced zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 and dominant negative zzso 1 enhanced zzso zzso and generated thinner zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso cell proliferation and activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 inhibited proliferation but zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 triggered the zzso zzso Thus distinctive zzso have positive and negative roles in forming the zzso zzso zzso spacing and the growth and shaping of individual zzso
