We have examined the cellular action of zzso zzso zzso a DNA binding drug with zzso activity against the zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso Its action has been compared with that of two zzso zzso drugs, zzso and zzso 

The zzso melanoma and zzso colon zzso cell lines, each expressing zzso zzso were cultured and responses were compared by flow zzso zzso zzso and growth of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells to all three drugs, as measured by zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest, were comparable and typical of those of zzso II zzso zzso of zzso cells responded to zzso zzso with a zzso growth delay of 16 zzso In contrast, zzso cells had an attenuated DNA damage response to the drugs and zzso zzso had no in zzso activity, consistent with low zzso II zzso However, zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell growth in zzso and activated the zzso zzso to induce a state with zzso DNA content, low zzso index and a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso E and the zzso marker zzso but showed low expression of zzso B and zzso In comparison, zzso caused little zzso expression or cycle arrest, and zzso had an intermediate zzso 

The action of zzso zzso in zzso cells is typical of a zzso II zzso but the low zzso zzso activity of zzso cells allowed the detection of a second zzso action of zzso zzso in which cells undergo zzso cycle arrest and induction of zzso
