The zzso cerebral zzso is characterized by complex patterns of anatomical and functional areas that differ markedly between species, but the molecular basis for this functional subdivision is largely zzso Here, we show that zzso in zzso which encodes an orphan G zzso zzso zzso with a large zzso domain, cause a human brain cortical zzso called bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso cortical zzso that is most severe in frontal zzso Our data suggest that zzso signaling plays an essential role in regional development of human cerebral zzso
