Late effects after zzso for brain tumors can be severe and tend to limit the efficacy of this treatment zzso The mechanisms governing the development of late zzso zzso in the brain are not clear, but they are preceded by cycles of molecular and cellular events including production of zzso one of which is tumor necrosis factor zzso There is literature to support possible roles for zzso as a contributor to zzso zzso and zzso in the brain, all of which are zzso associated with zzso brain zzso We have examined the role of zzso signaling in the response to brain zzso using zzso or zzso and control zzso Mice lacking zzso exhibited increased early zzso zzso in putative stem cell regions of the zzso At 1 month, they had decreased zzso responses in the same regions, and by 3 months they were demonstrating zzso zzso and other severe neurological abnormalities that were not seen in control or zzso zzso zzso activity correlated with the onset of extensive zzso and by 6 months, levels of zzso basic protein in zzso zzso mice were approximately zzso of those seen in the other two zzso the animals were moribund and had to be zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso acting through zzso protects against the development of late complications of brain zzso
