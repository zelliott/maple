zzso and zzso belong to a large family of zzso zzso group of structurally and functionally closely related zzso The zzso are known to zzso the transfer of terminal zzso from zzso to other zzso and zzso Besides their role in the maintenance of the cells zzso pool the zzso zzso are known to have additional different biological functions, the most important being its zzso zzso zzso The complete picture of roles, actions and targets of zzso zzso is yet to be zzso Our goal was to identify the downstream targets of zzso by subjecting zzso zzso zzso 27 cells zzso zzso cell zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso Using this powerful technology we identified zzso groups of genes and zzso pathways that could be clustered into several groups: zzso related zzso cell cycle and DNA damage, zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso zzso pathway, differentiation and zzso structural and related zzso cell zzso zzso and their zzso zzso transport related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso Based on these results we suggest that zzso might have an important role in oral zzso cell zzso which is to be confirmed by future zzso
