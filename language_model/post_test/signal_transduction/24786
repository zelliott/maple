zzso was originally cloned from a rat zzso zzso zzso library and shown to participate in T cell zzso Human zzso zzso was cloned by screening a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso has a calculated molecular mass of 63 zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence indicates the presence of an zzso zzso region, a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso 2 zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 75 zzso zzso zzso microscope analysis indicates that in zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso zzso a zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso is found at the zzso compartment and also appears to be localized at the plasma zzso zzso is zzso by zzso Following zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso through its zzso zzso 2 zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso through its zzso zzso 2 zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study reveals a potentially new mechanism of T zzso zzso
