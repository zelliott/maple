The zzso II zzso reaction center protein D1 zzso rapid zzso zzso which is caused by zzso To identify the zzso involved in the zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso the D1 zzso we determined the action zzso of zzso transcription, zzso activity, photosynthesis and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In accordance with its zzso zzso zzso showed the highest activity in the spectral region from yellow to red and only low activity in the zzso zzso to green zzso zzso in turn, was fastest in zzso to violet light and a minor peak was found in the orange zzso The action spectrum of zzso zzso resembled closely that of zzso suggesting that zzso creates a signal for zzso of the zzso zzso
