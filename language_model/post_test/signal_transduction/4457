Although formation of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso requires multiple steps and proceeds along divergent zzso the underlying genetic and molecular zzso for each step and zzso remain zzso By developing transgenic mice expressing single or zzso genetic zzso in zzso we demonstrated here that overcoming zzso zzso tumor barriers was critical for zzso tumor zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was persistent and did not progress to tumors over a 10 months zzso This resistance to zzso coincided with increased expression of zzso and all zzso family zzso zzso of a zzso virus 40 T zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso family zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso triggered zzso zzso and high-grade zzso zzso that strongly resembled the human counterpart zzso zzso cells expressing both zzso and zzso had defective zzso checkpoint, elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso significantly reduced the size of high-grade zzso zzso but zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso altogether resulted in much greater tumor reduction and longer survival than did zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our studies provide the first experimental evidence zzso the zzso genetic events required for initiating high-grade zzso zzso a poorly defined and highly challenging clinical zzso Furthermore, they suggest that targeted therapy using a single agent such as zzso may not be highly effective in controlling high-grade zzso and that combination therapy employing zzso against multiple targets are more likely to achieve desirable therapeutic zzso
