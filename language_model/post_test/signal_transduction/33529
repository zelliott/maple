zzso is a relatively zzso zzso oxygen species that signals between cells and zzso zzso zzso in plants is essential for response to stress, zzso against pathogens and the regulation of programmed cell zzso Although zzso diffusion across zzso is often considered as a passive property of zzso zzso native zzso represent significant barriers for zzso In the present study we addressed the question of whether channels might facilitate zzso zzso across plasma zzso The expression of several plant plasma membrane zzso in zzso including zzso from zzso (where zzso is plasma membrane intrinsic zzso enhanced the toxicity of zzso and increased the zzso of zzso zzso when exposed to zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso was altered by zzso that alter gating and the selectivity of the zzso The zzso of water, zzso and zzso was zzso using molecular dynamics simulations based on the crystal structure of zzso from zzso The calculations identify differences in the zzso between the zzso and reveal channel zzso critically involved in zzso zzso The results of the calculations on zzso and zzso are in agreement with the zzso zzso Taken together, the results strongly suggest that plasma membrane zzso pores determine the efficiency of zzso zzso between zzso zzso are present in most species and their capacity to facilitate the diffusion of zzso may be of zzso significance in many organisms and particularly in communication between different zzso
