zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso cause zzso zzso Parkinson zzso The most deleterious point zzso is the zzso zzso which resides in a structure motif zzso two zzso zzso and zzso separated by a zzso Here we subjected the zzso zzso motif to systematic zzso zzso introducing zzso zzso zzso as well as conservative zzso into the zzso zzso Furthermore, we generated deletion zzso lacking the zzso the zzso and the entire C zzso When zzso into neural and zzso cell lines, zzso levels of zzso breaking and zzso deletion zzso were dramatically lower than zzso zzso The effects of zzso breakers were comparably smaller, and the zzso breaking zzso only slightly zzso zzso The decreased zzso levels were due to accelerated protein degradation involving in part the zzso zzso breaking zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso These structural zzso had functional consequences on the zzso activities of zzso The zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso against zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso The loss of survival promoting activity of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso correlated with impaired zzso zzso We found that zzso but not zzso zzso facilitated the zzso zzso and simultaneously blocked the zzso zzso zzso 1, with which zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso are critical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is absolutely required for stability and the regulation of zzso zzso signaling of the Parkinson zzso protein zzso
