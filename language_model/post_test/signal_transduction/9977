zzso proteins involved in signal processing through zzso G proteins are generally defined as proteins distinct from G zzso zzso zzso G zzso or classical zzso that regulate the zzso of signal transfer upon zzso zzso or position these entities in the right zzso contributing to the formation of a functional signal zzso zzso A flurry of recent studies have implicated an additional class of accessory proteins for this system that provide signal input to zzso G proteins in the absence of a cell surface zzso serve as alternative binding partners for G protein zzso provide unexpected modes of G protein regulation, and have introduced additional functional roles for G zzso This group of accessory proteins includes the recently discovered zzso of G protein Signaling zzso proteins identified in a functional screen for zzso zzso of G protein signaling as well as several proteins identified in protein interaction screens and genetic screens in model zzso These accessory proteins may influence zzso zzso and zzso exchange at the zzso zzso alter zzso interactions within zzso zzso independent of zzso exchange, or form complexes with zzso or zzso independent of the typical zzso zzso zzso and related accessory proteins reveal unexpected diversity in G protein zzso as signal zzso within the zzso
