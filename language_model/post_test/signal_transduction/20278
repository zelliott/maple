This paper reviews the current understanding of the molecular basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and discusses the role of zzso in skeletal muscle zzso caused by zzso zzso is the master zzso regulator that stimulates zzso zzso by zzso nuclear respiratory factors zzso 2) and zzso zzso factor A zzso which leads to increased zzso DNA replication and gene zzso zzso also regulates cellular zzso zzso by stimulating the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso protein zzso Recent reports from zzso zzso zzso underline the importance of zzso in zzso skeletal muscle, demonstrate enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and reduced zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to play a protective role against zzso skeletal muscle zzso
