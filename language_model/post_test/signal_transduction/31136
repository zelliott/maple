The zzso zzso bacteria zzso are zzso that reproduce in an zzso manner rather than by zzso zzso and are of interest as simple models of zzso Prior to this work, the only member of this group for which zzso sequence was available was the model freshwater zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso sequence of zzso zzso a marine member of the zzso that differs from zzso zzso in that zzso zzso uses its stalk as a zzso zzso Genome analysis indicates that this zzso shares more genes with zzso zzso than it does with zzso zzso (a closer relative according to zzso zzso zzso that it relies upon a zzso strategy utilizing a wide range of zzso that its cell cycle is likely to be regulated in a similar manner to that of zzso zzso and that the outer membrane zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are remarkably zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are highly zzso via a single polar zzso With the exception of zzso and zzso genes required for zzso were absent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not respond to any zzso stimuli that were tested, which suggests that zzso zzso zzso is a random zzso mechanism for zzso cells rather than a zzso navigation system for locating specific zzso In addition to providing insights into bacterial development, the zzso zzso zzso will provide an important resource for the study of other interesting biological processes including zzso zzso polar growth, and cell zzso
