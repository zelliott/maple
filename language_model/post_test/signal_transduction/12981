The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso cells where it physically associates with the related zzso zzso Positive zzso through zzso is associated with zzso stability and suppression of this signal is thought to be required for vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso or zzso Here we examine the effects of zzso on zzso and the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso generation of the zzso zzso and loss of the full-length zzso The effects of zzso on zzso formation are not suppressed by zzso of protein zzso C and do not involve the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, do abolish zzso generation in response to the zzso growth zzso zzso stimulation of cells does not cause zzso of the zzso complex; rather the complex is converted to a form zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso can therefore switch the zzso complex between two different forms in zzso zzso The ability of zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso complex provides a mechanism zzso this zzso of vessel growth and zzso can directly zzso receptors involved in vessel zzso Such zzso is likely to be important in the coordinate control of blood vessel formation during development and in zzso zzso
