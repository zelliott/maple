The zzso zzso protein is localized at focal zzso and zzso contacts and is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle cell zzso A known interaction partner of zzso in human is the tumor zzso protein zzso zzso down zzso expression during zzso embryonic development results in defects of convergence and extension zzso movements, which occur during zzso and mediate zzso of the zzso body zzso zzso cell polarization underlying zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell polarity zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso during early zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso of zzso results in defects of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso analysis associates the defective zzso convergence movements with a reduced ability to migrate along straight zzso In addition, expression of zzso is significantly reduced in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso or a zzso form of zzso zzso 2, which is a downstream zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso expression is dependent on zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso in zzso and that zzso and zzso cooperate for the mediation of zzso
