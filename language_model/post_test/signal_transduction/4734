zzso zzso channels zzso ) mediate zzso background currents that zzso the membrane potential of excitable zzso zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso provides zzso background currents in zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso channels was proposed as a therapeutic zzso Here we zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso channels were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and currents were recorded with the zzso zzso clamp zzso 

zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso current by zzso in a zzso zzso The inactive analogue zzso had no effect on channel zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso reduced zzso channel zzso indicating that zzso is involved in this effect of zzso Selective zzso of conventional zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso did not reproduce zzso zzso channel zzso Current zzso by zzso was not affected by zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso ruling out a significant contribution of zzso or zzso with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso of putative zzso zzso sites did not prevent zzso zzso zzso channel zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso background currents may serve as a novel molecular target for migraine zzso
