When tobacco plants were treated by injection with zzso oxide zzso compounds, the sizes of zzso caused by zzso mosaic virus zzso on the treated leaves and on upper zzso leaves were significantly zzso The reduction in zzso zzso size was caused by NO released from the zzso zzso the byproduct formed after release of NO from the zzso compound zzso zzso did not itself alter zzso zzso Treatment of tobacco plants with zzso of zzso oxide zzso or an NO scavenger attenuated but did not abolish the systemic acquired resistance zzso induced by salicylic acid zzso In zzso transgenic tobacco plants, NO had no effect on zzso size following zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO plays an important role in zzso induction in tobacco and that NO is required for the full function of zzso as an zzso zzso The activity of NO is fully dependent on the function of zzso in the zzso signaling zzso in zzso
