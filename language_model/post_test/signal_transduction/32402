The nervous system can generate zzso capable of signaling cells of the immune system via two zzso zzso hormonal influences via zzso organ zzso and zzso neurotransmitter influences via direct zzso of the zzso of both primary and secondary zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso nerve fibers are found directly adjacent to cells of the immune system in bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso These zzso can zzso immune responsiveness at several levels, including individual cellular functions, collective cellular interactions and immune responses, and overall host zzso response to a challenge by bacteria, zzso tumor cells, or other zzso The ability of neural signals to zzso immune responsiveness is influenced by such factors as zzso with other zzso synergistic or dual signaling by zzso and zzso hormonal influences on zzso availability or zzso zzso extent of zzso and zzso of the neural zzso and unique chemical and zzso aspects of the specific zzso of the zzso organ in which signaling is taking zzso Thus, zzso signaling is a complex and dynamic process, with zzso interactions in a complex zzso
