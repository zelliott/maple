In zzso zzso zzso rats, zzso proliferation is regulated by neuroendocrine factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso There is no evidence that the sensory zzso substance P zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice underwent sham or zzso for 1 zzso Then we evaluated 1) zzso zzso zzso and zzso serum zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the number of zzso positive by zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling in liver zzso 3) zzso expression for collagen zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso in total liver zzso and 4) zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso In zzso lines, we determined the effects of SP on zzso and zzso zzso levels, zzso and zzso zzso zzso express zzso with expression being zzso following zzso In normal zzso mice, there was higher zzso zzso and scattered zzso zzso compared with zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, there was a decrease in serum zzso and zzso levels and the number of zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso compared with zzso In total liver samples, the expression of collagen zzso and zzso increased in zzso compared with normal mice and decreased in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In zzso from zzso zzso zzso mice there was decreased zzso expression and zzso zzso In zzso SP increased zzso levels, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso may be important in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
