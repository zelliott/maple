zzso have developed a zzso system for the control of the activities of key zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which allows a switch between these opposing pathways to prevent futile zzso This regulatory system, known as the zzso system, consists of several proteins zzso a zzso cascade that zzso the light signal perceived by zzso to selected target zzso thereby influencing their zzso A central component of the zzso cascade is a novel zzso the zzso zzso which is capable of reducing a zzso bridge with the help of an zzso zzso Recent developments on the zzso of the structures of several implicated proteins and on the mechanism of signal transfer have greatly improved our understanding of this regulatory zzso This review describes the components of the zzso zzso the principal target zzso and the mechanism of action of the zzso zzso
