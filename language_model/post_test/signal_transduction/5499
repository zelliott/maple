To investigate abnormalities of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso expression in chronic inflammatory airway diseases and its regulation mechanisms, the present study was designed to observe the expression of zzso zzso zzso current and the possible relevant signal pathways in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso by using real-time zzso zzso Western zzso and whole cell zzso The results demonstrated that zzso zzso was decreased in rat airway zzso under ozone zzso zzso stress also zzso zzso protein and zzso expression and zzso zzso current in cultured human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso signal zzso was checked to investigate the signal zzso It was found that zzso with zzso inhibitor attenuated the zzso zzso expression induced by ozone zzso We also observed that ozone stress accelerated the zzso of zzso in zzso which could be influenced by some signaling molecules related to the early zzso of cellular zzso Furthermore, zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso inhibitor zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso stress could zzso the expression of zzso and decrease zzso zzso current in zzso The signal mechanism which referred to cascade events in cells included early zzso stress signal transmission zzso and subsequently zzso zzso zzso
