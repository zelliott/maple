AIDS is one of the most devastating diseases in human zzso Decades of studies have revealed host factors required for zzso infection, indicating that zzso exploits host processes for its own zzso zzso infection leads to AIDS as well as various zzso The associations between zzso and human pathways and diseases may reveal zzso relationships between zzso and zzso zzso 

Human biological pathways were evaluated and statistically compared against the presence of zzso host factor related zzso All of the obtained scores comparing zzso targeted genes and biological pathways were zzso Different rank results based on overlapping zzso recovered zzso zzso zzso zzso and common interactions in human zzso interaction networks were zzso zzso between rankings suggested that these measures yielded diverse zzso Rank combination of these ranks led to a final ranking of zzso zzso which revealed that zzso is associated with immune zzso pathways and several zzso zzso The proposed method is also zzso to the evaluation of associations between other pathogens and human pathways and zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso infection shares common molecular mechanisms with certain signaling pathways and zzso zzso in zzso pathways and the long-term suppression of immune system functions by zzso infection might contribute to zzso zzso between zzso infection and human pathways of disease may aid in the identification of common drug targets for viral infections and other zzso
