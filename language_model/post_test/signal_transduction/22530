To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso into zzso cells induced by zzso zzso and to explore the expression and significance of zzso signaling in this zzso 

zzso were isolated and zzso from the zzso cords of normal or zzso term deliveries under sterile zzso After treatment with zzso for 24 zzso zzso was continued to culture, the expression of zzso and zzso at 4 weeks after zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso after induction were zzso The expression of cardiac zzso I zzso after 4 weeks was determined by zzso 

zzso treated with zzso were stained positively for zzso 4 weeks after zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso group was stable and significantly higher than that in the control group zzso zzso value for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso mean zzso value for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso Similar results were observed for zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso times higher than that in the control group, respectively, with statistical zzso 

zzso can be differentiated into zzso cells by zzso induction in zzso zzso may affect this process by regulating the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso may be involved in this zzso
