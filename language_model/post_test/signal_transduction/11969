The Allen Brain zzso zzso database provides comprehensive zzso zzso of gene expression in the adult mouse brain for studying the spatial expression patterns in the zzso central nervous zzso It is zzso challenging to construct the accurate anatomical and genetic networks using the zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel sparse zzso model to accurately construct the brain anatomical and genetic networks, which are important to reveal the brain spatial expression zzso Our new approach addresses the zzso and zzso tuning problems, which are notorious in the existing network analysis methods, such that the proposed model is more suitable for solving practical biomedical zzso We validate our new model using the zzso zzso data, and the network construction results show the superior performance of the proposed sparse zzso zzso
