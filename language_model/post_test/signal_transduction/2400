Previous blood flow studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso produces exaggerated zzso zzso in young spontaneously zzso rats zzso compared with zzso control rats zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of zzso calcium signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso in zzso Renal blood flow zzso was measured by electromagnetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso to avoid interactions with zzso zzso was injected into the zzso artery to produce a transient zzso to zzso decrease in zzso without affecting zzso zzso To achieve similar control levels of zzso zzso received a lower dose (2 versus 5 zzso zzso of zzso with zzso produced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted maximum zzso by blocking zzso to zzso of the peak zzso response, indicating the involvement of zzso zzso calcium zzso To evaluate zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso or zzso was zzso with zzso Each agent produced a zzso zzso of up to zzso of the maximum blood flow change produced by zzso The degrees of zzso produced by maximum effective doses of zzso and zzso were zzso the combination blocked up to zzso of the response to zzso These observations indicate that about one third of the zzso zzso of zzso resistance vessels is zzso by zzso zzso calcium channels responsive to the zzso zzso zzso two thirds of the change in vascular tone is due to zzso zzso calcium zzso from zzso sources sensitive to zzso and zzso The results suggest that the exaggerated zzso vascular zzso to zzso challenge in zzso is probably not due to a strain difference in zzso calcium signal zzso After zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and calcium entry signaling pathways participate to similar degrees in zzso and zzso
