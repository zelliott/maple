Natural zzso acids are commonly present in plants consumed in the zzso Recently we have observed that different natural zzso acids exert differential effects on the body mass gain in zzso and zzso female zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids on serum zzso and total cholesterol levels in zzso and zzso zzso The experiments were carried out on zzso old female zzso zzso rats, divided into following groups zzso in each zzso zzso control rats and zzso rats receiving zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso control rats, zzso control rats and zzso rats receiving the same zzso zzso The zzso acids were administered at a dose of 10 zzso zzso daily for 4 zzso zzso zzso and total cholesterol levels on the next day after the last administration of the zzso acids were zzso The zzso acids did not affect serum zzso or total cholesterol levels in zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso acid and to a lesser extent zzso acid increased serum zzso level, which effect correlated with a decreased body mass zzso All the zzso acids decreased serum cholesterol level in zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of some zzso acids may be, at least zzso connected with zzso zzso
