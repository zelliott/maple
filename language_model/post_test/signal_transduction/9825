zzso between functionally related adjacent zzso is essential during zzso For example, formation of trunk neural crest cells zzso is highly influenced by the adjacent zzso but the molecular mechanism involved is not well zzso As part of this zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso control the onset of zzso in the extending neural zzso In this paper, using zzso and zzso experiments, we show that zzso zzso signaling prevents premature zzso of zzso and, consequently, premature zzso transition zzso to allow cell zzso In contrast, zzso generated zzso promotes zzso of zzso at zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso signaling control zzso in part through the zzso of elements of the bone zzso protein and zzso signaling zzso These data establish a clear role for opposition of zzso and zzso signaling in control of the timing of zzso zzso and zzso and, consequently, coordination of the development of the central and peripheral nervous system during zzso trunk zzso
