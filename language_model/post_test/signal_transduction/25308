zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate cell and organ size in zzso but the role of zzso in zzso in zzso is not well zzso To examine the role of zzso in intact zzso zzso we have created and characterized transgenic mice expressing zzso active or zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso specific expression of zzso active zzso resulted in mice with larger hearts, while zzso zzso resulted in mice with smaller zzso The increase or decrease in heart size was associated with comparable increase or decrease in zzso zzso zzso changes, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso dysfunction, were not observed in either of the transgenic zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient to promote organ growth in zzso
