Transit into zzso of the first zzso cell cycle in zzso eggs is a process referred to as zzso and is accompanied by an increase in zzso free calcium zzso zzso which may be zzso into zzso events characteristic of zzso by protein zzso C zzso To investigate the respective roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso egg zzso the calcium signal was blocked by zzso of the calcium zzso zzso or the activity of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were then challenged for zzso by treatment with either calcium zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented cortical contraction, cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation in eggs challenged with zzso but not with zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso inhibited cortical zzso zzso cortical contraction, and zzso zzso formation in eggs challenged with either zzso or zzso zzso of egg zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso treatment does not increase egg zzso in zzso zzso Further, zzso does not increase zzso in eggs that have not been injected with zzso These results show that zzso acts downstream of the zzso increase to induce zzso events of the first zzso zzso cell zzso
