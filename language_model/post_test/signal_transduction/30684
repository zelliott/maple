The zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of the zzso zzso involved in the synthesis of both proteins and lipids destined for multiple sites within and without the zzso The zzso functions to both zzso and zzso modify newly zzso proteins and lipids and sort them for zzso within the zzso and for transport to their sites of function away from the zzso In addition, the zzso is involved in the metabolism and degradation of specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso A variety of zzso studies have been reported on different zzso of the zzso providing an zzso protein dictionary with new data being made available on many protein complexes of relevance to the biology of the zzso including the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folding zzso the zzso machinery, signaling proteins and proteins involved in membrane zzso This review examines zzso and zzso data in support of the presence of specific molecular machines at specific sites or zzso of the zzso
