The zzso zzso nucleus zzso controls the zzso rhythm of many zzso and behavioral events by an orchestrated output of the electrical activity of zzso zzso We examined the propagation of output signals from the zzso into the zzso especially into the region of the zzso nucleus, through zzso recordings using acute and zzso brain zzso zzso rhythms in spontaneous firing rate with a period close to 24 zzso were demonstrated in the zzso in directly adjacent zzso regions, and in the region of the zzso nucleus of the zzso an important center for the integration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity rhythms recorded from structures outside of the zzso were in phase with the rhythms in the zzso zzso information in the zzso was lost after zzso of the zzso but could be restored by zzso zzso indicating that a zzso factor is responsible for the restoration of zzso zzso in the absence of neural zzso zzso application of zzso zzso provided evidence that zzso can induce zzso in the zzso These data indicate that the zzso uses a dual zzso and zzso mechanism for communication with its targets in the zzso
