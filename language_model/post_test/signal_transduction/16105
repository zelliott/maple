zzso zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso that is currently used as a vaccine zzso in zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso treatment on the innate immune response to systemic bacterial infections in zzso Mice treated with zzso after burn injury showed improved survival and less local and systemic dissemination of bacteria in a model of zzso zzso burn wound zzso zzso treatment with zzso significantly enhanced bacterial clearance at the site of infection and reduced systemic dissemination of bacteria despite causing zzso of zzso zzso production during acute zzso infection caused by zzso zzso and zzso Administration of zzso at 1 h after zzso also improved bacterial clearance but did not alter zzso zzso zzso treatment increased the numbers of zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso at sites of infection and increased the percentage and total numbers of zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso eliminated the ability of zzso treatment to improve bacterial zzso The zzso effects of zzso were absent in zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies show that zzso treatment significantly zzso the innate immune response to bacterial infection by enhancing bacterial clearance despite the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The enhanced bacterial clearance is zzso in part, by increased numbers of zzso cells with effective zzso functions at sites of infection and is zzso zzso
