zzso zzso are plasma membrane zzso that are enriched in cholesterol, zzso and zzso proteins and play an important role in the signaling of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognizes zzso in the cell walls of zzso and triggers signal zzso via its zzso zzso However, it is not known if similar to zzso zzso zzso would also signal via zzso zzso and if the integrity of zzso raft zzso is important for the zzso functions zzso by zzso We demonstrate here using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso upon stimulation of zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, two key signaling zzso zzso and zzso are also recruited to zzso zzso upon the zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso raft zzso facilitate zzso zzso zzso of zzso raft integrity with the synthetic drug, zzso zzso leads to reduced zzso zzso flux and defective zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso have significantly attenuated production of zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso engagement, and they also exhibit impaired zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, the data indicate that zzso and perhaps also other zzso are recruited to zzso zzso upon zzso and that the integrity of zzso zzso is important for the signaling and cellular functions initiated by this class of innate zzso
