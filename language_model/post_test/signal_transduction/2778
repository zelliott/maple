zzso zzso C zzso zzso are essential components of cell zzso In this study, we investigated the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso cells by the zzso fatty acids zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso induced a zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane and focal zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso of zzso cells to the zzso protein zzso However, zzso inhibited these zzso effects on zzso A zzso mechanism of action for zzso and zzso is supported by the following zzso First, zzso triggered a rapid increase in cellular levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso bursts of both second zzso Second, the zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso was sensitive to zzso by a zzso C inhibitor and zzso zzso Finally, a zzso binding site zzso zzso 1 zzso for zzso was detected in zzso cells, and binding of zzso to zzso cells was effectively inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso In zzso our data provide evidence that regulation of zzso by zzso and zzso may be through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
