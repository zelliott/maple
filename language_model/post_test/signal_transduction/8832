During zzso in adult rat zzso fully developed zzso zzso zzso at the zzso edge of the zzso zzso undergo zzso at stage VIII of the zzso zzso zzso This is zzso by the disruption of the zzso zzso specialization zzso zzso so that zzso can enter the zzso zzso and to complete their maturation in the zzso At the same time, the zzso barrier zzso located near the basement membrane zzso extensive restructuring to allow transit of zzso zzso so that zzso germ cells complete their development behind the zzso While zzso and zzso restructuring take place zzso at opposite ends of the zzso cell zzso the zzso zzso by which they are coordinated were not known until zzso Studies have shown that fragments of zzso chains are generated from the zzso protein complex at the zzso zzso via the action of zzso zzso zzso at zzso These peptides serve as the local zzso factors to destabilize the zzso These zzso peptides also exert their effects on zzso which, in turn, further zzso zzso zzso Thus, a novel zzso zzso regulatory loop is operating in the zzso zzso to coordinate these two crucial cellular events of zzso This functional loop is further assisted by the zzso polarity protein complex in coordination with zzso and testosterone at the zzso zzso we provide a critical review based on the latest findings in the field regarding the regulation of these cellular zzso These recent findings also open up a new window for investigators studying zzso zzso
