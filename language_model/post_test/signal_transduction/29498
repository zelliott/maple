Although human zzso zzso zzso express high levels of zzso A, the zzso functions of zzso zzso A remain zzso Human zzso cancer cells express both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso the same zzso signaling molecules as zzso zzso Using three differentiated human zzso zzso cell lines, we investigated whether there are interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed cell surface expression of two types of zzso zzso zzso and four types of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation in three zzso zzso cell zzso zzso A did not affect the growth of the three zzso cell lines, and zzso with zzso A zzso reduced zzso zzso of cell zzso These results suggest that in zzso zzso cells, the zzso signals underlying zzso zzso of growth can themselves be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso the increased expression of zzso A may be involved in zzso by reducing zzso signals zzso cell growth in human zzso zzso zzso
