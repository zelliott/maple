This review article focuses on zzso of gap junctions in response to chemical zzso of zzso zzso mechanical forces, and zzso in zzso zzso Signaling zzso by mechanical forces is likely to be involved in the zzso of cardiac gap junctions during the early phase of cardiac zzso and the subsequent zzso in cardiac zzso Several signaling pathways involving zzso zzso II, transforming growth zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso regulators have been shown to affect expression of gap junction zzso However, a comprehensive view of regulation of gap junction trafficking, zzso and degradation is still zzso In addition to gap junction regulation by zzso mechanical forces, there is a close relation between gap junctions and zzso junctions and their linkage to the zzso This can be zzso from experiments on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and gap junctions after mechanical stretch, and human zzso caused by genetic defects in zzso zzso junction zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for the interaction between mechanical and functional zzso zzso remain to be zzso
