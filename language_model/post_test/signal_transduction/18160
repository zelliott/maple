Many zzso zzso can induce cell zzso and inhibit zzso and zzso communication zzso zzso the movement of small molecules (less than zzso zzso through membrane channels, is important in regulating cellular zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso can increase cell proliferation and zzso inhibit zzso In this study, the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined in rats treated for 7 days with zzso doses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 800 zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso In addition, zzso zzso was included as a negative zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso proliferation and inhibited zzso zzso while no zzso in these growth parameters was observed in zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso transfer through intact liver, was decreased nearly 50% by zzso zzso and zzso yet no effect on zzso was observed in liver from zzso zzso These data indicate that compounds that inhibit zzso in liver may be zzso zzso which occurs simultaneously during increased cell proliferation and inhibited zzso
