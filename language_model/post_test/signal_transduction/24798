In the rat zzso zzso zzso mediates nocturnal induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as of zzso factors such as zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of the DNA binding protein zzso response element binding protein zzso While zzso zzso zzso appears to be a prerequisite for zzso and zzso gene zzso it is not known whether zzso zzso accounts for the full zzso response of the two zzso Furthermore, the significance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso In the present in zzso study we used the zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso without altering zzso zzso zzso It was observed that zzso zzso zzso was less effective than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of this finding, it is concluded that zzso zzso alone is apparently not sufficient for the full zzso response of the two zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso equally zzso the zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso Therefore zzso may induce zzso and zzso transcripts via zzso zzso Our observations suggest that zzso zzso plays a critical role in diversification of zzso gene induction in the rat zzso
