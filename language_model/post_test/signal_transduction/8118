zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso of the zzso signaling zzso that plays important roles in both zzso and zzso zzso have been proposed to antagonize zzso activity by binding to zzso However, the affinity of this binding is zzso Here we show, using surface zzso resonance and zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind directly to zzso with affinities in the zzso zzso However, only zzso and zzso antagonize zzso activity by blocking zzso induced zzso zzso in L zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso signaling in an zzso cell model of zzso zzso These results provide the first measurement of binding affinity of zzso for a zzso which together with the measurement of zzso activity of zzso could help understand how zzso regulate zzso zzso
