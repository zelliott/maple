The removal by zzso of zzso zzso is central for repair in zzso zzso that follows traumatic injury to zzso and in zzso zzso diseases zzso multiple zzso We tested for roles played by the zzso cascade in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso by complement zzso zzso and scavenger zzso zzso separately and combined in mouse zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cascade tested are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso exchange protein directly activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso at normal operating zzso levels zzso those occurring in the absence of zzso that alter zzso zzso suggesting zzso of zzso through zzso at normal zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso that elevate zzso zzso levels to above zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited also by zzso zzso whose addition mimics abnormal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that abnormal high zzso levels inhibit zzso through zzso and zzso Altogether, observations suggest a dual role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso at normal zzso levels and zzso at zzso Furthermore, a balance between zzso zzso production by zzso and zzso degradation by zzso maintains normal operating zzso levels that enable efficient zzso
