zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, is expressed in zzso zzso within highly restricted zzso of the embryonic mouse zzso Previous reports identified critical roles for zzso in zzso of the zzso and zzso but the cellular identities of zzso zzso in these regions were not fully zzso This study characterizes zzso expression with respect to zzso zzso factor and neurotransmitter zzso in zzso mouse zzso In the zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso in the stratum zzso zzso zzso as zzso and observed a requirement for zzso in zzso zzso We also identified two zzso zzso populations in the zzso zzso the red nucleus, and a zzso population, both of which contain zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is present in regionally restricted zzso of zzso zzso and may have unique functions that promote zzso and zzso zzso
