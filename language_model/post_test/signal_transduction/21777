In this work, we show that zzso zzso of plasma membrane zzso from zzso zzso is strongly dependent on calcium metabolism and that the zzso sensor zzso works in a parallel way with the G protein zzso in the control of the zzso The role of zzso is played by the zzso zzso tail, since in a strain with the deletion of the zzso zzso but also expressing a zzso protein formed by zzso (a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso tail, a normal zzso process can be zzso We present zzso indicating that zzso would be the sensor for the internal signal zzso zzso of this zzso that would connect calcium signaling and zzso of the plasma membrane zzso We also show that zzso could be involved in the control of zzso activity that would regulate the calcium availability in the zzso
