The general features of theoretical biology are zzso starting from the beginnings of modern zzso energy zzso in zzso The major characteristics of the zzso systems are then described and it is pointed out that especially the treatment of zzso directed chemical flow in divided space in cells is central to this zzso It is also the major theoretical problem of many other cellular zzso The development of zzso until today, based on the theories of flows of zzso zzso and other chemical materials in structures, is then zzso Great benefit has accrued from the knowledge of the structures which allow controlled flow, zzso In a speculative forward look at the theoretical biology of cells based on this outline the usefulness of further reductive analysis of extracted molecular units is considered as descriptions of mobility within structures of large molecules and zzso as well as in free zzso Such structures are central to zzso control and zzso The possibility of a more holistic approach is then zzso This will require markers of flow states and spatial zzso It is shown that as the flow system is one of a combined environment and organisms the study of metal zzso in both has particular zzso Consideration is given as to how this study can assist a broad understanding of the chemistry of the evolution of zzso The changes of the zzso strongly linked to the zzso the zzso and the environment, is a ready source of information concerning the manner in which changes in zzso and controls of flow of organic chemicals have evolved in the divided space of cells and of cellular zzso The connection of the code changes to the environment via the zzso changes is then zzso
