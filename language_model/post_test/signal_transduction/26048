Cellular prion protein zzso is a zzso membrane protein that has various physical functions, including protection against zzso and zzso stress, cellular zzso of copper zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso cells revealed zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is shown to be involved in regulating zzso expression through the zzso zzso As zzso is the natural zzso of zzso and is required for the high zzso rate seen in zzso tumors, zzso of zzso reduced the proliferation and survival rate of zzso cancer cells in zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by zzso injection with a cocktail of zzso plasmids also inhibited zzso in a zzso model in nude zzso In zzso our data characterize a novel molecular mechanism that links zzso expression to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso will therefore be a promising strategy to overcome the growth and survival advantage in zzso zzso
