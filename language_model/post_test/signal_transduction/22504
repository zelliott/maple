Recent studies from our laboratory and others have shown that increases in zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso play a key role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso gene transfer of zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso form of zzso zzso in mice would zzso pressure zzso increases in zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso and cardiac zzso Adult zzso mice were subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso or sham surgery, and zzso injections of viral zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso There was robust zzso expression in the heart, which peaked zzso days after injection and then declined to zzso levels by zzso zzso In mice injected with zzso II, zzso caused a significant increase in zzso generation and cardiac mass at 1 zzso and these responses were markedly attenuated by zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso as measured zzso by in zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso This was also abolished by zzso zzso or zzso but not the control zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso hearts was associated with an zzso of cardiac zzso Since a direct zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been established zzso our data support the hypothesis that increased zzso generation and zzso zzso are key signaling zzso in pressure zzso zzso of zzso and cardiac zzso
