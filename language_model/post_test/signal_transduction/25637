zzso zzso recognition by zzso T cells is thought to contribute to the tissue specificity of various zzso diseases, particularly those associated with class II zzso zzso However, we show that localized class II zzso arthritis in zzso mice depends on local events that result in the zzso of activated zzso T cells in the absence of zzso zzso zzso In this model, transfer of in zzso polarized zzso cells combined with the induction of experimental zzso resulted in zzso production, the zzso of T cells in the zzso and local production of zzso Disease induction required zzso production by transferred T cells, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso signaling in type I zzso zzso Our data suggest a model in which the development of zzso disease in zzso mice depends on four events: zzso T cell zzso regardless of zzso zzso local events that induce T cell zzso enhanced sensitivity to T zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso This model provides a possible explanation for why zzso zzso recognized by activated zzso T cells have not been identified in many zzso diseases, especially those associated with class II zzso zzso
