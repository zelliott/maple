zzso protein zzso zzso has emerged as a significant signaling zzso that regulates zzso in response to energy demand and zzso An investigation into the degree of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso under exercise can provide valuable data for understanding zzso In particular, the effect of zzso on muscle cellular energy status makes this protein a promising pharmacological target for disease zzso As more zzso regulation data are zzso data mining techniques can play an important role in identifying frequent patterns in the zzso Association rule mining, which is commonly used in market basket analysis, can be applied to zzso zzso 

This paper proposes a framework that can identify the potential zzso either between the state of zzso of zzso beta and gamma zzso of zzso or between stimulus factors and the state of zzso Our approach is to apply item constraints in the closed interpretation to the zzso generation so that a threshold is specified in terms of the amount of results, rather than a fixed threshold value for all zzso of all zzso The derived rules from experiments are roughly zzso It is found that most of the extracted association rules have biological meaning and some of them were previously zzso They indicate direction for further zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso has a great impact on most zzso actions that are related to energy demand and zzso Those actions are adjusted via its zzso zzso under specific physical zzso Thus, there are strong zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso are correlated with each other in some zzso The methods developed here could be used when predicting these essential relationships and enable an understanding of the functions and zzso pathways regarding zzso
