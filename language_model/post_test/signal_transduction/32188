zzso evidence points to zzso zzso an accessory zzso for the transforming growth zzso zzso commonly associated with the zzso zzso as an important regulator of the zzso zzso We have shown that lack of zzso results in reduced numbers of primitive zzso colonies as well as zzso of key zzso zzso To determine the effect of zzso zzso in zzso development, we generated a zzso embryonic stem cell zzso Our results demonstrate that induction of zzso during zzso body differentiation leads to a significant increase in the frequency of zzso zzso in particular, the zzso zzso which correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and embryonic zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso program happened at the expense of zzso and cardiac cells, as differentiation into these zzso lineages was zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity was accompanied by high levels of zzso zzso This effect was attenuated by addition of a bone zzso protein zzso signaling inhibitor to these zzso Among the zzso zzso is well known for its role in zzso zzso from zzso by promoting expression of several zzso zzso including zzso Because zzso is considered the master regulator of the zzso program, we investigated whether zzso would be capable of rescuing the defective zzso zzso observed in zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso expression in zzso embryonic stem cells resulted in increased zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso and zzso positioning zzso upstream of zzso Taken together, these findings support the premise that zzso zzso the zzso zzso network, most likely through regulation of zzso zzso
