In the present study, we investigated how the zzso of cell division in zzso zzso cells can be evaluated by determining the plane of cell division and the potential distribution of proteins between daughter zzso The orientation of the zzso zzso is dependent upon the positioning of the zzso which determine the plane of cell division and the sharing of zzso If the functions of zzso shared proteins are relevant to the zzso of cell division, they could determine whether the daughter cells undergo zzso or zzso The kinetic function of the proteins of interest was investigated using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso as a model system, since they have a role in balancing zzso zzso zzso cells were examined microscopically and zzso markers zzso were used with activated zzso and zzso We monitored the first crucial divisions by zzso zzso and found an inverse relationship between activated zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso expressing activated zzso or zzso have different cell zzso To determine the influence of zzso signaling on zzso cell zzso we used the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso influences zzso outcome by affecting the frequency of zzso renewal divisions without affecting the rate of zzso Overall, the purpose of this study was to establish a cellular system for predicting the zzso of zzso zzso divisions at the level of zzso and protein distribution and to investigate the influence of these proteins on zzso cell zzso
