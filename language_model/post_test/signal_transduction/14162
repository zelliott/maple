In order to better understand the cellular responses to the zzso drug zzso and the mechanisms leading to zzso and potential side effects, we performed a zzso quantitative zzso analysis of zzso T cells exposed to zzso Signaling molecules in the T cell zzso zzso zzso were enriched among proteins displaying reduced zzso zzso The results were verified by zzso and/or zzso zzso for a selected set of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and downstream targets zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to the effects on the T cell signaling zzso the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso was increased in treated cells, and zzso of this signaling zzso was verified by zzso analysis of zzso levels of zzso zzso and the downstream targets zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso has been suggested to be one of the main mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may reduce the activity of proteins involved in the zzso signaling pathway, which has an important role in regulating proliferation of T cells, and may contribute to explain previous observations where zzso has been reported to inhibit proliferation of T zzso 

In this study, a quantitative zzso analysis was performed to identify changes of the zzso during exposure of zzso T cells by zzso The results of the zzso analysis were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso An initial zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso was detected at early time points of zzso treatment, a response previously suggested to be part of the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso levels of proteins involved in signaling downstream of the zzso during zzso were found by the zzso zzso zzso Our study can support to zzso the mechanism behind the previously observed zzso effect of zzso
