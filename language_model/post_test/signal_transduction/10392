Among the zzso zzso zzso is known to function as a molecular switch in various cellular zzso Among the zzso zzso the cellular function and signal zzso of zzso have been extensively zzso However, information about its in zzso functions is still zzso With the recent development of a specific zzso inhibitor such as zzso and zzso the understanding of the role of the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso has zzso However, to date, there have been few studies investigating the role of zzso in zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso inhibitor significantly attenuated the zzso zzso in kidney induced by unilateral zzso zzso However, there have been few studies investigating the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this review, we described the role of the zzso zzso in the progression of zzso zzso in several forms of zzso zzso Our results suggest that chronic zzso of the zzso zzso may be a new therapeutic approach for zzso zzso Our results also suggest that the mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso inhibitor is partly zzso via zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso stress, and zzso of zzso gene zzso
