We previously reported that zzso functional interaction could drive the expression of zzso zzso gene G zzso independently of zzso and the classical zzso pathway, providing a novel alternative zzso for zzso zzso to mediate their multiple biological zzso In addition, we also found that zzso could regulate zzso induction as well as the expression of zzso and zzso in some zzso But the mechanisms by which zzso exerted its action remained to be zzso Here, we showed that zzso could significantly enhance the effects of the zzso complex or zzso on zzso induction through an activated zzso pathway, though it was not essential for zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso could induce zzso expression via the zzso response elements in the zzso gene promoter, but it failed to zzso zzso and zzso unless the zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso indirectly activated zzso expression through an zzso zzso Taken together, we concluded that the expression of zzso was independent on the classical zzso pathway, but could be greatly increased by zzso This work will be of great benefit to us for a better understanding of the mechanisms on zzso gene expression zzso
