This study provides an initial characterization of basic zzso properties of cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from rat zzso resistance vessels and of the functional zzso of zzso II zzso zzso receptors to zzso free calcium concentration zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Renal zzso were isolated from zzso arteries and zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso using an iron oxide zzso method and compared with rat zzso zzso cultured under similar zzso zzso zzso maintained uniform zzso and zzso signaling profile between passages 3 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso shaped and expressed smooth zzso zzso and zzso heavy chains zzso and zzso zzso II caused a rapid increase in zzso followed by a sustained plateau phase at zzso of the peak zzso The initial maximum zzso responses were dose dependent and of similar magnitude in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso increased zzso from 50 to 240 zzso in zzso and from 57 to 201 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso II effects on zzso revealed significant signaling through distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso was effective in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had no effect in either vessel zzso Our results demonstrate that cultured zzso zzso have anatomical similarities to zzso zzso and functional differences in zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso This novel preparation should provide a useful approach with which to investigate cellular mechanisms concerning zzso zzso to signaling pathways involved in vascular zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso in general and the kidney in zzso
