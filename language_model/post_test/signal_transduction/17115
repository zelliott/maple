Visual environment plays an important role in the occurrence of zzso We previously showed that the different flashing lights could result in distinct effects on the zzso growth and development of zzso zzso has been reported to regulate various cellular functions and biological zzso However, whether zzso signaling was involved in the red flashing zzso zzso still remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of the red flashing lights exposure on the refraction and zzso length of the eyes in zzso and then evaluated their effects on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data showed that the eyes exposed to the red flashing light became more zzso with a significant increase of the zzso length and decrease of the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso , as well as zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed in the zzso zzso exposed to the red flashing zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were found to have the same gene expression profile in zzso In conclusion, our findings found that zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in the red flashing zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, our study establishes a useful animal model for experimental zzso zzso
