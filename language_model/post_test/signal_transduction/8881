zzso is an enigmatic zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso has been used in several studies, but few studies went further to zzso zzso of zzso based on expression patterns and to identify possible pathways involved in zzso Some of the observed pathways are more inconsistent between the studies, and these candidate pathways presumably only represent a fraction of the pathways involved in zzso 

We applied a zzso zzso zzso and gene set enrichment analysis to six independent studies, and demonstrated increased zzso between these gene zzso 

We find 16 zzso and 19 zzso pathways common in zzso zzso data sets, 22 zzso and one zzso zzso common in zzso zzso data zzso Among them, 12 zzso and 1 zzso were found consistent between zzso and zzso zzso The main zzso pathways identified are related to zzso and inflammatory zzso Early zzso phase has the most zzso pathways in the three zzso cycle zzso There are no overlapping significant pathways between the zzso from human zzso zzso cells and the zzso from zzso zzso which used whole zzso 

The study of complex diseases through zzso analysis is able to highlight genes zzso connected to the zzso which may be difficult to detect by using classical zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso and zzso we have increased the zzso in identifying many biological mechanisms involved in zzso The identified gene pathways will shed light on the understanding of zzso and promote the development of novel zzso
