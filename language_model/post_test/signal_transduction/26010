Both the zzso Y zzso and the zzso systems have been shown to be important central zzso of bone zzso However, the interaction between these two systems is complex and not fully zzso Here, we show that a unique interaction exists between zzso and zzso receptors in the regulation of bone zzso that is not evident when combined with lack of zzso zzso Despite the zzso shown in male zzso double knockout zzso zzso mice, when on the zzso zzso background, these mice display reduced zzso bone zzso However, combined zzso deletion enhances the effect of zzso zzso on the cortical bone zzso By replicating the enhanced central zzso expression evident in zzso mice using zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso of Y zzso knockout mice, we demonstrate that zzso zzso mice have an exaggerated response to the zzso effects of elevated zzso zzso in both zzso and cortical bone and that this effect appears to be dependent on zzso zzso zzso This study highlights the complex interaction between Y receptors in the control of bone zzso Moreover, it suggests that the reduction in cortical bone observed in the absence of zzso is due to the zzso effect of elevated zzso zzso zzso
