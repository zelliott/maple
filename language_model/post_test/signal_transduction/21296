zzso of zzso C zzso increases zzso zzso and may play a role in delayed zzso death after zzso Because changes in zzso zzso are believed to participate in zzso zzso injury, we tested the hypothesis that zzso beta protein levels are temporally altered in brain regions that undergo zzso after global incomplete zzso Dogs zzso zzso zzso were subjected to 20 minutes of global incomplete zzso followed by recovery of either 1 zzso zzso 5) or 7 days zzso zzso zzso Six zzso animals were used as zzso zzso In zzso and zzso brain zzso zzso density at 1 day after zzso was unchanged relative to zzso controls in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, at 7 days after zzso zzso zzso were decreased to 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso of control in zzso and zzso zzso At 1 and 7 days after zzso the percentage of zzso showing zzso injury increased from 13 zzso 10 to 40 zzso zzso in zzso 24 zzso 25 to 59 zzso zzso in zzso and 4 zzso 2 to 18 zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso stained brain sections from controls zzso zzso zzso 1 day after zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 days after zzso zzso zzso 5) revealed that zzso beta zzso was increased in zzso at 1 day zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso optical density units zzso in control and 1 day, zzso and 7 days zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso in control and 7 days, zzso zzso beta zzso was unchanged after zzso in zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso beta zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the control zzso zzso zzso 1 day zzso zzso zzso and 7 days after zzso zzso zzso 2) groups showed that zzso beta levels were increased after zzso in zzso zzso and zzso above control at 1 and 7 days, zzso However, in zzso zzso expression after zzso was unchanged at zzso and zzso of control at 1 and 7 days, zzso These results show that delayed zzso zzso after global incomplete zzso is accompanied by regional abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels early may represent an zzso signal zzso mechanism resulting in delayed cell damage, whereas decreased zzso levels later after zzso may reflect ongoing zzso
