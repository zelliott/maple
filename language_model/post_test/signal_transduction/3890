zzso proteins are essential constituents of the zzso zzso zzso zzso They are expressed in a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso but their cellular zzso in these remains to be established, as does the exact role of zzso in the immune zzso In this study we used zzso methods to analyze the cellular distribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso zzso proteins in normal human zzso zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso zzso were processed for indirect zzso zzso using zzso against each zzso zzso human zzso and a panel of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso and possibly in B zzso zzso zzso was seen in zzso cells and also in some zzso zzso cells, and in blood vessel zzso zzso zzso zzso scattered cells, mostly in the T cell zones, identified as zzso while specific zzso zzso could not be observed in zzso zzso In no case was zzso zzso seen in zzso 

These results demonstrate the occurrence of zzso proteins in normal human zzso zzso and describe their cellular zzso favoring the notion that zzso have a zzso role in the immune system, possibly acting through accessory cells and not directly on zzso
