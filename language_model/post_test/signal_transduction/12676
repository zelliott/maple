In zzso fat store levels are communicated by zzso and insulin signaling to brain centers that regulate food intake and zzso By using transgenic manipulation of neural activity, we report the isolation of two distinct zzso populations in flies that perform a similar function, the zzso and zzso zzso When either of these zzso groups is zzso fat store levels zzso This change is zzso through an increase in food intake and altered metabolism in zzso flies, while zzso zzso zzso alters only zzso zzso of either zzso group causes depletion of fat stores by increasing zzso rate and decreasing fatty acid zzso zzso the activities of these zzso causes changes in expression of genes known to regulate fat zzso Our results show that the fly brain measures fat store levels and can induce changes in food intake and metabolism to maintain them within normal zzso
