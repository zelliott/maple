The zzso signaling zzso is crucial for proper embryonic development and tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an integral part of zzso signaling and has recently been shown to interact with the zzso scaffolding protein zzso Using zzso deletion zzso we found that zzso binds a region zzso of the zzso domain of zzso which contains zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso reduced the binding of zzso to zzso Moreover, mouse embryonic zzso lacking zzso were able to zzso zzso in response to zzso but decreased the zzso of zzso and blocked zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso can bind zzso and forms a zzso complex with zzso and zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso decreased the expression of the zzso target zzso zzso and blocked axis zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso but not by zzso Thus, our results identify zzso as a necessary component for zzso zzso linking zzso and zzso and open a vast array of signaling avenues and possibilities for zzso with other zzso signaling zzso
