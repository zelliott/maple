In rat zzso zzso cells zzso current through zzso channels is reduced by zzso This zzso of channel activity by zzso receptors is zzso by a zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso It is sensitive to zzso zzso indicating the involvement of a zzso or zzso G protein in this zzso The identity of this G protein was determined by suppressing the expression of zzso G proteins individually via zzso injection of zzso zzso This method was applied to zzso cells to screen several G protein zzso beta and gamma zzso for their roles in the defined signal zzso zzso The loss of zzso modulating activity on the zzso zzso channel after zzso injection revealed the involvement of zzso alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 3 to the exclusion of other closely related zzso
