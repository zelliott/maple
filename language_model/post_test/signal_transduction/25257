The human D3 zzso zzso can activate zzso inward zzso zzso channels zzso inhibit zzso calcium channels, and inhibit spontaneous zzso activity in zzso neuroendocrine cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we evaluate the role of zzso in the D3 zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso The absence of selective zzso for zzso has precluded a direct test of the hypothesis that they play an important role in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso structure of these channels provides a means of zzso zzso zzso function using a dominant negative zzso To develop a zzso zzso zzso the zzso selectivity zzso acid sequence zzso in the putative pore domain of the human zzso channels was zzso to zzso zzso or zzso While the zzso of zzso to zzso did not affect channel function, both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso This suggests that the aromatic ring of the zzso zzso rather than its zzso group is involved in maintaining the pore architecture of human zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso acted as effective zzso zzso and significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso zzso zzso with the D3 zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, suggesting they are centrally involved in the signaling zzso of this zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso are effective molecular tools to examine the role of zzso channels in zzso
