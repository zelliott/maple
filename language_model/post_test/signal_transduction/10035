The insulin zzso zzso 2 zzso branch of the zzso growth zzso cascade prevents diabetes in mice because it promotes beta cell zzso function, and survival, especially during zzso zzso Because zzso zzso a long acting zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso has similar effects upon beta cells in zzso and humans, we investigated whether zzso signaling was required for zzso action in isolated beta cells and in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels in human zzso and zzso cells, which promoted zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso In wild type mice zzso administered continuously for 28 days increased beta cell mass zzso By contrast, zzso failed to arrest the progressive beta cell loss in zzso mice, which culminated in fatal zzso however, zzso delayed the progression of diabetes by 3 weeks by promoting insulin zzso from the remaining zzso We conclude that some short term therapeutic effects of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso can be independent of zzso but its long term effects upon beta cell growth and survival are zzso by the zzso branch of the zzso growth factor signaling zzso
