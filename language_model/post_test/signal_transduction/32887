zzso zzso starts when a zzso stem cell divides zzso to generate a daughter zzso stem cell and a zzso that will develop into a mature zzso We show that the zzso gene is essential for the maintenance of zzso stem cells during zzso We delineate zzso within a zzso zzso zzso region by transgenic rescue zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is present in the third zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso consistent with its role in regulating zzso stem cells during zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that all zzso zzso are zzso In the adult zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the terminal filament cells, suggesting that zzso acts in these signaling cells to maintain zzso stem zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso protein with no potential signal zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that this protein is not itself a signal but a key component of the signaling machinery for zzso stem cell zzso
