Three proteins containing a zzso zzso 1 zzso domain from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have important functions in zzso survival, seed development, and female zzso In this study, a novel protein containing the zzso domain from zzso zzso regulated zzso acid zzso zzso during seed zzso zzso of a zzso zzso line of this gene exhibited increased sensitivity to zzso during seed zzso and zzso development (named zzso By contrast, seeds with zzso zzso zzso were less sensitive to zzso The seeds of the sag zzso showed similar sensitivity to high zzso of zzso and zzso during these zzso zzso was also highly expressed in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso expression remained almost zzso zzso marker zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in sag zzso but were zzso in zzso zzso analyses indicated that the function of zzso in zzso zzso depended on zzso and zzso The expression of some target genes of zzso and zzso such as seed storage protein and zzso zzso was induced higher by zzso in sag zzso than in zzso zzso seeds, even higher than in zzso zzso This finding indicated that other regulators similar to zzso or zzso played a role during these zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is an important negative regulator of zzso zzso during seed zzso and zzso zzso
