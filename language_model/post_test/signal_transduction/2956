zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso zzso genetic disease characterized by the presence of zzso zzso profound learning disabilities and zzso zzso Unfortunately, children affected with zzso often die early of health complications including zzso zzso Although this syndrome was first described in the early 1950s and the affected zzso zzso was identified more than 17 years ago, the mechanism by which zzso defects lead to zzso symptoms remains zzso Here we show that zzso display characteristics of a zzso Specifically, we found that patients' cells have defects in the assembly of primary zzso and this zzso was reproduced in cell lines by zzso of zzso zzso this zzso could be rescued by zzso of zzso zzso in both patient and zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso animal model of zzso exhibited zzso defects and multiple zzso and anatomical abnormalities typically seen in zzso zzso we show that zzso is involved in protein trafficking to the primary zzso in an zzso zzso zzso Taking into consideration the relevance of the signaling pathways hosted by the primary zzso our results suggest zzso zzso mechanisms by which zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso characteristics of zzso This conceptual change in our understanding of the disease zzso may provide an alternative avenue for the development of zzso
