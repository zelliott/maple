Cancer zzso gene zzso 2, as a novel zzso has been predominantly detected in various cancer zzso such as zzso liver, lung and zzso We recently showed that zzso zzso zzso activity, leading to resistance to infection by zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate a possible role for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso we first established a colon cancer cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher levels not only in zzso of zzso but also zzso of zzso compared to that of the control zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso or zzso activity reduced zzso of zzso in zzso cells whereas zzso of zzso zzso did not significantly decrease levels of zzso zzso indicating that cell proliferation signals may be involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso expression diminished cell migration and wound healing compared to the control zzso In addition, since zzso expression zzso resistance to DNA damage caused by zzso treatment, we investigated whether zzso is involved in resistance to zzso cell zzso We found that zzso was not activated in zzso cells while zzso zzso was maintained in zzso cells during zzso zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso expression zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso whereas the control cells exhibited resistance to zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso enhances zzso and drug resistance through zzso zzso which eventually contributes to tumor zzso
