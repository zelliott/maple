zzso regulatory T cells zzso are required for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance to certain self zzso In this study, the requirements for zzso zzso activity and proliferation were examined in the context of the maturation of zzso zzso cells zzso We find that the zzso function of zzso is critically dependent on immature zzso and is readily reversed by the maturation of zzso induced by zzso but does not require zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso In contrast, reversal of zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso and involves the zzso of zzso responsiveness to zzso by cooperative effects of zzso and zzso both of which are produced by zzso mature zzso Thus, zzso zzso produced by zzso mature zzso are required for reversal of zzso zzso but are not required to overcome zzso zzso
