zzso zzso mice, which carry a point zzso in the nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso are characterized by the systemic absence of zzso zzso and zzso patches, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Another unique feature of zzso mice is that their zzso cavity contains more B1 cells than normal and zzso zzso Transfer experiments of zzso zzso from zzso mice into zzso zzso gene zzso mice revealed that B and T cells fail to migrate to other zzso zzso particularly to the zzso zzso tissue zzso In zzso zzso defects of zzso zzso cells correlated with reduction of their in zzso zzso responses to secondary zzso tissue zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso The migration zzso of zzso zzso was not due to a lack of expression of zzso and their zzso but rather to impaired signal zzso downstream of the receptors for zzso indicating that zzso is involved in the zzso signaling zzso known to couple only with G zzso The results showed that the reduced serum levels of zzso zzso and the absence of class switch to zzso in zzso mice are due, at least in part, to a migration zzso of zzso to the proper zzso where B cells zzso and differentiate into zzso zzso
