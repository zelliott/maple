The zzso factor zzso is expressed at high levels in neural stem and zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso specifically in the developing brain by using zzso zzso Although zzso animals did not survive after birth, analysis of late gestation zzso revealed that loss of zzso causes enlargement of the lateral zzso and a decrease in the number of zzso zzso However, although their zzso potential is zzso zzso neural stem cells retain their zzso and zzso zzso We found that expression level of zzso is elevated in zzso zzso developing brain, probably zzso the effects of loss of zzso
