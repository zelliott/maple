Signaling molecules of the zzso gene family are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and tissue polarity in zzso and zzso zzso Members of the zzso gene family, such as zzso zzso and rat zzso have been shown zzso zzso binding activity and to engage zzso signal zzso molecules known to be part of the zzso signaling zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of Fritz, a mouse zzso and human zzso gene which codes for a zzso protein that is structurally related to the zzso portion of the zzso genes from zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso function when both proteins are zzso expressed in zzso zzso In early zzso mouse zzso zzso is expressed in all three germ zzso Later in zzso zzso zzso is found in the central and peripheral nervous systems, zzso zzso and several other zzso all of which are sites where zzso proteins have been implicated in tissue zzso We propose a model in which zzso can interfere with the activity of zzso proteins via their zzso zzso receptors and thereby zzso the biological responses to zzso activity in a multitude of tissue zzso
