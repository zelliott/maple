zzso zzso cell death is both a normal zzso process and the catastrophic outcome of nervous system trauma or degenerative zzso Although the mechanisms of such death include an zzso zzso core zzso zzso that is highly zzso to that first described by zzso and co-workers in zzso zzso it appears that many instances of zzso death additionally require the zzso induction of zzso zzso One such zzso zzso zzso revealed by studies over the past decade revolves about the zzso factor zzso and those molecules that either regulate zzso activity or that are direct or indirect zzso targets of zzso Many of the molecules associated with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso also participate in the cell cycle in zzso zzso Observations in human material and in animal and cell culture models show widespread correlation between changes in zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso cell cycle molecules and zzso and catastrophic zzso zzso A variety of experimental approaches support a zzso role for such changes in the death process and are beginning to indicate how the zzso zzso zzso activates the core zzso zzso The discovery and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso provides abundant targets as well as small zzso candidates for potential therapeutic intervention in nervous system trauma and degenerative zzso
