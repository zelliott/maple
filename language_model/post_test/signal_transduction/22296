zzso an anabolic and zzso factor, promotes zzso survival by blocking zzso It is released into the zzso by the liver, or zzso locally by muscles and neural cells, acting in an zzso or zzso zzso zzso genetic studies conducted in zzso and zzso models also suggest that an excess of zzso signaling may trigger zzso This emphasizes the importance of gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling zzso regulation and gene zzso In the zzso zzso expression is activated just before birth in a subset of zzso cells zzso Mice carrying a zzso zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso feature PC zzso at zzso We show that zzso is sharply zzso in zzso zzso PCs starting before the onset of PC zzso In zzso zzso binds a zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso is strongly inhibited in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso cultures respond to zzso treatment by zzso PC zzso zzso wild type slices treated with an zzso competitor feature a sharp increase in PC zzso Our findings reveal that zzso is required for PC survival in the zzso zzso and identify a new mechanism regulating its local production in the zzso
