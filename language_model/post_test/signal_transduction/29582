zzso zzso has acute positive zzso effects, but consequences of chronically increased zzso on zzso function of cardiac zzso are largely zzso In the present study, effects of long-term treatment with zzso (10 zzso for 5 days on both force development zzso of contraction zzso and zzso of contraction were determined in heart tissue zzso from rat cardiac zzso zzso force was measured in response to cumulative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 64 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was associated with a significantly blunted zzso response to zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso significantly prolonged relaxation (62 zzso 3 zzso 53 zzso 2 zzso Selective zzso zzso and zzso zzso blockade zzso demonstrated that effects of zzso on zzso function were zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were prevented by zzso with either zzso a zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso In contrast to long-term zzso treatment, no changes in zzso parameters were observed after zzso treatment for 3 h before force zzso These data suggest that chronic zzso stimulation has dual effects on zzso improvement of zzso force but impairment of zzso zzso and zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso The signaling pathways involved include zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The present in zzso findings raise the possibility that zzso may exert both zzso and zzso effects in the failing zzso in which local zzso of zzso is zzso
