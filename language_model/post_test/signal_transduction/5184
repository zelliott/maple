zzso zzso zzso characterized by the expression of zzso fusion gene are clinically very sensitive to the DNA binding zzso agent, zzso However, resistance eventually occurs, preventing disease zzso To investigate the mechanisms of resistance, a zzso resistant cell line, zzso was zzso The resistance to zzso was not related to the expression of zzso related zzso zzso of zzso or zzso levels that were similar in parental and resistant zzso The zzso cells were hypersensitive to zzso light because of a zzso zzso repair zzso zzso zzso decreased sensitivity to zzso rays, but only partially to zzso zzso cells showed collateral sensitivity to zzso due to the lack of zzso zzso zzso activity, related to the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was bound to the zzso and zzso gene zzso as previously zzso and zzso caused zzso detachment from zzso Here we report that, in contrast, in zzso cells, zzso was not bound to these zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso of genes involved in different pathways including signal zzso zzso and stress response between the two cell lines were zzso zzso activates the zzso of genes involved in the zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso but not in zzso cell zzso The collateral sensitivity of zzso to zzso provides the rationale to investigate the potential use of zzso agents in zzso patients resistant to zzso
