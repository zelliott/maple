The tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso activates downstream zzso that include the zzso protein zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso is activated in a majority of spontaneous human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso induction zzso cell cycle restraints induced by zzso Ras and cooperated with Ras to convert normal human zzso into tumors indistinguishable from zzso confirming its zzso potency in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso itself using zzso zzso or zzso approaches abolished invasive human zzso zzso in a tumor cell autonomous zzso The zzso cascade thus promotes human zzso and represents a potential therapeutic target for human zzso zzso
