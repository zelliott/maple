A characteristic series of zzso abnormalities are observed in the human genetic disorder zzso zzso The recent cloning of a gene zzso in this syndrome provides additional evidence for a zzso in zzso signaling in zzso We have investigated the possibility that signaling through the B cell zzso zzso is one manifestation of the zzso zzso In response to zzso of the B cell zzso several zzso cell lines were defective in their zzso zzso in addition zzso zzso from internal stores was either absent or considerably reduced in these cell lines in response to zzso The zzso in signaling was not due to difference in expression of surface zzso The defective response in zzso cells was also evident in several arms of the zzso cascade activated by B cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a key step in zzso of the zzso was reduced or negligible in some zzso cell zzso This zzso in signaling was also seen at the level of Lyn zzso zzso zzso and its association with and zzso of zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for a role for the zzso gene product in zzso signaling which may account at least in part for the abnormalities in B cell function in zzso
