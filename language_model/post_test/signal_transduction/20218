zzso zzso zzso development is one of the zzso systems to study cell fate zzso during zzso The detailed knowledge of the signaling pathways determining zzso precursor cell zzso fates permitted us to create a zzso model based on the zzso interactions between the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso pathways that specify the primary and secondary zzso zzso A key notion of our model is called bounded zzso which predicts that a limited degree of zzso in the progression of the zzso is necessary to break their zzso While searching for a molecular mechanism underlying bounded zzso we discovered that the termination of zzso signaling is tightly linked to zzso zzso When single zzso were arrested in the zzso phase, zzso zzso failed to be zzso resulting in a mixed zzso cell zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso stabilize zzso while the zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso Our findings reveal a synchronization mechanism that coordinates zzso signaling with zzso progression and thus permits the formation of a stable cell fate zzso
