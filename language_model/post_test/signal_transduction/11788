The promoter region of the zzso gene contains several upstream zzso elements which dictate the zzso response to specific zzso zzso Among these is the zzso zzso zzso element, which is required for zzso expression by zzso in zzso However, we have previously shown that zzso agents cause only a slight increase in zzso zzso levels in intact Swiss zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso can zzso the induction of zzso by other second zzso A combination of zzso and either zzso or zzso growth factor leads to an increase in zzso zzso levels comparable to those induced by zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso agents can act in zzso with calcium zzso (which alone do not induce zzso to increase zzso expression by up to zzso of the zzso response, although, in parallel cultures, this combination does not stimulate the zzso of zzso an Mr zzso zzso which is a major zzso for protein zzso zzso These results suggest that, in intact cells, zzso acts zzso with distinct zzso signals to stimulate zzso zzso through protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso
