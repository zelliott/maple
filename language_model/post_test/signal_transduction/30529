zzso signaling initiated by zzso of the zzso influences cell fate at multiple points during the lifespan of a T zzso This is especially evident during zzso selection, where the nature of zzso signaling helps to establish a zzso zzso T cell zzso The zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso zzso zzso protein is a required intermediate in multiple signaling pathways triggered by zzso engagement, several of which have been implicated in dictating the outcome of zzso selection zzso zzso calcium flux and zzso of zzso family zzso To determine if zzso maturation and selection at later stages of development are sensitive to zzso in zzso levels, we analyzed these crucial events using several transgenic zzso lines of mice expressing altered levels of zzso in the zzso In zzso mice expressing low levels of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso ratio in the zzso and zzso was skewed in a manner consistent with impaired selection and/or maturation of zzso zzso Low zzso expression also correlated with reduced zzso expression on immature zzso consistent with reduced zzso signaling zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso at higher levels resulted in normal zzso zzso expression and zzso ratios in the zzso and zzso It is curious that zzso deletion of zzso zzso zzso was markedly impaired in both lines of zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso mice indicate that the zzso in deletion of zzso zzso is intrinsic to the developing zzso suggesting that maintenance of sufficient zzso expression from the zzso locus is a key element in the selection zzso
