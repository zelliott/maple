zzso weight gain occurs in many species, suggesting that zzso signaling is impaired at middle zzso To test this hypothesis, we measured changes in food intake and body composition in young zzso and middle-aged zzso zzso male mice infused zzso with zzso saline or zzso zzso decreases in food intake and body fat were delayed in MA mice and associated with zzso after longer treatment zzso zzso plasma zzso levels did not correlate with body fat in MA zzso zzso restriction zzso reduced body fat, plasma zzso and insulin in MA mice to levels in Y mice but did not zzso zzso zzso zzso mice did not respond to zzso doses that inhibited food intake in MA mice and reduced food intake and body fat in Y mice significantly below levels in zzso zzso Plasma zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso MA zzso We conclude that MA zzso mice exhibit impaired zzso signaling and that zzso possibly by zzso zzso zzso appetite control without improving the zzso actions of zzso
