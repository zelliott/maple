Wear debris contributes to implant loosening after total joint zzso and few advances have been made in our ability to inhibit the biological response to wear zzso zzso zzso augment the effects of wear particles in zzso and in zzso The zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso is produced by zzso in response to bacterial zzso and wear zzso and it increases zzso activity resulting in bone zzso and implant zzso The zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso contributes to zzso production in response to soluble zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso in the production of zzso in response to wear particles with adherent zzso and so-called zzso wear zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with titanium particles with adherent zzso or with zzso titanium particles in the presence and absence of specific zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed with use of Western zzso zzso production was measured with use of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by measuring zzso zzso zzso 

zzso particles with adherent zzso increased zzso zzso whereas zzso titanium particles did zzso The zzso inhibitor reduced zzso production by zzso in response to titanium with adherent zzso without increasing zzso Similarly, the zzso inhibitor reduced zzso production by zzso in response to titanium particles with adherent zzso without increasing zzso High zzso of zzso titanium particles resulted in a small delayed increase in zzso production that was completely blocked by the zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso production in response to titanium particles with adherent zzso and zzso particles in zzso
