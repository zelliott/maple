Cell zzso molecules of the zzso family contribute to the regulation of cell shape and fate by zzso strong zzso zzso through zzso interaction of their zzso and association of their zzso tail to zzso However, the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso with the reorganization of the zzso zzso remain zzso Here, the formation of de zzso contacts was dissected by spreading cells on a highly active zzso zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso zzso by extending zzso and organizing zzso complexes and zzso filaments in zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso at the leading edge sustained the extension of zzso contacts through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes and zzso zzso The expression and zzso of zzso at the plasma zzso associated with an increase in zzso zzso was required for both cell responses, consistent with a major role of zzso in zzso pathways initiated by zzso zzso and contributing to zzso contact extension and zzso These results provide additional information on the mechanisms by which zzso coordinates zzso with dynamic changes in the zzso to control cell shape and zzso junction zzso
