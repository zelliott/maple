The zzso of certain zzso molecules can be released by zzso and the zzso zzso often exert important biological zzso We demonstrated before that the zzso zzso zzso is shed from the cell zzso Here we show that zzso release in zzso breast zzso cells is zzso by a member of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso of zzso shedding by zzso zzso or zzso involved distinct zzso zzso induced shedding and zzso of cells from the zzso which was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tail and the zzso zzso zzso was observed following zzso zzso zzso of zzso release and zzso of zzso occurred also when cells were detached by zzso suggesting that the regulation of zzso shedding by this zzso was linked to cell zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso shedding was inhibited by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso I and by zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso and in bound form could support zzso cell zzso and zzso We propose that the release of zzso zzso molecules such as zzso may be relevant to promote cell zzso
