zzso engineering has become an extensively used tool in many fields, allowing us to probe protein function, characterize proteins using a range of zzso techniques, chemically modify proteins and improve protein function for medical and industrial zzso It is now possible to zzso incorporate zzso or zzso zzso acids zzso into zzso which has had a major impact on protein zzso In this review, we discuss the recent technical developments in the field and how zzso engineering is becoming an increasingly valuable molecular zzso with the unique chemical zzso of some zzso allowing a range of otherwise impossible experiments to be zzso Finally, the impediments that have resulted in a relatively small number of recent studies in which zzso engineering has been used to improve protein function are discussed, alongside some of the recent technical developments that may serve to overcome these zzso
