zzso are widespread membrane components that are found in all zzso zzso They consist of a long chain zzso usually zzso which is zzso at the zzso position, forming a zzso All together, zzso may represent the most structurally diverse category of lipids in zzso There is no known nutritional requirement for zzso Nonetheless, studies with experimental animals have shown that consumption of zzso zzso colon zzso reduces serum zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso which suggest that they are zzso components of zzso In animal models zzso zzso zzso supplementation reduces the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso by approximately zzso and, with longer zzso reduces the number of zzso zzso A possible mechanism of action of zzso in suppressing colon zzso is that zzso supplied zzso bypass a zzso zzso zzso that is important in cancer (for example, a loss of cellular zzso turnover to produce zzso and zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso can inhibit colon cancer in zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso in a human zzso cell line and feeding zzso to zzso mice reduces the number of colon zzso
