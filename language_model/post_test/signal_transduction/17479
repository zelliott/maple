The signal zzso pathways of the zzso zzso were investigated in two cell types zzso zzso with the human D1 zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cells zzso and mouse zzso cells zzso In both zzso and zzso cell lines, stimulation of the zzso zzso induced a marked increase in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso calcium channels in a zzso manner in zzso zzso However, in zzso cells, zzso increased zzso free calcium zzso zzso by zzso of zzso calcium rather than by calcium zzso This effect was correlated with a zzso enhancement of zzso C activity in zzso zzso zzso (24 zzso with zzso toxin zzso was used to zzso activate the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso zzso of zzso levels and zzso the D1 zzso from zzso The described actions of zzso in both cell lines were abolished by zzso with zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso may mediate these zzso The blockade by zzso was not due to zzso zzso of zzso since zzso with zzso or zzso to activate zzso protein zzso did not inhibit zzso actions nor alter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso (10 zzso or zzso (5 zzso altered neither the zzso activity of zzso C nor zzso zzso in zzso cells but greatly enhanced the zzso increase of zzso zzso turnover and zzso From these results we conclude that: 1) the zzso zzso zzso multiple and zzso signals, including zzso of zzso levels in both zzso and L cells, zzso zzso and zzso of opening of zzso zzso calcium channel in zzso cells, and a novel zzso zzso zzso of cellular calcium in L zzso 2) zzso of the D1 zzso to these responses involves zzso zzso possibly zzso and 3) acute zzso of zzso protein zzso can markedly zzso rather than zzso certain pathways of zzso zzso zzso
