Changes in gene regulation are associated with the evolution of zzso However, the specific sequence information controlling gene expression is largely unknown and discovery is time and labor zzso We use the intricate patterning of zzso cells to probe zzso zzso in the absence of sequence zzso We focus on one of the major families of genes that pattern the zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso screening for the zzso patterning of all nine zzso genes in three species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that most genes are expressed zzso during mid and late stages of zzso zzso an zzso code, we transformed the data into zzso zzso that capture the complexity of gene zzso Gene patterning is sufficient to predict zzso zzso consistent with their zzso Surprisingly, we found that expression zzso of most genes are different among species, suggesting that zzso regulation is rapidly zzso In addition, we found a zzso novelty along the zzso side of the zzso the zzso zzso Our zzso analysis placed the zzso zzso domain in a cluster of zzso growth factor zzso associated zzso which was validated through genetic and chemical zzso zzso zzso are regulated zzso or independently by signaling zzso supporting that complex patterns are zzso assembled from simple zzso
