zzso of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, whose zzso are arrayed along the zzso zzso relies on both zzso regulated localized zzso factor activities and zzso zzso Classic models proposed that fates are determined by opposing animal and vegetal zzso zzso whereas current models emphasize zzso and sequential zzso zzso zzso between adjacent zzso Recent data support aspects of both models: the vegetal zzso send one or more signals, which depend on a nuclear zzso pathway, that both activate zzso zzso required for secondary zzso fate and promote zzso differentiation and zzso This is opposed by an zzso domain of zzso signals that regulates zzso cell fates and establishes the zzso zzso
