zzso act as important switches in many signaling events in zzso Although small and zzso G proteins are subjects of intensive studies, little is known about the large zzso zzso In this article, we show that the zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso is a regulator of T cell zzso zzso of zzso leads to enhanced zzso of early T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso including zzso that is translated to higher zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses showed that regulatory zzso zzso like zzso that zzso zzso fibers and zzso zzso brain 1 that links the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso are binding partners of zzso The zzso zzso influences cell spreading and surface expression of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We found higher cell spreading and enhanced surface expression of zzso and zzso in zzso silenced T cells that explain their enhanced zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a downstream zzso of zzso via which T cells regulate zzso cell zzso
