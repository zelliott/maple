A diverse array of environmental factors contributes to the overall control of stem cell zzso In particular, new data continue to mount on the influence of the zzso zzso zzso on stem cell fate through physical interactions with cells, such as the control of cell zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso mechanical properties, and the transmission of mechanical or other zzso factors to the zzso Here, we review some of the physical processes by which cues from the zzso can influence stem cell fate, with particular relevance to the use of stem cells in tissue engineering and zzso zzso
