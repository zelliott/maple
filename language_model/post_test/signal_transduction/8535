The liver plays a central role in the transformation and degradation of zzso and zzso zzso and in the removal of unwanted cells such as damaged, genetically zzso and zzso zzso Because of this function, the liver is susceptible to toxicity caused by the products generated during these natural zzso zzso death is the major feature of liver zzso In response to liver injury, specific zzso processes are initiated to maintain liver zzso zzso zzso including tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso are key zzso of these processes and activate different cellular response such as zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso specific signaling pathways in zzso that lead to zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso of cell zzso Whereas zzso of zzso factor zzso promotes survival, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are strategic zzso of cell death in the zzso signaling zzso This review summarizes recent advances in the mechanisms of zzso zzso and suggests that zzso plays a protective role against zzso zzso zzso Identification of the mechanisms regulating interplay between the zzso and zzso pathways is required in the search for novel targets for the treatment of liver disease, including zzso and zzso zzso
