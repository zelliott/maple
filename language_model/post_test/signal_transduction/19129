The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso toxin zzso on inflammatory zzso measured by the rat paw pressure test and to zzso the mechanism involved in this zzso In this test, zzso zzso zzso administered zzso zzso zzso via a mechanism associated with zzso zzso zzso Local zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso and zzso (5 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso reduced zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso zzso Furthermore, local zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso reduced zzso induced by zzso a stable analogue of zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso zzso which indicates that zzso may have an effect other than just zzso zzso zzso analgesia was blocked by selective zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso G zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was shown to induce zzso oxide zzso production in cultured zzso of the zzso root zzso In conclusion, this study shows a peripheral zzso effect of zzso zzso resulting from the zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso
