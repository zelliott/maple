We previously showed that zzso increase zzso oxide zzso production in vascular zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is the most active one among zzso zzso However, the mechanism for zzso zzso oxide production is still zzso In this study, we determined whether zzso affects zzso and expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso 304 human zzso zzso zzso increased both the zzso and the expression of zzso in a zzso manner and a zzso effect was found at zzso of zzso The zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced as were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reporter gene transcriptions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activates zzso protein zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso was reversed by zzso zzso The present results provide a mechanism for zzso zzso NO zzso
