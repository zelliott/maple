zzso plays an important role in immune regulation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure has been shown to zzso T cell zzso In a mouse T cell zzso model, zzso attenuated T cell zzso zzso zzso We have confirmed that chronic zzso and zzso exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses, zzso In adult zzso zzso transgenic zzso diabetic mice, DNA zzso analysis of global gene expression in zzso zzso T cells in response to chronic zzso or zzso exposure showed that genes involved in functional categories including T cell zzso cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso were zzso Genes such as zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family genes zzso zzso and zzso and calcium channel zzso N type zzso zzso zzso were induced by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium channel zzso L type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso binding factor 3 were reduced by zzso Genes such as zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso by zzso were induced by zzso zzso Further, we showed that chronic zzso exposure impaired zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso activity, leading to T cell zzso Thus, our results present a detailed picture of zzso programs affected by chronic zzso exposure and provide candidate target genes that may function to mediate zzso T cell zzso
