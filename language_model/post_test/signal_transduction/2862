It is well established that zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso receptors present in the zzso show the pharmacological and zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso in fact, they are coupled to the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso activity and the reduction of zzso free zzso levels zzso suggesting the involvement of different zzso While the zzso receptors present in human zzso display these zzso no information is available on the zzso zzso of zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso on zzso activity and zzso was investigated in 8 zzso surgically removed by the zzso zzso zzso at zzso between zzso and 10 zzso had no effect on zzso formation in any tumor (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso was effective in reducing zzso levels either in resting conditions or after zzso stimulation in 5 out of 8 tumors, suggesting that zzso express zzso receptors with a defective zzso zzso As in these tumors zzso caused the expected zzso of both zzso activity (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso levels, it is likely that the lack of zzso action on zzso activity may be due to zzso properties of zzso receptors expressed in zzso instead of a zzso at the level of zzso zzso In conclusion, these data indicate that zzso receptors expressed in zzso show a defective zzso zzso leading to a partial zzso zzso
