zzso zzso or locally restricted zzso increases in the cell have recently been reported to regulate many essential zzso zzso zzso increases through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release channels contribute to the formation of a class of such zzso zzso which were often observed and referred to as zzso zzso in their isolated zzso In this report, we zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso intact zzso cells using a total internal reflection zzso zzso and zzso characterized the spatial profile by fitting recorded images to a two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso concentration profiles were marginally zzso zzso with the size increasing zzso even after the zzso began to zzso We found the event zzso drifted with an apparent diffusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is significantly larger than those estimated for zzso The sites of zzso zzso increase, rather than initiation or termination sites, were detected repeatedly at the same zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso in intact zzso cell are generated from zzso distributed multiple zzso clusters or zzso puff sites, rather than a single zzso cluster reported in cells loaded with zzso zzso
