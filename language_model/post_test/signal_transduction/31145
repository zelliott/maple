zzso of insulin to the insulin zzso zzso a cascade of protein zzso and zzso recruitment events leading to the zzso of multiple distinct signaling zzso Previous studies suggested that the diversity and specificity of insulin signal zzso are accomplished by both zzso zzso of zzso and the selective zzso of downstream signaling zzso The small zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Here we exploited the zzso interference technique to specifically knock down individual zzso zzso to determine the cellular function of zzso in distinct insulin signaling zzso Small interference zzso against a single zzso zzso had no effect on protein zzso B zzso or zzso zzso by insulin in zzso cells zzso human insulin zzso However, simultaneous zzso of all three zzso zzso dramatically attenuated zzso zzso by insulin without affecting zzso zzso This zzso of zzso zzso was because of the impaired interaction between insulin zzso zzso 1 and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate a requirement of zzso in presenting zzso to insulin zzso zzso zzso Additional evidence supporting a role for zzso was suggested by studies with zzso a zzso domain containing exchange zzso zzso of zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso this study indicates the involvement of zzso in insulin zzso
