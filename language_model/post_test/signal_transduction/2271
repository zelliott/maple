zzso enables capture and rolling of zzso on inflamed zzso This may facilitate the binding of zzso such as zzso and zzso factor zzso which signal zzso firm zzso and zzso Recent studies demonstrate that zzso can mediate zzso zzso However, the functional effects of zzso through zzso and zzso require further zzso Here, we zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso through zzso and zzso The surface expression of zzso increased and zzso decreased in proportion to the extent of zzso zzso A flow zzso zzso was used to measure zzso zzso to fluorescent beads zzso with zzso zzso zzso was detected within seconds of adding zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso by up to zzso the rate and extent of zzso zzso zzso through zzso induced membrane zzso whereas zzso or zzso induced bipolar shape zzso zzso zzso sustained the transient shape change induced by low zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso This was attributed to enhanced cell spreading following zzso zzso across zzso zzso zzso with zzso was also zzso in the presence of zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso and binding of zzso receptors may act zzso to amplify zzso zzso and zzso in the inflamed zzso
