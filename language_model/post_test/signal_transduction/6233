zzso zzso zzso is the third member of the zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso enhancing zzso zzso zzso basement membrane zzso zzso results from multiple effects generated by both zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate the contribution of these zzso to the progression of zzso zzso we investigated the effect of double blockade of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso mice, a zzso zzso zzso signaling was inhibited with the use of fusion proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling by the zzso zzso zzso for zzso Blood and urine samples were collected 5 and 14 days after induction of zzso zzso Mice were killed to facilitate zzso analyses at the same zzso zzso zzso was prevented from functionally deteriorating zzso zzso or increasing serum zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso Nevertheless, double or single blockade of zzso signaling showed a weaker zzso effect than single blockade of zzso signaling in terms of the serum zzso level and zzso zzso There is no synergistic effect between zzso zzso and zzso zzso when simultaneously administered in experimental zzso zzso Double blockade of both zzso signaling and zzso signaling is effective for preventing functional deterioration in this zzso However, zzso single blockade is more effective than double blockade both zzso and zzso
