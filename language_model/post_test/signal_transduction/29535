zzso zzso may initiate progression to a compromised cardiac zzso While the clinical consequences of zzso are well zzso only little is known about the underlying molecular zzso As reported from animal experiments, the zzso activated zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso have been implicated as zzso of the zzso zzso 

To study whether the zzso zzso is activated in human heart failure, we investigated samples of human left zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IV, zzso in comparison with zzso controls zzso zzso We not only analyzed the zzso by measuring the zzso activity, but also by determination of the protein expression of the zzso B zzso and additional key markers of the zzso signaling cascade zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was increased by zzso in human zzso zzso compared with zzso human hearts zzso and zzso zzso zzso per zzso This was in line with increased protein expression of zzso B in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso units zzso zzso In order to verify the activated zzso zzso as described in animal models, we compared the protein expression of zzso in zzso within nuclear zzso In nuclear extracts the protein level of zzso was increased in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso the expression of zzso was higher in the zzso tissue indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In human heart failure zzso the zzso signaling zzso is activated not only by an increased activity of zzso and expression of zzso but also by the shift from zzso zzso to the nucleus indicating zzso zzso and regulatory zzso
