zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso cells, is known for its zzso activity and its ability to activate zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso diseases associated with tissue zzso zzso we hypothesized that the expression of zzso might be modulated by changes in cell zzso involving proteins of the zzso zzso Spreading of zzso cells after detachment and zzso was characterized by the formation of zzso and focal zzso pointing toward a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso proteins was also observed in a model system of zzso disruption of zzso These zzso zzso were zzso by pharmacological zzso of zzso family zzso of the small zzso zzso or by zzso of zzso by zzso Upon cell zzso zzso was zzso in the absence and much more prominently in the presence of serum, but also after zzso zzso zzso zzso was controlled by zzso of zzso family zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling was not linked to zzso zzso We thus provide evidence that zzso expression is induced by common signaling zzso which are activated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells or by soluble factors as contained in serum, and these pathways include zzso family zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso Our data suggest that tissue zzso activates gene expression of zzso relevant proteins such as zzso
