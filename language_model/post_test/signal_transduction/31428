The zzso zzso zzso is an unusual zzso channel that couples to multiple downstream zzso zzso We noted differences in mouse zzso sequences that may indicate zzso the aim of this study was to compare function and expression of these mouse zzso zzso zzso 

There are three differences in the sequences of zzso zzso cloned from mouse zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the former and zzso in the zzso We expressed these receptors and measured membrane zzso zzso zzso calcium influx and surface membrane zzso We also carried out these zzso on the previously described zzso observed between zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso vs zzso 

zzso current zzso at zzso were zzso of those at zzso without change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso 283 yielded a zzso whose properties were the same as zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso with zzso yielded currents that were zzso of zzso and no zzso zzso was associated with its zzso zzso current zzso and zzso zzso values were the same at mouse zzso and zzso but zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly reduced at the zzso zzso There was equivalent surface membrane expression of all zzso zzso 

This study has revealed a zzso zzso in the zzso that is critical for zzso zzso function and suggests that the zzso zzso zzso alters downstream zzso independently of zzso channel zzso
