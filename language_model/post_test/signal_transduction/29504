The final step in the direct restoration of the zzso threshold by peripheral administration of zzso and zzso was recently suggested to result from the opening of zzso zzso channels zzso This channel is known to be open either directly by zzso or indirectly via protein zzso G zzso zzso In the present study, it was shown that the blockade was caused by a specific zzso inhibitor zzso of the zzso effect of zzso and zzso on acute zzso and of zzso on persistent zzso It was also shown that, in both models, zzso prevented the peripheral zzso effect of an analogue of zzso the zzso oxide zzso donor zzso However, in acute zzso zzso did not prevent the peripheral zzso effect of zzso (a direct zzso zzso In persistent zzso the zzso plateau was induced by daily injections of zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso into the rat paw for 14 zzso After zzso of zzso injections, the pharmacological blockade of persistent zzso led to a zzso phase in which a rather small stimulus restored the zzso zzso In this phase, zzso (which specifically closes zzso fully restored persistent zzso as did injection of zzso Thus, the zzso of the zzso zzso causes direct blockade of acute and persistent zzso by opening zzso via the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso constitute a previously zzso well defined class of peripheral analgesics with a mechanism of action different from either zzso or zzso of zzso
