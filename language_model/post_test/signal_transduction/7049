zzso zzso pneumonia is a common cause of death in zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso of secondary zzso pneumonia after influenza is zzso We now report that influenza infection induced pulmonary zzso production in a type I zzso zzso zzso zzso manner, which zzso mice to secondary zzso infection downstream of zzso zzso Mice deficient in zzso zzso were resistant to secondary zzso infection and generated more zzso zzso T cells but not zzso T cells, thereby leading to enhanced zzso response during the early phase of host zzso zzso treatment could suppress the development of zzso zzso T cells activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso activity of zzso on zzso T cells was dependent on zzso factor zzso Finally, zzso of zzso or administration of zzso restored the role of zzso T cells in combating secondary zzso zzso Our study defines what we believe to be a novel role of zzso in zzso host innate immunity against zzso zzso
