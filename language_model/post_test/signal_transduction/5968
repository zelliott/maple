We have identified a novel mechanism of zzso between cell signaling and zzso zzso zzso the signaling zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso binds to, zzso and enhances the zzso activity of zzso 1 zzso an important regulatory zzso in cellular zzso zzso and energy zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in model cell systems and showed functional interactions in a zzso zzso Strong direct interaction of zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso binding was within zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso while zzso binding to zzso was in the zzso 96 zzso zzso zzso of zzso selectively on zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso activity and could be blocked by zzso with a zzso zzso expression zzso and by zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso leukemia cells further demonstrated the role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso The results presented here provide new evidence that the cell signaling zzso zzso is a novel regulator of zzso metabolism through its zzso and regulation of zzso zzso These findings suggest a new mechanism zzso growth factor signaling may zzso integrate zzso regulation with established signaling functions of cell cycle regulation and cell zzso
