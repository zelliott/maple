In zzso incubation of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso cycle that is a potential zzso clock zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins assemble into large zzso complexes zzso to effect a robust zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report real-time zzso of the zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso by using zzso X-ray scattering and determination of the zzso shapes of the zzso and zzso zzso Most previously identified zzso zzso could be mapped to the association zzso of our complex zzso Our results suggest that the zzso processes are crucial for phase zzso in the early zzso stage but are passively driven by the zzso status of zzso in the late zzso zzso The zzso zzso is assembled in such a way that zzso and zzso are recruited to a zzso region of zzso in a zzso zzso
