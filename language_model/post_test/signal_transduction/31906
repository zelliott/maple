We characterized the zzso structure and zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 7) gene in zzso zzso and the evolution of the gene across zzso Within the zzso sequence zzso region, zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso and one zzso However, zzso analysis indicates that this zzso protein contains no obvious functional zzso or known zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso in zzso zzso results revealed that, in addition to its expression in the blood island region, some regions of the central nervous system, and zzso of the neural tube, zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed primarily in zzso zzso such as zzso and muscles during early zzso zzso in zzso is consistent with results from zzso association studies suggesting that zzso is related to human adult zzso zzso in the blood island region, where blood cell precursors (including B zzso are generated, implies a potential zzso role for zzso in zzso development between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in some regions of the central nervous system and zzso of the neural tube also suggests other functions in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is a zzso gene and zzso strong selective pressure in lower zzso but is functionally constrained in higher zzso When zzso zzso was examined by zzso of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with main distribution in zzso Treating zzso zzso with zzso a small molecular inhibitor of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso confirmed that zzso expression in zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Our data provide important clues for zzso and physiology during development from the perspective of evolutionary zzso
