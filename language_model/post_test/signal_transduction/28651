Although zzso zzso regulate multiple cellular events, their role in cell division is still zzso Here we show that expression of a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regulator zzso zzso abnormal cortical activity during zzso in zzso zzso Multiple large zzso were observed in cells expressing zzso zzso from the onset of zzso to the late stage of cell zzso When zzso zzso was zzso zzso was zzso and cells with zzso were zzso It has been reported that zzso is caused by abnormal cortical zzso The zzso zzso abnormal cortical activity was inhibited by the dominant negative form of zzso but not zzso or zzso Moreover, expression of zzso active zzso also induced drastic cortical activity during zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by the ROCK inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso regulates cortical activity during zzso through a novel signaling zzso We propose that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso by regulating cortical movement through zzso
