zzso is a zzso zzso which belongs to the family of zzso zzso zzso It is highly expressed in the zzso but molecular mechanisms underlying its action in this part of the brain have not been investigated in zzso To study whether intrinsic zzso activity could result in zzso signal zzso we examined spontaneous and action potential zzso changes in zzso of yellow fluorescent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cultured zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneously zzso zzso to specific sites within zzso confined zzso of zzso zzso The zzso to these sites were expressed as fast, zzso increases in zzso zzso coincided with a decrease in adjacent sites indicating genuine protein zzso zzso relevant zzso stimulation with short trains of action zzso also resulted in fast, simultaneous, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to several sites zzso zzso signaling in different parts of zzso zzso The amount of zzso protein increased with the number of action zzso in a train decoding the number of zzso into the amount of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may signal within zzso restricted zzso of zzso processes in which it might play a zzso role in zzso local zzso of specific molecular zzso
