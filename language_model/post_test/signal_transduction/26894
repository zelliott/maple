zzso of the heart requires tight control zzso zzso cell zzso expansion, and zzso zzso acid zzso signaling restricts expansion of the second heart field zzso serving as an important zzso in heart zzso Here, we identify the zzso domain protein zzso as a crucial regulator of the zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso show an increased pool of zzso cardiac zzso and, zzso dramatically increased numbers of zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso binds zzso zzso its zzso activity, and is also required for zzso of zzso expression in an zzso zzso Lack of zzso abrogates the zzso restriction of zzso cardiac zzso We conclude that zzso plays a central role in regulating the zzso during heart development by linking zzso signaling to the function of zzso a key zzso factor in cardiac zzso zzso
