zzso recording methods with zzso zzso were used to study signal zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso action of zzso zzso in zzso identified zzso in the small zzso zzso zzso Exposure to BK evoked slowly zzso membrane zzso and enhanced zzso associated with increased input resistance in zzso and decreased input resistance in zzso zzso zzso with zzso toxin did not affect the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed or abolished the zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso or PG zzso evoked zzso zzso responses in the zzso zzso with a potency order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso or zzso in zzso zzso were suppressed in the presence of the zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso but not the inactive analog zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso but not zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso or zzso a specific protein zzso C zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Selective protein zzso A zzso did not alter zzso or zzso zzso responses in S zzso The results suggest that BK stimulates synthesis and release of zzso which acts at zzso receptors to evoke zzso responses in zzso zzso The zzso zzso cascade includes zzso of zzso C, zzso production, zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C and/or zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
