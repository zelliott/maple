The adult zzso zone zzso contains zzso stem cells capable of generating new zzso for the zzso zzso Adult zzso is driven by a variety of signal systems that can induce synergistic or opposing cellular zzso It is therefore important to gain insight into the underlying downstream signaling zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso and zzso induce rapid zzso zzso in cultured zzso adult neural zzso and augment zzso zzso cell zzso Here, we investigated signaling pathways zzso by zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso All three zzso elicit zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso characteristics differ between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso alters the zzso zzso zzso and young zzso but not zzso lose responsiveness to the zzso zzso experiments are indicative of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso acts via the zzso zzso zzso exerts its function via the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso and zzso induce zzso but also zzso zzso signaling pathways and suggest that they carry the potential to act zzso in the control of cell proliferation and cell survival in adult zzso
