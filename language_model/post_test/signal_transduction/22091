A high concentration of bone zzso proteins zzso stimulates zzso zzso cells to undergo zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso role of the zzso signaling zzso during terminal muscle differentiation has not been zzso We report here that zzso was zzso and activated in zzso growing mouse zzso zzso zzso cells without exposure to any zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso was severely reduced during precocious zzso differentiation under the high cell density culture condition even in growth medium supplemented with a high concentration of zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso or zzso a specific zzso of zzso induced precocious terminal differentiation of zzso zzso cells in a cell zzso fashion even in growth zzso In addition, zzso was zzso activated in zzso zzso zzso cells during muscle zzso in zzso The present results indicate that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in a critical switch between growth and differentiation of zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, precocious cell zzso zzso differentiation suggests that a community effect triggers the terminal muscle differentiation of zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso
