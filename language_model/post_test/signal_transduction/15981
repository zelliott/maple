We investigated the roles of the zzso transcripts and found that expression of a zzso containing the zzso region zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso promoted cell differentiation zzso We hypothesized that the zzso expressed zzso binds zzso and zzso their zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso cells, contributing to the increased cell zzso through reduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso while inhibitor of zzso blocked zzso Our results indicate that the zzso transcripts are important in regulating cell activities and may have potential application for modulating zzso zzso zzso
