zzso immune recognition receptors zzso represent a family of surface receptors that is expressed on different cells and that zzso zzso signals, leading to many biological zzso The most intriguing common structural feature of zzso family members is that the zzso recognition zzso and the zzso signaling zzso are located on separate zzso It is not clear how zzso zzso binding triggers zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this article, I suggest that the structural similarity of the zzso provides the basis for the similarity in the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis assumes that the therapeutic strategies learned from a novel zzso model of zzso signal zzso the signaling chain zzso model, are generalized for this entire family and have important implications for the treatment of many disorders that are zzso by immune cells, including zzso
