zzso competition plays a crucial role in the refinement of synaptic connections in the peripheral and central nervous zzso The reduction in number of zzso zzso each zzso junction during development, zzso zzso zzso appears to be one such competitive zzso zzso Recently, we showed that zzso firing of competing zzso terminals is a key player in zzso zzso Although some previous studies suggested that activity of the zzso cell may be an zzso in the disposal of redundant zzso zzso the mechanism involved remains zzso In the present study, in order to assess the role of evoked muscle activity in this process, we inhibited the generation of zzso action zzso in muscle fibers in zzso through the zzso of inwardly zzso zzso and zzso channels, via zzso of the zzso muscle in the mouse zzso zzso and zzso data show that zzso of zzso channels in the zzso region of zzso muscle zzso zzso membrane zzso and an increase in zzso zzso of the action potential mechanism and prolonged persistence of zzso zzso These changes are not seen in muscle zzso with zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Our results are compatible with the interpretation that the block of action potential generation, even in single zzso can inhibit zzso elimination through local zzso
