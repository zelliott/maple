Although the molecular mechanism has not yet been clarified until now, it is very interesting that Alzheimer's disease zzso hypertension zzso and cerebral zzso zzso zzso often occur zzso and possess many similar pathological zzso zzso we zzso that a feedback signaling loop, consisted of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to the interesting pathological zzso First, zzso zzso the production of zzso and enhances the activity of zzso Second, zzso and zzso form a mutual zzso zzso Third, the well-balanced feedback signaling loop avoids the development of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso the frequent pathological characteristics of these diseases, including zzso deposition in cerebral zzso and cerebral zzso On one hand, zzso and zzso not only inhibit zzso production but also accelerate zzso zzso preventing zzso deposition in cerebral zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso promote zzso and prevent the zzso of blood pressure in brain, alleviating the pathology of cerebral zzso However, once the precise balance is zzso it may result in zzso deposition, zzso and elevated blood pressure, possibly leading to the zzso occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso The hypothesis updates the current understanding of the molecular linkage among zzso zzso and zzso and lays the ground for developing combined zzso diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases more efficiently and more zzso Interestingly, zzso medicines enhancing the activity of zzso and/or zzso may prevent the development of zzso zzso and zzso and targeting zzso deposition may alleviate the clinical zzso of these related zzso
