Several doping agents, such as anabolic zzso steroids zzso and zzso hormones like zzso growth zzso zzso are employed without considering the potential deleterious effects that they can zzso In addition, zzso are used in zzso women as replacement zzso However, there are no clear guidelines regarding the optimal therapeutic doses of zzso or long-term safety zzso In this study we aimed to determine if two commonly used zzso zzso and zzso alone or in combination with zzso could activate signaling involved in breast cancer cell zzso Using a human breast cancer cell line, zzso as an experimental model we found that both zzso and stanozolol caused a zzso induction of zzso expression and, consequently, zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso and stanozolol were combined with zzso higher induction in zzso expression was zzso This increase involved zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso C zzso which are part of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, both zzso were able to activate membrane rapid signaling involving zzso zzso zzso regulated protein zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso after binding to zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by the ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to block such zzso The zzso activity of zzso and stanozolol was further confirmed by their capacity to induce the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the cell cycle regulator zzso zzso which represents a key protein for the control of breast cancer cell zzso In fact, when zzso and stanozolol were combined with zzso they increased cell proliferation to levels higher than those zzso by the single zzso Taken together these data clearly indicate that the use of high doses of zzso as occurs in doping practice, may increase the risk of breast zzso This potential risk is higher when zzso are used in association with zzso To our knowledge this is the first report directly zzso zzso with this type of zzso
