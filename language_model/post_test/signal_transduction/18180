zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the presence of an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the molecular target for zzso we analyzed the zzso degradation of zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso a rapid reduction of the zzso zzso zzso blocks the zzso of steady state zzso zzso of the turnover of zzso reveal that zzso blocks the zzso of the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso degradation requires zzso of protein zzso because zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis at the concentration at which it causes zzso and zzso of zzso degradation; and zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein synthesis by mimicking zzso also blocks the zzso zzso zzso The blocking of the zzso zzso degradation zzso with the zzso of zzso gene expression in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is shown to increase the zzso of the zzso zzso and the functional zzso zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso our results reveal a mechanism of zzso by zzso by enhancing the stability of zzso zzso The finding that zzso of protein synthesis blocks the zzso zzso turnover implicates a zzso zzso factor zzso as zzso degradation promoting factor, or zzso in controlling the removal of zzso zzso in zzso
