zzso stem cells zzso reside in the bone zzso zzso niche in a zzso state and enter the cell cycle at long zzso However, little is known about zzso and zzso signaling mechanisms underlying this unique property of zzso Here, we show that zzso raft zzso is a key event in the regulation of zzso zzso Freshly isolated zzso from the zzso niche lack zzso raft zzso exhibit repression of the zzso signaling pathway, and express abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raft zzso induced by zzso is essential for zzso re-entry into the cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso raft zzso caused sustained nuclear zzso of zzso zzso factors and induced zzso hibernation ex zzso These data establish a critical role for zzso zzso in regulating the cell cycle, the survival, and the entry into zzso of zzso and uncover a striking similarity in zzso hibernation and zzso zzso zzso zzso
