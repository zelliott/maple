zzso zzso an zzso circulating hormone, and its zzso zzso are key components of an zzso loop that regulates zzso body zzso In this report we have analyzed signal zzso activities of zzso containing the fatty zzso zzso a single zzso acid substitution at position zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain that results in the obese zzso of the fatty zzso We find that this zzso zzso exhibits both zzso zzso zzso via zzso 6 and zzso zzso response elements and zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins 1 and zzso However, zzso is unable to zzso activate zzso and is highly impaired for zzso induced zzso of zzso compared with zzso Introduction of the fatty zzso into a zzso zzso generates a zzso with zzso character that is similar but distinct from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso by zzso of zzso The implications of an zzso domain zzso acid substitution generating a zzso zzso with a partially zzso zzso are discussed both in terms of the mechanism of zzso triggering and the biology of the fatty zzso
