Diabetes zzso zzso is a chronic disease in which the body either does not use or produce the zzso zzso hormone insulin zzso zzso of zzso in the arteries of diabetics is a major predictor of cardiovascular zzso It has been previously shown that zzso degradation products work zzso with transforming growth zzso 1 zzso to induce osteogenesis in vascular smooth muscle zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high concentration of zzso coupled with zzso degradation products and zzso (a zzso commonly associated with zzso will cause a greater degree of osteogenesis compared to normal vascular zzso Thus, the goal of this study was to zzso the effects of high concentration of zzso zzso peptides and zzso on zzso markers like alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 2 zzso We demonstrated using relative gene expression and specific protein zzso that zzso degradation products in the presence of high zzso cause the increase in expression of the specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso present on the surface of the vascular cells, in turn leading to zzso of typical zzso markers like zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocking of zzso and zzso strongly suppressed the expression of the zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso plays an important role in amplifying the osteogenesis induced by zzso peptides and zzso possibly by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
