The zzso zzso is an important physical barrier that regulates zzso processes including zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the mechanisms zzso the zzso zzso zzso by zzso growth factor zzso as part of a response to acute or chronic injury, could activate and zzso human zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso to mimic the in zzso events after zzso The effect of the resulting zzso media zzso was compared with that of zzso with respect to zzso zzso and zzso Such findings were then confirmed using primary zzso zzso cells zzso from healthy zzso zzso from zzso cells caused increased expression of zzso and zzso loss on zzso when compared with zzso zzso contained significant zzso zzso activity involving zzso zzso factor and zzso that was zzso by zzso zzso This was dependent on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with partial regulation by zzso D, but not zzso target of zzso zzso with these zzso zzso derived from zzso displayed increased zzso zzso The present results suggest that the enhanced zzso activity of the zzso growth zzso zzso can enhance zzso immunity during acute injury, while during continued injury and repair, as in chronic zzso this could contribute to persistent zzso zzso
