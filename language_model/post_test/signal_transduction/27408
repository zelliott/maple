The zzso of cells to the zzso zzso zzso generates zzso signals that affect cell zzso differentiation and zzso These signals are triggered by interactions between zzso and the zzso and involve zzso zzso of specific zzso including focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the assembly of focal zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso Swiss zzso cells, the system of focal zzso and zzso zzso is poorly developed, and the level of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is zzso A number of growth factors rapidly stimulate zzso zzso of these proteins and the assembly of focal zzso and zzso zzso Growth factors and zzso to the zzso are both necessary for the subsequent transition of cells to the zzso of the cell zzso 

In zzso Swiss zzso cells, the disruption of zzso by zzso or zzso without the addition of external growth factors, zzso the rapid assembly of focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequent enhancement of DNA zzso All these effects require cell zzso to the zzso and do not occur when cells are zzso on zzso coated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and cell zzso also eliminate the effects of zzso disruption on zzso signal zzso 

In zzso cells, zzso disruption activates the zzso signaling zzso which leads to the assembly of zzso zzso and the induction of DNA zzso The increase in cell zzso is an indispensable intermediate step in this signaling zzso
