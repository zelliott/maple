The amount of mutual information contained in the time series of two elements gives a measure of how well their activities are zzso In a large, complex network of interacting zzso such as a genetic regulatory network within a cell, the average of the mutual information over all pairs, zzso is a global measure of how well the system can coordinate its internal zzso We study this average zzso mutual information in random zzso networks zzso as a function of the distribution of zzso rules implemented at each element, assuming that the links in the network are randomly zzso zzso zzso methods for calculating zzso show that as the number of network zzso zzso approaches zzso the quantity zzso exhibits a zzso at zzso values corresponding to critical zzso For finite systems it zzso near the critical value, but slightly in the zzso regime for typical zzso zzso The source of high values of zzso is the indirect correlations between pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting zzso The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for critical networks and zzso deep in the zzso zzso
