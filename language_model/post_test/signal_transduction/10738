The zzso zzso system zzso is intimately involved in the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso that occur following zzso zzso Though zzso zzso II zzso zzso type 2 receptors zzso decrease greatly after birth, their number increases after zzso zzso during recovery from injury, zzso zzso cells display a relatively immature zzso expressing genes that are involved in zzso development, for example, the paired zzso gene zzso The present investigation hypothesized that zzso zzso would stimulate zzso gene expression in immortalized rat zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as we have found in fetal zzso 

zzso gene expression in zzso was evaluated by zzso Western zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with or without zzso II zzso zzso and proliferation were analyzed by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso incorporation in stable zzso zzso with zzso sense and zzso orientation, zzso 

zzso II zzso zzso gene expression via zzso in zzso The zzso effect of both zzso II on zzso gene expression was blocked by zzso zzso zzso AG zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of sense zzso zzso increased, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our studies suggest that zzso II stimulates zzso gene expression in zzso via zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso pathway, which may be important in zzso repair following zzso zzso lacking zzso gene expression appear to be prone toward zzso rather than zzso
