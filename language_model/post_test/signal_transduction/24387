A number of observations have implicated zzso in the formation of vascular zzso in plant zzso These include vascular strand formation in response to local zzso application, the effects of impaired zzso transport on vascular patterns and suggestive zzso of zzso zzso response zzso In this study, we have used molecular markers to zzso zzso response patterns in developing zzso leaves as well as zzso zzso and transgenic plants to trace pathways of zzso signal zzso controlling the expression of early zzso zzso We show that in young zzso leaf zzso molecular zzso response patterns zzso sites of zzso zzso This is the case not only in normal development but also upon experimental manipulation of zzso transport suggesting that local zzso signals are instrumental in patterning zzso leaf zzso We further found that the activity of the zzso gene zzso which is required for proper vascular zzso is also essential in a spectrum of zzso responses, which include the regulation of rapidly zzso zzso zzso and discovered the zzso vascular expression profile of the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso activity is a limiting factor in the expression of zzso and zzso two genes zzso zzso regulators expressed early in zzso zzso Our observations connect general zzso signaling with early controls of vascular differentiation and suggest molecular mechanisms for zzso signaling in patterned cell zzso
