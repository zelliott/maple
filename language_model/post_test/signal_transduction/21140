zzso zzso and zzso comprise a small family of zzso zzso zzso that possess two tandem zzso zzso To investigate the biological functions of zzso a targeted zzso has been introduced into the zzso zzso zzso which results in an internal deletion of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for embryonic development, as mice zzso for the zzso zzso die in zzso at zzso The zzso zzso zzso fail to zzso properly as evidenced by defects in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells indicates that zzso can function as either a positive or negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso depending on the specific zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso is required for full and sustained zzso of the zzso zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso growth factor zzso raising the possibility that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso results from a zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and is crucial for zzso during zzso zzso
