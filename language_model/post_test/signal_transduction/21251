The zzso growth factor II zzso zzso zzso is known to participate in zzso as well as sorting of zzso zzso and is involved in membrane trafficking through rapid cycling between zzso membrane compartments and the plasma zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso acting through the zzso zzso promotes zzso of insulin in the pancreatic beta zzso The effect of zzso was evoked at zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by a zzso toxin sensitive zzso zzso was dependent on protein zzso zzso zzso and was independent of changes in zzso free zzso zzso Since the applied concentration of zzso is within the range normally found free in circulation in humans, this novel signaling zzso for the zzso zzso is likely to be involved in zzso of insulin zzso under zzso zzso
