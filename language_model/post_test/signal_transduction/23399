zzso virus zzso alters the regulation and expression of a variety of zzso in its host cells to zzso host immune surveillance and facilitate viral zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that, in addition to the zzso reported zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were induced in zzso B cells and were expressed at high levels in all zzso zzso cell lines zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was responsible for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso using a short hairpin zzso approach or by zzso zzso suppressed cell proliferation and caused zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso survival and zzso zzso significant amounts of zzso were detected in zzso plasma from zzso patients, suggesting that zzso zzso this zzso in zzso This study reveals the regulatory mechanism and a novel function of zzso and zzso in zzso B zzso zzso might be useful as a therapeutic target in zzso zzso diseases and zzso
