Recent studies demonstrate that zzso class II molecules can signal via associated zzso zzso signal zzso previously thought to function only in B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso of zzso class II and zzso zzso (by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class II signaling leads to robust proliferation and extension of zzso It seemed possible that these differences might be due, at least in part, to differential use of zzso zzso thought to zzso membrane zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso an zzso zzso zzso neither associates with nor functions in zzso class zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is actively excluded from cell surface zzso class II zzso
