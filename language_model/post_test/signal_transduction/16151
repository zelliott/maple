zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso concentration play critical role in the zzso control of the heart, including regulation of a variety of zzso channels via mechanisms involving protein zzso A, zzso or direct actions on zzso zzso gated zzso zzso In case of any zzso channel, the actual signal zzso cascade can be identified by using properly modified zzso derivatives with altered binding and zzso zzso In this study we focus to structural modifications of zzso resulting in specific zzso and blocking effects on zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso in controlling rapid delayed zzso zzso ) current was studied in canine zzso zzso using these specific zzso zzso zzso stimulation increased the density of zzso in canine zzso cells, which effect was zzso by a zzso but zzso zzso It was also shown that zzso application of large zzso of zzso failed to fully activate zzso comparing to the effect of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso This difference was fully abolished following zzso of zzso by zzso These results are in line with the concept of zzso release, action, and degradation of zzso within zzso
