To investigate the effect of zzso a zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of human liver cancer zzso cells and explore the mechanism involving zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso at different doses zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso Cell viability was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein were examined by zzso and Western zzso zzso After treated separately with zzso zzso zzso or zzso the cell cycle of zzso cells was analyzed by flow zzso zzso was used to detect their proliferation capacity and Western zzso was used to examine the zzso zzso The growth zzso rate of zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso at different zzso showed an zzso effect on the proliferation of zzso cells though zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of flow zzso showed that compared with the control group, the percentage of S + zzso cells in zzso group was lowered by zzso zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, after treated with zzso and zzso the percentage was elevated by zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The zzso and Western zzso zzso showed that compared with the control group, the values of zzso and zzso protein levels in the zzso cells of zzso group were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso After treatment with zzso and zzso the values of zzso and zzso protein levels were elevated significantly zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso rate of zzso + zzso group was zzso significantly lower than zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso groups, zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of human liver cancer zzso zzso The underlying mechanism may be correlated with zzso zzso zzso can enhance the zzso of zzso cells to zzso
