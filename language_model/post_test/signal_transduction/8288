Bone zzso proteins zzso regulate diverse cellular zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso have been studied in several zzso but thus far contradictory results have been obtained and, especially in breast cancer, information on zzso is still zzso We performed a systematic expression survey of zzso and their receptors in breast zzso zzso expression was studied of seven zzso zzso zzso and six receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that specifically mediate zzso zzso zzso levels were determined in 22 breast cancer cell lines, 39 primary breast tumors, normal human zzso zzso cell line, and normal zzso zzso using zzso zzso The expression zzso and expression levels of different zzso varied considerably in breast cancer with zzso and zzso being most frequently expressed and showing highest expression zzso The zzso specific receptors were more zzso expressed and indicated that breast cancer is fully capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and levels for both the zzso and the receptors were in good zzso between the breast cancer cell lines and primary zzso We can conclude that breast zzso possess functional zzso signaling machinery on the cell surface with distinct differences in the expression of various zzso zzso Our survey focuses the attention particularly toward zzso and zzso and suggests their importance in breast zzso Breast cancer cell lines and the data generated here serve as a good resource for further studies on zzso function in breast zzso
