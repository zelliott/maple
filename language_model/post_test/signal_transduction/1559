zzso zzso is the most common highly aggressive human brain cancer, and zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the progression of this zzso We have recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso for zzso a zzso growth factor that is highly expressed during embryonic brain development and in tumors of the central nervous zzso Here we report on the contribution of zzso signaling to zzso zzso We found zzso zzso in human zzso relative to normal brain and detected zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso We reduced the zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso targeting and demonstrated that this prevents zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso Furthermore, this depletion of zzso reduced tumor growth of zzso in zzso nude mice and prolonged survival of the animals because of increased zzso in the zzso These findings directly zzso zzso signaling as a zzso factor in the growth of zzso zzso and suggest potential utility of therapeutic targeting of zzso
