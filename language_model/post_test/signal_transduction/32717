zzso and zzso deposition following complement zzso and its regulation by zzso were studied using zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells as targets and zzso Following zzso of the alternative pathway, an initial low level of zzso deposition was observed on zzso cell surfaces after a lag time of approximately 4 zzso This was followed by a secondary high level of zzso deposition with a slower zzso zzso deposition was zzso within 15 zzso When zzso was expressed zzso zzso the zzso of zzso deposition were essentially zzso but the onset of the secondary high zzso deposition was fully zzso zzso deposition was also observed on zzso but not on zzso cells following zzso of the alternative zzso zzso of the classical zzso on zzso and zzso cells, using factor zzso human serum and zzso zzso resulted in almost identical zzso zzso deposition zzso zzso no regulation of zzso deposition by zzso was evident following zzso of the classical zzso These data indicate that zzso prevents the zzso deposition amplification loop zzso by the alternative zzso zzso and, consequently, zzso the formation of the alternative zzso zzso But zzso prevents neither the spontaneous zzso zzso deposition leading to the formation of the alternative zzso zzso nor the formation of the functional classical zzso and zzso zzso
