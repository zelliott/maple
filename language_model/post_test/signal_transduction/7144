zzso converting zzso zzso 2 is a key negative regulator of the zzso system where it zzso zzso zzso II into zzso zzso We zzso that zzso II suppresses zzso by increasing zzso converting zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso II infusion zzso zzso in zzso mice for 2 weeks resulted in substantial decrease in zzso zzso protein levels and activity with corresponding increase in plasma zzso activity, prevented by zzso zzso zzso II resulted in zzso increase in zzso zzso expression and activity, and membrane zzso of zzso zzso II treatment in zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso shedding of zzso while zzso with zzso prevented shedding of zzso zzso deletion of zzso also prevented shedding of zzso zzso oxygen species played a key role since zzso mice were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with preservation of zzso zzso which dampened zzso zzso cardiac dysfunction and zzso In conclusion, zzso II zzso zzso shedding by promoting zzso activity as a positive feedback mechanism zzso zzso II zzso the loss of its negative regulator, zzso In zzso elevated plasma zzso activity likely represents loss of the protective effects of zzso in the zzso
