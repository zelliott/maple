Whereas zzso sensory zzso might ultimately lead to cell death and loss of sensation, they first progress through a phase, which might last for years, characterized by the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Much previous research has addressed these two zzso as separate phenomena zzso by presumably discrete zzso zzso We hypothesized that activity in zzso pathways that ultimately lead to zzso plays a critical role in the generation of zzso pain, before death of sensory zzso becomes zzso We have tested the hypothesis that zzso and zzso zzso defining components of programmed cell death zzso zzso zzso also contribute to zzso zzso in animals with zzso peripheral zzso and that the death zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso and its downstream second messenger, zzso also produce zzso zzso via this zzso In two models of painful peripheral zzso zzso therapy zzso by the zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and cancer chemotherapy zzso by zzso peripheral zzso and for zzso zzso induced by zzso necrosis zzso and its second messenger, zzso zzso of both zzso zzso 2, 8 and 9) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although has no effect in zzso zzso and control zzso We conclude that during a zzso phase, before zzso cell death is zzso the zzso zzso zzso can contribute to pain in zzso peripheral zzso and that zzso zzso also activate these zzso This suggests that these pathways are potential targets for novel pharmacological agents for the treatment of inflammatory as well as zzso zzso
