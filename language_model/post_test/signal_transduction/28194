The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in B cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso proteins to the plasma membrane through binding to zzso second zzso represents a major zzso mechanism for zzso We have found that the zzso zzso of zzso and tandem zzso zzso protein 2 zzso specify a temporally distinct wave of membrane recruitment compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso with recruitment of these two zzso representing a later stage of the zzso In this study we provide direct evidence that zzso zzso recruitment of zzso to the membrane is blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in human B zzso zzso In contrast, recruitment specified by the zzso or zzso zzso zzso is completely insensitive to zzso zzso This differential regulation can be accounted for by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity alone, as expression of zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso but had no zzso effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso kinetic analysis revealed that membrane recruitment of zzso and zzso is actually more rapid under zzso signaling zzso Analysis of zzso generation under zzso and zzso signaling conditions indicated that recruitment of zzso and zzso is zzso correlated with the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in B cells led to an increase in the sustained phase of the calcium response and increased zzso zzso zzso after B cell zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso define a novel group of zzso targets of zzso that regulate B cell zzso zzso zzso
