Biological signaling networks process zzso cues to control important cell decisions such as zzso zzso and zzso After zzso zzso zzso signaling proteins change in zzso modification state, and zzso zzso Many of the proteins in signaling networks have been identified, but it is not known how signaling molecules work together to control cell zzso To begin to address this issue, we report the use of partial least squares zzso as an zzso method to glean zzso relationships from zzso zzso signaling data collected from zzso human colon zzso cells zzso to undergo programmed cell zzso By partial least squares zzso we relate dynamic and quantitative zzso of zzso zzso signals to cell survival after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (a death zzso and insulin (a survival zzso We find that partial least squares models can distinguish highly zzso signals from redundant zzso signals to generate a reduced model that retains key signaling features and zzso zzso In these models, zzso of zzso zzso based on very different techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are grouped together as zzso showing that zzso data have been effectively zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of cell responses are always zzso demonstrating the zzso nature of the decision zzso
