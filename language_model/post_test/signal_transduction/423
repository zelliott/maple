The zzso zzso zzso is the main active compound in zzso It is used as a herbal medicine zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its mode of action, however, remains widely zzso In the present study, we aimed to zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso in attenuating inflammatory responses in zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that zzso caused a broad block in the induction of zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso also strongly attenuated inflammatory responses induced by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was accompanied by decreased zzso not only of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso but also of the parallel zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cascade upon stimulation with zzso and zzso zzso Further analysis of upstream events revealed that zzso treatment decreased cellular attachment and/or zzso of zzso and strongly impaired zzso zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso effects were specific for zzso zzso zzso as zzso was ineffective in blocking zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso induction upon stimulation with zzso a zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest that the broad zzso activity of zzso is zzso by the interaction with the zzso zzso thereby attenuating zzso zzso
