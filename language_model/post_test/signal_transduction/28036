The zzso more than 50 years ago, of zzso as the site of zzso energy metabolism has prompted studies that have unraveled the complexity of the numerous zzso and zzso zzso fundamental to cell function, carried out by these zzso These activities depend on a distinctive zzso structure, with different zzso and reactions localized in discrete zzso and zzso zzso The characteristic zzso structural organization is the product of both synthesis of zzso within the zzso and the import of proteins and lipids zzso outside the zzso zzso and import of zzso components are required for zzso zzso but rather than producing new zzso these processes may facilitate the growth of pre-existing zzso Recent evidence indicates that these events are regulated in a complex way by several zzso and environmental conditions, through zzso of specific zzso factors and signaling zzso Some of these are now being zzso Generation of zzso oxide zzso appears to be a novel player in this scenario, possibly acting as a unifying molecular switch to trigger the whole zzso zzso
