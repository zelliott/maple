Much attention has focused on zzso and zzso biology, but little research has been performed on the cell that composes zzso of all bone zzso zzso zzso function has been difficult to study because these cells are embedded in zzso tissue and are difficult to obtain in reasonable numbers and zzso zzso of an zzso cell line makes it possible to study zzso function more readily and easily by the application of protein chemistry and molecular zzso We have established a cell line that appears to have the properties of primary zzso
