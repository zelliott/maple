zzso smooth muscle cells zzso undergo many zzso changes when placed in zzso Several studies have shown that the levels of expression of soluble zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso are altered in cultured zzso In this study the mechanisms involved in the coordinated expression of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso that increase the expression of type II NO zzso zzso NO zzso or zzso decreased zzso expression in freshly isolated, zzso bovine zzso zzso However, in several zzso zzso lines zzso bovine zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein expression was not suppressed by zzso or zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso bovine zzso zzso but not in zzso cell zzso Restoration of expression of zzso to zzso bovine zzso using zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso restored the capacity of the cells to increase zzso in response to zzso Furthermore, treatment of these zzso cells with NO donors for 48 h resulted in decreased zzso protein zzso In contrast, zzso rat zzso zzso expressed high levels of zzso zzso but demonstrated reduced expression of zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso active domain in rat zzso zzso caused a reduction in the expression of zzso in these zzso These results suggest that there is a mechanism for the coordinated expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and that prolonged zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the loss of zzso expression appears to increase zzso zzso These effects may be an zzso mechanism allowing growth and survival of zzso in zzso
