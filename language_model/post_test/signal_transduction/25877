zzso are single zzso zzso zzso with an essentially zzso type of metabolism and are probably the major sites of zzso zzso zzso These zzso also generate zzso zzso zzso and besides zzso they have a complex battery of zzso zzso In recent years the existence of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso activity and the generation of the zzso nitrogen species zzso zzso oxide zzso have been demonstrated in plant zzso The zzso and zzso NO carrier zzso zzso can be generated inside zzso and the presence of this zzso has been demonstrated in zzso from several plant zzso This review analyzes the available evidence concerning the properties of the zzso activity and the generation of the zzso zzso NO and zzso in zzso in the context of the cellular function of these zzso as a source of zzso signaling zzso The important zzso functions displayed by NO and other zzso in zzso and zzso communication in different organisms indicate that more attention should be zzso to the zzso signaling function of zzso in human, animal and zzso cells, where it is very likely that similar mechanisms to those found in plant zzso are also zzso
