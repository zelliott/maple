zzso of zzso zzso is a recently discovered zzso zzso can induce a zzso response of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells where the zzso for zzso is zzso zzso Although the mechanism is not fully zzso zzso of zzso zzso may be an important part of the mechanism by which zzso encodes zzso in the zzso zzso of sheep and other zzso We used this as a hypothesis to search for a natural zzso that would activate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The approach revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be an indirect zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We discuss this in relation to the mechanism and importance of zzso to the function to the zzso zzso
