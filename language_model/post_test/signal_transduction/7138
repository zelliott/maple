The development of right heart failure zzso is characterized by zzso of right zzso zzso structure and function, but the mechanisms of zzso remain still zzso Thus, understanding the zzso is essential for improved zzso zzso identification by quantitative zzso of targets specific to zzso may have therapeutic benefits to identify novel potential therapeutic zzso The objective of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms changing RV function in the diseased zzso and thus, to identify novel potential therapeutic zzso For this, we have performed differential zzso analysis of whole RV proteins using two experimental rat models of zzso zzso protein expression was observed for hundred zzso six RV proteins including proteins involved in structural constituent of zzso motor activity, structural zzso activity, zzso protein binding and zzso zzso Interestingly, further analysis of zzso zzso reveals that both protein and gene expressions of zzso zzso were drastically decreased in zzso which was accompanied by an increase of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso activities zzso and zzso were decreased whereas zzso activity was zzso In conclusion, this study revealed the involvement of zzso system zzso in zzso Three zzso mechanisms were zzso zzso decreased gene and protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso decreased specific activity of zzso and zzso a specific zzso of zzso zzso This zzso of UPS of RV may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for restoration of cardiac function in the diseased zzso
