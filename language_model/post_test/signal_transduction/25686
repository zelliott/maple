Recently, it was reported that in a zzso zzso model, zzso cell death is associated with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso a zzso factor that is critically required for zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was found to significantly increase zzso oxide zzso production and to induce zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to markedly reduce zzso levels under conditions that could induce zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso cell death and zzso degradation by zzso were prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso but zzso could not restore the zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that the cell death and zzso degradation caused by zzso are dependent on zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but reduced the zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso cell death by zzso appears to be regulated by the zzso of zzso via some interaction between zzso and zzso zzso
