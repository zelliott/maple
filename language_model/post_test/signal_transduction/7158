The zzso protein 202 zzso has emerged as a key regulator of cell proliferation and zzso To explore the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso mouse zzso stem cells zzso were zzso and were found to continuously increase during zzso zzso The nuclear and zzso distribution of zzso in the differentiation process was also zzso In addition, suppression and zzso of zzso impaired and enhanced the differentiation process, zzso Further, results of zzso and zzso showed the interaction and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso at intermediate and/or late differentiation zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the elevated expression of zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, the zzso and spatial profiles of zzso and the observed manner in which zzso affected the expression of these zzso factors provided evidence that zzso plays a role during zzso zzso
