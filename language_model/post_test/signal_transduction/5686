There is a pressing need for new therapies to treat pancreatic zzso In principle, this could be achieved by taking advantage of signaling pathways that are active in zzso but not normal, zzso The work described in this study set out to determine whether the activities of three zzso which have been reported to be highly responsive to activated zzso differ in pancreatic tumor cells that express zzso versus zzso active zzso forms of zzso Surprisingly, the three enhancers are active in four different pancreatic tumor cell lines that express either normal zzso gene or zzso zzso Moreover, reducing the concentration of serum in the growth medium from zzso to zzso had relatively little effect on the strength of any of the zzso although it drastically affected cell zzso zzso our studies also indicate that zzso is active in pancreatic tumor cells that possess zzso as well as zzso zzso even when cultured in medium that severely limits cell zzso These findings support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso may be zzso active even in pancreatic tumor cells that express zzso zzso
