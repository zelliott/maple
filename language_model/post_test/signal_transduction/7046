Basic tenets of sensory processing emphasize the importance of accurate identification and discrimination of environmental objects zzso Although this principle holds also for zzso the crucial acquisition of reward for survival would be aided by the capacity to detect objects whose rewarding properties may not be immediately zzso Animal learning theory zzso how zzso stimuli induce behavioral reactions in rewarded contexts due to zzso and zzso context conditioning zzso We hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms may involve zzso reward zzso We studied zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso physically salient stimuli while systematically changing reward zzso zzso zzso showed substantial zzso to zzso stimuli and their zzso stimuli in highly rewarded zzso The zzso decreased and often disappeared entirely with zzso separation from rewarded zzso The influence of reward context suggests that zzso zzso respond to real and potential zzso The influence of reward context is compatible with the reward nature of zzso zzso zzso The responses may facilitate zzso default initiation of behavioral reactions in environments usually containing zzso Agents would encounter more and miss less zzso resulting in survival advantage and enhanced evolutionary zzso
