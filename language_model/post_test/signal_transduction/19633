zzso cell zzso zzso of the skin is the most common form of cancer, with the majority being caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling is implicated in many tumor zzso thus, defining the mechanisms by which zzso regulates tissue proliferation is of paramount zzso Here, we show that the key role of zzso in the skin is to limit the size of the zzso zzso compartment and allow hair zzso zzso Specifically, loss of zzso leads to the promotion of zzso cell fate by increasing zzso cell proliferation and limiting the progression of zzso cells into differentiated hair zzso cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso likely result from hair zzso zzso cells that, due to zzso signal zzso cannot progress through normal hair zzso zzso These data confirm the role of zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso turnover and also show for the first time that zzso plays a role in the differentiation of the hair zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso growth factor binding protein 2 zzso is zzso in both zzso and human zzso and that blocking zzso activity reduces the zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso mediates zzso zzso cell expansion and therefore represents an zzso zzso zzso target of zzso signaling that promotes zzso zzso
