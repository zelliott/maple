zzso zzso cells zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso on zzso T cells, and a major zzso of zzso center zzso T cells zzso which are adjacent to zzso in zzso expresses high levels of zzso We therefore reasoned that zzso T cells would actively migrate to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and tested this using zzso migration zzso with zzso T cells and other zzso T cells zzso that expressed much lower levels of zzso zzso zzso T cells were virtually zzso to zzso whereas zzso T cells migrated efficiently despite reduced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso T cells efficiently migrated to B cell zzso and zzso zzso which contained zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso to zzso correlated with high ex zzso expression of regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso and expression of protein in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso T cells, resulting in their impaired migration to zzso Finally, zzso T cells zzso zzso and zzso expression in the absence of zzso and regained migratory competence to zzso Although zzso T cells express high levels of zzso signaling through this zzso appears to be specifically inhibited by zzso expression of zzso and zzso Thus, zzso appear to directly affect zzso T cell migration within zzso zzso
