zzso zzso arise from diverse cell lineages and molecular strategies in the zzso zzso For example, the zzso and zzso are induced by zzso zzso whereas the tail muscles are specified autonomously by the localized zzso zzso A unique zzso zzso the trunk lateral cells, develop from a single pair of zzso cells, the zzso zzso which form part of the anterior zzso zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso signaling is active in the zzso descendants of zzso but is absent from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling results in expanded expression of zzso marker genes and loss of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso produces the opposite zzso the transformation of zzso into zzso Evidence is presented that a specific zzso signaling zzso zzso is required to establish zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso activity via zzso injection results in zzso zzso signaling and conversion of the zzso lineage into zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso marker zzso These results extend recent observations regarding the role of zzso signaling in the establishment of zzso cell fates in the zzso zzso and neural zzso
