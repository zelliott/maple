The zzso gene of zzso zzso is one of several genes required for mating between two zzso cell types of this zzso Its product is required for response to a signal that causes arrest of the zzso cell cycle in the zzso phase and induction of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene was zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows zzso to the protein zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso product has zzso zzso activity and that this activity is required for its in zzso zzso
