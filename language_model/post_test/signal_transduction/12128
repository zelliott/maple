zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso proteins that function during cell division and in the behavior of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is broadly expressed in many cells and zzso including the touch zzso zzso and body wall zzso Within muscle, zzso is associated with a zzso network that is closely opposed to the zzso zzso sites called dense zzso To examine zzso function, we zzso an zzso zzso interference zzso and screened for synthetic interactions with zzso zzso site zzso We reveal a synthetic lethal relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso results in adult animals with zzso zzso splayed and zzso muscle with altered zzso zzso zzso fill with zzso become zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso is a genetic modifier of a zzso zzso model of muscular zzso
