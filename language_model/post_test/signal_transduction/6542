Stem cells in animal zzso are often located and controlled by special tissue zzso known as zzso Studies of stem cell niches in model systems such as zzso have revealed adhesive zzso cell cycle modifications and zzso signals that operate to control stem cell zzso zzso niches and regulatory molecules have also been identified in many zzso zzso including bone zzso skin, gut and zzso While niches are an ancient evolutionary device with zzso features across diverse organisms, we suggest that certain niches display important differences in their organization and zzso
