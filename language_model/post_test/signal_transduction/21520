The cellular and molecular mechanisms zzso the zzso development of brain zzso are still incompletely zzso Here, we examine the role of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A zzso signaling in cortical development and zzso focusing on its role in zzso zzso and barrel map zzso We provide direct evidence that zzso activity mediates barrel map formation using zzso mice that lack type zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso function is required for proper zzso and the organization of cortical layer IV zzso into barrels, but not for the development and plasticity of zzso zzso zzso into a barrel zzso We zzso zzso function to zzso processes in barrel zzso and show that zzso zzso targets, but not zzso zzso targets, have decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that long-term zzso at zzso zzso and the associated zzso increase in zzso zzso function at these zzso which normally occurs as barrels form, is absent in zzso zzso Together, these experiments support an zzso model for barrel map development in which the selective addition and elimination of zzso zzso based on zzso mechanisms for zzso formation is zzso by a zzso zzso that relies on zzso zzso
