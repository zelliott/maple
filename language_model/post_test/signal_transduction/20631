Although voluntary running has beneficial effects on zzso cognitive functions if done zzso it is still uncertain whether resistance running would be the zzso For this purpose, voluntary resistance wheel running zzso with a load is a suitable model, since it allows increased work levels and zzso muscular adaptation in zzso zzso Here, we examined whether zzso would have potential effects on zzso cognitive functions with enhanced zzso zzso zzso factor zzso as does wheel running without a load zzso zzso male zzso rats were assigned randomly to sedentary zzso zzso and zzso (to a maximum load of zzso of body zzso groups for 4 zzso We found that in zzso work levels increased with load, but running distance decreased by about half, which zzso muscular adaptation for zzso zzso muscle without causing any negative stress zzso Both zzso and WR led to improved spatial learning and memory as well as gene expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso response zzso zzso protein levels, whereas WR increased only zzso With both exercise groups, there were correlations between spatial memory and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and work levels zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a beneficial role in zzso cognitive functions associated with zzso zzso zzso even with short zzso and that work levels rather than running distance are more zzso of zzso beneficial effects in wheel running with and without a zzso
