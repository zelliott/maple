There is current controversy regarding whether zzso plays a significant role in the elevated pressure of zzso advanced stages of pulmonary zzso zzso of acute zzso testing using conventional zzso in such patients suggest there is only a minor contribution of zzso However, there is a possibility that these results may underestimate the contribution of zzso because the most effective zzso have not yet been zzso This issue has not been addressed even zzso due mainly to a lack of appropriate animal zzso A few animal models that mimic the pathology of human severe pulmonary hypertension more closely zzso development of zzso zzso zzso in small pulmonary zzso have been introduced, including rat models of left lung zzso plus zzso injection and vascular zzso growth factor zzso plus exposure to chronic zzso We have observed that zzso zzso zzso a novel class of potent zzso reduce the high pulmonary artery pressure of these models acutely and zzso suggesting that zzso can significantly be involved in pulmonary hypertension with severely remodeled zzso pulmonary zzso This chapter describes methods used for evaluation of the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in rat models of pulmonary zzso
