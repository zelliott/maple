The unique properties of zzso cells zzso lend themselves to the zzso of zzso immune responses, including zzso zzso Central to their zzso function is the capacity of DC to zzso zzso T cells towards a regulatory zzso and to expand existing regulatory T cells zzso This review draws on current understanding of the interaction between these critical cell types to evaluate prospects for the use of DC as a therapeutic zzso 

Over the past year, there have been significant developments in zzso the molecular basis of zzso zzso Furthermore, it has proven possible to capitalize on this understanding to reinforce tolerance by conditioning DC through exposure to defined pharmacological zzso The use of these modulated DC in animal models of zzso rejection has highlighted the therapeutic potential of this approach but also the full extent of the challenges that remain to be zzso 

The use of DC to induce zzso tolerance by tapping into the zzso network remains a viable prospect for future strategies for immune intervention in zzso zzso Furthermore, principles learned from the study of whole organ transplantation may find application in the emerging field of zzso medicine, in which the use of immune suppression is likely to be zzso
