zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is a common cancer zzso by low survival rate and poor zzso The zzso process of oral zzso is affected by multiple genetic events such as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The use of appropriate experimental animal models that accurately represent the cellular and molecular changes which are associated with the initiation and progression of human oral cancer is of crucial zzso The Syrian golden zzso cheek zzso oral zzso model is the best known animal system that closely zzso events involved in the development of zzso and zzso human oral zzso zzso we established an experimental system of chemically induced oral zzso in zzso in order to study different stages of zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso early invasion, well differentiated zzso and moderately differentiated zzso We investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and cell proliferation marker zzso in the sequential stages of zzso oral zzso Here, we describe the findings of the experimental model in regard to the involvement of signal zzso pathways in every stage of cancer zzso Increased zzso and cell proliferation were observed in early stages of oral zzso Furthermore, the increased expression of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the increased expression of nuclear zzso factors in early stages of oral cancer indicates that these molecules may be used as early zzso factors for the progression of zzso Since the expression of both zzso and zzso do not seem to affect signal zzso during oral zzso it can be assumed that a different zzso pathway, such as the zzso and/or zzso pathway, may be implicated in the zzso of zzso
