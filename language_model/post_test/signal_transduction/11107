The requirement for the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso the cellular response to DNA damage induced by zzso radiation has been studied zzso Many of the zzso zzso in clinical use today cause DNA double strand breaks; however, few have been evaluated for their ability to zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the requirement for zzso in the cellular response to zzso a zzso zzso zzso Using several zzso and zzso cell lines, we have observed zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso on seven zzso zzso This was accompanied by an increased binding of zzso to its zzso binding site, suggesting zzso competency of zzso to activate its downstream zzso Treatment of cells with zzso led to the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso 139 with dependence on zzso for the initial zzso zzso treatment also zzso zzso zzso on zzso 1981 and the zzso zzso of numerous zzso in the zzso pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Although generally classified as a zzso zzso drug that zzso DNA double strand breaks, zzso can zzso DNA and generate zzso oxygen zzso zzso of cells with the zzso scavenger zzso acid had no effect on the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of cells with the zzso radical scavenger, zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
