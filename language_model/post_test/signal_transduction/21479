zzso a zzso type II zzso zzso carrying an zzso zzso is believed to be an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso B cells lacking zzso show enhanced zzso zzso and are zzso in response to zzso zzso However, the signal zzso pathways downstream of zzso signaling that transmit the zzso effect of zzso in mature B cells remain zzso To address this question, we used zzso egg zzso zzso transgenic mice to zzso the differential cell signaling between zzso and zzso B cells in response to zzso egg zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso predominantly zzso the major signal zzso pathways downstream of the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mature B zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso which mimics the binding of zzso (a natural zzso for zzso to release the zzso function of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity upon zzso stimulation in zzso B zzso In addition, we show direct evidence that zzso promotes cell cycle arrest and zzso after zzso stimulation in mature B zzso Taken together, our findings conclude that zzso plays a dominant role as a negative regulator of zzso signaling in primary mature B zzso
