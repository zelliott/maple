Many zzso and pharmaceuticals have been shown to promote zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of zzso interventions and the time points at which interventions should be implemented to achieve beneficial effects are not well zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso can promote lifespan in worms and flies and delay age-related functional decline of pancreatic cells in zzso Here we investigated the mechanism underlying lifespan extension induced by zzso and the effects of short-term or life zzso interventions with zzso on lifespan in zzso We found that lifespan extension induced by zzso was associated with reduced zzso of zzso a component of zzso stress response zzso zzso and slightly increased zzso of zzso a component of zzso zzso zzso extension was also associated with a reduced level of zzso protein zzso a zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, lifespan extension induced by zzso was partially suppressed by zzso of zzso a major zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso supplementation was administered in three life stages of adult flies, health span zzso zzso transition span zzso zzso and zzso span zzso days to the end when all flies zzso zzso supplementation during any of these life stages extended the remaining lifespan relative to the zzso and life zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso supplementation is sufficient to promote longevity when implemented during any life stage, likely through reducing zzso zzso
