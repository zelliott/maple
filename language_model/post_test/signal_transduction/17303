As part of the civil aviation safety program to define the adverse effects of ethanol on flying performance, we performed a DNA zzso analysis of human whole blood samples from a zzso point study of subjects administered ethanol orally, followed by breathalyzer analysis, to monitor blood alcohol concentration zzso to discover significant gene expression changes in response to the ethanol zzso 

zzso were administered either orange juice or orange juice with zzso Blood samples were taken based on zzso and total zzso was isolated from zzso blood zzso The amplified zzso was used in zzso and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso analyses to evaluate differential gene zzso zzso data was analyzed in a pipeline fashion to zzso and zzso and the results evaluated for relative expression across time points with multiple zzso zzso genes showing distinctive expression patterns in response to ethanol were clustered by pattern and further analyzed for related function, zzso membership and common zzso factor binding within and across zzso zzso was used with representative genes to confirm relative transcript levels across time to those detected in zzso 

zzso analysis of samples representing zzso zzso zzso return to zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that changes in gene expression could be detected across the time zzso The expression changes were verified by zzso candidate genes of interest zzso identified from the zzso analysis and clustered by expression pattern across the five zzso points showed seven zzso expressed zzso Analysis showed zzso networks, shared zzso factor binding sites and signaling pathways for members of the zzso These include zzso functions, innate immunity and inflammation functions, zzso functions expected of ethanol zzso and pancreatic and zzso zzso Five of the seven clusters showed links to the zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this study provide a first look at changing gene expression patterns in human blood during an acute rise in blood ethanol concentration and its depletion because of metabolism and zzso and demonstrate that it is possible to detect changes in gene expression using total zzso isolated from whole zzso The analysis approach for this study serves as a zzso to investigate the biology linked to expression changes across a time course and from these changes, to identify target genes that could serve as zzso linked to pilot zzso
