Multiple myeloma zzso is a B cell zzso characterized by bone zzso zzso with zzso plasma zzso IGF-1 zzso has been explored as a therapeutic target in this zzso We analyzed the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with a zzso zzso targeting IGF-1 zzso zzso in human zzso cell zzso We found that zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines which express high levels of zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso the disruption of zzso membrane potential caused by zzso These results support the role of IGF-1 zzso in zzso and suggest that zzso of this zzso could sensitize zzso cells to zzso zzso
