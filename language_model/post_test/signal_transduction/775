Important functions in zzso have been proposed for zzso a member of the zzso growth factor family accumulating almost exclusively in the zzso zzso However, the use of zzso zzso mice gave contradictory results and the role of zzso during zzso remains largely zzso Using zzso mice, we first zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso following zzso injection and showed zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso mice as compared to zzso zzso zzso to examine the function of the zzso family in the zzso process, we used zzso and real-time zzso zzso and Western blots to monitor the expression of the zzso growth factors zzso and zzso their receptors zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of a binding protein zzso in zzso zzso muscles of zzso knockout mice zzso zzso zzso In the zzso both zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso were strongly zzso whereas zzso was zzso strongly suggesting that, in the absence of zzso the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso were zzso specifically by an zzso zzso zzso distinct from the classic mechanism involving zzso and zzso previously described for skeletal muscle zzso The potential regulating role of zzso on zzso expression is also zzso This report shows for the first time a specific role for zzso in the regulation of zzso size during a process of in zzso zzso
