zzso a zzso possesses numerous pharmacological activities, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present study was conducted to explore the zzso potential of zzso against zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso were given a zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso for 30 consecutive zzso with a zzso of zzso (1 zzso body zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso stress zzso serum liver toxicity zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and by the zzso examination of the zzso 

zzso significantly prevented zzso damage as evident from the zzso studies and significant decline in serum zzso The zzso in cellular zzso status zzso and zzso zzso activities together with the enhanced zzso zzso and protein zzso levels were also observed in the zzso zzso In addition, significant zzso generation and zzso zzso were observed in this zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreased the level of serum zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso It also prevented zzso generation and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced the zzso zzso and zzso status and inhibited DNA damage and cell death by preventing the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso release of zzso c and the zzso of zzso zzso 

The conclusion of this study is that zzso when zzso with zzso effectively reduces zzso stress and prevents zzso zzso by zzso critical control points of zzso
