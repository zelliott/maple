zzso zzso play a critical role in the zzso of numerous diseases by producing zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso While the mechanisms of bacterial component recognition and signal zzso have been well investigated, viability regulation in activated zzso remains zzso We screened herbal ingredients to find an agent that reduces the viability of zzso zzso zzso and observed that zzso a component of zzso zzso reduced the viability of zzso zzso cells and primary zzso in the presence of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso membrane potential and induced zzso depletion in zzso zzso but neither affected zzso zzso membrane potential nor zzso content in zzso zzso zzso also prevented increased zzso of zzso and zzso in culture media of zzso zzso zzso of zzso action indicates that elevated zzso membrane potential may be a novel target to specifically reduce viability and suppress zzso production in zzso zzso
