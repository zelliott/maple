The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso have been implicated in the progression of several human zzso and are attractive therapeutic zzso zzso was identified as a zzso orally zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was selective for zzso (and zzso zzso zzso compared with a panel of zzso diverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in zzso zzso values, zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso cell survival or invasion and zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this agent also exhibits zzso zzso zzso showed efficacy at zzso doses, including marked zzso zzso activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity for the full dosing zzso was necessary to maximize the efficacy of zzso Additional zzso studies showed zzso zzso of zzso signal zzso tumor cell proliferation zzso induction of zzso zzso and reduction of zzso density zzso These results indicated that the zzso activity of zzso may be zzso by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as zzso zzso zzso these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting zzso with selective zzso zzso for the treatment of human zzso
