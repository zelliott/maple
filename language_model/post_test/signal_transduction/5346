The zzso signaling zzso regulates cell growth and development in zzso and is therefore of interest for drug zzso By screening a library of zzso zzso marine extracts in a zzso zzso signaling zzso several signaling zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso rapidly identified an active compound from zzso zzso as zzso A, a known zzso zzso Other zzso zzso similarly activated signaling in this zzso indicating zzso zzso will be identified through many zzso reporter zzso In a large scale analysis of zzso zzso three previously zzso zzso based natural products were zzso the structure of one of these was confirmed by zzso Additionally, three other derivatives of zzso A were zzso a mixed zzso and two zzso zzso Finally, evidence to support a structural zzso of zzso I from a zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
