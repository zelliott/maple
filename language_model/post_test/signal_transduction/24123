zzso zzso factor regulates zzso production by binding to a specific zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso expressed on cells of the zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso factor are used clinically to treat zzso As part of an effort to develop zzso zzso factor mimics with the potential for oral zzso we previously identified a zzso small zzso zzso that selectively activates zzso zzso zzso factor signal zzso pathways and promotes zzso formation in zzso To zzso the mechanism of action of zzso a series of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The activity of zzso is strictly dependent on the presence of zinc zzso zzso zzso experiments using a soluble zzso zzso zzso factor zzso construct show that zzso binds to the zzso domain of the zzso in a zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in a manner that is consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso on intact cells, consistent with a mechanism involving zzso zzso These data show that small zzso compounds are capable of selectively binding and inducing productive zzso of zzso zzso
