Multiple zzso signal zzso zzso including zzso zzso and D, can be activated by zzso growth factor zzso in both a protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the zzso of zzso D zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso cells zzso with the full-length zzso zzso In cells zzso with zzso acid or zzso acid, zzso activated a zzso determined by formation of the zzso product zzso in the presence of zzso A zzso zzso activity was seen in zzso zzso cells but not in cells zzso with zzso zzso This zzso activity was zzso by the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and reduced by zzso zzso zzso and was contributed to by zzso as activity could not be zzso following prolonged exposure to zzso zzso known to zzso some zzso zzso By contrast, zzso failed to stimulate formation of zzso in cells zzso with either fatty acid zzso It is proposed that in the zzso condition zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso are linked zzso by a zzso C zzso formation of zzso zzso which activated a zzso zzso zzso but which failed to elicit zzso zzso in these cells is without further effect on zzso
