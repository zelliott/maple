zzso is a major insulin zzso zzso which may play an important role in insulin signal zzso The zzso for zzso in rat cells and zzso is about zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso was zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso Although its calculated molecular mass is 131 zzso zzso from zzso cells migrated between 165 and 170 zzso during sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was zzso strongly on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso before insulin zzso zzso immediately zzso zzso zzso of zzso and after zzso zzso with insulin its apparent molecular mass increased to zzso zzso zzso of the human insulin zzso and rat zzso together in zzso cells increased the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and strongly increased zzso zzso during insulin zzso zzso insulin receptors directly zzso zzso zzso exclusively on zzso zzso By zzso zzso was absent from the nucleus, but otherwise distributed zzso before and after insulin zzso Some zzso associated with the insulin zzso during insulin zzso In addition, a zzso zzso associated with zzso during insulin zzso and this association was more sensitive to insulin in zzso cells zzso the insulin zzso zzso zzso more responsive to insulin to zzso cells, and both sensitive and responsive in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso DNA synthesis was more sensitive to insulin in zzso cells, and more responsive in zzso zzso however, zzso DNA synthesis was sensitive but poorly responsive to insulin in zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a direct zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and may play an important role in insulin signal zzso
