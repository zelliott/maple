Gap junctions are zzso channels organized in plaque that directly link adjacent zzso zzso zzso the zzso proteins of gap junctions are associated with several partner proteins zzso zzso which could participate in plaque formation and zzso zzso and indirect zzso analyses showed that zzso a tight zzso zzso was linked to zzso in the zzso By using zzso zzso known to induce gap junction zzso we demonstrated that zzso increased zzso association within the zzso of treated zzso zzso In control cells, the two proteins were present, as expected, at the plasma membrane level, but poorly zzso The increased zzso zzso complex was associated with a shift towards increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso induced zzso zzso was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that this effect could be zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso These data strongly support a novel role for zzso in the turnover of zzso during gap junction plaque zzso
