zzso proteins drive formation of zzso specialized zzso zzso that influence cell zzso Signaling proteins are proposed to use zzso zzso motifs zzso to associate with zzso via the zzso scaffolding domain zzso However, structural and zzso analyses argue against such direct physical zzso in the majority of signaling zzso the zzso is buried and zzso zzso zzso do not form a common structure for zzso recognition, are not enriched among zzso zzso and are even more common in zzso which lack zzso We propose that zzso interactions are unlikely to mediate zzso zzso and the basis for signaling effects should therefore be zzso
