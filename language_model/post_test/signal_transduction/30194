Nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso promote the function and/or survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso source is commonly thought to be targets of zzso zzso and the possibility that local zzso sources support zzso zzso has not been well zzso These sources, however, may be critical to zzso zzso before or even after they reach their zzso We investigated zzso expression in zzso zzso and its regulation by neural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins were expressed in cultured zzso zzso To investigate roles of zzso signals in zzso regulation, effects of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso These stimuli affected zzso expression zzso zzso increased zzso zzso but did not alter zzso or zzso zzso The effect was blocked by zzso suggesting that it was zzso by zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso levels without changing zzso or zzso zzso were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso increased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso again was zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso reproduced zzso effects, whereas zzso or zzso zzso plus zzso did zzso Lack of antagonism by zzso zzso and blockade of zzso effects by zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso are local sources of zzso for zzso zzso zzso during development and are regulated zzso by specific zzso zzso Critical zzso interactions may zzso zzso zzso zzso
