To determine the role of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of insulin zzso we examined the effect of zzso a zzso zzso on insulin zzso using the isolated zzso rat zzso and freshly isolated zzso In the zzso zzso zzso M zzso significantly enhanced the insulin zzso induced by the combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso In isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso content was significantly increased by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso promoted insulin zzso zzso On the other hand, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso although zzso tended to promote insulin zzso in the presence of zzso alone, it was not zzso To determine if zzso increases zzso content by promoting zzso production or by zzso zzso reduction, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso M zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the effect on zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso insulin zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso in the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso insulin zzso by zzso zzso to increase zzso content, and suggest that zzso zzso insulin zzso by zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso
