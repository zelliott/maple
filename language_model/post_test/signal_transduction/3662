zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells zzso with nerve growth factor zzso We explored the signals required for zzso outgrowth of zzso cells by using a series of zzso of a zzso zzso consisting of the zzso domain of the zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso incapable of zzso the zzso zzso cascade failed to induce zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso showing that zzso of the zzso zzso cascade is essential for the differentiation of zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso that abolished the ability to activate zzso did not zzso but rather zzso zzso zzso This zzso did not require zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso supporting the idea that zzso might regulate the differentiation of zzso cells zzso These results suggest that zzso outgrowth of zzso cells is regulated by the balance of zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso and that zzso activity can be regulated zzso by zzso
