Natural killer cell zzso receptors for major zzso complex zzso class I influence zzso and zzso effects after zzso bone zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso zzso influences the repertoire of zzso zzso In adult zzso mice, the zzso compartment is dominated by cells that express two zzso receptors capable of binding either self or zzso zzso zzso This zzso repertoire has significant functional consequences, because zzso mice fail to reject fully mismatched zzso zzso zzso and show enhanced survival after such zzso Thus, zzso plays an important role in two processes that limit the success of zzso zzso zzso graft rejection and zzso zzso
