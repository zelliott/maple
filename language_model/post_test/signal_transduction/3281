Bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso have shown great promise for zzso tissue zzso However, poor viability of transplanted zzso within zzso zzso has limited their therapeutic zzso zzso an zzso zzso whose level is elevated following zzso has been shown to enhance survival of zzso and zzso cells during zzso We hypothesized that zzso protects zzso from zzso zzso In this paper we determined the potential mechanism of zzso effects using cultured zzso from adult zzso zzso was induced by the specific zzso insult serum deprivation zzso for up to 36 zzso zzso cell death was measured using zzso and Western zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c release, and zzso zzso were largely prevented by zzso The zzso zzso effects were blocked by zzso the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso is a survival factor for zzso and its zzso property may prove to be of therapeutic significance in terms of exploiting zzso transplantation zzso
