Members of the viral zzso zzso protein zzso family prevent induction of zzso by death receptors through zzso of the processing and zzso of zzso and zzso at the level of the zzso zzso signaling complex zzso Here, we have addressed the molecular function of the zzso member zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso powerfully inhibited both zzso and zzso cell death induced by zzso The zzso region of zzso bound zzso zzso factor zzso was necessary for optimal zzso zzso and zzso the recruitment of both zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed impaired zzso of zzso zzso processing and zzso zzso and had reduced zzso zzso Our findings provide evidence that a zzso complex regulates a new aspect of zzso zzso and identify zzso zzso as a zzso that targets multiple features of zzso cell zzso
