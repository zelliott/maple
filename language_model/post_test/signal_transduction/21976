zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso family and controls essential processes such as zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso is triggered by zzso signals such as zzso and environmental zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso functions in zzso recruitment and zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso through zzso while it can either activate or inhibit zzso zzso depending on the cell type and underlying stimulation zzso zzso activities are zzso by zzso interactions with the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso or by zzso of zzso which is the cell surface expressed form of the class II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is dependent on zzso but the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso Here we zzso characterize the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and T cell lines and identify the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso triggered the zzso of zzso and zzso and rapidly activated zzso In T cells, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso led to zzso gene expression of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso involved the upstream zzso zzso and zzso and was found to be dependent on zzso and zzso Together, these data show that the zzso axis mediates a rapid and transient zzso of the zzso zzso as triggered by the inflammatory zzso zzso in T cells and zzso
