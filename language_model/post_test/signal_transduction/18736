The importance of hormones in zzso aging has been displayed by recent studies performed on animal models and zzso To decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in aging we maintained human zzso at defined zzso conditions that corresponded to average serum levels of females from 20 zzso to 60 zzso years of zzso The corresponding hormone zzso expression was demonstrated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso at zzso produced significantly lower lipids than at zzso Increased zzso and protein levels of zzso and increased protein levels of zzso which have been associated with aging, were detected in zzso zzso at zzso compared to those detected at zzso after 5 days of zzso zzso profiling employing a zzso zzso composed of 15 529 zzso identified zzso genes with altered expression levels at zzso zzso zzso Confirmation of gene regulation was performed by real-time zzso The functional zzso of these genes according to the Gene zzso identified pathways related to zzso function, zzso stress, zzso zzso cell cycle, immune responses, steroid zzso and zzso degradation - all hallmarks of zzso Twenty-five genes in common with those identified in aging zzso and several genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases were also zzso This is the first report describing the zzso of human zzso and its modification by a cocktail of hormones administered in zzso levels and provides an in zzso model system, which zzso some of the zzso changes in gene zzso that occur during aging in zzso
