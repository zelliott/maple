zzso acid and zzso acid, geometric and zzso zzso of zzso acid were previously shown to possess potent zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso acid and zzso acid could induce zzso and suppress invasion of human zzso zzso cells in zzso Treatment with zzso acid and zzso acid significantly increased zzso stress in human zzso zzso cells detected by the level of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effects of antioxidants zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso stress activated the zzso of zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso blocked the zzso induced by zzso acid and zzso acid by zzso zzso ratio and zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also partially zzso the cell invasion effects of zzso acid and zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso acid and zzso acid induced zzso and inhibited invasion in zzso cells by zzso of zzso stress pathways and subsequent zzso of zzso
