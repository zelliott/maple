The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by protein zzso and zzso is the major mechanism for the zzso of zzso signals in zzso zzso zzso pathways often comprise multiple zzso steps and a long-standing hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that of the protein zzso zzso in which a signal is amplified as it is passed from one step in a zzso to the zzso This review represents a zzso of this hypothesis, using the zzso network in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso function as an example, but drawing also on the related zzso systems involving zzso itself in zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso In plants, the zzso family comprises not only zzso but also two other zzso zzso and zzso with a total of 38 members in the model plant zzso This may have occurred to enable linking of zzso and stress zzso It is concluded that zzso pathways comprise multiple levels not to allow for signal amplification, but to enable linking between pathways to form networks in which key protein zzso zzso and target zzso factors represent hubs zzso which multiple pathways zzso and zzso
