zzso zzso activated by zzso play critical roles in the functional regulation of medium zzso zzso in the zzso However, the zzso zzso signaling pathways are not fully zzso due to their zzso In this study, we investigated the function of zzso receptors in the zzso by monitoring zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso (the zzso using mouse zzso zzso Treatment of slices with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly and zzso increased zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was completely abolished either by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic deletion of zzso zzso zzso toxins for zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas it was enhanced by zzso Analysis in zzso transgenic mice revealed that zzso increases zzso zzso selectively in zzso but not in zzso zzso When zzso and zzso receptors were blocked by selective zzso to exclude the effects of released zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso only in zzso zzso This increase required zzso of zzso receptors and was dependent upon zzso zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso especially zzso zzso act at zzso zzso zzso regulate the release of zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso and activate zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso receptors and activate zzso zzso
