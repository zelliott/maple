Loss of zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso is an evident and debilitating feature of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso We recently demonstrated involvement of the inflammatory classical zzso zzso in zzso zzso in muscle zzso The exact underlying mechanisms however are zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the alternative zzso zzso was recently identified as a novel positive regulator of skeletal muscle zzso We zzso that zzso classical zzso zzso contributes to loss of muscle zzso in COPD by reducing zzso zzso 

Classical zzso zzso was activated zzso or by zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso in cultured zzso and the impact on muscle zzso and zzso levels was zzso Moreover, the alternative zzso zzso was modulated to investigate the impact on muscle zzso in absence or presence of an inflammatory zzso As a proof of concept, zzso muscle zzso of COPD patients and healthy controls were zzso for expression levels of zzso zzso markers and zzso 

zzso zzso in cultured zzso decreased expression of zzso markers and key zzso zzso Moreover, classical zzso zzso (both by zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso levels and zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso in muscle zzso zzso muscle zzso protein abundance and zzso was reduced in COPD patients compared to controls, which was more pronounced in patients with increased muscle zzso zzso zzso 

Classical zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso reductions in muscle zzso may accelerate muscle zzso deterioration in zzso
