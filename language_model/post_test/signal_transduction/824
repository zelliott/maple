The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene transcript and salicylic acid zzso and enhanced resistance to bacterial and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is a dwarf and spontaneously develops zzso containing dead zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso also zzso enhanced resistance to zzso mosaic virus zzso Compared with the zzso plant, viral zzso and systemic spread were diminished in the zzso zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso resistance to bacterial and zzso zzso the zzso enhanced resistance to zzso was retained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso application was not effective in limiting zzso zzso and systemic spread in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso which, like the zzso zzso accumulate elevated zzso levels, zzso express the zzso zzso spontaneously develop zzso containing dead cells, and are zzso are, however, fully susceptible to zzso Our results suggest that zzso cell death, and zzso zzso of zzso signaling are not important for the zzso enhanced resistance to zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso which affect zzso zzso suppress the zzso enhanced resistance to zzso thus implicating a zzso or lipids in the zzso resistance to zzso Interestingly, the zzso resistance to zzso was compromised in the zzso zzso plant, suggesting the involvement of an zzso zzso mechanism in the zzso resistance to zzso
