The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is known to activate distinct zzso zzso zzso In rat zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso but not zzso receptors mediate the zzso zzso of zzso concentration of zzso zzso and are zzso coupled to zzso zzso In the present study, zzso mechanisms zzso distinct zzso receptors to their specific functional role were investigated with the use of both zzso zzso with well-known affinity at individual zzso receptors and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso receptors are coupled to distinct signaling pathways in zzso zzso In particular, zzso receptors are zzso coupled to the zzso zzso and this zzso is partially responsible for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso and zzso receptors are both coupled to a decrease of zzso acid zzso release with an efficacy similar to that of zzso suggesting that zzso reduces AA release through either a partial zzso of both receptors or the zzso of one at a zzso This finding is important given the zzso role for zzso zzso zzso as a positive signaling component in zzso pathways of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso negative zzso to zzso pathways does not seem to be implicated in the zzso zzso of zzso The possible role for the zzso zzso of AA release in zzso cell function remains to be zzso
