zzso zzso receive extensive zzso projections, and form the primary input to the zzso via the zzso zzso The zzso cells of origin for the zzso zzso are distinguished by their expression of zzso a zzso involved in learning and synaptic zzso The functional significance of zzso signaling within the zzso cortex, however, remains zzso To determine whether interrupting zzso zzso signaling might have consequences for learning and memory, we administered zzso zzso protein zzso into the lateral zzso zzso zzso of young zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso from binding to its zzso and we verified the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso the zzso state of zzso zzso signaling target, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was associated with impaired performance in the zzso version of the water zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso signaling induced a localized loss of synaptic marker expression in the zzso These observations support a role for zzso zzso signaling in spatial learning, and suggest that an intact zzso signaling zzso is essential for synaptic integrity in the adult zzso zzso
