We earlier showed that vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from spontaneously zzso rats zzso exhibit increased expression of zzso zzso Since the levels of zzso zzso are enhanced in zzso from zzso we undertook the present study to examine the implication of zzso zzso and the underlying mechanisms in the enhanced expression of zzso proteins in zzso from zzso The enhanced expression of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso from zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso zzso In addition, these zzso also attenuated the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by low zzso of zzso and by zzso hormones in zzso from zzso compared to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso and zzso respectively, inhibited the enhanced expression of zzso protein and the enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso from zzso to zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso a scavenger of zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso from zzso to control zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso from zzso was attenuated by zzso and zzso growth factor receptors zzso and zzso These results suggest that the enhanced levels of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso increase zzso stress, which through zzso zzso of growth factor receptors and associated zzso zzso zzso contribute to the enhanced expression of zzso zzso
