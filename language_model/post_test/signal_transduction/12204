Water zzso and corresponding zzso drought stress is one of the most important factors limiting plant performance and zzso In addition, plant productivity is severely compromised worldwide by infection with microbial zzso Two of the most prominent pathways responsible for drought tolerance and disease resistance to zzso pathogens in zzso are those controlled by the zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on the functional characterization of zzso a zzso regulator from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits both drought resistance and enhanced disease resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these two resistance zzso have different genetic zzso Whereas drought tolerance in zzso is zzso but zzso the opposite holds true for the enhanced disease resistance zzso These observations lead us to propose a regulatory role of zzso in the zzso responses to these two zzso functioning as a zzso of independent and specific aspects of the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
