zzso zzso is a major cause of infectious zzso of chronic zzso lung zzso In pulmonary zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays a pivotal role in orchestrating airway zzso The present study demonstrated that protein zzso zzso was activated by zzso infection and positively regulated zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was found to be dependent on expression of the zzso ubiquitous surface protein zzso In addition, it was shown that specific zzso of zzso play differential roles in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene expression through controlling zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with chemical zzso or using short interfering zzso gene zzso significantly zzso whereas zzso of zzso increased, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, it was shown that zzso zzso infection activates protein zzso C and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso regulate zzso zzso in human pulmonary zzso zzso
