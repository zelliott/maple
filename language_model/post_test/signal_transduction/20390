zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation during zzso which is zzso in most of human zzso tumors and may act as an zzso The aim of the current study was to investigate the mechanism of zzso involved in the zzso zzso resistance in human gastric cancer cells in zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso greater resistance to zzso compared with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and protein expression levels were significantly higher in zzso than in zzso To gain a deeper insight into the role of zzso in zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso with viral zzso expressing zzso Our result showed that zzso resistance type I zzso was found in zzso not in zzso by zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso zzso was found in zzso not in zzso by Western zzso regardless of zzso zzso We investigated whether an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso would change the drug resistance zzso with zzso zzso Western zzso results showed the zzso of zzso protein zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell by zzso zzso accompanied with drug resistance to zzso although the level of zzso and zzso protein expression did not change, so our results suggested that zzso which can activate zzso and zzso by zzso induced the zzso resistance in gastric cancer zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms, driving zzso zzso resistance, will provide benefits in developing new therapies for gastric zzso
