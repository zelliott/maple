zzso levels of CO2 and temperature can both affect plant growth and development, but the zzso pathways regulating these processes are still zzso zzso function to silence gene zzso and environmental stresses can alter their zzso Here we zzso using the small zzso method, zzso that change significantly in expression by either doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration or by increasing temperature zzso zzso nearly all zzso zzso are affected zzso by elevated zzso Using the zzso method, we determine strongly correlated expression changes between zzso and zzso and their target zzso factors under elevated CO2 zzso Similar correlations are also found for zzso acting in zzso stress responses and potential cell wall zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that both CO2 and temperature alter zzso expression to affect zzso growth and development, and zzso and zzso zzso network might zzso the onset of early flowering induced by increasing zzso
