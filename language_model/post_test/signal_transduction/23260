Although most smooth muscles express a greater density of zzso than zzso zzso zzso based on the potency of zzso selective zzso zzso antagonists, the zzso zzso predominantly mediates zzso The effect of zzso of putative zzso signal zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso was determined in zzso zzso mice and mice lacking either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso then increasing zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso contraction was not different between zzso The zzso response was unaffected in the zzso strain but decreased zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso potency was high in both zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso and low in the zzso strain, suggesting zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso had no zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso with zzso decreased zzso contraction in all zzso zzso zzso in the zzso strain were decreased zzso by the protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso strains were decreased by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso activates zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso while the zzso zzso activates ROCK and either zzso or zzso zzso These studies suggest that multiple parallel pathways mediate zzso zzso in stomach body smooth zzso
