Several of the genes currently known to be zzso when zzso with mental zzso code for molecules directly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These include zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso family, which are important zzso of small zzso In many systems, zzso zzso play crucial roles regulating complex mechanisms such as cell migration, zzso or zzso Their precise functions in the central nervous system remain, however, zzso Although their activity does not seem to be required for normal brain development, several recent studies point to a possible involvement in more subtle mechanisms such as zzso zzso spine zzso or zzso formation, and zzso This article reviews this information in the light of the current knowledge available on the molecular characteristics of the different members of this family and discuss the mechanisms through which they might contribute to cognitive zzso
