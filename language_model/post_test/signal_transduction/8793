Lung zzso strips isolated from zzso rats manifest a mast zzso zzso contraction when challenged with zzso The first phase is zzso by the release of zzso zzso while the second phase is dependent on de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is readily generated in mast cells and has been demonstrated to be an important regulator of zzso mast cell zzso We have used the zzso strip to explore the role of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the two components of the acute response to zzso Lung zzso strips were prepared from Brown Norway rats actively zzso to zzso The strips were set up in organ baths and zzso responses measured zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso both zzso of the zzso response induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects were seen at zzso similar to those which inhibit the zzso zzso and were selective in that neither the zzso response to zzso nor that to zzso was zzso zzso (a selective zzso zzso zzso also blocked the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso required zzso were substantially higher than its affinity for the zzso receptors zzso However, when tested against a lower concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the response with zzso zzso These data demonstrate the importance of zzso and the zzso zzso as regulators of zzso zzso of mast cells in their natural environment in the rat zzso
