zzso zzso depends upon zzso and an appropriate zzso zzso whose polarity is relevant for zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Here we have studied qualitative and quantitative aspects of zzso participation in controls of the zzso required to sustain zzso We zzso zzso zzso expression and shedding by two primary liver zzso cell cultures isolated from wild type and zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso The latter one has a higher capacity to sustain zzso zzso zzso growth zzso cell line was used as the reporter system, monitoring the cell survival and proliferation that reflect the zzso and the activity of zzso Although the two zzso cells zzso the same zzso their relative content was quite zzso zzso proliferation decreased in cultures in which zzso synthesis was inhibited in the zzso as well as in presence of zzso cell zzso in which zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reverted the zzso and sustained proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells do not accumulate zzso but they are able to take up the zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a double role in sustaining zzso providing both growth zzso and zzso required for the optimal stimulation of the zzso cell zzso and the zzso zzso zzso controls of zzso are zzso for this cell zzso
