Heat stroke zzso is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome zzso consisting of profound core temperature zzso changes in zzso zzso is common at HS collapse, but inflammatory changes occurring in the brain during the zzso remain zzso We determined the association between inflammatory gene expression changes in the brain with zzso disturbances during HS recovery in zzso Gene expression changes of heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso were examined in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of control zzso zzso zzso and HS mice at zzso zzso zzso depth zzso zzso zzso zzso and fever zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only) were the only genes that showed increased expression at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was highest at HD and similar to controls during zzso zzso expression was unaffected by zzso whereas HD was associated with approximately zzso increase in zzso expression zzso zzso zzso expression was not increased during fever and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on this zzso response indicating fever is regulated by other inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at HD coincided with zzso zzso and zzso expression suggesting zzso cells are a possible source of brain zzso and zzso during HS zzso The inflammatory gene expression changes during HS recovery suggest zzso and/or zzso may be initiating development or zzso from hypothermia, whereas fever zzso remain to be zzso
