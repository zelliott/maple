The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the zzso and zzso effects of zzso a novel analog of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso was found to inhibit cell growth in a zzso and zzso manner, and inhibit cell cycle progression by inducing the arrest of the zzso phase and zzso in zzso zzso When treated with 3 zzso zzso inhibited proliferation associated with zzso induction was found in the zzso cells in a concentration and zzso manner, and nuclear zzso zzso revealed the typical nuclear features of zzso Furthermore, zzso induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase through the zzso zzso of the zzso protein at zzso and zzso of its downstream target gene zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso cells by way of zzso arrest and zzso in association with the regulation of multiple molecules in the cell cycle zzso
