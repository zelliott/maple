zzso of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso is regulated by two interconnected zzso zzso the zzso zzso induction zzso and the zzso zzso repression zzso The zzso and zzso zzso sensors in the membrane generate a signal in the presence of zzso that zzso the functions of zzso and zzso zzso proteins that regulate the function of the zzso zzso factor, which binds to the zzso zzso It is well established that zzso zzso degradation of zzso but the fate of its zzso zzso has been less zzso We present evidence that zzso degradation of zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is obscured by feedback regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso is accelerated when zzso induction of zzso expression due to feedback regulation by zzso is zzso The consequence of zzso feedback regulation of zzso expression is that zzso of repression of zzso expression upon removal of zzso is zzso In contrast, degradation of zzso is reinforced by zzso repression of zzso expression: disappearance of zzso is slowed when zzso repression of zzso expression is zzso and this results in a delay in induction of zzso expression in response to zzso Thus, the cellular levels of zzso and zzso and, as a consequence, the zzso of induction and repression of zzso gene zzso are closely regulated by interwoven zzso and zzso controls zzso by two different zzso zzso
