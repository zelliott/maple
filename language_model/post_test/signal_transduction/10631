zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant inherited zzso zzso of zzso zzso ducts is one of the major zzso To explore the molecular mechanism by which zzso in the human zzso 1 gene zzso zzso zzso causes liver zzso we investigated the gene regulation of zzso to zzso growth factor gene zzso By zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso cells in zzso we found that zzso is a target gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso expression and zzso zzso relieve the zzso Several domain disruptions in zzso zzso protein reveal a reduced zzso to zzso expression at different zzso zzso zzso actually result in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso controls zzso expression by a zzso regulation and zzso signaling seems to mediate zzso zzso Given that zzso plays a critical role in differentiation of zzso stem cells, zzso of zzso acts on zzso cell fate determination in zzso zzso zzso stem cells may differentiate towards more zzso but less zzso cells, thus causing the paucity of zzso zzso ducts in liver development of zzso Our novel findings demonstrated that zzso regulation by zzso of zzso is a fundamental mechanism for liver zzso in zzso
