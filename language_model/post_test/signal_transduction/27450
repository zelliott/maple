Previous studies have indicated that zzso behaves as an zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1993; zzso et zzso zzso In the present study, Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso form of zzso zzso was present at a high level in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cells also exhibited a marked increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the significance of these findings, dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso expressed in early passage control and zzso zzso zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso negative zzso expressing clones exhibited a flat zzso a decreased zzso density, and decreased growth in soft zzso In addition, these reverted clones exhibited decreased zzso zzso zzso In contrast, dominant negative zzso expressing clones remained highly zzso In addition, zzso was detected in zzso zzso indicating that zzso forms a complex with zzso in zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso functions as an zzso in zzso cells by enhancing zzso of the zzso zzso
