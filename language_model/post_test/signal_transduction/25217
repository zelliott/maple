Small molecules that zzso specific protein functions are valuable tools for zzso complex signaling zzso Here, we identified a small zzso that zzso the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso by stimulating all the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso This compound stimulates zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which is a member of a family of proteins involved in zzso signaling zzso zzso with this, zzso activates zzso in addition to zzso and zzso for the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso activates zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together with previous zzso these results zzso that, for the assembly of an zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso and zzso through the zzso pathway, whereas it can induce zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, specific zzso family proteins may be able to integrate some of multiple signal zzso pathways leading to the specific zzso of the zzso zzso
