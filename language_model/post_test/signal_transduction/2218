The zzso zzso zzso is the second member of a putative larger class of zzso activated receptors that mediate cell zzso events by zzso zzso or synthetic zzso corresponding to the newly generated zzso To further study the previously identified zzso effects of zzso we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso for generation of stable cell lines expressing zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only zzso cells expressing either zzso or zzso zzso exhibited zzso responses when grown in zzso media supplemented with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was dose dependent with an zzso of approximately 80 zzso sustained at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and was also zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso shares approximately zzso zzso with zzso zzso shown to activate zzso we studied zzso expressed forms of zzso and zzso as candidate zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was present as a sharp peak at Mr approximately zzso confirming the presence of zzso and functionally active zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were evident using either zzso form of zzso with zzso responses seen at approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient for zzso because active zzso zzso failed to induce this response, and zzso responses were zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso These results specifically identify both forms of mast cell zzso as zzso zzso zzso for zzso and have implications for zzso molecular mechanisms regulating cellular zzso events zzso by zzso generated during zzso zzso or zzso zzso
