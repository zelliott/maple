Alzheimer's disease zzso chiefly characterizes a progressively neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, and eventually leads to irreversible loss of intellectual zzso The zzso zzso zzso is believed to be the main pathological mechanism of zzso and zzso production zzso or its clearance promotion is one of the promising therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso Here, we report that the natural product zzso from zzso zzso zzso can both inhibit zzso production by suppressing zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso 1 expression and promote zzso clearance by enhancing zzso through zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso as investigated in cells and zzso transgenic zzso model zzso Moreover, the results showing that treatment of zzso in mice highly decreased zzso formation and senile plaques and efficiently ameliorated zzso mouse memory impairment strongly highlight the potential of zzso in zzso drug zzso
