Our previous work revealed transforming growth factor zzso zzso gene zzso are associated with zzso to zzso zzso and liver zzso However, no further study of functional substitution in zzso cells has yet been zzso 

This study was designed to uncover the functional mechanisms of zzso gene zzso in the zzso of liver zzso 

Two zzso zzso expression plasmids containing zzso zzso 10 zzso variation were constructed with zzso promoter and zzso into human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and immortalized zzso zzso The zzso capacities of zzso protein in the zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso activity, and expression of CD 105, zzso and zzso were also measured by use of flow zzso 

The zzso results showed that cells zzso with zzso were more capable of zzso zzso than those zzso with zzso zzso zzso was more zzso and induced more proliferation than zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso expression of zzso 

zzso gene zzso variation in signal zzso has significant effects on zzso zzso and functions in zzso zzso
