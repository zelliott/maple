zzso treatment strategies for patients with zzso brain tumors have resulted in only small gains in terms of prognosis in spite of the use of aggressive zzso There is a growing realization that a paradigm shift is needed in the conceptual approaches to zzso zzso Such approaches will rely on identification and modification of key cellular targets that define the biological behavior of these zzso Among the targets for such treatment approaches, tumor zzso has captured the attention of not only the medical field but also of the lay public because of its conceptual departure from traditional methods of cancer zzso zzso and vascular proliferation are particularly important in the growth and progression of zzso zzso and are used as indicators of the degree of zzso Recent studies have helped us gain a better understanding of the molecular zzso of this zzso It is now evident that after the initial formation of zzso the continued growth of a zzso is critically dependent on its zzso zzso zzso several approaches to control zzso are being developed and zzso zzso results from clinical studies have shown that zzso zzso is a valid approach as a therapeutic strategy against zzso but it is also becoming evident that zzso of individual zzso of this process may not yield the expected impact on zzso To fully realize the potential of zzso therapy, a deeper understanding of the interplay between the tumor zzso and its environment is zzso zzso zzso have made the transition from zzso studies to the clinical zzso it remains for ongoing human trials of such agents to fully explore the feasibility and efficacy of these agents in order to exploit the potential of this zzso
