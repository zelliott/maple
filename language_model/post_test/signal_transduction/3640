Despite the fact that zzso cells are not zzso for human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection, several investigators have constructed transgenic zzso mice to model zzso diseases to overcome this zzso The generation of zzso mice expressing selected zzso genes revealed that zzso harbors a major disease zzso zzso zzso protein is a molecular adapter able to interact with several cellular partners, interfering with cellular zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice was extensively characterized regarding in zzso development of zzso disease and the effects of zzso expression in T zzso but the functions eventually corrupted by zzso in zzso and zzso were less zzso zzso treatment of human zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the protein and zzso the production and zzso of different zzso and zzso by zzso specific zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso Therefore we set up an in zzso zzso zzso model using stabilized cell lines and primary zzso zzso and treated them with zzso zzso zzso zzso Like human cells, zzso zzso responded to zzso treatment, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is mandatory for the synthesis and release of a pool of zzso and zzso including zzso that induce zzso zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso and zzso manner, confirming that zzso zzso respond to zzso similarly to human zzso These data extend the results previously obtained in human primary zzso allowing the use of zzso cells in culture to study signaling events modulated by zzso in zzso zzso In particular, it may be feasible to use zzso derived from mice knocked out in specific signaling zzso to obtain greater insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
