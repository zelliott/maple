zzso transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso has been reported to be directly influenced by the frequency of mechanical zzso This study explored the effects of different zzso of mechanical strain on expression of zzso marker zzso and the possible zzso zzso were subjected to zzso strains of zzso zzso at 1 and 2 zzso for 24 h by using a zzso strain zzso The protein expression of zzso was assessed by Western zzso and the possible protein zzso involved were evaluated by their specific inhibitor or targeted zzso zzso The results showed that zzso strains modulated the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor alpha zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso change of zzso expression could be blocked by a specific zzso zzso zzso The changed expression of zzso induced by the zzso of zzso strain was reversed by targeted zzso zzso of zzso while enhanced by targeted zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression of zzso under zzso strain is zzso at least partly by the regulation of zzso and zzso alpha expression on the zzso of zzso zzso
