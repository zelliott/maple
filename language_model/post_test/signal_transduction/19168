zzso signaling regulates essential biological processes ranging from zzso to zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that positively zzso zzso zzso An important step in understanding the mechanism of action of zzso is identifying its interacting proteins in the zzso zzso In this study, we used a series of zzso and functional zzso to investigate the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein 6 zzso Here, we report that, contrary to previous studies, zzso interacts with zzso and zzso However, zzso did not interact with, or alter expression of, zzso zzso protein zzso did not alter the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso our data establish that zzso proteins are novel binding partners of zzso and suggest a mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso
