This is the first report that characterizes specific inhibitor of zzso zzso as a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso zzso In the reporter zzso the increased zzso activity of zzso by the zzso of zzso active form of zzso was zzso by the treatment with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso attenuated the transforming growth factor zzso zzso of zzso and interaction of zzso with zzso On the other hand, this zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso zzso we evaluated the ability of zzso in the suppression of the zzso type I zzso zzso in human zzso zzso We found that the addition of zzso attenuated the effects of zzso by reducing the zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso differentiation of zzso by zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso completely diminished the zzso zzso of zzso as well as the zzso type I collagen expression in zzso zzso Together, our study suggested that zzso is a useful tool to evaluate the zzso cellular mechanisms via selective zzso of zzso
