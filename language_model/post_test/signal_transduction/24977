zzso zzso zzso is assumed to be involved in the regulation of many zzso signaling systems including calcium wave zzso So far all supportive evidence is zzso such as monitoring changes in zzso calcium on application of zzso zzso or off-site measurement of zzso from zzso Furthermore, the zzso relationships among the various signaling agents are still zzso A novel zzso dynamic imaging method was developed to monitor zzso release from living biological zzso The zzso has linear response over 3 orders of magnitude for fixed zzso of zzso and zzso with a correlation zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso is down to zzso M at zzso exposure times with an intensified zzso device zzso The direct imaging of zzso waves in zzso cultures was performed together with zzso imaging at zzso zzso resolution and zzso spatial zzso We discovered that zzso zzso mediates zzso calcium wave zzso but surprisingly, release and propagation of zzso are not calcium zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso or zzso is the primary zzso signaling zzso
