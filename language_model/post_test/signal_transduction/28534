zzso zzso factor zzso cell signaling occurs following sequential binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso then to the zzso zzso used by all members of the zzso family of zzso By zzso displaying human zzso on the surface of zzso zzso and zzso clusters of zzso in regions predicted to be important for human zzso zzso we have identified zzso which lead to significant increases in affinity for binding to zzso Six libraries were constructed in which regions of 4-6 zzso acids were zzso then panned against zzso zzso identified in three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave rise to proteins with significantly increased affinity for binding to both human and mouse zzso Combining the zzso for each of these regions further increased the zzso such that the best zzso bound to human zzso with zzso higher affinity than zzso human zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso did not alter the overall structure of the zzso relative to the native zzso although some local changes occurred in the vicinity of the zzso zzso Despite increases in zzso binding zzso these zzso did not show any increase in activity as zzso of zzso proliferation of zzso cells expressing human zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of two additional zzso zzso and zzso which were found to abrogate cell zzso led to the generation of highly potent zzso of both human and zzso zzso zzso
