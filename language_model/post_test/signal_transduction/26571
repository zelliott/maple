To investigate the combination of conventional zzso zzso agents and a small zzso zzso inhibitor in zzso models of zzso lung cancer zzso 

We compared the induction of zzso by zzso zzso drugs and zzso a predominantly protein zzso C zzso small zzso zzso in six zzso cell lines of different zzso and genetic zzso The outcome of various combinations and schedules of zzso agents and zzso was zzso and zzso were zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was applied to specifically target zzso signal zzso in combination with drug zzso 

Resistance of zzso cells to DNA zzso zzso was mainly determined at the zzso step of the intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited the growth factor signal zzso but failed to induce zzso in zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso Combining conventional zzso drugs with zzso at different doses and schedules resulted in unpredictable zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, conditional expression of zzso reliably zzso drug-resistant zzso cells to zzso induced by zzso agents or zzso 

Combining zzso zzso drugs with a zzso inhibitor of growth and survival factor signaling in zzso may result in unpredictable treatment zzso In contrast, targeting specific death zzso mechanisms, such as zzso signal zzso is a promising strategy to sensitize zzso to zzso agents or zzso zzso
