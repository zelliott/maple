zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function is hypothesized to contribute to the heightened zzso to infection and zzso inflammation in term and zzso zzso clinically evident in zzso zzso and increased rates of inflammatory zzso Current data indicate that zzso zzso expression in term zzso equals adult expression patterns, while expression in zzso infants seems to increase, depending on zzso zzso Regarding zzso zzso some studies suggest zzso incompetence in zzso associated with impaired zzso responses, others describe zzso zzso function well developed and zzso to its zzso zzso We discuss the competing positions and considerable limitations of research approaches and conclude that zzso innate immunity is not generally less able to respond to zzso zzso Moreover, we describe zzso factors other than zzso having a comparable zzso In the long term, better understanding of the complex interplay of zzso and zzso conditions and zzso zzso zzso function may provide new therapeutic zzso
