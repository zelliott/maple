In tomato, the zzso resistance zzso protein zzso acts in concert with the zzso or zzso zzso to determine immunity against zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso defense signaling is initiated by the recognition of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by tomato zzso or zzso zzso detects these interactions and activates signaling leading to host defense responses including localized programmed cell death zzso that is associated with the arrest of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso at zzso in the zzso motif zzso zzso in the zzso domain cause zzso zzso when zzso expressed in leaves of zzso zzso suggesting zzso plays an important role in zzso of zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso and the zzso domain are required for this zzso zzso cell death signaling but zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso zzso an zzso form of zzso zzso or zzso completely suppresses zzso However, the zzso zzso does not interfere with zzso caused by zzso a distinct R zzso zzso signaling event, or that caused by zzso of zzso a protein acting downstream of zzso Furthermore, we found the zzso protein is unable to accumulate in plant cells when zzso with the zzso zzso domain, likely explaining the cell death zzso The mechanism for the zzso degradation of zzso is unknown but may involve interference in the zzso interactions of zzso or to binding of the zzso zzso to other host proteins that are needed for zzso zzso
