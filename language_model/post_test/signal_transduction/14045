zzso zzso are zzso of the cell membrane with distinct protein composition and high zzso of cholesterol and zzso zzso proteins are thought to mediate diverse cellular processes including signal zzso However, its cellular mechanisms remain zzso zzso zzso marker protein of zzso has been thought as a zzso between zzso zzso zzso stimuli and zzso zzso zzso is another zzso expressed raft protein which defines zzso raft zzso zzso zzso Its cellular function is largely zzso Our novel studies demonstrated that zzso in conjunction with zzso played important functions on controlling cell death via regulating zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells, we found that in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso via preventing zzso zzso zzso signaling complex zzso formation, subsequently suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reduced the zzso zzso intrinsic zzso by regulating the zzso family and suppressing zzso C release from zzso to zzso zzso further modulated the common zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso via zzso the members in the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and limited its zzso Taken together, we found that zzso protected cells from zzso induced zzso and zzso the zzso effects of zzso Thus, zzso played crucial functions in cellular zzso and cell survival, suggesting a differential role of individual raft zzso
