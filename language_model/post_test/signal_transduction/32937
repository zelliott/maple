We report here that at least one major zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso mouse eggs but becomes fully activated during early development following zzso zzso zzso h zzso exhibited a marked zzso zzso upon external zzso zzso which is indicative of active zzso zzso in contrast to the very small response observed in zzso In addition, zzso of zzso from eggs upon external zzso removal was much slower than that from zzso indicating additional pathways for zzso to cross the plasma membrane in zzso Furthermore, while zzso quickly recovered from an induced zzso eggs exhibited only a slow, incomplete zzso Following in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity was first zzso about 4 h zzso and reached the zzso level after about 8 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso activity after zzso appeared to occur by zzso of existing, inactive zzso rather than by synthesis or transport of new zzso as the increase in activity following zzso was unaffected by zzso of protein synthesis or by disruption of the zzso apparatus or the zzso This zzso may depend on the zzso zzso which follow zzso as suppression of these zzso using the zzso zzso zzso reduced subsequent zzso of zzso zzso activity by about zzso zzso of zzso systems may be a widespread feature of the earliest period of embryonic development, not restricted to species such as marine zzso as previously zzso
