The zzso signal zzso zzso mediates important cellular functions through direct zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity can lead to an altered cell proliferation and has been linked to many human zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a ubiquitous zzso regulates several cellular processes by zzso proteins involved in signal zzso gene zzso and protein zzso In this report we identify zzso as a novel target of zzso by zzso Using mapping and zzso studies, we identified zzso zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso as the target zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso 1901 by zzso appears to generate a second zzso site at zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 1898 zzso only occurs when zzso forms a complex with zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso 1898 and zzso 1901 resulted in decreased binding of the zzso zzso complex to DNA and consequently lower zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso of zzso 1901 and zzso 1898 zzso regulates zzso function by zzso the complex from zzso This study identifies a new component involved in regulation of zzso zzso activity, reinforcing the notion that a precise and tight regulation is required for this essential signaling zzso
