zzso plays a significant role in the development of zzso zzso by zzso the zzso effects of transforming growth factor zzso and has been shown to be zzso zzso in human breast cancer zzso It has been suggested that zzso is an important underlying cause for the development of zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso One of the key zzso of the cell's response to lowered oxygen environments is zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso factor, which enables cells to adapt to zzso by regulating the expression of genes involved in increasing oxygen availability zzso zzso and enhancing zzso zzso and metabolism zzso zzso In this paper, we have used primary zzso zzso cell cultures from a zzso knockout zzso model to further zzso the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso response elements present upstream of zzso enable direct interaction of zzso zzso factor with the zzso promoter, resulting in increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso were incapable of inducing zzso zzso in response to zzso suggesting an absolute requirement of zzso Furthermore, the observed zzso hypoxic stimulation of zzso expression was found to occur independently of zzso zzso Our findings have important implications for a number of zzso disorders in which zzso zzso and zzso are involved, including zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso
