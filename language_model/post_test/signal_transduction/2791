Ten percent to zzso of potential cardiac donors with brain injury and no previous cardiac history have zzso zzso We assessed components of the zzso zzso complex as well as the zzso response in 10 zzso acutely failing human hearts zzso heart dysfunction zzso and compared the results with 13 zzso zzso zzso organ donor zzso 

As measured by zzso all zzso hearts exhibited a decreased zzso fraction (16 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso Although total and zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso were similar in the zzso and zzso groups, zzso hearts exhibited a zzso decrease in maximum zzso zzso zzso activity and a 50% decrease in the zzso response to zzso zzso hearts also exhibited decreases in zzso zzso zzso stimulation by zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso versus 295 zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but there was no significant decrease in zzso zzso stimulation by zzso a direct zzso of zzso zzso Right zzso zzso removed from zzso hearts exhibited a profound decrease in the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso versus 22 zzso 2 zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as reduced calcium responses zzso zzso zzso zzso versus 14 zzso 3 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso examination of two hearts revealed some zzso evidence suggestive of zzso injury, but there was no difference in tissue zzso zzso activity between the two zzso 

Compared with zzso hearts, zzso hearts exhibit marked zzso of beta zzso and beta zzso receptors from zzso zzso and zzso response stimulation as well as decreased intrinsic zzso zzso Thus, acute zzso dysfunction accompanying brain injury is characterized by marked zzso in zzso signal zzso as well as changes in the zzso apparatus, and this profile is markedly different from what occurs in the chronically failing human zzso
