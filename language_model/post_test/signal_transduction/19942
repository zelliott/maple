The type II zzso zzso zzso are key zzso of zzso zzso involved in cell zzso survival, and zzso Using a zzso approach, we discovered that type II zzso are regulated by an zzso zzso zzso motif centered on a critical zzso zzso and that this regulation occurs independently of zzso loop zzso We determined six X-ray crystal structures of either full-length zzso or its zzso domain, that demonstrate the molecular basis for zzso binding to the active state with zzso zzso zzso We show that full-length zzso is zzso zzso but zzso of the zzso releases this zzso and causes increased zzso of the zzso regulation protein zzso zzso causing cell death and cellular zzso zzso We also find that zzso is regulated by the zzso region, indicating a common type II zzso zzso zzso Finally, we find zzso zzso but not zzso zzso can activate zzso We provide a unique understanding for type II zzso zzso
