The present experiment demonstrates that the exposure of zzso II zzso produced an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso level in rat cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted a marked increase of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The maximum increase was observed at 3 zzso of zzso stimulation and lasted 3 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was antagonized by zzso an zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso an zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that the increase in zzso zzso zzso is zzso via zzso zzso This increase is blocked by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid, but not by the zzso zzso inhibitor sodium zzso thus suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso and zzso C, did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso In addition, calcium zzso zzso had no zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso is regulated by the activity of zzso zzso in the cortical zzso This observation is also the first example concerning the regulation of zzso zzso within the zzso
