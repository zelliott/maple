zzso have two distinct zzso zzso systems, the main zzso system and the zzso system zzso zzso by certain zzso zzso the main zzso system is present in all groups of zzso while the zzso is found only in zzso Previous attempts to identify a zzso precursor in zzso fish were limited by functional and zzso characters that could not clearly distinguish between zzso and analogous zzso In the past decade, several genes that specifically function in the zzso have been zzso Here we first describe recent evolutionary studies of zzso zzso zzso We then review evidence showing the presence and zzso expression of the zzso genes in zzso as well as zzso patterns of these genes in specific regions of the zzso zzso zzso We propose that a zzso precursor exists in zzso and that its evolutionary origin predated the separation between zzso and zzso
