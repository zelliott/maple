In plants, multiple zzso zzso zzso exist in an zzso which vary in their primary structures in as much as 32 zzso out of their 148 zzso zzso These zzso zzso show differences in their expression patterns and/or target zzso zzso zzso To further understand the biological significance of zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso act on specific regulatory zzso In gel overlay zzso on various soybean tissue zzso surprisingly, two soybean zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show significant differences in their target binding protein profiles, although they exhibited minor differences in their relative target binding zzso In addition, both zzso zzso not only effectively bound five known plant zzso but also showed competitive binding to these zzso Finally, zzso experiments with the zzso proteins in sections of various zzso using specific zzso revealed similar distribution patterns for the zzso zzso except for root zzso which indicates that the zzso zzso are zzso expressed in most plant zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may compete for binding to zzso in zzso This competitive nature of zzso zzso may allow zzso of zzso signaling pathways by virtue of relative abundance and differential target zzso zzso
