The generation of zzso oxygen species and subsequent zzso stress in the central nervous system is now considered to be one of the primary zzso of a host of neurodegenerative disorders, such as zzso disease, Parkinson disease, and cerebral zzso On a cellular level, zzso stress leads to an zzso early phase that involves cellular membrane zzso zzso exposure and a late phase that zzso to the degradation of zzso zzso The zzso of membrane zzso from the inner cellular membrane to the surface is a critical component for both zzso zzso and cellular disposal of injured zzso During zzso stress, this early phase of zzso is intimately controlled by zzso zzso exposure and zzso zzso zzso zzso The late phase of zzso that involves a loss of zzso DNA integrity can result as a function of an ill-fated attempt to enter the cell cycle in zzso zzso By using a cascade of pathways that involve zzso zzso to zzso programmed cell death, protein zzso B zzso surfaces as a key regulatory element of both zzso pathways of inflammation and intrinsic pathways of cellular zzso Further understanding of the cellular mechanisms modulating zzso cellular integrity and zzso cell disposal during zzso stress may form the basis for the future development of zzso strategies in the nervous zzso
