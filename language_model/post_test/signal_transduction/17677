zzso bacteria have been implicated in the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso cells zzso to bacterial components potentially zzso zzso inflammation by release of zzso and recruitment of inflammatory zzso We analyzed zzso expression and signaling pathways involved in zzso of human primary zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso content in zzso was analyzed by zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso 4 was determined by zzso zzso of zzso 4 protein was assessed by western zzso zzso zzso response was modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of early signal zzso 

zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells while zzso and permanently differentiated zzso cells were zzso zzso to zzso both zzso and zzso cells zzso expressed transcripts for zzso However, zzso was not required for zzso induction of zzso in zzso cells since zzso zzso zzso left zzso levels zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells to zzso persisted in the presence of zzso and/or zzso zzso Neither cell line expressed zzso 2 transcripts while only responsive zzso cells expressed zzso 4 zzso and zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 expression and significantly diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso of G protein dependent zzso zzso reduced zzso levels to zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso 

zzso of zzso lines to zzso is positively correlated with zzso 4 zzso Strategies targeting zzso 4 expression or zzso 4 zzso signaling may antagonize zzso zzso by zzso
