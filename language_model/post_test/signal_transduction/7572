zzso stress induced by zzso oxygen species zzso is associated with various neurological disorders including aging, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as traumatic and zzso zzso zzso have an important role in the zzso defense in the zzso The gap junction protein zzso zzso forms zzso channels as well as zzso in zzso In the present study, we investigated the contribution of zzso to zzso death induced by the zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and the mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso Lack of zzso expression or zzso of zzso channels resulted in increased zzso zzso death, supporting a cell protective effect of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity, but reduced gap junction zzso communication zzso zzso in zzso zzso recovered after 7 zzso but was absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso incompletely inhibited zzso zzso activity, indicating the presence of other zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to be a major zzso contributor in zzso did not appear to have any cell protective effect from zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso treatment decreased the ratio of the zzso zzso to total zzso zzso zzso has been reported to promote zzso death induced by zzso We therefore speculate the increase in zzso zzso may account for the zzso of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the role of zzso in response to cellular stress is dependent on the zzso of signaling pathways leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso
