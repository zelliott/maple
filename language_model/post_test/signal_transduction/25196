Cell zzso receptors of the zzso family are involved in various zzso zzso affecting cell zzso and migration, and also cell proliferation and zzso In order to dissect the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent signal zzso to the zzso and/or zzso leading to adapted cell responses, we developed an approach allowing us to mimic and control zzso zzso We produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso which retains structural and functional properties of zzso including zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and the ability to mediate zzso zzso of covered zzso zzso covered with either zzso or zzso zzso specifically bound to zzso expressing zzso Both types of beads induced the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by lateral zzso of zzso cell membrane zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso by zzso beads triggered local zzso of zzso zzso zzso a recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso as well as local membrane zzso These results support a model where the zzso of zzso zzso is followed by zzso of zzso complexes allowing signal zzso affecting both zzso reorganization and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso binding was altered by agents promoting zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating a possible regulation of the adhesive properties of the zzso domain of zzso by zzso factors zzso zzso
