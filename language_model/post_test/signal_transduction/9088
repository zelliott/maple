It is well accepted that zzso occurs in a zzso manner especially at branch points where disturbed blood flow zzso zzso to the development of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso have shown that zzso is zzso by promoting zzso and inflammatory states in the artery zzso In contrast, steady zzso blood flow zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso stress and inflammation in the vessel zzso The mechanism for inflammation in zzso cells zzso exposed to zzso has been well studied and includes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that ultimately lead to the expression of adhesive zzso In contrast, zzso leads to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that prevents zzso zzso Important zzso events that reflect the zzso and zzso condition of zzso in zzso include the zzso of zzso protein 1 zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso of zzso factor 2 zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso 2 zzso are zzso Recent studies have shown that protein zzso c zzso zzso is highly activated under zzso conditions and may represent a molecular switch for zzso signaling and gene zzso The targeted zzso of proteins activated in a zzso manner holds the promise for a new approach to limit zzso
