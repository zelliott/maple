The role of zzso oxide zzso as a zzso of synaptic plasticity is controversial in both the adult and developing zzso NO generation appears to be necessary for some types of zzso zzso synaptic plasticity during development but not for zzso Our previous work using several NO donors revealed that zzso zzso retinal zzso cell zzso stop growing in response to NO zzso We demonstrate here that the same response occurs in zzso zzso processes bathed in the NO donor zzso zzso and in zzso growth cones to which zzso is very locally zzso We show that NO zzso zzso activity is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso throughout development in a dispersed zzso of zzso zzso although effects of NO on synaptic function in a zzso zzso zzso slice were zzso We chronically inhibited zzso in doubly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in zzso Despite significant zzso zzso as measured zzso zzso stripes remained normally zzso This suggests that zzso activity is not downstream of zzso zzso zzso during zzso synaptic competition because zzso zzso zzso is necessary for segregation of retinal zzso into zzso dominance stripes in the doubly zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that NO has some signaling function in the zzso pathway, but this function is not critical to the mechanism that zzso the projection and causes zzso zzso
