zzso zzso has been used traditionally to treat pimples and alleviate zzso and zzso in zzso The present study aimed to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso seeds on zzso hormone zzso zzso 

The zzso fraction from zzso zzso zzso was used to determine zzso effects by examination of cellular zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis for zzso zzso signaling proteins in zzso mouse melanoma zzso 

zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso synthesis and zzso activity, and also decreased zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso proteins zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased the level of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling through the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirmed that the specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso synthesis and zzso activity was further attenuated by zzso zzso also further decreased zzso suppression of zzso and zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with suppressed zzso levels and subsequently zzso zzso and zzso zzso which results in a marked reduction of zzso synthesis and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso
