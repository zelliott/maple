zzso are zzso fragments of the plant cell wall, whose signaling role has been described thus far during plant development and zzso zzso In the present work, we evaluated the potential involvement of zzso in the molecular communications between zzso and zzso during the establishment of zzso zzso zzso with a degree of zzso of 10 to 15 were found to trigger a rapid zzso production of zzso oxygen species in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso detected by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso deposits of zzso zzso was transient and did not affect bacterial cell zzso due to the prompt zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso carried out in zzso zzso transformed with the zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrated the induction of a rapid and remarkable zzso zzso increase in response to zzso When applied jointly with zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso nod gene zzso indicating an zzso interplay between zzso and inducing zzso in the early stages of plant root zzso The above data suggest a novel role for zzso as signaling molecules released in the zzso in the initial zzso zzso
