The zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso is a critical regulator of inflammation and immunity and is zzso regulated via zzso The zzso effect of zzso is overcome by zzso zzso which under zzso conditions zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso The mechanisms zzso expression of the zzso gene is regulated remain zzso Here we examined the role of zzso in regulating zzso of zzso zzso mice that express a zzso zzso active version of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in significant induction of zzso A zzso region of the zzso promoter that contains two putative zzso binding sites was activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed binding of zzso to the promoter of zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso lung zzso cells with zzso caused transient increases in zzso zzso expression and zzso increases in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso of zzso prolonged zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso zzso this study demonstrates that the zzso gene is positively regulated by zzso and suggests a zzso mechanism to promote zzso signaling by decreasing zzso
