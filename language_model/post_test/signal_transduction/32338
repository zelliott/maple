Fat zzso in skeletal muscle combined with low zzso zzso capacity is associated with insulin resistance zzso zzso athletes, characterized by a high zzso capacity, have elevated zzso zzso yet are highly insulin zzso We tested the hypothesis that a high zzso capacity could zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso (age zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 untrained subjects (age zzso zzso zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were included and underwent a clamp with either infusion of zzso or zzso Muscle zzso were taken to perform high-resolution zzso and protein zzso Trained subjects had zzso higher zzso capacity and zzso higher insulin sensitivity zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso infusion reduced zzso zzso zzso by zzso in untrained subjects zzso zzso zzso whereas this effect was blunted in trained subjects zzso P zzso zzso In untrained subjects, zzso infusion reduced zzso and zzso zzso disposal zzso whereas trained subjects were completely protected against zzso reduction in zzso supported by zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that chronic exercise training zzso zzso zzso and specifically zzso the zzso reduction in zzso Signaling data support the notion that high zzso zzso in trained subjects is maintained by shuttling zzso toward storage as zzso
