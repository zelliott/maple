zzso regulates energy zzso and zzso function within the zzso The underlying mechanisms responsible for zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso were investigated using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso Analysis of zzso zzso synthesis and zzso following zzso treatment demonstrated that the zzso cell line is a representative model of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, following zzso exposure, indicated that these zzso were responsive to low zzso and high zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity, and was linked to the downstream stimulation of zzso zzso zzso The effect was confirmed with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso can directly regulate zzso transcription, while implicating the zzso zzso as an essential zzso of nutritional signaling in a novel zzso zzso cell zzso
