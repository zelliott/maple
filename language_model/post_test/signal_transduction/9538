In a previous study, we demonstrated zzso zzso inflammatory response through zzso and zzso zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and associated signaling zzso may also be involved in zzso inflammatory process in zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analysis indicated zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso protein detected from 1 to zzso zzso As type I zzso zzso signaling requires the zzso pathway, we investigated zzso expression of zzso and zzso by zzso and quantitative zzso zzso Our results indicated both zzso and zzso increases in both zzso and zzso zzso expression after zzso challenge, with the highest zzso observed at zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we applied a pharmacological approach to demonstrate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso reduced significantly zzso zzso NO production and the expression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso and zzso production and their respective zzso expression were markedly suppressed by zzso However, zzso had no zzso effect on both zzso and protein levels of zzso Taken together, we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso I signaling are integral parts of zzso inflammatory zzso Further studies will zzso the interaction of the different signaling zzso the specific downstream targets of zzso the zzso of zzso release, and if zzso could induce the zzso zzso to the same extent in zzso zzso
