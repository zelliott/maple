Previous studies zzso Guo and zzso zzso Cell Growth zzso zzso zzso 1998) have demonstrated that zzso of transforming growth factor zzso beta type II zzso zzso gene in human prostate cancer cells zzso which are zzso to zzso and lack zzso zzso zzso can restore zzso sensitivity and suppress in zzso zzso growth by zzso cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells on zzso induction and zzso The ability of zzso cells that zzso zzso to undergo zzso in response to zzso was examined by DNA fragmentation and terminal zzso zzso end labeling zzso To explore the potential zzso nature of zzso zzso effect against human prostate cancer cells, the expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso was examined by Western zzso zzso The significance of zzso 1 in zzso zzso was also determined by examining the expression and zzso of zzso 1 by reverse zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso of the parental zzso and zzso clones in severely combined zzso mice revealed a significant suppression of tumor growth in zzso zzso clones compared with parental zzso cells and zzso clones zzso zzso zzso A significantly higher zzso of zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso tumor compared with the parental zzso zzso This induction of zzso in the zzso tumors with restored zzso signaling was associated with decreased zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, an increased expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was detected in zzso tumors compared with the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a marked induction of zzso paralleled with a decreased zzso expression in response to zzso treatment in zzso This zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso cells was significantly protected by the zzso inhibitor zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, a significant zzso induction of zzso zzso and protein expression was detected in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso Our findings suggest that restoration of zzso signaling suppresses zzso of human prostate cancer cells by inducing zzso potentially via a zzso zzso
