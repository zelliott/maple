zzso is known to activate zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells zzso to support zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso In this study, zzso indeed induced an immediate and zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso or in the absence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso microscopic observation of zzso image revealed that the SC cellular zzso level was gradually increased after 50 zzso of zzso zzso zzso a blocker of zzso zzso release, did not affect this zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of rat zzso with zzso C zzso zzso zzso (3 and 10 zzso inhibited the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso On the other hand, the zzso of G alpha h was immediately induced by zzso in the rat zzso within 5 zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso from zzso to cell membrane and the formation of G alpha h zzso complexes occurred within 5 and 10 zzso respectively, of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso production was also detected after 30 zzso of zzso zzso The synthetic zzso of zzso zzso not zzso zzso predominantly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso formation of G alpha h zzso complex, zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso immediate zzso influx is zzso zzso by an alternative G alpha h zzso zzso that is distinct from the zzso zzso in rat zzso
