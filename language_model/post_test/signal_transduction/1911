The free radical theory of aging proposes that zzso stress is one of the zzso of an zzso life zzso In zzso zzso genetic or environmental changes have been shown to zzso life zzso Here we discuss whether changes in the generation and destruction of free zzso are implicated in these life span zzso Changes in culture oxygen zzso that are considered to reflect free radical generation zzso the life zzso The life spans under high and low oxygen zzso were shorter and longer, respectively, than those under zzso zzso zzso exposure to high oxygen concentration lengthens the life zzso This is considered to be the result of an increase in zzso defense induced by short-term zzso zzso zzso in genes such as zzso and zzso that compose the zzso signaling network zzso zzso stress resistance and an increase in zzso gene expression as well as life span zzso
