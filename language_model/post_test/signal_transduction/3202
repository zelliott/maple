Target of zzso zzso signaling and the control of cell growth is zzso in many zzso However, the signaling molecules downstream of zzso that zzso regulate the synthesis of zzso and zzso are not well zzso Here, we show in zzso that zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso families function downstream of zzso complex 1 to repress zzso and zzso synthesis in response to zzso limitation and other types of cellular zzso As a part of this response, we found that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and zzso and accumulates in the nucleus after zzso treatment, zzso it zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso III zzso zzso by a specific zzso family member, zzso In cooperation with another zzso zzso zzso this zzso of zzso zzso the function of the zzso and together with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso III zzso
