Dynamic properties of signaling pathways control their behavior and zzso We undertook an zzso zzso and experimental investigation of the dynamic properties of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso Surprisingly, we found that the zzso profile of the zzso activity is zzso to the zzso zzso We reverse engineered a zzso model of the signaling zzso to identify mechanisms that impart this important response zzso thus predicting that the zzso activity profile must zzso peak at all zzso doses to generate the observed zzso zzso Experimental confirmation of this prediction emphasizes the importance of mechanisms that rapidly zzso zzso following zzso zzso A refined zzso model further revealed signaling characteristics that ensure robust zzso zzso communication over considerable zzso allowing for zzso of cellular inflammatory responses in infected zzso
