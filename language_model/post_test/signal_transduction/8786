zzso of lower zzso doses zzso zzso and 5 zzso for 24 h was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso in wheat zzso leaves zzso by further zzso damage zzso by higher dose of zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso with zzso zzso zzso being the most effective zzso Further results illustrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered the zzso production of zzso during a 24 h zzso We also noticed that only peak I zzso zzso rather than peak II (4 zzso was approximately consistent with the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso gene zzso Meanwhile, enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso transcripts might be a potential source of peak I of zzso zzso Further results confirmed that zzso zzso zzso treatment for zzso h was able to zzso HO gene zzso which was detected by zzso activity determination, zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and western zzso Meanwhile, the application of zzso a trap for zzso zzso not only blocked the zzso of zzso but also reversed the corresponding zzso zzso Together, the above results suggest that zzso zzso production zzso I) plays a positive role in the induction of HO by enhancing its zzso level and protein zzso thus leading to the zzso to zzso zzso
