The wealth of zzso zzso and molecular data from human zzso available to zzso means that pathology is poised to become a truly quantitative systems zzso By measuring zzso parameters such as tumor stage and grade, and by measuring molecular zzso such as hormone zzso status, zzso have sometimes accurately predicted what will happen to a patient's zzso While zzso technologies have seemingly improved zzso and zzso some molecular zzso are not useful in clinical practice because of the failure to independently validate these zzso Many associations between gene zzso and clinical response are zzso rather than zzso and such associations are poor zzso of how cellular zzso networks will behave in zzso diseased zzso Using systems biology, the dynamics of reactions in cells and the behavior between cells can be integrated into models of zzso The challenge is how to integrate multiple data from the clinic into zzso models using mathematical models and systems biology, and how to make the zzso model sufficiently robust to be of practical zzso We discuss the difficulties in using mathematics to model cancer, and review some approaches that may be used to allow systems biology to be successfully applied in the zzso
