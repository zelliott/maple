zzso IV is widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in zzso However, its role in cardiac zzso remains zzso In this study, we aim to determine the protective effects of zzso IV on zzso zzso induced by zzso and to identify their precise molecular and cellular zzso Cell size, reorganization of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso expression were used as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression and the distribution of zzso in both zzso and nucleus were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso transient in zzso cells was measured by zzso image zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso challenge induced cardiac zzso increased resting zzso transient level, promoted zzso of zzso and zzso and enhanced nuclear zzso of zzso Administration of zzso IV zzso 32, and 64 zzso 1 h prior to zzso stimulation zzso attenuated cardiac zzso induced by zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso IV inhibited the zzso of the resting zzso free zzso and its effect was similar to zzso Moreover, zzso IV also inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso and the nuclear zzso of zzso induced by zzso In conclusion, our results revealed that zzso IV had the potential to protect against cardiac zzso through zzso zzso signaling zzso
