zzso polarity is evident in the coordinated orientation of zzso in the zzso zzso This process requires that the zzso zzso precursor of each zzso have a higher level of zzso signaling than its neighboring zzso zzso We show that two zzso zzso members, Fat and zzso and the zzso protein zzso play important roles in this zzso Our data support a model in which the bias of zzso signaling between the zzso precursors results from higher Fat function in the precursor cell closer to the zzso which becomes zzso We also provide evidence that zzso information regulating Fat action is provided by graded expression of zzso across the eye and the action of zzso which is expressed in an opposing expression zzso and appears to zzso zzso zzso
