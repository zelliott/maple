zzso receptors are responsible for binding to zzso cues and initiating responses in zzso zzso zzso We investigated the genetic diversity and expression of one family of zzso receptors in a zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to isolate zzso type 2 receptors zzso full-length zzso compared them with other zzso zzso with zzso zzso We also amplified a zzso zzso a zzso usually expressed in the main zzso zzso zzso of zzso and an zzso channel expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We then localized zzso expression of zzso zzso and Golf in the zzso and zzso zzso with in zzso zzso The zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso were detected solely in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, there were differences in the density of cells that expressed particular zzso of zzso 2 zzso showed sexually zzso zzso whereas a third did zzso Although Golf zzso was expressed primarily in the zzso Golf transcripts also were found in the zzso zzso Thus, some aspects of zzso expression of zzso receptors and related molecules differ between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso
