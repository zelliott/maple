zzso 1 zzso 1) is known to induce the differentiation and cell cycle arrest of human zzso leukemia cells in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso originally identified as a participant in zzso zzso has recently been implicated in the signaling of cellular zzso To examine the role of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell differentiation of the zzso Acute zzso zzso cell line, the effects of zzso 1 on zzso zzso were zzso On zzso 1 treatment, the activity of zzso zzso rapidly increased, with zzso zzso protein levels remaining zzso zzso zzso from zzso of zzso zzso cells had increased their ability to zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso activity was shown to be zzso after zzso 1 treatment using zzso mobility shift zzso The protein composition of the zzso zzso factor complex activated by zzso 1 was analyzed using zzso analysis with specific zzso against zzso zzso B, zzso zzso B, and zzso D zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso complex was composed predominantly of zzso B and zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on both DNA binding and cellular zzso Treatment of zzso cells with 20 zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity and DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso blocked the zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, as assessed by a number of features associated with zzso zzso including changes in zzso cell growth arrest, attachment, and increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, transient zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso expression of zzso Our analysis also shows that zzso gene promoter activity is zzso by zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is necessary for zzso zzso differentiation of the zzso Acute zzso zzso cell line zzso
