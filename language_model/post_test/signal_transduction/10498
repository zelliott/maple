The resistance of zzso zzso to many stresses is dependent on the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Hence we have explored the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso responses to zzso DNA zzso were used to characterize the global zzso responses of zzso and zzso cells to three stress conditions that activate the zzso zzso zzso stress, zzso stress, and heavy metal zzso This revealed both zzso zzso responses and a core zzso response to stress in zzso zzso The core zzso response was characterized by a subset of genes that responded in a stereotypical manner to all of the stresses zzso zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso responses to zzso and heavy metal zzso but not to zzso stress, and this was reflected in the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso core stress zzso Instead, the zzso zzso factor plays a key role in the zzso stress regulation of zzso zzso core stress zzso Our data show that the zzso network in zzso zzso has zzso from corresponding networks in model zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in parallel with other pathways to regulate the core zzso response to zzso
