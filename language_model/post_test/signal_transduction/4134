zzso zzso zzso cell lines, each established from a primary zzso induced with zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice or in zzso zzso zzso and severe combined zzso zzso mice, were examined for sensitivity to zzso zzso as measured by zzso cell zzso of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso The zzso cells were cultured with zzso and their expression of zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso cell zzso zzso All but three of the 78 zzso lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a variable degree in response to zzso indicating that zzso resistance is not a common property of these zzso The zzso cell lines varied greatly in their zzso class I expression before as well as after zzso zzso There was a tendency towards a higher zzso expression after zzso stimulation in zzso lines from zzso mice compared to zzso mice, but no common maximum zzso class I expression level was found for the 78 zzso cell zzso Three of the zzso lines, all from zzso mice, completely failed to respond to zzso by zzso zzso class I zzso The same three also displayed absence of zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and low zzso alpha zzso zzso indicating a zzso in the signal zzso zzso affecting zzso of zzso These findings strongly suggest a link between defects in zzso zzso and the failure to zzso zzso class zzso In all zzso lines tested, the zzso Western zzso revealed a 78 zzso protein zzso not previously zzso
