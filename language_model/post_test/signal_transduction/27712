zzso zzso is an increase in the mass of the zzso It is a major risk factor for the development of zzso zzso and zzso heart failure, diseases that zzso millions of patients zzso zzso can be caused by intrinsic defects of the proteins of the zzso apparatus of the heart, or by zzso stimuli such as zzso In this review, we will focus on the zzso signal zzso pathways that mediate the zzso response to zzso zzso Although a large number of signaling molecules have been implicated in the zzso response, we will review data that, we believe, suggest there may be only a few molecules that serve as signaling zzso through which many zzso signals must pass on their way to the zzso These include the stress response protein zzso (the zzso protein zzso or zzso and, zzso the zzso zzso and zzso These molecules have as their primary targets zzso factors, many of which have been implicated in the complex yet zzso genetic response to zzso zzso In most cases, it is not possible at present to complete the link from zzso stimulus through a specific signaling zzso and a specific zzso factor to the induction of a specific gene that zzso a particular zzso zzso We will attempt to identify some of the most important areas where major questions remain in the hopes of stimulating further research into this major cause of death and zzso
