During zzso neural development, many dividing zzso precursors adopt features of zzso zzso which are now known to also serve as neural zzso In zzso most zzso zzso do not persist past early zzso zzso whereas zzso maintain large numbers of zzso zzso into zzso The mechanisms that maintain and specify zzso zzso for different fates are still poorly zzso We investigated formation of zzso zzso in the spinal zzso of zzso and the role of zzso signaling in their maintenance and zzso We found that spinal zzso precursors begin to express zzso a marker of zzso zzso during zzso and that zzso cells give rise to both zzso and zzso We also determined that zzso signaling is continuously required during zzso to maintain zzso zzso limit motor zzso formation and permit zzso development, but that zzso zzso seem to be zzso to changes in zzso activity in zzso zzso
