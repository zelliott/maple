zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso and promotes zzso bundling and is one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of zzso breast and zzso zzso Although its interaction with zzso has been well zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso growth arrest and zzso is not well zzso zzso we show that zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso cells, although the degree of induction was greater in cells expressing zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso protein was also induced after zzso treatment, and this induction was zzso primarily by increased protein zzso zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells after zzso exposure with an zzso of 5 zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso was similarly induced after zzso exposure to zzso zzso with these zzso effects, zzso altered the zzso mobility of zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso Previous depletion of zzso inhibited both the zzso and zzso properties of zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that induction of zzso by zzso requires zzso activity, but that it is not strictly dependent on zzso zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso to both induce zzso zzso in zzso cells and activate zzso zzso is also dependent on zzso zzso
