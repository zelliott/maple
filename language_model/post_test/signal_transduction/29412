zzso zzso signaling regulates many aspects of development and tissue zzso and zzso zzso signaling can lead to zzso Upon a zzso signal zzso degradation is halted and consequently the level of zzso in the zzso zzso This allows entry of zzso into the nucleus where it can regulate gene zzso by direct binding to members of the zzso zzso zzso cell factor zzso family of zzso zzso Recently, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso factors as novel interaction partners of zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) Science zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso binding to zzso serves a dual zzso zzso through zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso competes with zzso for interaction with zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding between zzso and zzso is observed after zzso zzso and cellular zzso stress, which simultaneously increases binding between zzso and zzso Furthermore, small interfering zzso knock down of zzso reverts loss of zzso binding to zzso after cellular zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide evidence for a zzso mechanism between zzso and zzso signaling in which zzso plays a central regulatory zzso
