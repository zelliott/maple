Cancer zzso is defined as the prevention of cancer by the administration of diet supplements or zzso A drug discovery effort should therefore focus on finding agents that will avert the process of zzso zzso which precedes invasive zzso Over 30 agents developed by the zzso program at the National Cancer Institute are being tested against zzso zzso of many organ sites in more than 80 clinical zzso Two basic mechanisms zzso the onset and development of zzso zzso First is the development of the two precursor zzso of chronic diffuse zzso zzso and zzso instability, the latter being produced by zzso zzso in genes responsible for zzso stability, by gene copy amplification or loss from DNA zzso cycles, by unequal sister zzso exchange, and by zzso of double zzso Second is the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso which independently progress through each of the following processes at a continuously accelerating rate: zzso evolution, zzso production of zzso structural zzso and zzso zzso zzso strategies based on these mechanisms are zzso the development of better technology for early diagnosis, zzso the development of multiple agents that block zzso proliferation at steps along the signal zzso of zzso signal zzso and along the signal zzso of synthesis of daughter cell zzso zzso the development of nontoxic zzso agents, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the avoidance of zzso zzso through use of drug combinations, and zzso the use of zzso quantitative image analysis to zzso zzso of surrogate end points in zzso clinical zzso
