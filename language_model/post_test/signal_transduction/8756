A major goal of molecular biology is to zzso the mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression in order to achieve early zzso better diagnosis and staging and novel preventive and therapeutic zzso We feel that an understanding of zzso zzso factor 3 zzso biological pathways will directly impact our knowledge of these areas of human zzso The zzso zzso factor is a downstream zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling pathway, and has a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell death by zzso and in zzso cell zzso and zzso We previously identified zzso as a major gastric tumor zzso by establishing a zzso relationship between loss of function and gastric zzso More recently, we showed that zzso functions as a bona fide zzso of zzso zzso by linking the zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso Apart from gastric and zzso zzso a multitude of zzso zzso exhibit zzso of zzso thereby making it a putative tumor zzso in human zzso This review highlights our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in the context of cancer development and zzso
