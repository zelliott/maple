zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso has been shown to require both a zzso zzso and an unknown zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of an zzso zzso response element in the zzso promoter zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso element, located at zzso to zzso contains two DNA zzso an zzso site zzso zzso and a zzso site zzso zzso studies using variously zzso zzso elements showed that both motifs were necessary and sufficient for zzso response of the zzso The zzso of the zzso element zzso appears to bind a protein in the zzso family or a related protein which could also form a major complex with the zzso of the zzso zzso virus long terminal repeat or human zzso leukemia virus type 1 long terminal zzso The zzso site appears to zzso bind multiple zzso family zzso Despite the similarity in the structure between the zzso element and the zzso zzso zzso composed of an zzso and an zzso site and known to be activated by a variety of zzso signals, zzso could not be activated by activated zzso zzso or zzso We show that zzso activates zzso through an zzso zzso that does not involve protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and the zzso site appears to form the basis for the selective and efficient response of zzso to zzso signals, but not to signals generated by activated zzso zzso or protein zzso zzso
