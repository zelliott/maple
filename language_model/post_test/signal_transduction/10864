The neurotransmitter zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso learning and zzso zzso of the nucleus locus zzso or systemic blockade of zzso receptors has been shown to delay the acquisition of several zzso learning zzso To date, no studies have shown a direct involvement of zzso zzso activity nor localized the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso localized infusions into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have established that blocking zzso receptors with zzso significantly zzso acquisition of zzso zzso Furthermore, interrupting zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso using zzso completely prevents zzso However, neither blocking zzso receptors nor blocking zzso zzso significantly interferes with performance of established zzso responses when administered after the learned response is zzso
