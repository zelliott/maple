An zzso zzso zzso that is specifically impaired in its ability to undergo blue light dependent zzso was used to identify zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed about 205 zzso expressed protein spots in the blue zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso The proteins corresponding to 28 zzso and 33 zzso spots were zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso were closely related to the expression of various zzso zzso Our findings suggest that blue light signals may be involved in many cellular processes including disease resistance and stress zzso
