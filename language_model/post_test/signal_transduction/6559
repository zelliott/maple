In the present study a rat leukemia zzso cell line designated zzso zzso from zzso zzso was shown to spontaneously transform into a zzso zzso line referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso to study pathways of zzso zzso by zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso activated zzso to lyse zzso zzso zzso zzso cells produced zzso specific zzso compared to zzso for zzso zzso zzso M zzso inhibited normal zzso zzso The optimum concentration of zzso for zzso was zzso M and 3-6 h treatment zzso zzso of zzso by zzso occurred at different zzso zzso The time required to reverse the zzso zzso of zzso cells was approximately zzso h zzso In an effort to attempt to differentiate pathways which initiated zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso binding zzso or with combinations of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso or in combination with zzso M zzso increased zzso However, zzso either zzso or when combined with zzso or zzso did not produce an zzso zzso of zzso target zzso Additional experiments were conducted to determine if zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso This was accomplished by analyzing redirected killing of various zzso zzso myeloma cells in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso treatment of the zzso cells caused a significant increase in the zzso of zzso cells compared to control zzso Further evidence that zzso binding was associated with zzso was presented by demonstrating specific zzso of redirected zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso cells demonstrated that zzso and zzso expression on zzso cells was increased by zzso and zzso respectively compared to zzso zzso expression zzso zzso by zzso and zzso cells was not zzso These experiments indicated at the functional level that rat zzso cells can be activated for increased zzso by zzso zzso binding and/or by treatment with the zzso analogue zzso This implies that protein zzso C zzso either zzso or in concert with zzso zzso following zzso zzso binding may play important roles in zzso cell zzso
