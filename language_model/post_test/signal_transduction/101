zzso zzso is a zzso for energy production in the cell and is a rapid regulator of cellular zzso Recent studies have also implicated zzso and its signal zzso pathways in controlling cell zzso fate, and zzso during the development of many zzso including the nervous zzso zzso tensions in the intact brain are much lower than in room air, and there is evidence that dynamic control of zzso availability may be a component of the in zzso neural stem cell zzso zzso At lower zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways that promote zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways that promote zzso differentiation or zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso tension degrades zzso thus promoting differentiation or zzso of zzso and zzso These dynamic changes in zzso tension can be zzso to zzso ex zzso production methods for cell replacement zzso zzso disrupted zzso availability may play a critical role in disease states such as stroke or brain tumor zzso zzso during stroke activates precursor proliferation in zzso while zzso stem cells zzso zzso in a more hypoxic environment than normal stem cells, which may make them resistant to certain zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso response is central to the normal architecture and dynamics of zzso regulation and in the zzso and treatment of brain zzso
