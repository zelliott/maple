zzso rely on innate immune mechanisms to defend themselves against zzso The zzso zzso peptides constitute an important arm of this zzso In zzso the Toll and the zzso pathways are the major routes to induce the zzso and it has become clear that to a certain extent, these pathways can discriminate between different microbes and mount an appropriate response to eliminate the zzso This review discusses the proteins responsible for this zzso recognition, the zzso recognition proteins zzso The serum protein zzso triggers a zzso cascade of zzso upon infection by certain zzso bacteria to activate the Toll zzso The zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso in response to certain zzso bacteria or their zzso Other zzso have zzso activity, zzso zzso bonds in zzso to eliminate its zzso thus turning off the immune zzso The zzso family is zzso from insects to zzso Short zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso and stored in zzso These zzso seem to influence the survival of zzso zzso zzso Long zzso zzso are expressed in the liver and zzso into the zzso where their zzso activity might serve scavenger zzso
