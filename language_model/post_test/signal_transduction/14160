Analysis of zzso zzso zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso remains challenging, due to the low occurrence of this zzso modification compared to zzso and zzso zzso events in zzso zzso Conventional zzso affinity zzso methods used to enrich zzso can nowadays isolate over 10,000 zzso However, these approaches are not particularly suitable for the selective enrichment of low abundant zzso zzso peptides as the higher abundant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides typically obscure their zzso zzso a more targeted approach based on zzso zzso at the zzso level has been introduced for the specific analysis of zzso zzso zzso This method typically leads to the detection of a few hundreds of zzso albeit typically over zzso of those are zzso zzso Here, we evaluated and compared zzso peptides enriched by a zzso zzso enrichment zzso zzso zzso and a zzso approach consisting of zzso based enrichment zzso followed by zzso interaction liquid zzso zzso zzso Our aim was to assess differences and similarities in the set of zzso zzso peptides detected by each zzso Our data suggest that both strategies are not redundant but complementary and should zzso be combined for a more comprehensive view at zzso zzso 

Here we evaluated enabling tools for the global analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key protein modification driving cellular response also involved in zzso molecular zzso
