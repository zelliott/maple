The protein zzso was isolated from rat brain as an zzso zzso protein with a domain organization similar to that of zzso zzso but lacking zzso zzso We show that zzso plays an important role in signaling by the type A zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso screening identified zzso zzso zzso zzso which is proposed to contribute to the zzso targeting or zzso of zzso zzso as a protein that interacts with zzso Furthermore, zzso competitively inhibited the binding of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso current by zzso or zzso both of which act at zzso receptors containing gamma zzso is impaired in zzso zzso of zzso knockout zzso Moreover, behavioral analysis revealed that motor coordination was impaired and the zzso injection of zzso induced markedly reduced sedative and zzso effects in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is essential for the function of zzso zzso especially in response to the agents acting on a zzso zzso
