zzso hormone nuclear receptors zzso are zzso zzso factors which regulate growth, zzso and zzso The molecular mechanisms by which zzso mediate these diverse effects are zzso One emerging hypothesis suggests that zzso could mediate these diverse effects via cooperation with different zzso zzso Indeed, we have recently shown that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the tumor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and tumor zzso To assess the zzso relevance of the interaction of zzso with zzso the present study addressed the question as to whether the functions of zzso could be modulated by zzso We first compared the zzso zzso activity in two pairs of zzso cell lines, zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells are colon and breast zzso cell lines, respectively, that contain zzso but lack zzso The zzso zzso E6 and zzso E6 cells are stable clones expressing high levels of zzso type 16 E6 zzso In these cells, the level of zzso protein was lower than the parental zzso The impairment of zzso functions in these zzso cells led to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in a growth zzso cell line in which the expression of the growth hormone gene is positively regulated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso led to repression in the expression of the growth hormone zzso Thus, zzso could zzso with zzso in its signaling pathways to regulate gene regulatory zzso The present findings further strengthen the hypothesis that mediation of the zzso effects of zzso requires the cooperation of zzso with a large network of zzso zzso
