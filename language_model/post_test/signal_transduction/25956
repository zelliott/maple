Although many studies have suggested that human zzso tissue contains zzso stem cells, a few reports are available on zzso vascular fraction zzso In the present study, we evaluated the bone formation capacities of zzso We implanted zzso freshly isolated zzso stem cells combined with zzso bone zzso zzso to induce bone zzso in a critically sized rat zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Fifty white rats were zzso to 5 different groups zzso zzso control, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso and zzso zzso + zzso zzso After acquiring zzso an zzso critically sized zzso zzso was made in each zzso zzso were harvested at 8 weeks zzso and evaluated zzso and zzso New bone formation was qualified by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were determined by zzso zzso In gross appearance, the zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso groups showed more abundant bone formation than the other zzso zzso evaluations revealed that significant intergroup differences were observed according to the zzso zzso test zzso The 5 groups show different amounts of filling of bone defects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation revealed that there was abundant new bone formation in the zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso stem cells in the form of zzso induced new bone formation in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso offers a practical, promising candidate for zzso tissue engineering or zzso zzso
