The zzso factors zzso zzso binding factor 1 zzso and zzso factor 7 zzso zzso cell zzso zzso are downstream zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which is a critical regulator of T cell development in the zzso In this study, we show that zzso and zzso zzso are not only expressed in zzso but also in mature T zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso encounter in zzso and engagement of the zzso or zzso zzso in zzso leads to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso T zzso We further show that resting T cells zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that T cell zzso changes the zzso balance in favor of zzso zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our study suggests that proteins involved in the zzso signaling zzso not only regulate T cell development, but also peripheral T cell zzso
