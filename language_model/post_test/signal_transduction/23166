zzso zzso is a major zzso of aggressive zzso zzso Biological targeted therapies on this disease need to be further investigated and may help to improve the clinical outcome of the zzso 

This study examined the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso combined with the zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, as well as in primary tumor cells and a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the tumor cell growth and triggered the zzso cell death, with a significant zzso of zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso as a class I zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso attenuated zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tumor cell growth and induction of zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso to suppress tumor cell growth and to induce zzso Strong zzso effect was also observed on primary tumor cells while sparing normal zzso ex zzso In a zzso zzso model established with subcutaneous injection of zzso cells, dual treatment efficiently blocked tumor growth, inhibited zzso and induced in zzso zzso 

These findings confirmed the synergistic effect of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso and provided an insight into clinical application of targeting zzso in treating zzso zzso zzso
