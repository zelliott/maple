zzso molecules and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling play key role in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso cells zzso High expression of zzso is required for zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso of these molecules is required for successful zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso signaling is required for zzso of zzso and zzso whereas disruption of the zzso signaling is required for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso occur zzso It is proposed that drug resistance zzso as a result of repeated cycles of zzso Following each cycle of chemotherapy, zzso lose zzso molecules and zzso zzso Surviving cells, released from tumor sites, circulate until zzso of zzso molecules and zzso occurs, then zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by cells in the new zzso induce proliferation and drug resistance of zzso This process is amplified in each cycle of chemotherapy resulting in disease zzso A novel model for treatment is proposed in which circulating zzso are the target for clinical intervention, and concurrent treatment with chemotherapy and zzso zzso will result in zzso of the zzso zzso of conventional zzso zzso
