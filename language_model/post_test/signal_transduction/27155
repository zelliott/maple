The zzso zzso zzso their partners zzso and zzso constitute a zzso regulatory zzso commonly targeted in zzso zzso zzso and functional cell cycle analyses showed abnormalities of this zzso in each of 22 human melanoma cell lines zzso zzso zzso and all melanoma lines expressed zzso zzso and zzso D1 and zzso The tumor zzso zzso and zzso were lost in 17 and 4 cases, respectively, due to various genetic mechanisms, including zzso block of zzso and nonsense zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso prevented zzso entry of zzso but not zzso melanoma zzso The zzso cell line harboring an zzso zzso in zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter preventing zzso zzso but not zzso from zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso arrested the zzso cells in zzso whereas zzso did not, indicating that the zzso zzso complex is required for zzso zzso and the resistance of the complex to zzso in zzso These data strongly support the candidacy of zzso as a novel zzso provide further evidence for the zzso zzso zzso as a functional unit, and suggest that deregulation of this checkpoint may represent a common step in the zzso progression of sporadic zzso zzso
