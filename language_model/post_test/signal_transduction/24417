zzso of zzso pathways by zzso II zzso zzso is important for cardiac zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso is closely controlled by a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are elevated in patients with heart failure and may contribute to disease zzso In this study, we investigate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso (1 zzso 30 zzso almost completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso II directed zzso by more than zzso Compared to controls, zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was inhibited by the protein zzso C zzso zzso C, but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso but not zzso is required for zzso zzso induction in zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso have direct cellular effects in zzso through an zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity via zzso induction of zzso This might be relevant with regard to the decreased zzso activity and increased levels in zzso reported during chronic heart failure in zzso
