In retinal zzso diseases, zzso zzso cells zzso acquire migratory zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate this migration remain poorly zzso In addition, zzso disorders associated with enhanced activities of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso also present increased levels of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso In the present work, we investigated whether the zzso activated form of zzso zzso and zzso are involved with the zzso migratory zzso By performing zzso migration and zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso induced cell migration and zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line, zzso This induction was blocked when zzso and zzso were knocked down with zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso procedures, we found that zzso induced an increase in zzso and zzso zzso in early zzso followed by zzso recycling and zzso distribution of zzso toward cellular zzso Moreover, zzso negative zzso zzso zzso recycling pathway, cell migration, and zzso zzso induced by zzso In conclusion, zzso through its zzso zzso zzso cellular migration of zzso zzso cells by a mechanism that involves zzso zzso traffic to the plasma membrane by a zzso recycling zzso
