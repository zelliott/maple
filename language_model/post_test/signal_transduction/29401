Most zzso family members are zzso and zzso associate with membrane zzso zzso that coordinate zzso Whether the zzso zzso frequently zzso in zzso also zzso at zzso remains zzso Using polarized zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso we here addressed how zzso zzso zzso may impact on its zzso membrane zzso in particular to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso correlated with its recruitment from the zzso to zzso zzso where zzso largely resisted zzso by zzso zzso at 4 degrees C and floated into zzso density zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso activated zzso showed a dual zzso at zzso zzso and at the zzso plasma zzso The plasma membrane zzso pool did not zzso with zzso and zzso but extensively overlapped zzso zzso by zzso zzso Severe ( approximately zzso cholesterol extraction with zzso zzso did not abolish zzso zzso but strongly decreased zzso association with floating zzso and abolished its zzso at the zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso independently activated first the zzso - zzso pathway, then the zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso was insensitive to zzso which suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso both depending on the zzso zzso We therefore suggest that activated zzso is recruited at two membrane zzso allowing differential zzso first via zzso at zzso zzso on zzso then via zzso on a distinct set of zzso at the zzso plasma zzso Whether this model is zzso to zzso remains to be zzso
