Human zzso zzso arise from zzso zzso cells, which likely respond both to zzso and to zzso zzso However, the identity of these cues and how they might act remain zzso We analyzed zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso using a three-dimensional zzso model generated from human breast tissue that zzso both zzso and zzso the normal zzso network in zzso zzso different zzso zzso generate distinct patterns of cell zzso zzso growth factor zzso causes a massive expansion of the zzso zzso zzso in contrast, enables normal zzso zzso These differences cannot be ascribed to preferential zzso or proliferation of differentiated cell zzso but are dependent on zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso prevents the zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso are much less responsive to zzso zzso Little is known about the zzso lineage or about growth factor effects on zzso zzso zzso and our studies provide an important window into human zzso development that reveals unexpected differences from the mouse zzso
