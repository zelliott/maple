zzso zzso receptors are implicated in the control of mood, and their blockade is of potential interest for the management of zzso zzso 

zzso we characterized the in zzso and in zzso pharmacological profile of the novel zzso zzso zzso 

Standard zzso zzso zzso and behavioral procedures were zzso 

zzso displayed high affinity for human zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, it had negligible zzso zzso affinity for zzso receptors and all other sites zzso In measures of zzso zzso C zzso zzso displayed potent zzso properties at zzso receptors zzso zzso values, zzso and zzso receptors zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished the induction of penile zzso and a zzso stimulus by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso It elevated dialysis levels of zzso and zzso in the frontal zzso of freely moving rats, and accelerated the firing rate of zzso zzso and locus zzso zzso zzso At similar doses, zzso decreased zzso in a zzso test in rats, reduced the motor depression zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited both aggressive and zzso behavior in zzso Supporting zzso properties, chronic zzso weeks) administration of zzso suppressed zzso in a chronic mild stress procedure and increased both expression of zzso and cell proliferation in rat zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed zzso properties in Vogel conflict and social interaction tests in zzso 

zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso and possesses zzso and zzso properties in diverse zzso zzso
