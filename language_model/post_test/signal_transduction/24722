zzso zzso is one of the widespread cell surface zzso The zzso is expressed in the cells of a wide variety of different zzso and species and its pattern varies considerably during development and among zzso Although the zzso is one of the members of zzso its zzso remain zzso Here we show that zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso prevent zzso of zzso mouse zzso cells zzso to zzso of two mouse bone zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The same zzso do not prevent zzso of cell zzso to zzso of two other mouse bone zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and to a wide spectrum of different normal and tumor mouse cell zzso A characteristic of the cell line zzso is the ability to support growth of mouse zzso zzso This data suggest that cells of zzso lines zzso and zzso contain on their surface a specific zzso for the zzso zzso zzso interaction via this zzso and the zzso on the cell surface may be an important step for development of certain lineages of zzso
