zzso plays a role in human B cell proliferation and is an effective target for zzso In this study, mouse zzso expression and zzso were assessed for the first time using a new panel of zzso zzso with zzso function assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was B cell restricted and was initiated during late zzso cell zzso The frequency and density of zzso expression increased during B cell maturation in the bone zzso with a zzso of transitional zzso B cells expressing higher zzso levels than the majority of mature zzso B zzso Transitional zzso B cells in the zzso also expressed high zzso levels, providing a useful new marker for this B cell zzso In zzso mice, immature and mature B cell zzso expression was approximately zzso lower relative to B cells from zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso calcium responses were significantly reduced in zzso B cells, with a less dramatic effect on zzso zzso These results reveal a role for zzso in zzso zzso movement in mouse primary B cells that zzso previous results obtained using human zzso zzso cell zzso Otherwise, B cell development, tissue zzso signal zzso zzso T zzso zzso responses and affinity maturation were normal in zzso zzso Thus, mouse and human zzso share similar patterns of expression and zzso These studies thereby provide an animal model for studying zzso function in zzso and the molecular mechanisms that influence zzso zzso
