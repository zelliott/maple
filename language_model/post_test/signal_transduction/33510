zzso is zzso coupled to zzso throughout adult life, and the interplay between these two processes is communicated by multiple zzso Here we show that in a transgenic mouse model, increased expression of zzso box C2 zzso in the zzso tissue affects zzso vascular zzso and zzso White and brown zzso zzso contain a considerably high density of zzso appearing as vascular zzso which show zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells and zzso zzso of these primitive vessels is reflected by impairment of skin wound zzso We further provide a zzso insight of the vascular zzso by showing that zzso controls zzso expression by direct zzso of its promoter in zzso zzso an zzso zzso almost completely reverses this vascular zzso Thus, the zzso signaling system is crucial for controlling zzso vascular function, which is part of an adaptation to increased zzso tissue zzso
