zzso to zzso and other zzso family genes in both mice and humans result in numerous zzso zzso zzso Little is known, however, about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which zzso genes regulate zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso cell zzso and a zzso transition in zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso arise through the formation of distinct structures involving cell zzso and cell behaviors resembling those that occur during zzso and zzso known as zzso zzso During these zzso zzso zzso and zzso are localized to the zzso zzso and both proteins zzso focal zzso components from zzso cell zzso We show further that these zzso cell movements are associated with zzso of a zzso zzso resulting in induction and zzso of zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso All of these zzso factors exhibit altered zzso distribution in zzso zzso In particular, we show the zzso of zzso to both the nucleus and to zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso regulates zzso cell behavior and that regulation of a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso is a function of zzso zzso
