We report on the physical parameters governing zzso zzso signaling in a model zzso The model zzso is comprised of bacteria that are genetically engineered to transmit and receive zzso zzso zzso The model is formed using zzso of zzso holographic optical traps in conjunction with zzso to precisely position bacteria, and then zzso within a zzso that mimics the zzso zzso Using fluorescent protein reporters functionally linked to zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso We find that there isn't a single cell density for which zzso genes are induced or zzso On the contrary, zzso signaling is largely governed by zzso and is acutely sensitive to zzso to the surroundings and the cell zzso These observations are consistent with the view that zzso act simply as a probe measuring zzso flow, or diffusion in the zzso of the zzso
