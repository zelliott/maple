Animal organ development requires that tissue patterning and differentiation is tightly coordinated with cell zzso and cell cycle zzso Several variations of the cell cycle program are used by zzso cells at different stages during development zzso zzso In zzso discs of developing larvae, cell cycle progression is controlled by a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso signals from multiple zzso ranging from growth factors and receptors to small signaling zzso zzso oxide zzso a zzso second zzso zzso can zzso suppress DNA synthesis and cell division zzso zzso In developing flies, the zzso action of NO is essential for regulating the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation and, ultimately, the shape and size of adult structures in the fly zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms of the zzso activity of NO in developing organisms are not known, zzso We used transgenic flies expressing the zzso zzso oxide zzso gene zzso and/or genes zzso components of the cell cycle regulatory pathways (the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso factor complex components zzso and zzso combined with zzso zzso to address this zzso We found that zzso of zzso or transgenic zzso activity during zzso disc development can enhance or suppress the effects of zzso and zzso on development of the zzso Our data suggest a role for NO in the developing zzso eye disc via interaction with the zzso zzso
