In this study, the zzso signaling zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso production in zzso increased in a zzso manner, as zzso induction began at 4 zzso peaked at 12 zzso and then zzso at a high zzso zzso zzso in zzso was zzso as early as 4 h after zzso the zzso expression was observed at 8 zzso The earliest induction of zzso protein occurred at 4 h and peaked at 16 zzso meanwhile, zzso zzso level and protein production remained unchanged zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso production and zzso zzso expression in zzso but they had no significant effect on zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited both zzso acid zzso and zzso production without zzso zzso protein zzso but zzso inhibited neither AA nor zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso production, and zzso zzso expression and protein expression by zzso or zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by regulating AA production through a zzso zzso and induction of zzso expression by a zzso zzso
