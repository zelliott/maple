The knowledge of signaling pathways that are triggered by zzso and pathological conditions or drug treatment is essential for the comprehension of the biological events that regulate cellular zzso Recently novel platforms based on zzso protein zzso have proven to be useful in the study of different zzso but they still lack the possibility to detect events in the complexity of a cellular zzso We developed an zzso of cells on chip where, upon cell zzso growing, drug treatment, and zzso by spotting specific zzso we can detect the zzso and state of hundreds of proteins involved in specific signaling zzso By applying this technology to zzso cells we analyzed signaling proteins involved in the response to DNA damage and identified a zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso We propose our technology as a new tool for the zzso zzso analysis of signaling pathways in drug response zzso for the zzso of profiling patient cells, and ultimately for the high zzso screening of zzso for zzso zzso
