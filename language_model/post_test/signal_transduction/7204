zzso zzso Group zzso is a nuclear protein that acts as an architectural zzso factor involved in the maintenance of zzso structure and regulation of gene zzso It can be released into the zzso milieu from immune and zzso cells in response to various zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of numerous chronic inflammatory and zzso diseases, including zzso zzso arthritis, zzso chronic kidney disease, systemic lupus zzso zzso as well as cancer zzso zzso of released zzso with the zzso zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso is one of the main signaling pathways triggering these zzso It has been also demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso interaction represents a promising approach for the zzso of the inflammatory and zzso activity of zzso In this review we describe various approaches recently proposed in the literature to inhibit zzso and the related inflammatory zzso especially focusing on the block of zzso zzso Several strategies are based on molecules which mainly interact with zzso as competitive zzso of zzso As an alternative, encouraging results have been obtained with zzso leading to the identification of compounds that directly bind to zzso ranging from small natural or synthetic zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso proteins as well as bent zzso zzso Future perspectives are discussed in the light of the overall body of knowledge acquired by a large number of research groups operating in different but related zzso
