zzso zzso zzso such as common zzso zzso zzso maintain a zzso zzso differentiation potential, which can be initiated by stimulation through zzso expressed zzso zzso including zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is promptly zzso in zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is sufficient to initiate zzso differentiation from zzso as well as from zzso and zzso cells, even though zzso cells do not give rise to zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a B zzso zzso factor, is completely suppressed by enforced zzso but not by zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso Introduction of zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso lineage conversion in zzso These data suggest that zzso is a zzso target of zzso lineage conversion in zzso zzso Furthermore, complete loss of zzso expression triggered by zzso of zzso is a critical event for lineage conversion from zzso to zzso lineage in zzso and zzso zzso
