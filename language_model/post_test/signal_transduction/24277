In this paper we study a class of neural networks with continuously distributed zzso By means the of zzso functional method, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of the equilibrium and periodic zzso We also estimate the zzso zzso zzso Our results are less restrictive than previously known criteria and can be applied to neural networks with a broad range of zzso functions assuming neither zzso nor strict zzso Moreover, these conclusions are presented in terms of system parameters and can be easily zzso zzso our results play an important role in the design of globally zzso stable neural circuits and periodic zzso neural zzso
