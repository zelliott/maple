We report here the results of an analysis of the regulatory range of the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso Using zzso we identified a large number of genes that are regulated by the system, and detected a near complete overlap of these genes with those regulated by two small zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the expression of all zzso genes is zzso Using zzso zzso interaction zzso we identified only two zzso regions that associated specifically with zzso located upstream of the zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that in zzso zzso the zzso system zzso the regulatory signals to downstream genes exclusively by directly controlling the expression of only two genes zzso and zzso These two zzso serve as zzso between the input signals and the output at the level of zzso stability, although additional regulatory zzso can influence the levels of these two zzso We show that the zzso DNA segment upstream of zzso is bound and silenced by zzso and zzso the global gene regulators of the zzso zzso This work highlights the importance of zzso mechanisms involving zzso in controlling gene expression during bacterial adaptation to different zzso
