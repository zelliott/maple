zzso receptors convey stimulus duration and intensity and are implicated in zzso zzso However, how zzso zzso signals are generated and how they reconfigure neural circuits and modify animal behavior is poorly zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso receptors that continuously signal ambient zzso to set the zzso behavioral zzso zzso signaling relied on a zzso relay involving zzso zzso zzso channels, the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso activity evoked continuous zzso release, which helps elicit the enduring behavioral state associated with high zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was zzso to downstream neural zzso including the hub zzso zzso zzso receptors evoked similar zzso states at particular zzso zzso regardless of previous zzso However, a zzso component of the zzso zzso response to high zzso as well as zzso transformations in downstream zzso enabled transient zzso movements shaped by zzso Our results highlight how zzso zzso signals can generate both transient and enduring behavioral zzso
