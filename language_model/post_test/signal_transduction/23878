zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso modification of nuclear and zzso zzso The zzso for its addition and removal have recently been cloned and partially zzso While only about 80 zzso proteins have been identified to date that carry this zzso it is clear that this represents just a small percentage of the modified zzso zzso has all the properties of a regulatory modification including being dynamic and zzso The modification appears to zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso There are also zzso data that zzso plays a role in zzso and zzso A working model is emerging that zzso serves as a zzso sensor that zzso a cell's response to zzso stimuli based on the energy state of the zzso In this review, we will focus on the zzso that zzso zzso the functional impact of zzso zzso and the current working model for zzso as a zzso zzso
