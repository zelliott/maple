zzso zzso zzso is responsible for conversion of zzso steroids to zzso in a number of human zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso skin and the zzso zzso expression in human zzso is regulated by use of alternative promoters in the zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is absent in the zzso adult liver, adrenal and zzso zzso zzso or inappropriate zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, as well as in zzso zzso adrenal and zzso tumors, is associated with zzso high circulating zzso levels and/or with increased local zzso zzso in these zzso Whether zzso delivered or locally produced, elevated zzso levels will in turn promote the growth of zzso zzso We recently studied zzso expression in zzso tumor and zzso tissue samples from zzso boys with zzso in zzso cancer and zzso tumor samples from adult men with zzso in breast zzso tissue samples zzso to breast tumors, and in zzso cancer, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso transcript levels were found in these tissue samples or in cultured cells derived from these zzso In these zzso or zzso zzso or cells, the regulation of zzso expression was studied in terms of alternative promoter use, both in zzso and in response to various hormonal zzso Our results were suggestive of a common zzso zzso associated with zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that gives rise to zzso zzso of zzso expression via promoters zzso and II in all of the above zzso This article describes the common zzso and molecular features of excessive zzso expression in these disease zzso
