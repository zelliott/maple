Ring finger protein 11 zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso in numerous human zzso colon and invasive breast zzso Although functional studies have implicated zzso in a variety of biological zzso including signal zzso and zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying its function are still poorly zzso In this study we show that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with markers of both the early and the recycling zzso Several modification and protein interaction signals in the zzso sequence are shown to affect its zzso zzso binding requires two zzso motifs driving the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso genetic removal of the zzso signal results in diffuse zzso whereas an zzso protein zzso in the zzso signal is retained in compartments of the early zzso zzso However, zzso fusion to green fluorescent protein of a zzso zzso containing both zzso signals zzso the zzso to the plasma zzso but it is not sufficient to direct it to the recycling compartment suggesting that additional signals contribute to the correct zzso In addition, we show that membrane zzso through zzso is necessary for zzso to be zzso modified by the addition of several zzso zzso and that loss of zzso severely zzso the in zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, in cells zzso with zzso we observe a correlation between high zzso zzso as in tumor cells, and a swelling of the zzso compartment suggesting a possible role of the zzso of the zzso compartment in zzso
