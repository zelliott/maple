The zzso zzso was first identified as a gene contributing to tumor progression in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso leukemia zzso The biological function of zzso remained elusive until its zzso zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso protein and was shown to be an essential component of the maternal zzso zzso To date two zzso zzso have been described in the zzso zzso and zzso The proteins zzso by these two genes are zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a third zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the mouse zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso are juxtaposed on zzso 19 in a zzso organization zzso between man and zzso We show that zzso and zzso are zzso which is the first evidence that these proteins are subject to zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is able to bind to zzso However, a side-by-side comparison of the zzso zzso proteins for their capacity to induce signaling through zzso factor reveals that zzso is a less potent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein accumulates to higher levels upon zzso into zzso cells than either zzso or zzso Thus, whereas zzso may be a core component of zzso zzso zzso might very well be part of a divergent zzso zzso zzso
