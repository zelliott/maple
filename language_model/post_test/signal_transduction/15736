zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of risk for breast cancer in Caucasian zzso We analyzed these zzso and combinations of their zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer patients (N zzso zzso and healthy women (N zzso zzso from western India as well as in breast cancer patients and healthy women from the zzso community (N zzso 48 & zzso zzso Western Indian women were characterized by a higher frequency of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and a significantly lower frequency of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso as compared to healthy zzso zzso A strong protective effect of zzso zzso was seen in younger western Indian women zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to healthy women, the zzso higher zzso of low or intermediate zzso zzso zzso in patients suggested a strong influence of the combination of these zzso on the risk for breast cancer in zzso women (for intermediate zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of low zzso in zzso healthy women, while comparable to that reported in Europeans and Americans, was three times higher than that in healthy women from western India zzso vs zzso zzso These zzso in conjunction with the low zzso rate of breast cancer in Indian women compared to White women, raise a possibility that the higher frequency of zzso zzso and lower frequency of zzso zzso may represent important genetic zzso that together contribute to a lower risk of breast cancer in western Indian zzso
