Gender differences have been described in osteoporosis with females having a higher risk of osteoporosis than zzso The differentiation of bone zzso zzso cells zzso into bone or fat is a critical step for zzso Here we demonstrated that loss of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso suppressed osteogenesis but promoted zzso The mechanism dissection studies revealed that zzso zzso suppressed zzso genes to inhibit zzso differentiation from zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso of zzso via zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and the zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso zzso further proved that zzso could zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Finally, addition of zzso zzso successfully masked the zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitions of zzso zzso and zzso pathways reversed the zzso depletion effects on the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso changes in zzso might zzso the zzso axis to regulate zzso in zzso
