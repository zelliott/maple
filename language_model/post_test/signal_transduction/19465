zzso T cells occupy a central role in the induction and regulation of zzso immune zzso zzso zzso T helper zzso cells exert immediate zzso functions by producing zzso and zzso providing help for the induction of zzso zzso T zzso responses and memory, and providing help for zzso class zzso affinity maturation of zzso and B cell zzso Inherent in zzso zzso T cells is the flexibility to adopt alternate lineage zzso which depend upon regulatory mechanisms that change with tissue zzso and upon zzso Here, we discuss lineage zzso programs that regulate zzso T cell differentiation and memory and how to translate this knowledge into vaccines and zzso that promote protective immune zzso
