The zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates development in animals ranging from flies to zzso Although its framework is zzso differences in zzso components have been zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts primarily as a negative regulator of zzso signal zzso However, in zzso analysis of the function of zzso zzso and the closely related zzso has led to the conclusion that neither protein has a role in zzso zzso Using zzso knockout mice, we demonstrate that mouse zzso like its zzso and zzso zzso plays a role in zzso the zzso zzso We show that zzso accumulates at the zzso tip of the primary zzso in a zzso zzso We also demonstrate a requirement for zzso in the efficient zzso of zzso to zzso in response to zzso and for the processing of zzso to its zzso zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in zzso zzso signal zzso at the tip of zzso and preventing zzso zzso into a zzso form in the presence of zzso
