Dynamic interactions between cellular zzso and the zzso are known to play major roles in many cellular responses to environmental zzso External signals resulting in zzso zzso zzso and zzso must be translated from chemical signals into changes of state, often involving the zzso altering of cell shape and zzso of zzso zzso a critical component of zzso cell zzso performs vital roles in regulating membrane dynamics and zzso Here we zzso using zzso and zzso cell lines, that depletion of membrane cholesterol results in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which together collaborate to form stress zzso These results demonstrate that cholesterol is a critical regulator of zzso dynamics and suggest that altered cholesterol zzso may result in dramatic changes in cellular responses zzso by the zzso
