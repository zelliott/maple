Cell zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for development of the zzso zzso and to maintain the normal architecture and function of the zzso zzso adhere to the zzso via the zzso family of zzso zzso which signal to control zzso gene expression and regulate cell proliferation and zzso During tumor formation, the zzso is extensively remodeled and signaling through zzso is altered such that cells become zzso and zzso A key regulator of whether zzso zzso will promote tumor suppression or tumor formation is the zzso of the zzso zzso The normal zzso zzso is typically surrounded by a loose zzso zzso An increase in the deposition of collagen and other zzso components is associated with zzso density, which is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast zzso Several groups have demonstrated that increased zzso zzso density results in a zzso that is zzso zzso sense the zzso of their surrounding zzso by zzso contraction of the zzso zzso If the surrounding zzso is stiffer than the cell's ability to contract it, then the zzso forces that result are able to drive the zzso of zzso and assemble zzso signaling zzso The result is subsequent zzso of signaling pathways including zzso zzso and zzso that drive cell proliferation and zzso In contrast, focal complexes are not formed in a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso is diminished, resulting in control of zzso Signaling from zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso members, which control zzso and zzso zzso such that a zzso zzso is predicted to promote normal zzso zzso architecture and suppress tumor zzso
