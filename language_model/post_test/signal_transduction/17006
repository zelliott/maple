An expansion of zzso within the human zzso protein zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso a zzso inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso Although the mechanisms linking the zzso to the disease remain zzso evidence indicates that it involves a combination of both gain and loss of functions of zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso interacts with zzso a potent and selective zzso zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso zzso we found a new function of zzso the zzso of zzso activity and the regulation of its zzso zzso with the zzso zzso within zzso altering this function in the zzso mouse zzso before disease zzso We show that zzso enhances zzso expression and zzso zzso levels without affecting zzso modifications of zzso zzso zzso zzso known to regulate zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso a decrease in zzso in zzso known to enhance its activity, while reducing zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses show that zzso regulations of the zzso zzso specifically zzso and of zzso occur at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were confirmed by identified zzso changes of the known zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit abnormal zzso zzso decreased levels of both zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which are ameliorated by zzso zzso Our results point to zzso of this newly assigned function of zzso in zzso uncovering new potential targets for zzso
