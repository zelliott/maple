zzso pneumoniae, an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a common zzso agent of respiratory tract infections, has been implicated in the induction and progression of zzso and coronary artery zzso In this study, the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso in human zzso a prominent cell population in chronic inflammation and persistent infection, contributing to plaque formation, was zzso zzso zzso elementary bodies were demonstrated to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in human zzso The effect was independent of the zzso zzso and was likely to be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso was shown to abolish zzso zzso cell zzso whereas an zzso zzso had no effect, indicating the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso 4 zzso 4) inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso zzso in zzso Together the results indicate that zzso zzso triggers rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and chemical enhancement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso infection at the molecular zzso
