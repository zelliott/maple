zzso II zzso a zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso substance recently shown to induce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso However, little is known about mechanisms involved in zzso zzso response such as cell zzso To investigate the zzso signaling pathways involved in this process, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso manners the zzso level of zzso In contrast, zzso failed to alter the zzso level of zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso was noted even in suspended cells, zzso failed to induce an increase in zzso zzso in such zzso On the other hand, zzso induced an increase in the zzso level of zzso but not zzso in cells adherent to zzso Furthermore, zzso proliferation of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Our results suggested that zzso of zzso signaling pathways play a critical role in zzso zzso of zzso leading to proliferation of zzso which does not involved increased zzso of zzso
