The zzso of pea zzso tissue with the bean pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso resistance response causing a complete zzso of zzso growth within 6 to 8 zzso In addition to previously reported zzso by zzso we now report that components of this response are also induced by a zzso released from this zzso A single band of protein corresponding with zzso activity elicits zzso production and the zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso activity and the zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are heat stable but susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso mimics the intact fungus in inducing resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso causes similar zzso zzso changes in pea zzso such as increasing hypersensitive zzso and diminishing zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stained zzso
