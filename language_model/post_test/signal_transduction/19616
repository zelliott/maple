zzso in brain density and signaling associated with zzso receptors are believed to play a role in depressive zzso This study evaluates the functional status of zzso in zzso frontal zzso of depressed zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity induced by the zzso zzso zzso were measured in zzso in samples from 15 suicide victims with an zzso diagnosis of major depression and 15 matched control zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ between zzso In depressed victims, an increase in zzso zzso binding potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso depressed zzso zzso and a significant reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso p zzso zzso were observed after incubation with the zzso zzso zzso No differences were found between zzso and zzso zzso A significant relationship between zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso values for zzso zzso was found zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The dual regulation of zzso signaling pathways raises the possibility that factors affecting the zzso cycle and/or selective access of zzso to zzso might be relevant to zzso abnormalities in depression, providing further support for the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso
