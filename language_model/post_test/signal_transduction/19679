A recent study by our group indicated that peripheral B cells in chronic zzso C zzso patients are infected with zzso C virus zzso This raised the logical question of how zzso zzso the zzso immune responses of B zzso Because type I zzso zzso plays a critical role in the innate zzso immune response, zzso expression levels in peripheral B cells from zzso patients were zzso and these levels were found to be comparable to those in normal B cells, which suggested that zzso infection failed to trigger zzso immune responses in B zzso zzso mechanisms for invading viruses in host immune cells involve zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both pathways culminate in zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus for zzso gene zzso Although the expression levels of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso were substantially enhanced in zzso B cells, zzso and subsequent nuclear zzso of zzso were not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso expression of both zzso was markedly enhanced in zzso B zzso However, reduced expression of heat shock protein of 90 zzso a zzso zzso and enhanced expression of zzso an zzso zzso were observed in zzso B cells, which might suppress the zzso activity of zzso for zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso membrane zzso zzso a putative inhibitor of zzso zzso was negligible in B zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso B cells as a zzso for persistent zzso
