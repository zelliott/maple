zzso signal sequences are DNA motifs that promote DNA zzso by competent bacteria in the family zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso of these bacteria contain many copies of their zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso so the bias of the zzso machinery causes cells to prefer DNA derived from close relatives over DNA from other zzso However, the molecular and evolutionary forces responsible for the abundance of zzso sequences in these zzso are not well zzso and their presence is not easily explained by any of the current models of the evolution of zzso Here we describe use of a computer simulation model to thoroughly evaluate the simplest explanation for zzso zzso that they accumulate in zzso by a form of molecular drive generated by biased DNA zzso and zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso In parallel we used an unbiased search zzso to characterize zzso zzso sequences and DNA zzso zzso to refine the zzso zzso zzso zzso These analyses showed that biased zzso and neutral zzso are sufficient to drive zzso sequences to high zzso with the zzso zzso and strong consensus typical of zzso sequences in real zzso This result greatly zzso testing of hypotheses about the benefits of DNA zzso because it explains how zzso could have passively accumulated sequences matching the bias of their zzso zzso
