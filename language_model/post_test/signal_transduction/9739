The broad definition of zzso is the application of a series of alternating intervals of brief zzso zzso and zzso zzso applied in the setting of prolonged zzso causing zzso zzso While the conditioning stimulus is applied before the major zzso zzso event in zzso zzso it is applied during the event in zzso and applied after the event zzso in zzso Studies on zzso have only recently demonstrated a reduction in zzso size by remote zzso applied during transport of heart attack victims to the hospital before zzso coronary interventions zzso The zzso paradigm has been extended to include remote zzso and remote zzso However, the biology of zzso is virtually zzso zzso has enjoyed enthusiastic attention from scientists that have done much to demonstrate that the model of zzso zzso and zzso used in zzso may also apply to zzso with the addition and important contribution of zzso mechanisms resulting in zzso including gradual zzso of tissue zzso reduction in generation of zzso oxygen species, and avoidance of zzso This same zzso has not been confirmed in zzso However, the unknowns in both conditioning zzso far outweigh the zzso Why zzso does not exert zzso in experimental models of zzso and aging, yet reduces zzso injury and zzso dysfunction in older patients with multiple zzso is a conundrum for which no answers are zzso The optimal zzso is unknown, as is the zzso between the many zzso zzso and zzso pathways that purportedly zzso or zzso the conditioning zzso Whether there are common pathways engaged in all 3 forms of zzso and what zzso separate one form of conditioning from another are unanswered zzso Yet, the zzso potential of zzso and zzso will drive further experimental work and clinical trials, which will ask unprecedented cooperation and information sharing between basic and zzso scientists, and creative developments from zzso
