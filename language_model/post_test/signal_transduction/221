Recent studies have established a new regulatory axis in the zzso system zzso In this zzso zzso zzso is finally produced from zzso I or zzso II by the zzso activity of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso shows actions different from those of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso As the zzso efficiency of zzso is approximately zzso higher with zzso II as a zzso than with zzso I, this axis is possibly acting as a zzso system against the zzso zzso zzso zzso The signaling zzso of the zzso axis has not yet been totally and clearly zzso However, a recent report suggests that the zzso zzso acts as a zzso for zzso zzso signaling through zzso is not clear zzso Several factors such as zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso seem to be involved in this signaling zzso Further investigations are needed to clarify the regulation and mechanism of action of zzso and zzso However, this second axis through zzso and zzso in zzso can be an important target for the therapy of cardiovascular and zzso zzso
