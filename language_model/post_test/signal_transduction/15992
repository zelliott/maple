zzso is an increasingly prevalent condition that zzso worldwide with the epidemic of type 2 diabetes zzso zzso It would seem logical to expect that the occurrence of zzso increases the likelihood of developing zzso due to its deleterious effect on the cerebral zzso and the associated hormonal and zzso zzso Many reports indicate that it also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease zzso However, other studies suggest that diabetes might have a relatively strong protective effect against zzso whereas genetically engineered animal models of the condition deteriorate more severely when there is a zzso insulin resistant brain state zzso Furthermore, zzso alone is associated with zzso zzso and molecular changes that justify the proposal that zzso may be due to an zzso This is explored in the context of accumulating evidence that the zzso need not be related to peripheral insulin resistance, and that administration of insulin directly to the brain improves selected cognitive parameters targeted in zzso This view is consistent with the zzso zzso hypothesis of zzso zzso which can help unifying the zzso effects of agents toxic to zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cells, as well as zzso caused by different mechanisms in zzso Such approach may help tackling the Innovation Gap, which results from a host of factors slowing down progress towards innovative zzso and prevention of zzso as well as zzso due to complications of diabetes distinct from zzso and both conditions combined with their commonly associated zzso and hormonal zzso
