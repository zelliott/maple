Central nervous system development requires precise and localized regulation of neural precursor zzso Here we show how the interaction between growth factor and zzso zzso pathways provides a mechanism for such precision in zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso were not in themselves sufficient to promote zzso zzso they did so on zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso Upon zzso exposure and zzso engagement, a physical zzso between both receptors was demonstrated, confirming the interaction between these zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which in turn induced zzso proliferation via a zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies establish a mechanism by which zzso proliferation is dependent on the availability of both an zzso zzso and a zzso growth zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso zzso is the critical zzso step in proliferation zzso and ensures that the response of neural precursor cells to long-range cues can be regulated by their cellular zzso allowing precise control of cell zzso during zzso
