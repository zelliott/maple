zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso binds a zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso and forms a signaling complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling activates cellular pathways that are required for normal induction of the zzso bud zzso from the zzso duct zzso Failure of zzso formation results in bilateral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both the zzso and zzso compartments of the developing kidney while zzso expression is specific to the zzso The biological importance of zzso wider tissue expression and its role in later kidney development are zzso We discovered that conditional loss of zzso in the zzso zzso prior to zzso branching is sufficient to cause zzso zzso This finding indicates that zzso expressed in the zzso structures cannot compensate for this zzso To determine zzso role in branching zzso after zzso induction we used an zzso zzso zzso strain and deleted zzso from the majority of zzso tip cells post zzso induction in zzso and in zzso kidney zzso We report that zzso zzso from the zzso compartment after zzso induction caused a modest reduction in branching zzso The loss of zzso from zzso cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and decreased activated zzso zzso Further, cells without zzso expression are able to populate the branching zzso zzso These findings delineate previously unclear biological roles of zzso in the urinary tract and demonstrate its zzso and zzso requirements in kidney zzso
