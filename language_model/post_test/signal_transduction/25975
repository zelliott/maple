zzso reduces zzso responses after zzso stroke primarily by acting on zzso and zzso but relatively little is known about the direct effects of zzso on cortical zzso which are often damaged in zzso We found by zzso and zzso that cortical zzso express zzso zzso Treatment of primary cortical zzso in culture with zzso increased zzso survival after exposure to zzso deprivation zzso or zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso in cortical zzso zzso with the specific zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso zzso zzso with a functional blocking zzso to the zzso zzso reduced both zzso and zzso zzso and blocked zzso zzso protection of cortical zzso These data suggest that zzso provides zzso by acting via zzso zzso and zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
