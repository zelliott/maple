Nuclear factor zzso B zzso plays a potential role in tolerance by orchestrating onset and resolution of inflammation and regulatory T cell differentiation through zzso zzso We characterized cellular infiltrates and expression of zzso zzso and its upstream regulators zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from patients with spontaneous clinical operational tolerance zzso 

zzso kidney zzso zzso from 40 patients with zzso zzso zzso rejection zzso zzso borderline changes zzso zzso and long-term zzso function without rejection zzso zzso were used in the zzso Cellular infiltrates and zzso expression of key proteins of the zzso zzso were evaluated in the cortical zzso and in cellular infiltrates using digital image analysis zzso zzso were given as zzso 

zzso from patients with zzso exhibited a comparable amount of cellular zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but a significantly higher proportion of zzso box zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in cellular infiltrates was significantly elevated in zzso zzso and zzso when analyzing the number of positive cells per zzso zzso and positive cells per zzso cells zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso expression were significantly higher in zzso and BC but not in zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso similar tendencies were observed zzso 

zzso from zzso patients show significant cellular infiltrates but a distinct expression of proteins involved in the zzso zzso and a higher proportion of zzso box zzso zzso
