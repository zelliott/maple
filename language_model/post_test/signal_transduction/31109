As zzso programs become stabilized in zzso cells by progressive patterning of zzso structures, cells lose their plasticity and the ability to freely modify their identity in response to changing zzso zzso By contrast, stem cells maintain this flexibility, enabling them to embark on different determination zzso However, zzso of tissue requires an exception because determined cells are forced to switch their zzso programs to reconstruct the missing zzso In zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso discs can even switch to a new disc zzso New studies show that the increased plasticity observed during zzso results from the action of multiple signaling pathways on zzso malleability, zzso profiles, and expression of zzso zzso zzso how signaling pathways can integrate to switch determined cells into zzso cells has a great medical potential, especially in the field of tissue engineering and zzso
