zzso zzso zzso generated from the zzso zzso zzso causes chronic zzso leukemia and acute zzso zzso To examine the roles of zzso individual signaling molecules and their cooperation in zzso we zzso expressed a dominant negative zzso form of zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone or in combination in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso Ras zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth by 90, 55, and zzso zzso During the growth zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso D3 was suppressed by zzso zzso or Delta zzso that of zzso E by zzso and that of zzso A by Delta zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso in a small proportion of zzso whereas zzso and Delta zzso were hardly zzso In contrast, zzso of two zzso zzso in any combinations induced severe zzso During these cultures, the expression of zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso or Delta zzso and that of zzso by zzso Furthermore, although zzso was resistant to zzso and zzso zzso disruption of one zzso by zzso zzso or Delta zzso zzso zzso to these zzso These results suggested that cooperation among these molecules is required for full zzso activities of zzso
