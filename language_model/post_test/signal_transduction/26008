Four and a half zzso protein 1 zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein family and plays important roles in muscle growth and zzso However, the biological function of zzso remains largely zzso Here, we show that zzso physically and functionally zzso with zzso receptors zzso which are involved in breast cancer development and zzso zzso bound specifically to the zzso zzso domain of zzso Physical interaction of zzso and zzso is required for zzso repression of zzso gene zzso zzso affected recruitment of zzso to an zzso promoter and zzso binding to an zzso zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells decreased expression of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso with zzso small interfering zzso increased the expression of these zzso Further analysis of 46 breast cancer samples showed that zzso expression zzso associated with zzso gene expression in breast cancer zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso as well as breast cancer cell growth zzso
