zzso insulin receptors were inserted into zzso by fusion with zzso zzso The number of receptors was increased approximately two times as monitored by insulin binding zzso zzso of zzso receptors resulted in increased zzso zzso The zzso added receptors could be coupled to the zzso zzso system as shown by increased zzso of the insulin zzso zzso 1, zzso and by increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso was partly zzso to zzso This method for introducing insulin receptors into cells represents a novel system to study the zzso of insulin zzso and may provide information as to the role of variation of zzso number in insulin action in cellular metabolism of specific zzso
