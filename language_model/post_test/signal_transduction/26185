The heat shock protein 90 zzso plays a crucial role in the stability of several proteins that are essential for cell survival and for zzso zzso The binding of zzso with zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso degradation of zzso and contributes to the functional stabilization of zzso signaling and cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso are therefore highly zzso in a large panel of cancer cell lines and are present in zzso zzso In this paper, we investigated whether targeting both zzso and zzso would inhibit the survival zzso in zzso cells zzso gastric zzso zzso and how zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso for 30 zzso or 18 zzso respectively, were treated with DC zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was evaluated by measuring the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in whole zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso zzso were treated with DC, and zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso cells were counted according to changes of cell zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The intrinsic level of zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso inactive zzso and zzso were highly expressed in zzso cells indicating the active zzso zzso zzso zzso at low concentration zzso zzso slightly inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso zzso to 55 zzso fragment, no significant effect on zzso zzso up to 4 h (as assessed by zzso zzso was zzso The higher zzso of DC zzso zzso zzso resulted in progressive zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and specific zzso of zzso to approximately 45 zzso fragments with significant induction of zzso Although DC zzso zzso had no profound effect on zzso and did not induce zzso it became an zzso of zzso when cells were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso with these findings, significant zzso of zzso in response to DC zzso zzso was observed in cells with depleted zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso with specific zzso of zzso to 45 zzso zzso the zzso effects of DC in gastric zzso They further indicate the importance of stable zzso complex in regulation of zzso zzso
