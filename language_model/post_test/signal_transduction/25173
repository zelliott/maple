The zzso domain zzso zzso zzso has been shown earlier to bind to the zzso growth factor zzso and to have the capacity for zzso zzso New zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on the zzso system were constructed and employed to generate stable cell lines with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and of zzso DNA binding of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso was localized in the zzso with an enrichment in the zzso zzso Association of zzso with zzso structures may form the basis for a partial zzso with zzso observed in different types of zzso cells and also with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells or of zzso human zzso expressing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in partial nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, zzso may interact with zzso or regulatory proteins in zzso or nuclear zzso
