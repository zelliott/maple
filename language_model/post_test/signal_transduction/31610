zzso the main regulator of the systemic response to stress, is also expressed in the skin where it is incorporated into a local zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate the mechanisms of the induction of the zzso zzso response in human zzso we used zzso as an zzso zzso Human normal zzso cultured in zzso were zzso with graded doses of zzso and the zzso responses were measured in cell extracts and/or zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso stimulation of the zzso promoter was suppressed by pharmacological zzso of protein zzso A or by zzso zzso a dominant zzso zzso response element zzso protein zzso zzso also zzso zzso of zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso sites in the zzso promoter, and activity of the reporter gene construct driven by consensus zzso zzso zzso in the zzso site in the zzso promoter rendered the corresponding reporter gene construct less responsive to zzso in both normal and zzso zzso In addition to zzso effects, zzso activated the zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso and zzso release, whereas an zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso the zzso induction of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso production in human zzso through stimulation of the protein zzso A pathway, with sequential involvement of zzso zzso 1 in the stimulation of zzso zzso
