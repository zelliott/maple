Type I zzso zzso are known to be critical factors in the zzso of host zzso responses and are also important in protection from influenza A virus zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso type I zzso zzso is essential in the zzso of zzso responses in cells infected by influenza A zzso Previously, it has been reported that influenza A virus zzso is involved in the zzso of this zzso We show in this report that the influenza A virus zzso another critical zzso mechanism in this zzso In fact, the viral zzso complex exhibited an zzso activity on zzso promoter zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and this activity was not competitive with the function of zzso zzso analysis revealed that each zzso zzso bound to zzso in zzso cells, and each zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso promoter by zzso zzso In addition, by a zzso expression of each zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter was more efficiently inhibited by the expression of zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso zzso gene induced after influenza A virus zzso These findings demonstrate that the viral zzso plays an important role for regulating host zzso response through the binding to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
