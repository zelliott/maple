Recent findings zzso embryonic signaling centers in patterning the zzso cerebral zzso We used mouse in zzso zzso and zzso analysis to test whether cortical signaling sources interact to regulate one zzso We identified interactions between the cortical zzso rich in zzso zzso proteins and bone zzso proteins zzso and an anterior zzso source of zzso growth factors zzso zzso the zzso domain suppressed zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso Next to the zzso the zzso was zzso consistent with its dependence for growth on a zzso zzso zzso Maintenance of hem zzso signaling and zzso development thus require a constraint on the zzso source, which is likely to be supplied by zzso zzso When zzso zzso signaling is inhibited by zzso robust zzso expression appears zzso in the cortical zzso zzso signaling centers were further investigated in mice lacking the zzso factor zzso in which zzso activity is increased, zzso expression reduced, and the zzso zzso zzso that these defects are zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso substantially recovered zzso expression in the hem and partially rescued zzso zzso Because zzso can induce zzso zzso we examined zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso zzso As the zzso zzso closed, zzso expression was expanded and zzso activity reduced, potentially leading to zzso zzso Our findings point to a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling in the early zzso integrated by zzso and required for normal cortical zzso
