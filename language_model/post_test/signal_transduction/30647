In zzso and pathological events, zzso zzso plays an important role by controlling several types of zzso receptors and changing zzso zzso To know the process of zzso zzso zzso we focused on zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso and investigated the dynamics of zzso in zzso cells through fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging, and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso As a result, zzso induced zzso zzso increase, following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was not observed in cells expressing zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso suppressed zzso These results indicate that zzso influx through zzso receptors zzso the formation of zzso rods via zzso zzso of zzso This zzso might be one candidate to explain the effects of zzso on zzso development and zzso
