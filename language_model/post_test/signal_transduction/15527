zzso zzso zzso is a common human cancer with high zzso and zzso there is no effective zzso or systematic zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways are implicated in zzso Here, we report that omega-3 zzso fatty acids zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso inhibit zzso growth through simultaneously zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso treatment resulted in a zzso reduction of cell viability with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in three human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso a zzso zzso exhibited no significant zzso zzso and zzso treatment caused zzso and thus zzso of zzso leading to zzso degradation in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso partially prevented zzso zzso protein degradation and zzso Additionally, zzso induced the formation of zzso binding complex, which serves as a parallel mechanism for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso signaling through zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the growth of zzso in zzso was significantly reduced when mouse zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso transgenic mice, which express a zzso zzso zzso converting zzso to omega-3 zzso zzso These findings provide important zzso evidence and molecular insight for zzso of omega-3 zzso for the zzso and treatment of human zzso
