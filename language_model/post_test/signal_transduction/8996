The zzso of cellular damage is a feature common to all aging cells and leads to decreased ability of the zzso to zzso The overall rate at which damage accumulates is influenced by zzso zzso factors zzso pathways and regulatory zzso that control lifespan through adjusting mechanisms for maintenance and zzso zzso the major zzso process of zzso cells that degrades and zzso damaged zzso and zzso is implicated in aging and in the zzso of diverse age-related zzso Recent evidence has revealed that zzso activity is required for lifespan extension in various zzso zzso organisms, and that numerous zzso genes or proteins are directly regulated by longevity zzso These findings support the emerging view that zzso is a central regulatory mechanism for aging in diverse zzso zzso
