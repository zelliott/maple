To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso in rat bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso zzso them to differentiate into zzso cells through the zzso signaling zzso 

zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso bearing zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these cells were examined by zzso or Western zzso analysis and the activity of the zzso signaling zzso was evaluated by measuring the zzso status of zzso 

zzso of zzso in rat zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and decreased the ratio of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, thus zzso the zzso zzso down the expression of zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso partially blocked the role of the zzso and decreased those zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in rat zzso zzso them toward cardiac differentiation through the zzso the zzso signal zzso
