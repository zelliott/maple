zzso are zzso cells essential for bone zzso To study the derivation of these interesting cells, we developed a zzso culture system where zzso cells promote embryonic stem zzso cells to differentiate into mature zzso Three zzso to this differentiation process include zzso induction of zzso along with the generation of zzso zzso zzso expansion of these zzso and zzso terminal differentiation into mature zzso in the presence of zzso D3 zzso Although the transition of zzso cells to the zzso lineage was not blocked by an zzso to zzso later zzso were dependent on a signaling through this zzso zzso as indicated by the finding that zzso treatment of cells in the second and third zzso reduced the number of zzso produced by zzso and more than zzso zzso zzso of signaling through another zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect any stages of zzso although generation of other zzso lineages was reduced to less than zzso of zzso When small numbers of zzso cells were directly cultured under conditions that promote zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso cells were observed at the edge but not inside of zzso This suggests that some types of zzso interactions may inhibit development of mature zzso The culture system developed here provides an important tool for zzso zzso
