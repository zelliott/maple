We have previously shown that, although zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso high affinity binding of zzso growth factor zzso to the zzso zzso zzso it does not inhibit zzso zzso of the zzso into zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that, upon zzso binding and incubation at 37 degrees C, the zzso was zzso regardless of zzso of zzso zzso In cells not zzso zzso zzso the zzso was rapidly zzso and zzso In cells being zzso due to zzso of zzso zzso however, the zzso was upon prolonged chase first found in deeply zzso coated pits, and then eventually moved out of the coated pits and back onto the smooth plasma zzso zzso occurred equally efficiently in cells with or without intact zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso and zzso was somewhat zzso We further found that the zzso zzso of zzso occurred both in the absence and presence of zzso with the same zzso as zzso of the zzso but that the zzso zzso of zzso was somewhat reduced upon zzso of zzso zzso Our data show that zzso zzso of the zzso occurs at the plasma zzso
