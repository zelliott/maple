In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compete for zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso We have recently shown that zzso is the strongly preferred zzso for EPO in zzso and that zzso in contrast with other zzso zzso and zzso is a relatively weak, zzso zzso zzso zzso We here show that zzso is a uniquely potent (up to zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue factor zzso activity in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso This induction is attributable to zzso zzso of zzso gene expression dependent upon both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor and activity of the zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso and was markedly further enhanced in the presence of zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also markedly activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings we zzso that zzso generated by adherent and zzso zzso may provoke the development of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso that promotes the pronounced zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso
