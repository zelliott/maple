Body size in zzso larvae, like in other animals, is controlled by zzso zzso restriction leads to zzso responses in the majority of zzso but the zzso zzso zzso discs continue zzso The nature of these differential control mechanisms that spare distinct zzso from zzso are poorly zzso Here, we reveal that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for cell growth and proliferation through the zzso zzso in the zzso wing zzso Both zzso and insulin zzso zzso signaling activate zzso and drive cellular proliferation and tissue zzso However, whereas optimal growth requires signaling from both zzso and zzso zzso changes zzso by zzso only occur when both signaling pathways are zzso The combined activities of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso provide an zzso two-tiered reaction threshold to varying nutritional conditions that promote zzso organ growth even at low levels of zzso zzso
