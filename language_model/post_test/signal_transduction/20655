zzso zzso factors zzso that bind small zzso molecules zzso zzso that drive genes that respond to environmental zzso often display a zzso zzso profile for zzso of the bona fide chemical zzso zzso the master zzso for expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso responds not only to the aromatic compound but also, albeit to a lesser extent, to many other aromatic compounds, such as zzso zzso We have examined whether such a relaxed regulatory scenario can be reshaped into a zzso regime by changing the connectivity of this zzso zzso within the rest of the circuit rather than zzso zzso structure zzso To this end, the natural negative feedback loop that operates on zzso zzso was modified with a zzso zzso that brings down the response to zzso while maintaining the zzso output induced by zzso (as measured with a zzso reporter zzso zzso expression was then subject to a positive feedback loop in which the zzso was transcribed from its own target zzso each known to hold different zzso transfer zzso In the first case zzso under the strong promoter of the upper zzso zzso zzso the reporter system displayed an increased zzso capacity in the resulting network for both the optimal and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso was expressed under the weaker Ps promoter, the resulting circuit unmistakably zzso zzso from zzso The zzso connectivity engineered in the network resulted both in a higher promoter activity and also in a zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the working regimes of given genetic circuits can be dramatically altered through simple changes in the way upstream zzso factors are zzso by positive or negative feedback zzso
