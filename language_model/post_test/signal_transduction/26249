zzso is associated with zzso tissue zzso and is thought to be linked to the chronic zzso inflammation of zzso zzso although the precise mechanism has remained zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of a prominent zzso on human primary zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso array and zzso analysis, we compared the zzso patterns of zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso and observed various zzso in zzso zzso We could reproduce known zzso like an induction of zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and a reduction in zzso release under zzso Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction in the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso under zzso zzso stimulation of hypoxic zzso resulted in a significantly reduced zzso of zzso and its inhibitor zzso compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, chronic treatment of hypoxic zzso with zzso resulted in an expected higher zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso but under zzso the zzso level was substantially lower than that under zzso This reduction in protein release was accompanied by a reduced zzso expression of zzso whereas zzso zzso expression was not zzso Additionally, we observed a significantly reduced expression of the zzso zzso possibly being one cause for the reduced responsiveness of hypoxic zzso towards zzso zzso 

In conclusion, human primary zzso show a zzso and zzso reduction of zzso release under zzso This effect may be due to a reduced expression of zzso and therefore attenuated zzso zzso zzso These observations demonstrate a reduced responsiveness of hypoxic zzso towards inflammatory stimuli like zzso which may represent an adaptation process to maintain zzso tissue function under zzso and inflammatory zzso
