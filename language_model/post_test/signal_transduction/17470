The initiation of zzso in zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso factor which is activated by zzso through a zzso mechanism that is dependent upon the activity of one or more protein zzso The zzso activity of one of these protein zzso zzso was found to be inhibited in zzso by certain fatty zzso The most potent zzso have at least one zzso double bond in the zzso zzso and a chain length of zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso with a trans double bond are not zzso zzso zzso or zzso fatty acids are either much weaker zzso or have no zzso The zzso prevent zzso of zzso and are zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to contain at least one as yet unidentified type of fatty acid that, when present in an zzso form, inhibited zzso The results suggest that the concentration of a specific zzso fatty acid may act as a signal linking the initiation of zzso to the status of membrane synthesis and zzso or some other specific zzso zzso
