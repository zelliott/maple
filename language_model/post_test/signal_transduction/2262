zzso is a B cell membrane zzso that, upon zzso zzso engagement, becomes rapidly zzso zzso and associates with several signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in strains such as zzso and zzso whereas zzso is expressed in zzso and most other zzso zzso cells, which derive from a zzso zzso zzso zzso express one copy of each zzso Previous studies have proposed both positive and negative functions for zzso We explored the role of zzso in surface zzso zzso zzso signal zzso by examining signaling in three zzso independent zzso zzso that have lost expression of the zzso zzso This experimental design allowed us to assess the signaling functions of zzso independent of its zzso zzso These zzso which exhibit a 50% reduction of total surface zzso are zzso to zzso zzso zzso several cellular proteins are zzso on zzso zzso and surface zzso calcium flux is markedly zzso Interestingly, the increased calcium response observed in zzso cells is due largely to enhanced calcium zzso zzso of zzso expression reduces these zzso The zzso association is reduced in zzso cell lines and is restored by zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a cell autonomous negative regulator of B cell zzso zzso zzso and suggest that it regulates calcium entry via a mechanism downstream from or independent of calcium release from zzso zzso
