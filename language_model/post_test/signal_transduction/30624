zzso zzso is a growth and survival factor in human prostate cancer zzso cells with aggressive zzso and has been implicated in the progression of hormone zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso A1 as an important downstream target of zzso Treatment of cells with zzso inhibitor or zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso decreased zzso A1 promoter zzso zzso A1 promoter activity and its expression were zzso by zzso active zzso zzso and were zzso by dominant negative zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso A1 are resistant to zzso zzso zzso targeted zzso of zzso A1 via zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in decreased survival after treatment with zzso This suggests that zzso A1 is an important downstream target of zzso that zzso survival signals in response to zzso zzso zzso tumors generated from zzso cells expressing zzso had higher levels of zzso A1 and had rapid tumor growth compared to zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso might zzso zzso and zzso A1 to promote tumor cell survival in zzso
