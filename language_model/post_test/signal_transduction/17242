zzso death domain zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso contains both a zzso and a death zzso domain zzso that are important in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a unique member of the zzso zzso in that it has a domain with sequence and structural characteristics of both zzso and zzso We show that zzso forms a complex with zzso and diminishes zzso zzso death zzso The zzso of zzso is required for the complex formation with zzso Following spinal zzso injury, transgenic mice zzso zzso exhibit increased zzso survival, decreased zzso of zzso tract fibers and improved functional zzso zzso zzso cellular and molecular mechanisms may provide insights into zzso nerve zzso in zzso
