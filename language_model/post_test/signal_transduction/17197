zzso and zzso are both important zzso proteins associated with several types of zzso zzso of these 2 proteins had long been thought to contribute to cancer progression and poor zzso thus, therapies targeting zzso and zzso signaling pathways have been applied in recent zzso zzso is a zzso targeted zzso that being widely used for the management of zzso positive breast cancer, which demonstrate significant benefits in both the zzso and zzso zzso However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10 zzso Identification of zzso best suited for and most likely to respond to zzso is of utmost zzso We analyzed the signaling pathways of zzso and found that zzso shares a very similar downstream network with zzso while zzso lies in the upstream of zzso and could promotes its expression through zzso This discovery suggests that the zzso directed zzso zzso may activate downstream signals of zzso despite zzso zzso Here, we hypothesized that in zzso zzso breast cancer cases, zzso of zzso bypass may account for the resistance to zzso directed zzso zzso zzso of zzso might enhance zzso sensitivity and zzso reverse the resistant zzso in zzso positive breast zzso Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of zzso zzso Nevertheless, wet lab experiments and clinical trials are still zzso
