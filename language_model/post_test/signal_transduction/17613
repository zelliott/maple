We have cloned and zzso new zzso coli genes which belong to member of the family of environmentally responsive zzso system and named zzso and zzso because their zzso acid sequences were found the most zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso They were mapped at 51 zzso and extending from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso library of the zzso coli zzso In fact, both zzso and zzso proteins predicted from their DNA sequences were identified in the in zzso coupled zzso translation zzso When the zzso and zzso were expressed on multiple copy zzso in an zzso deletion strain, zzso expression was also regulated by temperature, zzso and zzso acid, by which zzso of zzso zzso is controlled via zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso expression was controlled by in zzso zzso via zzso and zzso which can work in zzso coli the same way as zzso and zzso
