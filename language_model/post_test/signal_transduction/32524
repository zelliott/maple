zzso A combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso recording, zzso dialysis and pharmacological techniques have been employed to study zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso within rat zzso zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso zzso steps applied through the zzso resulted in transient increases in the zzso zzso by the zzso indicator zzso The intensity of the zzso zzso was zzso to the magnitude of the zzso currents recorded through the zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso currents ran down in parallel over a period of between approximately zzso zzso The zzso zzso were considered, therefore, to be caused by increases in zzso free zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso led to compound zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso These zzso but not the zzso disappeared with a time course similar to that of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso under zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence images were obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso starting at least 30 zzso after obtaining zzso access to the zzso zzso were obtained only after zzso zzso channel activity had run down zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in compound zzso and zzso zzso currents zzso under zzso and zzso zzso In both cases, these were invariably associated with zzso zzso zzso In cells zzso at zzso zzso the fluorescent signal increased on average zzso during the zzso and decayed to baseline values with a zzso zzso of approximately 5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso partially reduced the zzso zzso without affecting the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso which also depressed the zzso substantially reduced or eliminated the zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic currents displayed the typical region of negative slope zzso in the peak zzso relationship (between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed a similar anomalous zzso zzso decreasing in size from zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
