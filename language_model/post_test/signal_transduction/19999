Loss of zzso zzso gene function can occur as a result of zzso zzso of large zzso regions, referred to as long-range zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses have revealed that zzso is present in many cancer zzso Here we zzso zzso zzso zzso array analysis to identify zzso across zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to normal zzso zzso DNA zzso This region encompasses 53 individual zzso zzso genes divided among three gene zzso zzso within these gene clusters is zzso while most zzso zzso occurs early, and is apparent in zzso zzso promoter zzso occurs later in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso according to zzso array zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction showed that zzso is the highest expressed zzso in normal zzso zzso and that there was a strong zzso relationship between zzso zzso and expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns are reflected in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines are not zzso at zzso and show abundant expression at the zzso and protein level, while the expression is suppressed in zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso led to a decrease of zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in the reduction of colony formation, consistent with zzso zzso capabilities for zzso Further functional analysis showed that zzso can suppress zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso locus in zzso cancer, and that zzso may be a strong marker and driver for the zzso zzso
