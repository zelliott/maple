zzso is well recognized for its potent capacity to activate mouse zzso to produce zzso an important inflammatory zzso in innate host zzso We demonstrate here that, although inducing little NO alone, DNA from both zzso and zzso bacteria zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to induce NO in cultures of zzso zzso zzso The effects of the DNA are zzso by synthetic zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso This synergistic activity is not inhibited by zzso zzso against zzso zzso of zzso with DNA for zzso h suppresses subsequent synergistic zzso responses to zzso whereas prolonged zzso with zzso enhances zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso levels of the zzso NO zzso gene are also zzso suppressed or zzso These findings indicate that temporally controlled, synergistic interactions exist between microbial DNA and zzso in the induction of zzso NO via enhanced zzso NO zzso gene zzso
