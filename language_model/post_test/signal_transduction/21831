zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is activated by an array of zzso stimuli and is a key player in the regulation of cell zzso The zzso process of zzso zzso involves a complex and sequential series of multiple zzso zzso and is mainly zzso via zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulators of zzso such as zzso and protein zzso B zzso are recruited to the membrane via their zzso zzso zzso or zzso interaction zzso However, the mechanism of integration of zzso into a zzso complex around activated zzso zzso zzso is not zzso In the present study, we describe a specific interaction between zzso with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso The interaction with zzso is zzso via the zzso or the zzso extension domain of zzso Complex formation is zzso by growth factors and leads to zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have shown that the zzso is exerted via a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso towards zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso lead to a reduction in zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we mapped the sites of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso at these sites does not affect their activity or zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso is recruited into a complex with zzso and zzso and becomes zzso on zzso in response to zzso or zzso
