zzso of zzso transport in response to insulin or zzso stress is an important zzso of cardiac zzso function and survival, particularly during zzso zzso The impact of zzso and its consequence zzso zzso on zzso zzso transport in cardiac zzso remains zzso zzso adult rat cardiac zzso were chronically exposed to free fatty acids zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso and related cell signaling were zzso Exposure of cardiac zzso to zzso reduced both zzso and zzso Exposure to either zzso or zzso zzso but not to a zzso zzso reduced zzso but not zzso and increased fatty acid zzso zzso The reduction in zzso was associated with impaired insulin signaling and, in the case of zzso zzso zzso of zzso a protein known to hinder zzso insulin zzso In contrast, the reduction of zzso could not be explained by a reduced activity of the cellular zzso system, as assessed from the maintained zzso state of zzso zzso of zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso restored zzso but not zzso Seemingly zzso further stimulation of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso also restored zzso but not zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso occurs downstream of energy gauging and is caused by some zzso of fatty acid zzso which does not appear to be zzso The results indicate that the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso and zzso differ zzso
