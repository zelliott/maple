zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are producers of the zzso antibiotics zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, all of which are bacterial zzso zzso In an attempt to develop a general zzso method for zzso monitoring of secondary zzso from culture extracts of these zzso we used superior mass zzso zzso The aim was to develop and apply a technique for the rapid analysis of zzso culture extracts with respect to those zzso thereby providing a method for screening extracts of genetically modified strains for new zzso active antibiotics with improved pharmacological zzso The combination of full scan mass zzso zzso parent zzso scan zzso product zzso scan zzso and zzso zzso fragmentation prior to product zzso scans zzso zzso using characteristic fragmentation of the central zzso unit, was employed for the detection and structural interpretation of expected and new zzso We were able to show the zzso of this methodology to the three culture zzso where the main zzso could be found, and to demonstrate its use for interpretation of secondary zzso zzso Some new compounds were discovered, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and several structurally and not yet fully zzso zzso derivatives or zzso
