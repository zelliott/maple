Cellular zzso is an effective zzso mechanism that causes a stable zzso arrest in cells with potentially zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the role of the zzso tumor zzso in the regulation of cellular zzso in human primary zzso We show that zzso triggers a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso protein accumulates in zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso by zzso interference zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso the ability to induce zzso is lost in a zzso version of zzso present in human zzso Using specific point zzso we further show that recognition of the zzso mark zzso is essential for induction of zzso by zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is associated to a specific genetic signature with a strong representation of zzso and zzso signaling factors, which significantly zzso with that of zzso zzso In zzso our results identify zzso as a critical zzso regulator of cellular zzso in human zzso and highlight its role in control of gene expression in the context of this zzso zzso
