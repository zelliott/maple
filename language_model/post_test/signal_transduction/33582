Mice lacking zzso zzso 9 zzso and its truncated zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso that zzso as an extra big toe on the right hind zzso zzso in zzso zzso knockout mice occurs with incomplete zzso and affects both genders zzso Because zzso can result from zzso of sonic zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso acted as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso We find that zzso a zzso factor and downstream zzso of zzso zzso is expressed at substantially higher levels in the feet of zzso zzso zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso To more directly examine whether zzso zzso zzso signaling we zzso cell lines that express components of the zzso zzso and that respond to the zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso stimulation of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso cell lines is inhibited by the expression of zzso In zzso cells, zzso treatment leads to an increase in the rate of cell zzso which is also inhibited by zzso This zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation was also observed in primary cultures of zzso zzso Although the mechanism by which it zzso zzso induction and cell proliferation by zzso is not clear, zzso zzso to the nucleus suggesting it acts just upstream of zzso zzso in the signaling cascade activated by zzso Taken together our results suggest that zzso acts as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso and that the absence of zzso results in zzso of this zzso resulting in zzso
