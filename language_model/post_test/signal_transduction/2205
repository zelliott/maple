The zzso channel of the hair cell is permeable to both zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso entering through the zzso channel serves as a feedback signal in the adaptation process that sets the channel's open zzso an understanding of adaptation requires zzso of the magnitude of zzso zzso To determine the zzso current through the zzso channel, we measured zzso zzso currents with zzso zzso recordings while the zzso surface of a zzso zzso was bathed with solutions containing various zzso of zzso zzso or zzso For modest zzso of a single zzso zzso zzso carried much more zzso current than did either zzso or zzso For higher zzso zzso however, the flux of zzso or zzso through the zzso channel exceeded that of zzso For zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso current displayed an anomalous zzso effect, which indicates that zzso interact while zzso the channel's zzso These results demonstrate not only that the hair cell's zzso channel is selective for zzso over zzso zzso but also that zzso carries substantial current even at low zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso flux through zzso channels can change the local zzso concentration in zzso in a range relevant for the control of zzso
