The zzso zzso activity of zzso fusion proteins plays an important role in the zzso of leukemia that is for the Philadelphia zzso zzso Because nuclear zzso is regulated during the cell cycle through a specific interaction with the zzso protein zzso the possible interaction of zzso with zzso in zzso cell lines was zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso associated with both zzso and zzso forms of zzso These findings suggest that zzso interferes with zzso function and thereby regulates cell zzso
