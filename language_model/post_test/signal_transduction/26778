Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of zzso zzso has been shown to contribute to tumor zzso after zzso however, the relationship between zzso and zzso remained zzso In this study, we investigated the association of zzso with zzso resistance and identified the underlying mechanisms of action of zzso in human breast cancer cell lines and tumor zzso We found that the expression level of zzso was closely associated with the resistance to zzso zzso The zzso cancer cell line, which highly expresses zzso is more resistant to zzso than the zzso zzso or zzso cancer cell lines, which had low-level expression of zzso zzso down of zzso in zzso high expression zzso cells increased the sensitivity to zzso treatment, while stable expression of zzso in breast cancer cells effectively attenuated the sensitivity to zzso treatment, resulting in a significant increase of zzso values of zzso zzso with zzso also significantly inhibited zzso zzso We also found that zzso expression was dramatically increased in tumor zzso after zzso chemotherapy or in local zzso or zzso breast cancer zzso Moreover, further studies showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the molecular targets of zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells considerably induced zzso and zzso expression and inhibited zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso expression might be one mechanism underlying zzso resistance in breast cancer, and zzso could be a potential target for overcoming zzso resistance in breast zzso
