The cellular prion protein zzso is a zzso anchored by zzso to the cell surface and is abundantly expressed in various zzso The putative roles of zzso are thought to be related to cell zzso survival, and differentiation and cancer zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso with a more aggressive and zzso zzso disease in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso mediates the process of zzso transition and, zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso cells revealed zzso of the special zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated to be involved in regulating zzso expression via the zzso zzso Since zzso has been previously proposed as a key protein that controls tumor development and zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a reduced zzso capacity in zzso cells, as well as a reduction in distant zzso in zzso In conclusion, our data characterize a novel molecular mechanism that links zzso expression to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso will, therefore, be a promising strategy to overcome the zzso advantage in zzso zzso
