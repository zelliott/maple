The four members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso are involved in a complex array of zzso interactions involving zzso and zzso Since most cell types express more than one member of the zzso family, it is difficult to distinguish the biological activities of different zzso and zzso Here we describe a method for inducing zzso or zzso of zzso receptors by using synthetic zzso without interference from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing synthetic zzso binding zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso domain zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso 2 zzso proteins zzso and zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso activated downstream signaling pathways leading to zzso and zzso zzso However, only zzso zzso were zzso upon zzso zzso and only zzso zzso were able to associate with and induce zzso of zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso were able to associate with and induce zzso of zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso were able to form zzso however, cells expressing zzso zzso displayed a five- to zzso higher zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso is unable to associate with zzso in a zzso zzso most likely because zzso is unable to zzso the zzso binding site on zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso differ in their abilities to transform zzso and provide evidence for differential signaling by zzso zzso and zzso These observations also validate the use of synthetic zzso to study the signaling and biological specificity of selected zzso zzso in any cell zzso
