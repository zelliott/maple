zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso in acute phase of heart zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso have been demonstrated on zzso zzso cells zzso functional zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the in zzso effect of zzso on activity of human origin zzso and the possible mechanism zzso zzso were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers without cardiovascular risk factors and zzso After ex zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a series of final zzso zzso zzso 1, and 10 zzso of zzso for 24 zzso In some other experiments, zzso were zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso and then zzso with 1 zzso zzso for 24 zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso and migration were determined, respectively, by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso migration zzso In addition, the vascular zzso vascular growth zzso zzso production has been examined using quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the total and zzso level of zzso was determined by Western zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso and zzso the zzso growth factor zzso at zzso and protein level, while exerted no influence on cell zzso However, zzso with zzso significantly diminished zzso zzso migration, zzso and zzso zzso One zzso per zzso zzso for 15 zzso activated zzso of zzso These results suggest a potent role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso could be involved in the regulation of zzso functions induced by zzso
