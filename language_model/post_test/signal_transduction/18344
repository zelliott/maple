zzso zzso differentiation within prostate tumors is proposed to be a contributing factor in disease zzso However, the cellular origin and molecular mechanism controlling differentiation of zzso zzso cells are zzso The prostate tumor cell line, zzso can zzso acquire many zzso characteristics in response to treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that these treatments induce protein zzso A zzso zzso in zzso cells and that zzso expression of a zzso activated form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in acquisition of zzso zzso including the extension of zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity, and production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells was significantly inhibited by expressing a dominant negative zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso differentiation in response to these agents depends on zzso zzso and this signaling zzso may provide a therapeutic target for treating advanced forms of prostate zzso
