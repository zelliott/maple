Human natural killer zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was investigated by flow zzso Over zzso of zzso cells bound zzso zzso and during incubation at 37 degrees C, the zzso occupancy decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells bind zzso or zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso zzso of in zzso zzso zzso from zzso was 130 zzso By zzso the zzso zzso with zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso the zzso decreases to 85 zzso In zzso study, it has been shown that zzso bound to zzso is slowly released in the culture zzso maybe zzso at acid zzso or partially zzso and zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was increased by zzso on cells cultured in the presence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, an increase in zzso of Lyn zzso zzso after zzso of zzso complex, was observed on zzso cells treated with zzso When the zzso was occupied by zzso the capacity of zzso cells to kill zzso target cells was decreased by zzso because the zzso inhibitor protects zzso from zzso Our data demonstrate that binding of zzso to human zzso cells is followed by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso degradation and zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor protects zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and may interfere in their killing zzso
