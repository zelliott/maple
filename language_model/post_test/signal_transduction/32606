zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of cell zzso Its zzso by growth factor requires zzso by various zzso on multiple zzso Data accumulated thus far support a model zzso zzso zzso requires sequential zzso at zzso zzso in the putative zzso zzso domain, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso a site in the zzso loop is zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso Experimental evidence suggests that zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso between zzso and zzso remain zzso Here, we have identified zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso as an upstream regulator of zzso In zzso experiments, we found that a zzso zzso zzso antagonized zzso of zzso by zzso growth factor, zzso and activated zzso and zzso While zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only modestly activated zzso this zzso cooperated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also enhanced by zzso Moreover, we have found that zzso can associate with both zzso and zzso in zzso in a growth zzso manner, while zzso and zzso can also associate with each other, suggesting the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso This work provides evidence for a link between a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The existence of a zzso zzso complex may enable efficient zzso of zzso in zzso
