zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso cells zzso to draining zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso by zzso of at least two zzso signals provided by tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso It has been reported previously that zzso injection of healthy human volunteers with zzso zzso or zzso each zzso a significant reduction in zzso frequency, as measured in zzso sheets prepared from zzso punch zzso In the current experiments, we have compared the frequency of zzso in punch zzso with those obtained zzso in zzso sheets from the roofs of zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso skin of healthy adult zzso There was a zzso approximately zzso reduction in zzso zzso numbers in zzso zzso roofs compared with punch zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a stimulus that provokes measurable zzso zzso zzso in punch biopsy sites, failed to provoke further zzso migration in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the mechanical trauma to the skin caused by the creation of zzso zzso provokes the degree of zzso inflammation necessary for zzso zzso The responsive cells zzso a proportion of resident zzso approximately zzso have already zzso thus addition of an zzso zzso signal zzso is without further zzso It is not possible therefore to measure the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, this technique provides an opportunity to profile induced changes in the zzso zzso environment, with zzso expression measured by a multiple zzso array zzso Using this technique, zzso injection of zzso was found to cause a marked zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in fluid from zzso zzso raised at the site of zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso technique appears to be a powerful tool for measurement of induced changes in zzso zzso
