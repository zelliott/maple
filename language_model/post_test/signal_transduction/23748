zzso in multiple zzso factor zzso protein 2 zzso are a cause of factor V and factor VIII combined zzso type 2 zzso zzso was also suggested to play an important role as an zzso factor in maintaining neural stem cell zzso The current work provided direct evidence that both zzso and human zzso can maintain stem cell zzso or zzso of zzso monkey embryonic stem cells zzso as basic zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso In most cases, zzso had identical effects on stem cells as zzso We investigated the possible mechanism of zzso to support stem cell zzso by highlighting the effects of zzso and zzso on several signaling pathways in zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 3 core zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso In addition, some features of signaling pathways zzso and zzso which are different from human embryonic stem cells zzso and mouse embryonic stem cells zzso are found in zzso indicating that zzso zzso have unique signaling zzso These results may shed light on the biological roles of zzso the zzso protein family distributed in both zzso and zzso The ability to support stem cell zzso may be the general function of the zzso protein zzso
