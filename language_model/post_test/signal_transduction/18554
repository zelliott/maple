To determine the role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression and protection in zzso 

zzso expression was studied in isolated zzso rat zzso zzso cultures in response to bacterial zzso zzso or following zzso with zzso active zzso or zzso and in hearts isolated from zzso or zzso zzso knockout zzso Cell injury in response to simulated zzso was studied following zzso of active zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter by zzso was studied using zzso reporter and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso active zzso zzso with zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was zzso by pharmacological zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso but zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression in zzso but not zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso of zzso active zzso in isolated zzso caused zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso of nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso induced strong zzso zzso and induced zzso protection against simulated zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso of a mouse zzso zzso reporter in combination with active zzso and zzso or dominant negative zzso confirmed that zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso in zzso binding of zzso to consensus sites within the zzso zzso 

These results support a zzso role for zzso zzso by zzso induction of zzso expression and zzso between zzso and zzso
