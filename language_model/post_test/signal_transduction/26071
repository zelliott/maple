Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso was reported to be involved in zzso However, the regulating mechanism of zzso remains zzso The present results showed that zzso was activated within zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to the zzso In addition, we detected zzso zzso zzso acted upstream of the zzso zzso at the early stage of zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso led to the partial zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results based on zzso zzso zzso and gel shift approaches indicated that zzso could regulate the zzso of zzso by binding the zzso region of zzso promoter at the early stage of zzso zzso our findings reveal that zzso zzso is involved in the early stage of zzso zzso differentiation though regulating the zzso zzso
