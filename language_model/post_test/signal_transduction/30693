zzso activate the production of zzso and zzso in response to zzso through signaling zzso downstream from zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which are produced during inflammatory responses, have been shown to suppress zzso gene expression upon zzso zzso in zzso The study reported here investigated the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso as well as the molecular mechanism underlying such an zzso We demonstrate that zzso strongly suppresses zzso zzso production at the zzso and protein zzso Poly zzso zzso and zzso zzso production were also suppressed by zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso expression is zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso by the zzso analog zzso as well as by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The downstream zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso effect is exchange protein directly activated by zzso zzso but not protein zzso zzso Moreover, data demonstrate that zzso signaling proceeds through zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso production in these cells through a distinct zzso requiring protein zzso A activity and independent of zzso In zzso administration of a zzso inhibitor before zzso injection resulted in enhanced serum zzso concentration in zzso zzso data demonstrate that zzso is a negative regulator for zzso production in activated zzso and during zzso
