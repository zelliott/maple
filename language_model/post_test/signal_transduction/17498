We examined the responsiveness of normal and zzso lung cells to agents which stimulate zzso zzso While their zzso zzso levels were similar, spontaneous in zzso zzso E9 cells and zzso zzso cells produced much less zzso in response to 1 zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso cells derived from normal mouse lung zzso zzso binding studies indicated that both zzso lines contained fewer zzso receptors than normal zzso zzso When receptors were zzso via treatment with 10 zzso zzso zzso the pattern of zzso was zzso both zzso cell lines produced more zzso than zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso greatly increased zzso zzso in all three cell zzso These anomalies at both the zzso and zzso levels in zzso lung zzso cells may contribute to their zzso zzso
