zzso cells require proper zzso zzso zzso zzso engagement for growth and zzso normal cells deprived of proper zzso contact undergo zzso At the same time, zzso is induced as a survival zzso in both zzso and zzso cells upon zzso zzso Here, we further define the zzso signals that mediate zzso zzso and uncover an important role for the zzso zzso zzso complex in the induction of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso deprived of zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso enforced zzso of this zzso is not sufficient to suppress zzso zzso in zzso Instead, zzso of zzso as well as its upstream regulator, zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments corroborate that both zzso zzso and zzso induction result from decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological zzso zzso enhances zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso in three-dimensional zzso Based on these results, we propose that the zzso complex functions as a key zzso of zzso zzso and zzso resistance in zzso zzso
