In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso activates at least two signaling zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso The former zzso differentiation as measured by zzso zzso while experiments with sodium zzso zzso show that NO zzso zzso In order to resolve this apparent contradiction, the zzso zzso and cellular zzso of NO production and sensitivity in zzso cells were zzso First, zzso cells remained responsive to zzso throughout the incubation with respect to NO zzso Second, although zzso occurred with continuous zzso exposure, recovery began as quickly as 30 zzso after zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso in zzso in zzso complete zzso was not a likely explanation for the zzso escape from NO zzso Finally, the cellular site of zzso was examined using the zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso NO but not zzso This finding was confirmed by membrane zzso studies where the zzso NO production occurred primarily in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso which transcribes the zzso zzso occurred predominantly in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of NO by zzso did not inhibit zzso As such, the zzso seen with zzso appeared to be an artifact of the ubiquitous generation of NO from zzso Physiologically, zzso zzso NO only in zzso and this restricted distribution does not interfere with zzso
