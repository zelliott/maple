Two general forms of synaptic plasticity that operate on different zzso are thought to contribute to the zzso refinement of neural zzso during development: zzso long-term zzso zzso and long-term depression zzso which involve rapid adjustments in the strengths of individual zzso in response to specific patterns of correlated synaptic activity, and zzso zzso synaptic zzso which zzso uniform adjustments in the strength of all zzso on a cell in response to prolonged changes in the cell's electrical zzso Without zzso synaptic zzso neural networks can become unstable and perform zzso Although much is known about the mechanisms underlying zzso and zzso little is known about the mechanisms responsible for synaptic zzso except that such zzso is due, at least in part, to zzso in zzso content at zzso Here we show that synaptic zzso in response to prolonged blockade of activity is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso we also show that zzso are the source of the zzso that is required for this form of synaptic zzso We suggest that by modulating zzso levels, zzso actively participate in the zzso zzso regulation of synaptic zzso
