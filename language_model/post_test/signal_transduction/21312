zzso are believed to play an important role in the host inflammatory response to implanted zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso and inflammation is zzso Previously the effect of various zzso proteins and increasing zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso protein expression levels in adherent human zzso cell line zzso was identified using zzso and zzso The protein zzso and zzso zzso up or down regulated the expression of a set of proteins ranging from approximately 200 to approximately 23 zzso In the present work, zzso coupled tandem mass zzso zzso was used to identify proteins in these zzso We hypothesized that key proteins in zzso zzso and zzso could be identified by observing protein expression resulting from various zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso down or up regulate protein expression in adherent zzso on zzso zzso at approximately 52, approximately 42 and approximately 23 zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cells on zzso zzso surfaces but regulated different protein expression in adherent zzso on zzso zzso zzso at 40 and 80 zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso regulate distinct sets of proteins in adherent cells as zzso zzso Based on the data from zzso both surface associated zzso and increasing zzso of zzso zzso shifts in zzso zzso
