zzso M zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso induce expression of a similar set of acute phase plasma protein genes in zzso zzso The redundant action of these zzso has been ascribed to the involvement of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso To define the specificity of the signal zzso by the zzso zzso (a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso function by zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso Both receptors activate DNA binding activity of zzso zzso and zzso and induce gene zzso through zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain regions of zzso and zzso were defined by the analysis of progressive zzso deletion zzso The 36 zzso zzso region containing the zzso box 3 sequence motif of zzso is required for signal zzso by the zzso zzso In contrast, signaling by zzso did not display the same requirement for zzso zzso and was not strictly dependent on the box 3 zzso The signaling by zzso zzso and zzso receptors differed from that by zzso by the prominent zzso of zzso as shown in the mouse zzso cell line, zzso The data suggest that the signaling specificity of the receptors for the three zzso is determined by the composition of the zzso zzso associated in the zzso zzso complex and that the signaling is not identical among these zzso zzso
