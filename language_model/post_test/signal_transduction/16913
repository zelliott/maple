zzso zzso cells zzso respond to injury after brain injuries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso at an injury site and is known to attract zzso zzso cells that express zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso depends on two zzso located at the zzso of the zzso In the present work we aimed to investigate if the zzso end of zzso where zzso binding and zzso zzso are located, was sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso Our data show that a synthetic zzso analogous to the first 21 zzso acids of the zzso end of zzso named zzso zzso is able to promote zzso of zzso in zzso and stimulate zzso and proliferation of zzso cells in zzso without affecting zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and in zzso We suggest the zzso end of zzso is responsible for a positive feedback loop to maintain a zzso of zzso that attracts zzso from the zzso zone into an injury zzso
