The survival promoting and zzso actions of zzso zzso factor zzso are well known but under certain circumstances this growth factor can also exacerbate zzso insults to zzso Prior exploration of the zzso through which zzso exerts this action on motor zzso zzso attention away from zzso Here we investigated the possibility that zzso acts through the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso on motor zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso We blocked zzso zzso of zzso using a dominant negative zzso zzso or a zzso function blocking zzso and found that this protected motor zzso against zzso insult in cultures of mixed spinal zzso zzso zzso of a function blocking zzso to zzso to mixed spinal zzso zzso cultures is also zzso indicating that zzso produced zzso zzso in vulnerability to zzso We next examined the zzso signaling zzso that are engaged upon zzso zzso Previously we found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso Here we show that expression of a zzso active zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso upon motor zzso not incubated with zzso Parallel studies with zzso motor zzso confirm that these events are likely to be zzso specifically within motor zzso The zzso of zzso capacity to accentuate zzso insults may make it a more attractive zzso zzso
