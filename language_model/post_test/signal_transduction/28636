zzso cells zzso play a key role in the induction and control of zzso zzso engineering of zzso is a promising approach for the development of a broad range of zzso strategies, for purposes ranging from genetic zzso to tolerance zzso The development of zzso zzso is limited by the inability to efficiently zzso zzso using naked zzso Here we demonstrate that after zzso DNA delivery, the zzso expression level controlled by the human zzso zzso promoter zzso is higher in mature zzso than in immature zzso and is further increased after terminal differentiation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or after DC interaction with zzso T zzso zzso signaling of zzso resulted in nuclear zzso of the zzso factors nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso element, necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso diminished after the zzso of these zzso factors or the blockade of zzso molecules involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling of zzso results in the highly efficient expression and presentation of transgenic zzso and the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses specific for transgenic zzso zzso demonstrating the functional potential of genetically engineered zzso
