To evaluate the role of zzso isolated from zzso extract of zzso zzso in inducing zzso in zzso cells and to assess the main zzso pathways zzso 

zzso were initially treated with different zzso of zzso for 48 h and the median lethal dose zzso value was selected by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of nuclear zzso and DNA damage and fragmentation were measured by zzso zzso and comet zzso Further, zzso oxygen species zzso generation, cell cycle arrest and change in zzso membrane potential were also examined and analyzed by flow zzso zzso of interaction of drug with CT DNA was investigated by circular zzso zzso spectral analysis to find any possible zzso DNA zzso The zzso and protein expressions of major signal proteins like zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and E6 and zzso zzso as well as the zzso genes and zzso genes were also estimated by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso 

Based on zzso value (30 zzso of zzso three doses were selected, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells through generation of zzso cell cycle arrest at zzso and zzso stage, change in zzso membrane potential and fragmentation of zzso zzso of CD zzso showed effective interaction between zzso and calf zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso revealed that zzso could efficiently induce zzso through zzso of expressions of zzso zzso and other zzso genes and zzso of expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso 

zzso isolated from zzso zzso efficiently induced zzso in zzso cells through possible zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
