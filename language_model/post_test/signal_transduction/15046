An zzso zzso including an zzso zzso zzso is an important factor in regulating stem cell zzso During tissue development, the zzso is zzso remodeled to regulate stem cell zzso Here, we developed zzso mimicking zzso zzso during the osteogenesis of zzso stem cells zzso The zzso were prepared from cultured zzso controlled at different stages of osteogenesis and referred to as zzso zzso zzso The zzso supported the zzso and proliferation of zzso and showed different effects on the osteogenesis of zzso On the zzso mimicking the early stage of osteogenesis zzso stage zzso the osteogenesis occurred more rapidly than did that on the zzso mimicking zzso stem cells zzso cell zzso and the late stage of osteogenesis zzso stage zzso zzso was similarly expressed when zzso were cultured on both the early stage and late stage zzso but decreased on the stem cell zzso zzso expression in the zzso cultured on the late stage zzso was higher than for those cultured on the stem cell and early stage zzso This increase of zzso expression was caused by the suppression of the amount of zzso and downstream signal zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso had different effects on the osteogenesis of zzso and the early stage zzso provided a favorable zzso for the zzso
