Total zzso zzso activity is often elevated in both zzso and membrane zzso of zzso breast tissue and zzso with a decrease in zzso zzso Breast tumor zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 6) is a soluble zzso zzso that was cloned from a zzso breast tumor and found to be zzso in a majority of breast zzso zzso we show that zzso is zzso in zzso of invasive zzso breast tumors and zzso with zzso family members in breast cancer cell zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by stable expression of short hairpin zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells decreases proliferation and blocks zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso D1 expression is dependent on zzso signaling and inhibited by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor 2 zzso factor target of zzso zzso and zzso signaling is also sensitive to altered zzso zzso Finally, zzso migration of zzso cells requires zzso zzso activity and is blocked by zzso zzso These results place zzso in a novel signaling zzso downstream of zzso receptors and upstream of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and establish the zzso zzso zzso as a critical zzso of breast cancer cell zzso
