We suggest that the commonly observed zzso between zzso and late-life reproduction may be zzso by genetic variation in zzso stem cell zzso Stem cell biology provides a natural framework and experimental methods for understanding the zzso basis of zzso zzso At the same time, natural variation in zzso strategies can serve as a powerful tool for identifying the genes and molecular pathways involved in the maintenance of stem cells in aging zzso We illustrate the connections between zzso and stem cells with examples drawn primarily from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and suggest a number of testable hypotheses and avenues for future investigation that can be addressed with existing models and zzso
