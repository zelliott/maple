One of the current models of cancer proposes that zzso activate a DNA damage response zzso which would limit the growth of the tumor in its earliest zzso In this context, and in contrast to studies focused on the acute responses to a one-time zzso zzso understanding how cells respond to a persistent source of DNA damage might become critical for future studies in the zzso We here report the discovery of a novel zzso pathway, which involves zzso and zzso tumor zzso and is only implemented after a persistent exposure to zzso In agreement with its late zzso we show that this zzso is critical for the zzso but not the zzso of the cell cycle arrest triggered by DNA zzso Interestingly, this late response is independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but downstream of zzso zzso protein zzso Our results might help to reconcile the zzso DNA damage model with the clinical evidence that points to zzso members as the most important tumor zzso in human zzso
