zzso released by zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso may control firing in these zzso by an zzso zzso Here we used patch clamp techniques to examine the effects of zzso on firing properties of zzso zzso zzso of male zzso In zzso zzso that generated only a few action zzso zzso termed zzso in response to long zzso current zzso zzso zzso substance P zzso zzso zzso lowered the zzso threshold by zzso zzso and increased firing from zzso zzso to zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso that fire multiple zzso SP zzso smaller changes in zzso threshold zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The effects of SP were similar to the effect of zzso II zzso zzso or low zzso of zzso zzso zzso that block zzso zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso The effects of SP in zzso zzso zzso were fully reversed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but only partially by a protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased by zzso of zzso receptors and zzso signaling zzso only in part by zzso
