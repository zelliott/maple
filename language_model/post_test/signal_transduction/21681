zzso the thirty or so zzso systems known in zzso coli, the zzso system has been described as being a stress response system the main function of which is to respond to damage to the cell envelope via zzso of zzso and folding zzso Nevertheless, the size of the zzso zzso (several dozens of target zzso and the diversity of the zzso functions associated with it zzso to hostile conditions, mobility, adherence factors, zzso zzso indicate that the role of zzso in cell physiology is undoubtedly more zzso The range of cellular functions affected by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso quite closely to the description of the zzso state of cells grown in zzso We suggest that zzso is a strategic signaling zzso for facing adverse conditions and for settling zzso zzso Current knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of the zzso response zzso and zzso and the interactions between zzso and the other bacterial regulatory systems are zzso
