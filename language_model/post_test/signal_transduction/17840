zzso a zzso family member, is produced by zzso zzso and zzso multiple pathways of cell death, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell death, in a cell zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso that mediates these multiple death pathways remains to be zzso Recently, zzso growth zzso 14 zzso has been identified to be a zzso zzso which was responsible for zzso proliferation of zzso cells and zzso Because zzso lacks the zzso death domain, it remains unclear whether zzso can also mediate the zzso cell zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso could induce zzso cell death in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso rather zzso the zzso zzso to zzso cell death by necrosis via zzso oxygen zzso and zzso zzso zzso By using newly generated zzso zzso zzso we also observed that zzso is zzso expressed on the cell surface of all zzso tumor cell lines, and can transmit the multiple death zzso Moreover, an zzso zzso that blocks zzso interaction could totally abrogate zzso binding and zzso cell death in all zzso tumor cell zzso These results revealed that the multiple pathways of zzso cell death are solely zzso by zzso
