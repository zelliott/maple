Light signals perceived by the zzso family of sensory zzso are zzso to zzso genes by an unknown zzso Here, we show that the basic zzso zzso factor zzso binds specifically to a zzso zzso motif present in various zzso gene zzso and that zzso B binds zzso to zzso zzso specifically upon zzso conversion of the zzso to its biologically active zzso We suggest that the zzso may function as integral zzso components of zzso regulator complexes, permitting continuous and immediate sensing of changes in this environmental signal directly at target gene zzso
