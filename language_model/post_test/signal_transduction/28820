zzso zzso expression deeply affects several properties of tumor cells that are involved in tumor progression and zzso zzso cell zzso (to the zzso zzso or to the zzso of blood zzso zzso recognition and invasion of host zzso In particular, zzso might contribute to the zzso of zzso interactions of tumor cells zzso their zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso as well as with host cells present in the zzso compartment of the zzso A model based on solid experimental evidence has been zzso zzso at the cell surface interact with plasma membrane receptors zzso zzso receptors and growth factor zzso and adapter molecules (including zzso forming signaling complexes that are able to influence the activity of signal zzso molecules oriented at the zzso surface of the plasma membrane zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of these signaling complexes appears to be strictly dependent on their zzso zzso and likely on specific zzso zzso From this point of view, particularly intriguing is the connection between zzso and zzso a membrane protein that plays multiple roles as a zzso of tumor growth and zzso in zzso breast and colon human zzso
