Loss of von zzso zzso tumor zzso gene function occurs in familial and most sporadic clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso resulting in the zzso expression of genes that control cell zzso invasion, and zzso The molecular mechanisms by which zzso loss leads to zzso are not yet fully zzso zzso loss has been shown to allow robust zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso growth factor zzso zzso processes that are known to contribute to tumor zzso and zzso zzso Among the most likely zzso zzso of these zzso activities is zzso a structural link between zzso and the zzso zzso as well as a gene zzso We show that zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso junction zzso zzso zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso specifically restored zzso invasion and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso loss in zzso and zzso zzso was blocked by the expression of a zzso zzso of zzso We conclude that, unlike many other zzso where zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso through the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso cells zzso loss enables zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as a potential target in zzso and drug development for zzso
