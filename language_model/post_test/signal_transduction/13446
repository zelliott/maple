A fusion protein in which the zzso of zzso zzso sensory zzso I zzso is connected by a flexible zzso to the zzso of its zzso zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso zzso responses to orange light and repellent responses to zzso light that were comparable to those produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso membrane proteins demonstrated intact fusion protein and no zzso zzso zzso zzso Rapid zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso domain confirmed that the fusion protein exists as a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown previously to exhibit large differences in the pH dependence of their zzso zzso and in the zzso of zzso that controls a zzso spectral transition in zzso These differences were used to assess whether only one or both zzso zzso in the fusion protein were zzso properly to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at various pH values established that both zzso zzso are zzso to zzso in the fusion zzso and therefore the zzso is zzso Closer examination of the zzso effect on zzso revealed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso fits two zzso values, with zzso and zzso of the molecules zzso with zzso of 7 and 9, zzso The same two zzso of zzso are evident in zzso zzso but with zzso with zzso of 7 and zzso with zzso of 9 and a similar bias toward the zzso of 9 in the fusion zzso zzso of the fusion protein with Ala substitution at zzso a zzso in the zzso site, in the zzso domain indicates that a basic zzso at zzso is necessary for the lower zzso to be zzso A model in which zzso plays a role in the zzso effect on zzso is zzso
