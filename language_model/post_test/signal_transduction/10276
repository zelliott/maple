zzso evidence suggests that zzso microbial organisms may play an important role in triggering and sustaining inflammation in individuals afflicted with inflammatory zzso disease zzso Moreover, individuals with zzso are at increased risk for developing zzso cancer, suggesting that chronic inflammation may initiate genetic or zzso changes associated with cancer zzso We tested the hypothesis that bacteria may contribute to the development of colon cancer by zzso with defective transforming growth zzso zzso zzso a zzso commonly zzso in human colon zzso Although others have reported that mice deficient in the zzso signaling zzso zzso develop colon cancer, we found that zzso mice maintained free of the zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso for up to 9 months do not develop colon zzso Furthermore, infection of zzso mice with zzso triggers colon cancer in 50% to zzso of the zzso Using real-time zzso we found that zzso organisms concentrate in the zzso the preferred site of tumor zzso zzso zzso develop 5 to 30 weeks after infection and are preceded by an early inflammatory phase, consisting of increased proliferation of zzso zzso increased numbers of zzso cells, zzso T cells, zzso and increased zzso class II zzso zzso tissue revealed increased transcripts for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso some of which have been implicated in colon zzso These results suggest that bacteria may be important in triggering zzso cancer, notably in the context of gene zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, one of the most commonly affected cellular pathways in zzso cancer in zzso
