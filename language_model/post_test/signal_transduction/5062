zzso zzso protein 3 zzso ABC zzso C zzso plays an important role in protecting zzso and other zzso by zzso an array of toxic organic zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso expression is increased in the liver of some zzso patients, but the molecular mechanism of this zzso remains zzso In this report, we assessed liver zzso expression in patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso of zzso ducts and zzso patient controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were significantly increased by zzso and zzso respectively, in these zzso patients where elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso specificity protein 1 zzso factor zzso and liver zzso zzso 1 expression zzso and zzso at zzso level, zzso and zzso at protein level, zzso were also zzso The induction of zzso zzso zzso expression is significantly positively correlated with the level of plasma zzso in these zzso In zzso cells, zzso treatment induced zzso and zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner, where increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was also zzso These zzso were significantly reduced in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced zzso cell nuclear zzso activity to the zzso promoter, but was abolished by zzso as demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso An increase in nuclear zzso activity to the zzso promoter, consisting primarily of zzso was also observed in liver samples from zzso patients, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso of zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso is likely triggered by zzso zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso
