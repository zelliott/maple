zzso zzso acid zzso a naturally occurring zzso acid zzso found in zzso foods, has the potential to serve as an effective zzso zzso factor for breast cancer prevention based upon previous published zzso There are several zzso zzso in zzso food products, among which zzso and zzso are more zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso in zzso tumors has been correlated with poor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso product in various zzso and, as in humans, zzso zzso in canine tumor zzso were frequently zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso Thus, various studies have implicated the important role of zzso and zzso in zzso tumor zzso 

zzso tumor and normal zzso zzso were both collected from a female dog with zzso zzso Both zzso and normal zzso zzso were subjected to isolation of zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso as well as zzso and zzso protein expression in canine zzso normal and zzso cells, were detected by zzso 96 zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso not only suppressed zzso zzso cell growth, but also exerted zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, both zzso and zzso suppressed zzso protein expression in both normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective in decreasing zzso protein expression in zzso zzso cells, while, in contrast, zzso zzso zzso protein expression in both normal and zzso zzso zzso 

The results indicate that the dietary component zzso regulates zzso and zzso protein expression in both zzso zzso cells and cells from the zzso zzso zzso In turn, this may suppress zzso zzso leading to better zzso We further speculate that the knowledge obtained from canine studies may also be beneficial to study human breast zzso
