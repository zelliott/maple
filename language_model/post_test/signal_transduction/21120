zzso zzso is one of the major acute phase plasma proteins in the zzso and its synthesis is zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso serves as the zzso of the zzso zzso signal and appears to contribute to the zzso induction of acute phase protein zzso The zzso region of zzso consisting of an zzso domain and containing a zzso zzso site, has been proposed to contribute to the induction zzso To assess the role of zzso in the zzso control of the zzso promoter, we applied two zzso forms of zzso one with a deletion of the zzso 55 zzso acid zzso zzso and the other with a substitution of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso both zzso zzso forms are activated by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso cells similarly enhance zzso through the zzso element of the zzso zzso This enhancement is specific for zzso and cannot be reproduced by zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas zzso zzso also enhances stimulation of the zzso promoter by zzso through the zzso zzso activated zzso reduces the regulation below the level achieved by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso action by zzso is dependent on a functional zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso domain, but not its zzso zzso site of zzso is required for zzso as part of the zzso zzso signaling as well as for cooperation with other zzso factors such as the zzso zzso
