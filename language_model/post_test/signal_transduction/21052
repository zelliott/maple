We have shown previously that protein zzso A zzso zzso levels are regulated by zzso of zzso or protein zzso C zzso in anterior zzso zzso zzso also influenced zzso zzso levels, suggesting that hormonal regulation occurs in zzso and therefore, we have zzso this question using the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, using specific zzso zzso zzso revealed expression of zzso zzso and regulatory type I zzso and type II zzso zzso of zzso in these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid zzso at zzso zzso and zzso loss of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced Cat and zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso reduced Cat and zzso by 50% and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso caused the expected zzso reductions in Cat, and the effects of zzso or zzso were nearly zzso zzso and zzso were reduced similarly by 10 zzso zzso whereas 100 zzso zzso tended to prevent the reduction of zzso or zzso caused by zzso zzso which activates zzso C and not zzso in these cells, caused a clear loss of Cat or zzso at all zzso tested and of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38, which acts via zzso receptors to stimulate both zzso C and zzso in these cells, also caused a clear zzso decrease in Cat, zzso and zzso although higher zzso were needed for the latter zzso Together, the data demonstrate that zzso and regulatory zzso of zzso are subject to both hormonal and zzso regulation in zzso cells, reinforcing the possibility that such effects occur in zzso zzso Whereas the effects of zzso zzso very likely involve zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso and zzso occur in the absence of zzso zzso by unknown zzso Whatever the mechanisms involved, the data reveal a mechanism for zzso between zzso C and zzso hormonal signals, in which zzso zzso seems to play a pivotal zzso
