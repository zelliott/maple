The effects of the zzso and the zzso zzso products on the pattern of newly zzso proteins was investigated in zzso cell zzso A conditional expression system which allowed hormonal induction of the zzso was zzso to detect effects on the zzso of zzso by two zzso gel zzso of crude cell zzso Strong and zzso changes of protein synthesis following the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso induced synthesis of four proteins with a molecular mass of 23 zzso 32 zzso 35 zzso and 47 zzso was zzso These changes were zzso indistinguishable in both, zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso This is in agreement with the notion that the two zzso products act on a common signal zzso zzso zzso zzso growth induction of zzso zzso cells led to a different pattern of altered protein zzso We observed the transient zzso in the synthesis rates of three proteins with a molecular mass of 27 zzso 47 zzso and 52 zzso Only the 47 zzso protein was also subject to regulation by the zzso One of the proteins whose synthesis was strongly induced by the zzso and zzso zzso products is also expressed by heat zzso
