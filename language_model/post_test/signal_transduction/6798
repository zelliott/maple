The zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso genes are a family of zzso pattern recognition receptors zzso that are a critical component of the zzso innate immune system, involved in both defense against zzso zzso and in beneficial interactions with zzso To investigate the origin and evolution of the zzso gene family, we characterized the full zzso zzso gene complement in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As sister group to all animals, sponges are zzso placed to inform our understanding of the early evolution of this ancient zzso zzso zzso zzso has a large zzso zzso gene complement that is dominated by bona fide zzso zzso zzso zzso with varied zzso zzso zzso half of these have a zzso architecture that includes an zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes and the high zzso across the zzso and zzso zzso are consistent with involvement in zzso We also provide new insight into the evolution of zzso in zzso through comparative zzso analysis of multiple zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, we demonstrate that the zzso gene family appears to be a zzso innovation, characterized by two major gene lineages that may have originated with the last common zzso zzso zzso zzso gene duplication, gene loss and domain zzso all have played an important role in the highly dynamic evolutionary history of zzso zzso
