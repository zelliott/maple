Tight junctions are components of the zzso complex linking zzso zzso cells and are important for barrier zzso Recent evidence suggests that tight junctions also participate in signal zzso mechanisms that regulate zzso cell zzso gene zzso differentiation and zzso One important class of zzso signal zzso mechanism is based on dual zzso of certain proteins both at junctions and in the zzso These proteins and their partners participate in various steps of gene zzso ranging from regulation of zzso and zzso structure to zzso processing and zzso In cancer zzso their expression is often zzso in a manner that suggests that tight junctions function as zzso of proliferation and zzso
