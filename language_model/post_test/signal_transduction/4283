The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes an zzso of zzso zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso whose expression is induced upon an zzso of the medium zzso We provide evidence that this zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso is under the control of a zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso gene is a downstream target of the zzso signaling that is transmitted through zzso thereby defects of either of these genes result in the similar zzso zzso zzso for growth, because of the failure in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
