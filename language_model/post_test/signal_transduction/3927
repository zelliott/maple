Multiple sites of zzso zzso are present in zzso but the molecular basis of zzso zzso is poorly zzso This study reports the cloning of the first zzso specifically expressed in the directly zzso zzso and zzso of cold-blooded zzso This zzso identified in channel zzso and termed zzso defines a new gene family of zzso zzso and is expressed in a majority of zzso and a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso zzso of expression within the zzso zzso This study also reports the cloning of partial zzso zzso the channel zzso zzso of zzso and the red cone zzso full complement of retinal zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso studies using zzso derived from these retinal zzso together with zzso reveal no expression of retinal zzso in zzso and zzso organ and no expression of any zzso tested in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These data imply that zzso in these sites of zzso zzso must be zzso by novel zzso
