The zzso B viral X protein zzso is known as a zzso factor and potential zzso To gain a better view of the effect of zzso on the zzso regulation in the human liver cell, we constructed a zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso and performed zzso zzso analysis on 588 cellular zzso comparing with zzso control zzso Two genes zzso zzso of zzso one gene zzso of cell cycle regulators, three genes zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso one gene zzso of stress response zzso two genes zzso zzso zzso of zzso response zzso one gene zzso of zzso factors were highly zzso one gene zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso factors and two genes zzso zzso protein 1, zzso protein zzso of growth factors were highly zzso These results showed selective zzso regulation by zzso in the human liver zzso
