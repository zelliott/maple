zzso is the major zzso zzso for the zzso zzso components and is implicated in a wide variety of zzso and pathological processes including the regulation of tumor cell growth and zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso zzso sequential zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso product derived from zzso zzso zzso acts as a signal zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism of the zzso zzso of zzso remains to be zzso In the present study, we report for the first time that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso treatment or mechanical scraping is blocked by zzso zzso in zzso cells and that this zzso is also inhibited in zzso mouse embryonic zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso is redistributed to zzso areas of the plasma membrane similarly to zzso after zzso treatment, supporting our zzso observation that zzso is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso Our present findings suggest important implications for understanding zzso signal zzso and a potential role of zzso activity in the functional regulation of zzso zzso
