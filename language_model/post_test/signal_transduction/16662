zzso evidence has been collected demonstrating that many zzso induce zzso cell death in embryonic structures that turn out to be zzso in fetuses and zzso zzso is a genetically regulated process that is realized by the zzso of death and zzso signaling zzso and the interplay between these zzso determines whether the cell exposed to zzso stimuli dies or zzso zzso there is intense interest in understanding how the zzso machinery functions in zzso exposed to zzso However, the interpretation of the results obtained remains zzso The main problem is that excessive embryonic cell death, regardless of its nature, if zzso for, ultimately leads to zzso or embryonic zzso zzso we can easily interpret results when the intensity of zzso cell death and the severity or zzso of zzso anomalies directly correlate with each zzso However, when zzso cell death is not followed by the formation of anomalies, a usual explanation is that zzso zzso cell death contributes to the renewal of zzso cell populations by promoting the removal of injured zzso It is clear that such an explanation leaves vague the role of the zzso signaling mechanism (and, zzso the zzso machinery as a zzso with respect to protecting the zzso against zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the data from studies addressing the function of the zzso machinery in zzso exposed to zzso and then we discuss approaches to interpreting the results of these zzso We zzso that zzso of a zzso signaling in zzso cell populations is a necessary condition for an zzso signaling that zzso the process of zzso to be zzso If such a scenario is true, we need to modify our approaches to choosing molecular targets for studies addressing this zzso
