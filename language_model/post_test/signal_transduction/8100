To investigate the possible involvement of Ras signaling in the zzso differentiation of embryonic stem cells zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Western zzso was used to test the effect of zzso expression on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect expression of gene related to zzso in differentiation of zzso zzso The results showed that the expression of zzso in the zzso cells remarkably zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of several markers related with zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly suppressed in the zzso expressing zzso whereas the zzso of zzso a gene required earlier than zzso in development of zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso It is concluded that the zzso of Ras is pivotal for in zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
