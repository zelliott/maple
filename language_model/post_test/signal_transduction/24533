zzso growth factor zzso also known as scatter factor zzso is a zzso which zzso zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso involved in signal zzso we have produced the human zzso zzso in insect cells zzso by means of a zzso zzso Two zzso forms of the zzso were zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso precursor (which is by far the more zzso and the zzso processed zzso zzso Both zzso species are zzso on zzso in zzso and are active zzso in zzso The zzso zzso binds and zzso in zzso four known zzso zzso containing zzso zzso region 2 zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In all cases the association is strictly dependent on zzso zzso of the zzso indicating that it occurs via specific interaction with the zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso has the sequence requirements for binding a spectrum of zzso zzso whose different combinations in target cells may result in the observed zzso biological zzso
