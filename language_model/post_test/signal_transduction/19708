We have developed multiple stable cell lines containing zzso zzso zzso that are resistant to treatment with zzso alpha zzso zzso of these zzso resistant zzso cells showed defects in the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso proteins due to a defective zzso zzso 

In this study, we have developed an alternative strategy to overcome zzso resistance in a cell culture model by improving zzso zzso zzso An engineered zzso zzso with double zzso zzso in the zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso (at zzso and zzso efficiently zzso and zzso to the nucleus of zzso cells in an zzso dependent zzso zzso of a zzso clone containing zzso significantly activated the zzso promoter compared to wild type zzso and zzso The activity of the engineered zzso is dependent upon the zzso of zzso zzso zzso since the construct with a zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso failed to activate zzso promoter in the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso protein showed zzso and nuclear zzso in the resistant cell line after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso clone into an zzso resistant cell line resulted in zzso of viral replication and viral clearance in an zzso dependent zzso Furthermore, the resistant zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso significantly up regulated surface zzso expression when compared to the wild type and Y to F zzso zzso 

These results suggest that modification of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso allows for improved zzso signaling through increased zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso surface zzso and prolonged zzso zzso gene zzso
