zzso zzso and knockout studies have demonstrated that blockade of zzso via zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso has zzso effects in mice submitted to the forced swimming test zzso The aim of the present study was to explore further the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso in different species zzso and zzso and using different zzso zzso and tail suspension test zzso and to investigate the zzso involved in its zzso (10 zzso zzso reduced zzso time of Swiss mice in the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso was without effect per se, but fully prevented the effect of zzso The spontaneous zzso time of zzso zzso mice in the zzso was much lower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or of Swiss zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso decreased zzso time zzso and increased climbing time zzso in rats submitted to the zzso In rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered robust zzso zzso currents in locus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso fully prevented zzso zzso but was inactive per zzso zzso zzso (both 30 zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso reduced zzso time of mice in the zzso The zzso synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso 100 zzso per day zzso prevented the zzso effects of zzso and zzso (but not zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso 7 days zzso suppressed only the effect of zzso Neither zzso affected spontaneous zzso time per zzso zzso exhibits pronounced zzso effects in different species and animal models, possibly by preventing the zzso effects of zzso zzso on brain zzso (in particular zzso zzso Participation of the zzso zzso system in mood zzso sets new potential targets for zzso drug zzso
