zzso and zzso members of the zzso family of signal zzso and zzso of zzso factors zzso have been associated with numerous inflammatory zzso including inflammatory zzso disease, zzso and acute lung zzso But little is known about their role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso gastrointestinal hormone, ameliorates zzso in zzso and in zzso In addition, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso factors, such as nuclear zzso factor zzso and zzso which mediate zzso We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor zzso would induce zzso and zzso and zzso would zzso their zzso factor zzso 

zzso pancreatic zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso was added 30 minutes zzso zzso zzso were harvested at 2 hours, and nuclear protein and zzso media were zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso production were measured using commercially available zzso zzso zzso factor binding was determined by zzso array analysis and zzso results were verified again by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso production was considerably increased zzso zzso zzso as early as 5 minutes after addition of zzso zzso and remained elevated for 24 zzso zzso decreased zzso production to control zzso A notable increase zzso zzso zzso in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed with zzso zzso production was reduced with zzso zzso substantially zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso their binding activity to control zzso zzso from both the zzso mobility shift zzso and the zzso zzso verified zzso and zzso responses to zzso and zzso 

In pancreatic zzso cells, zzso activated zzso and zzso known zzso of inflammatory zzso Interestingly, zzso attenuated their zzso zzso which may have an impact on development of the zzso Additional investigation of zzso proteins and zzso could provide new therapeutic strategies for zzso
