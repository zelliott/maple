Signaling pathways are controlled by a vast array of zzso zzso By contrast, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of their core zzso We conducted an zzso screen in zzso for factors modulating zzso signaling and identified the zzso zzso Complex zzso as a key element of this zzso The zzso binds the zzso junctions of zzso and thus far, has been linked exclusively to zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso is required for proper zzso of zzso transcripts by a mechanism that apparently controls zzso zzso Moreover, whole zzso and zzso analyses of zzso cells revealed that the zzso of long zzso zzso which includes zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso These results identify a role for the zzso in the zzso zzso subset of transcripts and suggest that zzso signaling depends on the regulation of zzso levels by the zzso
