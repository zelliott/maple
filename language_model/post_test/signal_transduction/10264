zzso and zzso proteins are maintained within distinct membrane zzso in polarized zzso cells by zzso and zzso sorting zzso zzso of zzso proteins in these processes has been well zzso however, the sorting signals and mechanisms that direct proteins to the zzso surface are less well zzso We previously demonstrated that an zzso sorting signal directs the zzso zzso to the zzso surface in polarized zzso canine kidney zzso Terminal processing of a subset of zzso zzso is key for polarized zzso delivery to the zzso zzso zzso is subsequently zzso and via a zzso zzso sorting motif is targeted to zzso from where it zzso cycles to the cell zzso Here, we examine the polarized sorting of zzso along the zzso zzso in polarized zzso Our results suggest that similar zzso sorting zzso are required for zzso delivery of zzso along both the zzso and the zzso zzso
