zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate zzso zzso zzso release signals from the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso application evoked two types of elementary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from single zzso zzso release channels zzso 30 zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from the concerted zzso of several zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso waves in the zzso cells arose from a variable number of initiation sites, but for individual cells, the number and zzso location of the initiation sites were zzso The zzso and zzso of global zzso signals were directly zzso to the number of initiation sites zzso zzso Reduction of the feedback inherent in zzso zzso release caused zzso zzso waves, revealing the two principal steps underlying wave zzso diffusion and zzso zzso stimulation evoked zzso zzso waves, caused by the limited recruitment of zzso zzso zzso The hierarchy of zzso zzso events, from fundamental levels zzso to intermediate levels zzso to zzso waves, is a zzso for zzso signal zzso for zzso cells, and is also analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso waves in cardiac muscle zzso
