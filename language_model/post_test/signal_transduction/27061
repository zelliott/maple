zzso a small protein zzso one zzso domain and two zzso zzso represents the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have been implicated in a highly zzso mechanism that regulates zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this report we show that in response to insulin, zzso forms a stable complex with two zzso zzso One protein is the major insulin zzso zzso zzso and the second is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interactions between zzso and these two proteins require zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and are zzso by the binding of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso on both zzso and zzso Although zzso associates with zzso and zzso it is not zzso after insulin zzso zzso that zzso is not a zzso for the insulin zzso Furthermore, we have identified a short sequence motif zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso which specifically binds the zzso domain of zzso with high zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso can simultaneously bind distinct zzso zzso regions on the same zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism zzso zzso could provide the core for a large zzso zzso We propose a model zzso insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple zzso interactions between zzso and the two targets zzso and zzso These interactions may play a crucial role in zzso of zzso and the control of downstream zzso zzso
