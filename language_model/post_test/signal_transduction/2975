zzso zzso coordinate cellular growth, survival, migration, and differentiation within a tissue by mechanically zzso cells to their zzso They also intersect with diverse signaling pathways in development and zzso Although the adhesive functions of zzso junction proteins are well zzso their contribution to other signaling pathways is less well zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso in the zzso selectively zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso while sparing zzso cell zzso This protection from death is coupled to elevated focal zzso zzso faster migration, and an altered distribution of growth factor zzso We show that simultaneous depletion of zzso and focal zzso zzso or zzso zzso eliminates zzso cell protection as well as the elevated migration and proliferation of zzso The increased dependency of cells upon zzso interactions for their survival when zzso zzso are zzso has important implications for cancer progression and zzso
