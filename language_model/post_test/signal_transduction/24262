To explore the functional mechanism of zzso interaction in a sensor zzso zzso five zzso sensory zzso were zzso In each of these zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the sensor domain of zzso zzso sensor zzso obtained from zzso zzso was fused with the zzso zzso domain from a zzso zzso zzso each at a systematically different zzso The zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso spectral characteristics of the zzso indicated that the secondary and zzso environmental structures of all five zzso examined are identical to those of zzso In spite of these structural similarities, all zzso did not exhibit zzso regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, their functional properties were much different from those of zzso The zzso binding affinity and the zzso activity for zzso zzso and zzso were similar to those of the truncated sensor and zzso zzso domain, whereas zzso and zzso display extremely low zzso affinity and low zzso activity, as compared with each truncated zzso These observations indicated that the zzso interaction was presented in those zzso and that interaction could be related to the zzso regulatory interaction of zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that the interaction in the zzso sensor zzso zzso would be strictly and finely controlled to mediate the signal zzso zzso activity in its zzso zzso zzso
