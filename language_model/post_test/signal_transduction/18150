Directed cell zzso occur during zzso zzso and organ zzso Despite the identification of zzso processes in which zzso is a critical component of pattern formation, little is known regarding the underlying cellular and molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells undergo zzso changes that generate an zzso through the formation of seven stacked zzso Here, we study the dynamics of ring formation during zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso as a model system to explore the cellular mechanisms that drive zzso The behavior of individual cells was analyzed in a zzso zzso by three-dimensional zzso zzso We showed that stereotyped cell fusion events occur within the rings that form functional and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in abnormal cell migration, zzso cell fusion, and structural fate zzso Within each developing zzso the anterior and zzso halves develop zzso zzso to prevailing hypotheses which proposed three cell fates (1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 zzso we found that each of the seven rings is a product of a discrete structural zzso that is derived from zzso of seven distinct cell fates zzso B, C, D, zzso zzso and zzso We have also shown how autonomous ring formation is the zzso force that drives zzso of the zzso
