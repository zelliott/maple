zzso growth factors, zzso and other stimuli induce expression of immediate early genes zzso in zzso We identified a subset of zzso zzso which are induced zzso by zzso but not by zzso or growth factors, in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced by growth factors and zzso in addition to zzso require zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso for induction in response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso has no effect on zzso expression of the known zzso in zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso were identified by a zzso comparison of genes induced by zzso in the presence zzso the absence of an zzso inhibitor in zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that representative newly identified candidate zzso as with the known zzso are also induced by a zzso zzso independent zzso in response to zzso both in zzso cells and in rat primary cortical zzso Nerve growth factor and zzso growth factor are unable to induce the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso cells, zzso their identification as zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso or protein zzso A zzso activity prevents zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso genes are induced by zzso in zzso via a combination of zzso and zzso zzso
