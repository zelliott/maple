The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso controls cell fate decisions throughout zzso Typically, binding of zzso zzso to zzso on the cell surface zzso a zzso cascade of events that ultimately zzso zzso changes in the zzso In contrast, the mechanisms by which zzso effects are regulated in the zzso cell are zzso In the zzso eye, zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso is required for differentiation of all zzso except for R8, the primary source of zzso zzso differentiation is instead under the control of the zzso factor zzso We show that high levels of zzso zzso are incompatible with zzso differentiation and describe the mechanism by which zzso signaling is actively prevented in zzso Specifically, zzso does not affect zzso zzso of zzso zzso but does block nuclear zzso of zzso zzso through zzso repression of pointed, which encodes the nuclear zzso of the zzso Thus, zzso promotes normal zzso differentiation by preventing the effects of zzso stimulation by zzso An analogous relationship exists between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this mode of repression of zzso signaling is zzso
