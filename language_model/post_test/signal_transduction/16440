zzso of the zzso zzso axis is one of the earliest patterning events during inner ear zzso In zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient to specify zzso zzso identity between the 10 zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso zzso is both necessary and sufficient for anterior zzso zzso during a similar period, a function that is completely zzso from its earlier role in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso character is reduced, but not lost zzso zzso all zzso zzso at zzso zzso however, using the zzso inhibitor zzso results in the loss of anterior zzso structures and a mirror image zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso during a similar period, using a zzso zzso transgenic line, results in the loss of zzso zzso structures and a zzso of anterior zzso These zzso are opposite to those observed when zzso zzso is zzso Loss of both zzso and zzso function between 10 and 20 zzso results in symmetrical zzso zzso with neither anterior nor zzso identity, which, zzso retain defined poles at the anterior and zzso ends of the zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso act on a symmetrical zzso zzso to specify anterior and zzso zzso identity, zzso Each zzso zzso has zzso activity: neither acts simply to repress activity of the other, and, together, they appear to be key players in the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
