zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affect zzso resulting in fewer committed late zzso zzso unit zzso zzso in the fetal zzso As the survival and proliferation of zzso depend absolutely on zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso cannot zzso or mature further unless both the zzso and EPO zzso zzso pathways are zzso How zzso affects proliferation or differentiation of zzso is not zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso (for stem-cell zzso can replace EPO in supporting the growth and survival of zzso cells, an zzso zzso cell line expressing high levels of zzso zzso supports the proliferation of zzso cells that express zzso only if they also express the EPO zzso In zzso cells, zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso of the EPO zzso and zzso physically associates with the extended box 2 region in the zzso domain of the EPO zzso Our results indicate that zzso may activate the EPO zzso by zzso zzso to induce further proliferation and maturation of zzso
