This study aimed to examine zzso whether polarity protein zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells zzso and contributed to zzso barrier integrity and zzso whether altered zzso expression and distribution were associated with disturbed zzso junction protein zzso expression induced by factors derived from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso expressions were examined by zzso zzso and Western zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso treated with normal and zzso zzso zzso medium zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso were examined by zzso and zzso 

Similar to zzso zzso is localized at the cell contacts in control zzso Both zzso and zzso expressions were markedly reduced in cells treated with zzso for zzso but not in cells treated with zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was pronounced in cells after zzso treatment with zzso zzso and zzso complexes were detected in zzso treated cells, but not in zzso control cells and in cells after zzso In contrast, zzso complex was detected in control cells and in cells after recovery, but not in zzso treated zzso 

zzso protein zzso is localized at cell zzso zzso from zzso zzso not only interrupt junction protein zzso distribution, but also zzso polarity protein zzso expression and distribution in zzso The results of zzso and zzso complexes formation in cells treated with zzso CM suggest that zzso from zzso could interfere both junction protein and polarity protein functions in zzso
