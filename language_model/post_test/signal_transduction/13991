zzso is a major threat to agriculture production zzso zzso protein zzso zzso play a pivotal role in sensing and converting stress signals into appropriate responses so that plants can adapt and zzso To examine the function of zzso in the drought tolerance of tomato plants, we silenced the zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso plants using the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso the individual genes or zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced the drought tolerance of tomato plants by varying zzso zzso zzso and zzso impaired zzso acid zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso zzso closure and enhanced zzso zzso zzso Similar results were observed when zzso zzso alone, but not when zzso and zzso were individually zzso These data suggest that the functions of zzso and zzso are zzso and they overlap with that of zzso in drought stress signaling zzso In addition, we found that zzso may regulate zzso levels by zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may play crucial roles in enhancing tomato plants' drought tolerance by influencing zzso activity and zzso production via the zzso zzso
