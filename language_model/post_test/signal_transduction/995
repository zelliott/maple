Since mast cells play pivotal roles in allergic zzso we investigated how zzso stimulation modulated mast cell zzso zzso zzso production, and its zzso zzso In this study, we clearly demonstrated that zzso released from zzso bone zzso cultured mast cells zzso was activated to its valid form after zzso of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitive to zzso inhibited the phenomenon, indicating that certain zzso may be responsible for zzso of zzso Although binding of zzso to its specific receptors did not alter zzso production, the zzso zzso increased both expression of zzso and production of zzso in mast zzso zzso declined extra cellular processing of zzso without affecting zzso zzso These findings give rise to the possibility that production and zzso of mast cell zzso may be increased in the affected sites, thereby resulting in an zzso of tissue degradation in inflammatory zzso
