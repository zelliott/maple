zzso acid zzso zzso is one of the zzso of zzso zzso levels affecting numerous aspects of plant growth and zzso stress zzso The major zzso zzso zzso is triggered by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Among four members of zzso zzso the expression of zzso was most highly induced in response to both zzso and subsequent zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso contained higher zzso levels in zzso plants, which showed a reduced zzso rate and hypersensitivity to zzso zzso during early zzso zzso On dehydration, the zzso zzso accumulated a higher amount of zzso zzso than the wild type, an event that occurred relatively later and was zzso with slow drought induction of zzso The zzso zzso plants exhibited both exaggerated zzso gene expression and enhanced drought zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso relieved growth zzso by zzso increased zzso and a reduction of zzso zzso in both zzso and dehydrated zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso plays an important role in determining threshold levels of zzso during zzso and after zzso
