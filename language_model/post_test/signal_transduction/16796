zzso zzso of zzso signaling was previously shown to zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso a disease model of multiple sclerosis in zzso Different studies attributed these effects to decreased zzso and zzso zzso enhanced regulatory T cell function, reduced T cell zzso to the zzso or impaired zzso cell zzso zzso of these zzso findings is difficult because past experimental strategies did not ensure complete zzso zzso in T cells and because many cell populations could be affected by systemic zzso zzso To resolve the role of zzso in T cells during zzso we used the zzso inhibitor zzso form of zzso 1 zzso as well as several complementary zzso approaches specifically in zzso T zzso zzso zzso in T cells profoundly decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells had preserved zzso and zzso differentiation in secondary zzso zzso However, zzso T cells failed to accumulate in the zzso after zzso Parking zzso and zzso T cells together in bone zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso T cells in the zzso after zzso but did not prevent zzso indicating the absence of dominant suppression by zzso T zzso Analysis of zzso zzso T cells revealed markedly defective zzso and zzso production, despite preserved zzso zzso zzso our findings capture the profound overall effects of zzso signaling in zzso T cells and demonstrate that zzso controls the zzso and zzso functions of zzso T cells within their target organ but not in zzso zzso during zzso
