zzso zzso zzso is a T zzso zzso zzso zzso A dual altered zzso zzso zzso that is composed of the zzso arranged two single zzso acid zzso of two zzso peptides was demonstrated to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with the dual zzso ameliorated the clinical manifestations of an established experimental zzso zzso in zzso This study was undertaken in order to investigate the ability of the dual zzso to zzso zzso responses of peripheral blood zzso zzso of patients with zzso to the native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 22 of 27 patients with zzso tested responded by proliferation to torpedo zzso The zzso responses of zzso of 21 of 22 zzso were significantly inhibited by the dual zzso The zzso was specific because a control zzso did not inhibit these zzso zzso The dual zzso also zzso the levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso of the tested zzso The latter inhibitions correlated with an zzso production of the zzso zzso tumor growth factor zzso Thus, the results of our study demonstrate that the dual zzso is capable of zzso in zzso zzso responses of patients with zzso and suggest that this zzso is a potential candidate for a novel specific treatment of patients with zzso
