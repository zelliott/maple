zzso in insulin signaling are associated with abnormal zzso cell function, which occurs commonly in cardiovascular zzso zzso of insulin signaling in zzso cells are incompletely zzso zzso zzso the zzso modification of proteins by the zzso zzso is a zzso process relevant to cell zzso but little is known about the role of insulin in protein zzso 

To test the hypothesis that insulin alters protein zzso in zzso cells, we combined zzso exchange chemistry with stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture to perform quantitative zzso profiling of human zzso zzso We identified zzso putative zzso zzso of which zzso were not known to be zzso zzso of the putative zzso proteins were induced or suppressed by zzso Of those potentially affected by insulin, zzso have been implicated in vascular zzso For one, zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso not previously known to be zzso we confirmed that insulin zzso zzso without affecting zzso protein zzso Chemical zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso had the same zzso zzso zzso also disrupted cell zzso zzso of zzso at zzso 56 and 206 prevented zzso of zzso abolished its capacity to stimulate cell migration, and inhibited its association with zzso zzso which are implicated in cell zzso zzso promoted the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

These findings provide proof of principle for using zzso to identify novel zzso zzso targets relevant to zzso zzso
