We recently demonstrated that dominant negative zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interferes with Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso and the differentiation cascade are zzso To further investigate zzso in zzso we examined zzso ability to inhibit zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso of zzso and zzso by 80 and zzso zzso zzso did not block zzso of zzso and zzso but inhibited zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it reduced zzso zzso only zzso zzso expressing zzso or treated with zzso were unable to differentiate to mature zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed moderate zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso and that the zzso plays an important, but less crucial role in zzso as compared to zzso
