In the present study, we characterized zzso zzso zzso a putative inhibitor of zzso and determined its specificity and selectivity in zzso We found that zzso completely abolished zzso zzso functional zzso In order to determine whether zzso inhibited zzso family zzso zzso responses, we evaluated its effect on zzso family zzso zzso signaling events in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In the present work, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso 352 zzso is not inhibited by zzso whereas zzso and zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is abolished by all the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso was marginally inhibited by zzso whereas treatment with zzso and zzso completely abolished zzso However, zzso zzso generation (an event zzso by zzso was zzso by zzso whereas zzso and zzso brought zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso are known to zzso zzso zzso generation in zzso In contrast, zzso unlike zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso we conclude that zzso is not a zzso inhibitor in zzso because of its unexplained zzso zzso
