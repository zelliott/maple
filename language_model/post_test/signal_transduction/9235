zzso sensing as an zzso signal zzso system is distributed widely among many bacteria to coordinate their behaviors or actions by zzso gene zzso and plays key roles in many zzso processes and zzso zzso sensing was also observed among many zzso as an important regulatory mechanism of secondary zzso zzso and/or cell zzso and displayed certain diversity of the zzso structures and action zzso The participation of zzso zzso sensing systems in the secondary metabolism has been extensively zzso and triggered the identification of a major signal class featured with zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso and certain small zzso molecules recently found in zzso clearly could play important roles in the zzso pathways of some zzso and might represent zzso zzso classes with novel zzso Meanwhile, some specific products of zzso including cholesterol zzso and zzso have been identified to function as zzso molecules which zzso the secondary zzso activities in zzso probably by the mode of zzso zzso Here, we reviewed research advances on zzso sensing systems involved in the zzso of secondary zzso in zzso mainly focusing on the clarification of their action modes and structural diversity of zzso We also zzso the research trends in this field and application of zzso through zzso in zzso engineering of natural zzso
