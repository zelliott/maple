In zzso stem cell fate is regulated by local zzso zzso Governing parameters in this stem cell niche include soluble factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The complexity of this in zzso niche limits analyses into how individual niche parameters regulate stem cell zzso zzso we use mouse embryonic stem cells zzso and zzso printing zzso to investigate how niche size controls zzso signaling zzso zzso is used to restrict colony diameter, zzso and degree of zzso We show, for the first time, spatial control over the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The functional consequences of this zzso signaling control are confirmed by demonstrating that direct and indirect zzso targets of zzso including members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by colony zzso Modeling results and empirical observations demonstrate that colonies less than 100 zzso in diameter are too small to maximize zzso zzso zzso and that colonies separated by more than 400 zzso can be considered independent from each zzso These results define zzso boundaries for the use of zzso in screening studies, demonstrate the importance of context in stem cell responsiveness to zzso cues, and suggest that niche size is an important zzso in stem cell fate zzso
