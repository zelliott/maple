The recent findings demonstrating that insulin and zzso are expressed in and zzso by human zzso zzso raise the controversial issue related to zzso function in male zzso zzso zzso display an increased metabolism and overall energy expenditure presumably to affect the changes in zzso signaling and function during zzso However the relationship between the signaling events associated with zzso and the change in zzso metabolism energy is poorly zzso It emerges from the findings here reported that both zzso and insulin may be crucial in zzso zzso to manage their energy zzso zzso analysis revealed that in zzso zzso insulin was located at the zzso level, in the zzso and through the tail while zzso was zzso at the equatorial segment and at the zzso zzso zzso display an overall decrease and a more uniform distribution in the signal for both hormones and this is in agreement with their enhanced release in the zzso Both hormones in zzso zzso somehow zzso the zzso between their zzso zzso pathways in zzso cells, resulting in the increase of zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso was abolished suggesting how in zzso zzso there is a block in zzso zzso This reasonably indicates how during zzso zzso reserve is mobilized and this makes the zzso as energy zzso zzso For instance insulin dismissed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has be shown to be crucial in the acquisition of zzso capability as well as to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of its release, dramatically down regulated zzso Interestingly, in the presence of a zzso of insulin signaling zzso an inhibitor of zzso the intrinsic activity of zzso zzso zzso appears to play similar action to that of insulin on zzso in zzso zzso in zzso The enhanced activity of this zzso induced by both hormones produces an increase of zzso that is essential for fatty acid synthesis from zzso zzso These fatty acids have two possible zzso zzso to produce zzso or zzso back into zzso zzso of the classes of zzso of free fatty acids zzso and zzso zzso for energy, has been long established zzso zzso zzso The zzso of hormones, fatty acid and zzso in the provision of zzso zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso The authors observed in zzso zzso what it occurs in zzso zzso zzso zzso tested utilizing the zzso as zzso appears to be zzso by zzso and zzso by the zzso presence of insulin in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity dramatically increases when zzso starts, so it may be assumed the possibility that zzso may work to stimulate such zzso activity providing additional zzso fuel to triggering zzso zzso The autonomous capability of zzso to release insulin and zzso suggests that they through an zzso short loop may provide the recruitment of energy zzso according to zzso zzso zzso This occurs independently by the systemic regulation and may represent a protective mechanism which preserves zzso zzso capability by any zzso effects produced by long calorie restriction or by zzso occurring in the energy zzso at systemic zzso
