zzso zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso on zzso via an zzso to form core zzso in zzso We recently found that disruption of the zzso gene zzso severe growth zzso and early zzso zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism involved, we have established embryonic zzso of zzso and zzso derived from zzso and zzso mice, zzso Interestingly, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso were substantially blocked in zzso cells, compared with zzso cells, while there are no significant changes in the total activities of zzso zzso for zzso zzso between two zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was completely restored by zzso of the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso or zzso zzso was significantly suppressed in zzso zzso Finally, we found that the core zzso of zzso is required for the binding of the zzso to its zzso whereas no effect was observed for the expression levels of zzso on the cell zzso zzso these results strongly suggest that core zzso is essential for zzso zzso biological zzso
