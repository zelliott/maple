The question of how the zzso zzso gives rise to a nervous system is of paramount interest in zzso zzso zzso induction constitutes the earliest step in this process and is tightly connected with development of the embryonic body zzso In the zzso zzso perpendicular zzso of zzso and zzso signals pattern the zzso and zzso body zzso Both pathways need to be inhibited to allow anterior neural induction to zzso zzso and zzso are active neural zzso that together with zzso and zzso signals are integrated at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributes to anterior neural zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso mechanisms are discussed that establish zzso zzso and integrate zzso acid and zzso signals during zzso zzso These findings not only improve our understanding of regional zzso in neural zzso but have profound implications for zzso stem cell research and zzso zzso
