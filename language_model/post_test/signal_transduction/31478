zzso immune system receptors function as sensors of infection and trigger the immune responses through zzso signaling zzso These zzso are zzso products, such as components of bacterial walls and viral nuclear zzso A common response to such zzso is the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso whereas zzso viral zzso additionally zzso the zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso Here we have shown that zzso and zzso zzso represent two zzso markers of the effects induced by zzso zzso the zzso products of a number of zzso bacteria, including the human opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso as well as zzso gene zzso These effects occurred in a wide variety of cell types including zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, requiring the structural integrity of the zzso ring motif and its natural zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso might be recognized by receptors of the innate immune zzso However, we provide evidence that zzso zzso signaling does not require the presence of the zzso innate immune system zzso zzso zzso or two members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso These data offer a new understanding of the effects of zzso zzso on host cells and its role in persistent airway infections caused by zzso zzso
