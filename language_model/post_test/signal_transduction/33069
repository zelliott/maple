We have used zzso with zzso zzso zzso to clone novel members of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here a novel zzso zzso which encodes a candidate zzso that is most similar to the zzso zzso zzso The coding region of the human zzso gene predicts a seven zzso domain zzso zzso of 375 zzso zzso zzso has zzso percent zzso acid identity to zzso II and zzso 8 zzso and slightly lower percent identity to many other zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals a zzso zzso zzso transcript in different regions of human brain and in various peripheral zzso The ubiquitous tissue distribution of zzso its expression in early development, and its conservation in evolution indicate a potentially important biological function for this zzso and its putative zzso zzso
