Although substantial studies have begun to explore the regulation of zzso zzso cascade by different zzso zzso whether protein zzso C zzso activity plays a crucial role remains as yet zzso In this study, we found that in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso VIII, and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso caused zzso zzso at zzso zzso and increased the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the newly identified zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso stimulation caused by zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso We also found that this stimulating effect on zzso zzso by zzso zzso was not the result of zzso zzso since treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and sodium zzso zzso had no zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso in a negative zzso
