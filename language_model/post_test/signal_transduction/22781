zzso zzso proteins act in concert with activated beta zzso the product of zzso zzso to zzso downstream target zzso To probe the role of activated zzso zzso factor complexes in hair zzso zzso and zzso we engineered mice harboring zzso a beta zzso gene under the control of a zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso In mice, zzso expression was directly zzso by a stabilized form of beta zzso but was also dependent upon zzso in zzso During zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso in a subset of zzso cells of zzso zzso and underlying zzso zzso of initiated zzso proceeded in the absence of zzso zzso zzso even though zzso was still zzso While zzso zzso cells expressed the highest levels of zzso zzso zzso concentrated in the precursor cells to the hair zzso where zzso expression was zzso with zzso zzso genes containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression ceased during zzso and zzso but zzso at the start of the zzso hair cycle, zzso with zzso zzso In contrast to hair zzso precursor cells, zzso outer root sheath expressed zzso but not zzso zzso was also expressed in the putative zzso stem cells, and while zzso was generally silent in this zzso it was zzso at the start of the hair cycle in a fashion that appeared to be dependent upon stabilization of beta zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso revealing the existence of positive and negative regulators of these factors in the zzso Furthermore, our findings unveil the importance of activated zzso complexes at distinct times in hair development and cycling when changes in cell fate and differentiation commitments take zzso
