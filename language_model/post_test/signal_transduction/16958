zzso is a life-threatening outcome of zzso hypersensitivity to zzso consecutive to mast cell zzso by zzso zzso Regulatory T cells zzso can control allergic zzso and mast cell zzso yet their clinical benefit on zzso symptoms is poorly zzso Here we investigated whether zzso action during the zzso arm of the allergic response zzso zzso 

We used a validated model of zzso passive systemic zzso induced by intravenous challenge with zzso in mice passively zzso with zzso zzso zzso was monitored by the drop in body temperature as well as plasma zzso and serum zzso zzso The role of zzso was analyzed using zzso class zzso zzso mice, treatment with zzso or zzso zzso and conditional zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso efficacy of zzso was also evaluated by transfer experiments using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso did not occur in mast zzso zzso zzso mice and was only moderate and transient in mice deficient for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso either genetic or induced by zzso or toxin treatment resulted in a more severe and/or sustained hypothermia, associated with a rise in serum zzso but not zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso from either zzso or zzso donors similarly alleviated body temperature loss in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can control the symptomatic phase of mast cell and zzso zzso in zzso This might open up new therapeutic avenues using zzso rather than zzso zzso for inducing tolerance in allergic zzso
