To gain insight into the mechanism by which the adapter protein zzso promotes nerve growth factor zzso zzso differentiation and survival, the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso B and downstream zzso proteins was zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso which exhibit enhanced zzso zzso differentiation compared with control cells, showed enhanced and prolonged zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso activity were not altered in cells zzso zzso with a defective zzso domain, despite the ability of the zzso zzso to block zzso zzso zzso with zzso enhancing the activity of zzso cells zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited increased and/or prolonged zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that, although zzso expressed zzso was primarily concentrated in the zzso of control cells and cells zzso zzso zzso it was concentrated in the nucleus of cells zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso cells, whereas zzso enhanced its zzso in the zzso In zzso cells zzso expressing forms of zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to promote zzso of zzso to the zzso whereas zzso blocked this effect of zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
