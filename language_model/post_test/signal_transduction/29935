There is accumulating evidence that zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso family, such as zzso zzso and zzso are involved in synaptic plasticity in brain regions such as the zzso We have recently shown that zzso family zzso are activated by synaptic transmission in the zzso region of the zzso Since the function of these zzso is dependent on zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso of zzso would modify long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which suppressed zzso of zzso and Ras but not zzso or zzso reduced the magnitude of zzso while zzso zzso zzso which inhibited zzso and zzso but not zzso increased the magnitude of zzso In addition, zzso a specific inhibitor of a downstream zzso of zzso zzso increased the magnitude of zzso This provides strong evidence that zzso are important zzso of synaptic zzso and demonstrates that zzso acts to reduce the degree of plasticity at zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso have the unusual property of increasing the magnitude of zzso and so may be potential cognitive zzso
