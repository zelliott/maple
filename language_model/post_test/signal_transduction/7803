The zzso of immune complexes by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and cellular responses to zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso cells are shown to be responsible in zzso for immune zzso zzso of T zzso We examine the consequence of zzso zzso of self zzso by zzso cells in the rat insulin zzso zzso model and identify a role for the zzso zzso in the maintenance of peripheral zzso T cell zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso T cells is enhanced in rat insulin zzso zzso mice lacking zzso resulting in a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso T cell zzso results from suppression of both DC zzso and zzso through zzso zzso Further zzso on zzso inhibited the induction of zzso zzso zzso limiting zzso differentiation and memory T cell zzso In these zzso zzso responses, the presence of zzso only modestly affected initial zzso T cell zzso responses, suggesting that zzso limited zzso cell differentiation primarily by zzso DC zzso Thus, zzso can contribute to peripheral tolerance maintenance by zzso DC zzso alone or by also limiting processing of zzso acquired zzso
