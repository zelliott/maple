We previously demonstrated that the activities of zzso in the lateral zzso area zzso and the zzso reach region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are modulated by zzso zzso zzso We now report similar zzso in zzso an area of frontal zzso that is zzso connected with zzso Although it is possible that these zzso signals originate in zzso and are conveyed to zzso it is also possible that these signals originate in zzso and are zzso zzso to zzso We found that signal magnitude was no larger, and onset time no earlier, in zzso compared with zzso Moreover, zzso activity in zzso but not in zzso was largely driven by spatial zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso signals found in zzso do not originate in zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso signals found in zzso but does not wholly account for zzso
