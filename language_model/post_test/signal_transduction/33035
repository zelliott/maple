We have investigated the hypothesis that different zzso zzso activate distinct zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained increase in zzso zzso activity at both 30 s and 4 zzso of stimulation zzso zzso zzso at 30 s and zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso P zzso zzso zzso of smooth muscle cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (3 zzso resulted in a significant zzso of both C2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso A, an zzso zzso inhibitor (3 zzso inhibited only C2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso using zzso zzso zzso showed that C2 zzso not zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso to the regulatory zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that both zzso and C2 zzso zzso with the regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas C2 zzso zzso only with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso C2 zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso contraction, unlike C2 zzso was not zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso but was zzso by G protein zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
