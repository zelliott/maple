To incorporate variation of zzso shape in neural models, we developed a method of generating a population of realistically shaped zzso zzso that characterize a zzso include zzso zzso distances to branch points, fiber zzso and overall zzso tree shape and zzso zzso measured zzso provide a means of treating these zzso parameters as zzso variables in an zzso for production of zzso zzso generated zzso shapes were used in a model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A large part of the variation of whole zzso input resistance zzso is due to variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso varies zzso Statistics of responses to synaptic zzso were zzso for different zzso zzso zzso of response variation depended on zzso location, measurement site, and attribute of zzso
