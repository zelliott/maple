zzso a weak zzso on its own, elicits strong zzso reactions zzso zzso zzso release zzso through zzso Such amplification operates via zzso receptors which are linked to the turnover of zzso and increases of zzso zzso zzso as signal zzso zzso In experimental animals, selective blockade of zzso receptors eliminates zzso zzso formation over sites of zzso injury in zzso canine zzso in combination with a manipulation of zzso it prevents coronary zzso zzso after zzso with zzso and zzso drastic zzso zzso zzso by injections of collagen in zzso These observations suggest that zzso amplification substantially contributes to the zzso of zzso in damaged vessels and offers perspectives for an improved zzso zzso
