zzso zzso is a highly abundant cell surface zzso expressed on zzso and zzso cells where it functions as a zzso zzso and signaling zzso Since zzso and appropriate zzso are important features in the regulation of cell surface interactions and signal zzso we studied the pattern of zzso as well as the ability of zzso to undergo zzso both in solution and when expressed on cell zzso zzso is heavily zzso with an approximate zzso content of zzso zzso neutral and thirteen zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis showed that soluble zzso zzso exists in equilibrium between a zzso and a zzso with an approximate zzso constant of zzso zzso Chemical zzso studies of both soluble and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso exists as a zzso These studies suggest that, like zzso zzso is likely to play a role in zzso zzso and zzso
