The ability to respond to a changing environment separates successful organisms from their zzso Thus, signal zzso is a crucial aspect of an zzso growth, development, zzso and zzso Nowhere is this more evident than in the zzso of zzso pathogens with their host zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso the pathogen of zzso has provided a powerful tool in the assessment and characterization of signaling pathways for this zzso zzso of the sequence reveals that while zzso zzso has a streamlined gene content, it appears to contain a full repertoire of the standard signaling zzso present in other zzso A full range of zzso are present to provide zzso of function on the one hand while, on the other, distinct strategies for zzso This review explores signaling based on the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso A zzso pathways as well as ancillary functions, with emphasis on the unique aspects of the zzso zzso approach to utilizing this zzso
