zzso zzso zzso and healing after wounding require complex zzso zzso In this study, we show that for skin zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in underlying zzso which in turn zzso the zzso activity of zzso via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In fact, zzso stimulates production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which leads to an zzso decrease in zzso signaling pathways and consequently decreases production of zzso zzso factors by the zzso This zzso zzso regulation of the zzso signaling is required for proper wound healing and can regulate tumor as well as normal human zzso cell zzso Together, these findings provide evidence for a novel zzso control of zzso proliferation and differentiation zzso via zzso regulation in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Given the ubiquitous expression of zzso other zzso interactions may also be regulated in a similar zzso
