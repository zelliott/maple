zzso signaling critically contributes to the zzso growth, and therapy resistance of zzso zzso Here, we show that targeting of zzso zzso with zzso zzso enhances the sensitivity to zzso radiation and delays the growth of human head and neck zzso cell zzso cell lines in zzso cell culture and in zzso zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso of a zzso protein zzso This, in turn, zzso zzso signaling and induced cell zzso leading to zzso Thus, these findings suggest that robust and selective pharmacological targeting of zzso zzso may provide therapeutic benefit to overcome tumor cell resistance to zzso
