Biological processes are often zzso thus researchers must monitor their activity at multiple time zzso The most abundant source of information regarding such dynamic activity is zzso gene expression zzso These data are used to identify the complete set of activated genes in a biological process, to zzso their rates of change, their order and their zzso effects and to model dynamic systems in the zzso In this Review we discuss the basic patterns that have been observed in zzso experiments, how these patterns are combined to form expression programs, and the zzso analysis, zzso and integration of these data to zzso models of dynamic biological zzso
