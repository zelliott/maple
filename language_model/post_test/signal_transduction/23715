The zzso capacity of the heart is markedly diminished shortly after birth, coinciding with overall withdrawal of zzso from cell zzso zzso the adult zzso heart has limited capacity to zzso after zzso The discovery of factors that can induce zzso proliferation is, therefore, of high interest and has been the focus of extensive investigation throughout the past zzso 

We have recently identified zzso as a novel zzso and zzso induced stem cell factor zzso zzso from zzso stem cells, which can promote cardiac repair through zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso can also contribute to cardiac zzso by stimulating zzso division and zzso 

Neonatal zzso zzso were zzso in culture for 7 days with zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with control zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso increase in DNA synthesis as measured by zzso zzso These results were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso showing a 50% to zzso increase in the number of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cardiac zzso of zzso in a transgenic mouse model resulted in enhanced level of DNA synthesis and zzso in zzso and adult zzso These zzso effects were modulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso as revealed by the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

Our studies support the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso proliferation via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso The implications of this finding may be significant for cardiac zzso biology and zzso
