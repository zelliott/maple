The zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso regulates the zzso rate of a zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is transmitted from the zzso zzso domain to the zzso regulatory domain, is carried by an zzso zzso change within the zzso zzso zzso The present work uses engineered zzso and zzso bonds to probe the nature of this zzso change, focusing in particular on the role of the second zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso consisting of 13 zzso pairs and the corresponding zzso bonds, have been introduced into the contacts between the second zzso zzso and adjacent zzso The effects of these modifications on the zzso signal have been zzso by in zzso zzso which measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso All three parameters are observed to be highly sensitive to zzso of the second zzso zzso In particular, 13 of the 26 modifications (6 zzso pairs and 7 zzso significantly increase or decrease zzso zzso while 15 of the 26 modifications (6 zzso pairs and 10 zzso destroy zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 of the zzso zzso are found to lock the zzso in the zzso or zzso signaling state by zzso constraining the second zzso zzso demonstrating that it is possible to use engineered zzso to lock the signaling function of a zzso zzso A separate aspect of the study zzso the zzso motions of the second zzso zzso 4 zzso designed to trap large zzso twisting motions are observed to disrupt function but form zzso suggesting that the zzso is zzso Together the results support a model in which the second zzso zzso is a mobile signaling element responsible for zzso the zzso zzso
