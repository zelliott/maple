zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso are both low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso that are recognized by the zzso family of G zzso zzso In zzso cells, these two zzso activate zzso zzso resulting in cell proliferation and cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of many cell zzso molecules belonging to the zzso zzso This study showed that zzso and zzso enhance zzso expression at both the zzso and protein levels in human zzso zzso vein zzso cells zzso This enhanced zzso expression in zzso was first observed at 2 h zzso zzso zzso expression appeared at 8 h zzso treatment, as detected by flow zzso and Western zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso on zzso expression were shown to be concentration zzso Prior treatment of zzso with zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso ammonium zzso and BAY zzso zzso of the nuclear factor zzso pathway, or zzso zzso toxin B, an inhibitor of zzso prevented the enhanced effect of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso system, zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso between zzso and zzso cells, a human zzso cell zzso The enhanced zzso effect could be prevented by zzso with a functional blocking zzso against human zzso These results suggest that zzso released by activated zzso might enhance interactions of zzso with the zzso through a zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso thus zzso wound healing and inflammation zzso
