Upper urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of zzso dysfunction in children and zzso While there is clinical evidence of an increased male zzso and mortality rate with acute zzso failure, the effect of gender and testosterone on zzso zzso injury has not previously been zzso We hypothesized that testosterone zzso zzso zzso production and zzso and zzso signaling during zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso cell death and zzso zzso To study this, male, female, zzso male, and zzso zzso female rats were subjected to sham operation or 3 days of unilateral zzso obstruction zzso Renal cortical tissue was then analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso In a separate arm, zzso zzso rate zzso zzso was measured in rats zzso and zzso Male and zzso zzso female rats demonstrated a significant increase in zzso production, zzso activity, zzso cell death, zzso fibrosis, and zzso dysfunction during zzso compared with zzso males and normal female rats subjected to the same time course of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso testosterone production in normal male rats and testosterone zzso administered to zzso females significantly increases zzso production and zzso and zzso signaling during zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso cell death, zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso
