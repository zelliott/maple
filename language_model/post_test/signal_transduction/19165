zzso are responsible for maintaining zzso in the zzso under zzso conditions and promoting the active export of zzso from the nucleus following zzso zzso to terminate the zzso We now show that zzso proteins regulate the zzso signaling zzso by physically interacting with zzso and zzso zzso We identify two functional zzso binding zzso in the zzso protein involving zzso zzso and zzso and map the interaction region of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso binding zzso in zzso or zzso results in a predominantly nuclear distribution of both zzso zzso treatment promotes recruitment of zzso and zzso to zzso promoters and enhances the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso with a zzso zzso leads to the zzso of nuclear zzso complexes and the zzso association of zzso with the zzso In this situation, zzso genes become unresponsive to zzso zzso Together our results indicate that zzso proteins facilitate the nuclear export of zzso complexes and are required for the appropriate regulation of zzso zzso
