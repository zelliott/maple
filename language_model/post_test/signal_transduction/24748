zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso by zzso was assessed in immature zzso mast cells cultured from bone zzso to determine whether the early expression of zzso receptors on such cells may be of functional zzso zzso receptors were expressed by approximately zzso of cells after 1 week in culture and by an increased proportion at 2 and 3 zzso The ability of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to increase zzso calcium in these cells was also zzso zzso zzso in large numbers of individual cells was monitored with use of a zzso zzso and flow zzso Both zzso and zzso had significant effects on zzso calcium in cells cultured for as little as 1 week with zzso when few cells exhibited zzso or functional characteristics of mast zzso zzso times in culture were associated with an increase in the proportion of cells responding to these stimuli with calcium zzso but not with a change in the magnitude of the zzso We conclude that the early expression of zzso receptors during mast cell development may be functionally zzso since these receptors appear to be linked to cellular signal zzso zzso The data additionally imply a possible role for zzso in mast cell zzso
