zzso (also known as zzso recruitment domain zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso family protein that plays an essential role in zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso in the assembly of signaling molecules at the immune zzso using a zzso zzso We report that zzso is essential for zzso zzso 2 and zzso gamma production, but zzso for proliferation in T zzso zzso and distribution of T cell zzso zzso function associated 1, zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso to central and peripheral immune zzso regions occur normally in zzso T zzso zzso controls entry of zzso zzso zzso into zzso raft zzso and the central region of the immune zzso as well as zzso of zzso downstream of zzso Our data provide the first genetic evidence on a new class of molecular scaffold that controls entry of defined signaling zzso zzso into the central zzso zzso cluster at T zzso cell zzso without having any apparent effect on the overall organization and formation of immune zzso
