Mouse gene knockout studies have provided unimpeachable evidence of zzso functions for several zzso zzso including zzso I, zzso I, and zzso zzso Such studies zzso however, identify cellular mechanisms for regulating such zzso In this article we provide evidence that zzso B zzso respond to specific immune signals in zzso with tightly regulated changes in the zzso acid composition of the cell surface zzso These changes are both quantitative and qualitative in nature and are apparently regulated at both the zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso binding and flow zzso combined with relative real-time zzso to show that zzso and zzso binding are tightly correlated with the abundance of zzso IV and zzso I zzso respectively, under several different conditions of B cell zzso Finally, we show that although zzso binding and the expression of zzso I coding sequence are not tightly zzso there is a clear differential control of zzso zzso usage in response to different immune zzso
