This study investigates the roles of zzso overproduction and zzso signaling pathways in the induction of unfolded protein response zzso and the expression of Phase II zzso in response to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso triggered three zzso pathways of zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso and induced the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as Phase II zzso zzso and zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest, which was correlated with the increased expression of zzso The addition of zzso a cellular permeable zzso scavenger, scavenged zzso zzso formation, but did not alleviate zzso or the expression of zzso genes or Phase II zzso indicating that zzso overproduction per zzso did not play a major role in zzso deleterious zzso zzso expression was attenuated by zzso zzso and chemical zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso expression was regulated by zzso which may work downstream of zzso zzso zzso treatment promptly induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso specific inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso but enhanced expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso transient zzso zzso zzso may serve as an upstream negative regulator of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso against zzso cell zzso
