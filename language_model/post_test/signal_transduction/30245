zzso of the zzso interfere with zzso regulation of growth signaling pathways and block cell cycle progression of zzso zzso As growth signaling pathways are highly zzso between zzso and zzso cells, we hypothesized that zzso zzso might also be a valuable approach to interfere with zzso growth of zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of zzso zzso on zzso growth of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso of the zzso effectively suppressed zzso zzso as determined by reduced cell size, zzso of zzso induction of zzso and protein zzso reduced expression of several zzso marker zzso and diminished zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso growth was independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling and subsequent Western zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso induced a cellular stress response with reduced expression of zzso growth signaling zzso and impaired zzso phase transition of zzso In zzso zzso sensitive rats, zzso of the zzso with low doses of the zzso approved zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced zzso heart zzso Our data provide important insight into the zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso growth of zzso and establish zzso zzso zzso as a new and zzso approach to interfere with cardiac zzso
