The velvet belly zzso shark zzso zzso zzso a blue zzso from thousands of tiny zzso In this work, we performed a pharmacological study to determine the zzso control of zzso from these luminous zzso zzso zzso skin patches produced light under zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation in a zzso manner but did not react to classical zzso The zzso hormone zzso had an zzso effect on zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso the action of this hormone is likely to be zzso through binding to the zzso zzso zzso which probably decreases the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso because zzso (a zzso zzso strongly zzso the light response to zzso However, zzso seems to achieve its effects via zzso zzso 2 zzso after binding to its zzso because a specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso The two stimulating hormones showed different zzso as well as a seasonal variation of light intensity, which was higher in summer zzso than in winter zzso and zzso All of these results strongly suggest that, contrary to zzso zzso fishes, which zzso a nervous control mechanism of their zzso zzso the light zzso is under hormonal control in the zzso zzso zzso This clearly highlights the diversity of fish zzso and confirms its multiple independent zzso during the course of zzso
