zzso C zzso is a key zzso in the T cell zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in human T zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a cascade of zzso events that ultimately regulate gene zzso and T cell zzso We studied the effects of zzso a putative inhibitor of zzso events, on zzso zzso early and late events in human T zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and free zzso calcium zzso increases were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but not by the related inactive zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso increase in T cells, indicating a specific mode of zzso of zzso zzso Late events in T cell zzso like zzso T cell proliferation and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso expression were also inhibited by this zzso T cell proliferation induced by a combination of a zzso zzso and zzso was not affected by zzso Although an zzso effect on zzso zzso and zzso levels was observed with high zzso of zzso the inhibitor alone did not induce any zzso effect or zzso expression in T zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso processes in human T cells and could serve as a valuable tool for studying T cell signal zzso zzso
