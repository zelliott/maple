zzso cell zzso cells missing zzso zzso factor is expressed in all zzso precursors of the zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient to induce zzso differentiation but also plays a role in other cell types, by interacting with specific zzso To find potential partners of zzso which trigger these other zzso we performed a zzso zzso screen and identified zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso zzso larvae show zzso tumors due to excess of zzso a zzso lineage that is involved in zzso zzso We here show that blocking zzso activity also triggers zzso tumors and that zzso interacts genetically with zzso Moreover, the members of the zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathway, which are known for their role in the zzso and zzso immune system and are required for zzso tumor formation, act downstream of zzso Altogether, this study identifies an zzso role of zzso dictated by its zzso zzso allowing zzso to act in a specific zzso Together with the recent finding that zzso act as zzso during development and in pathological conditions, our data open new perspectives onto the cellular and molecular pathways involved in zzso recognition within and outside the nervous zzso
