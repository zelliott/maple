We investigated the effects of zzso acid, a zzso agent, on the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso and oral zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acid suppressed zzso induction of zzso protein and synthesis of zzso zzso zzso acid also suppressed the induction of zzso zzso by zzso Nuclear zzso revealed increased rates of zzso zzso after treatment with zzso an effect that was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the effects of zzso were zzso by a zzso zzso response element in the zzso zzso zzso acid inhibited zzso zzso of protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso activity and the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso response element of the zzso promoter, effects that were blocked by zzso zzso These data are important for understanding the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso
