zzso oxygen zzso is the main agent of zzso stress and is generated by zzso as zzso It leads to the damage of cellular zzso and therefore zzso organisms have to mount an zzso response to zzso zzso A major player of the zzso stress response in zzso zzso is the alternative zzso factor zzso which is zzso under zzso conditions by its zzso zzso factor zzso By using random zzso we identified zzso to be required for full zzso of the zzso response under zzso stress, but not under organic zzso zzso In this study we show that both zzso and zzso are required for full resistance towards zzso Moreover, we revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to zzso resistance and promote zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso is therefore highly similar to that of zzso coli, although very different zzso factors control zzso zzso Based on the acquired results, the current model for zzso zzso in response to zzso exposure in zzso zzso was zzso
