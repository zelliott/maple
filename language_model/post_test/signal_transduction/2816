Recently, a severe combined zzso syndrome with a zzso of zzso peripheral T cells and a zzso signal zzso zzso in peripheral zzso T cells was associated with zzso in zzso Since zzso signaling is required in zzso decisions resulting in mature zzso (and zzso T cells, the presence of peripheral zzso T cells expressing zzso incapable of signaling in these patients is zzso Here, we show that the zzso on zzso but not peripheral T cells, from a zzso patient are capable of zzso Moreover, the zzso on a zzso line derived from this patient can zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is present at high levels and is zzso zzso after zzso zzso Thus, zzso may compensate for the loss of zzso and account for the zzso selection of at least a subset of T cells zzso in zzso zzso
