To probe the changes of vascular responsiveness and zzso signaling during zzso withdrawal zzso 

zzso withdrawal syndrome in rats was zzso by zzso zzso following daily injection of increasing dose of zzso for 2 weeks, the changes in mean zzso blood pressure zzso caused by zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso vascular beds were zzso with zzso solution containing different concentration of zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cultured bovine zzso zzso cells zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso were zzso The positive zzso to the zzso zzso zzso responsive zzso protein zzso in cultured zzso was zzso 

zzso 2 zzso zzso following chronic zzso treatment zzso severe zzso withdrawal signs in company with blunted zzso effect of zzso that was the same as chronic zzso treated rats before zzso In the zzso vascular beds from chronic zzso treated rats, the zzso of zzso effect of zzso zzso was decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, P zzso zzso after the zzso solution containing zzso 20 zzso was replaced by zzso containing zzso 25 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso pressure increases were completely prevented by zzso contained zzso 40 zzso zzso acutely applied to control zzso produced some variable and zzso zzso changes, but zzso did zzso However, zzso increased zzso in two thirds of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 48 h from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 29) zzso zzso zzso 9, P zzso zzso and from (106 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, P zzso zzso respectively, and it also increased the ratio of positive zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso % to zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso 6, P zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased zzso from zzso zzso 34) to (78 zzso 24) zzso in one third zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, P zzso zzso 

That zzso enhances vascular responsiveness to zzso in chronic zzso treatment rats may be relevant to zzso transient zzso in company with zzso zzso zzso
