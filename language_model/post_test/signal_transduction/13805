In patients, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso can persist in the bone zzso zzso while other zzso (such as zzso present growing zzso This suggested that the zzso might be a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cues in zzso Here we show in a head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso model that strong and specific transforming growth zzso zzso zzso in the zzso activates the zzso zzso inducing an zzso zzso zzso This results in induction of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso and dormancy of zzso zzso zzso dormancy required zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso with low zzso levels, DTC dormancy was short-lived and followed by zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso of zzso or zzso activities awakened dormant zzso zzso zzso zzso Our work reveals a zzso and zzso mechanism where zzso and zzso zzso through zzso regulates DTC dormancy and defines restrictive zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso
