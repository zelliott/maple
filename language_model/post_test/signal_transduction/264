The mechanisms underlying white matter changes in psychiatric disease are not zzso We aimed to zzso the differential protein expression in deep white matter from the zzso prefrontal zzso from 35 zzso 35 bipolar disorder, and 35 control subjects, from the Stanley zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to profile for protein expression changes in the zzso We found 70 protein spots to be significantly zzso expressed between disease and control subjects zzso zzso 46 of which were subsequently identified by zzso The proteins identified included novel disease candidates as well as proteins that have previously been reported as abnormal in zzso thus reinforcing their association with the zzso Furthermore, we confirmed the direction of change for three proteins using zzso namely zzso zzso II, and zzso in a subset of the Stanley zzso zzso In addition, altered expression of zzso zzso II, and zzso was not observed in the zzso of mice chronically treated with haloperidol, making it less likely that these zzso are a consequence of zzso zzso The data presented here strongly suggest disruption of the zzso and its associated signal zzso proteins in zzso and to a lesser extent in bipolar zzso
