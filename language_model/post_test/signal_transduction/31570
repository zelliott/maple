zzso a known member of the class II tumor zzso gene family, is involved in the regulation of differentiation and zzso We analyzed zzso in zzso cell lung zzso in normal zzso and in immortalized and zzso cell zzso zzso percent of lung tumors revealed positive zzso zzso Furthermore, survival analysis demonstrated a significant association of zzso zzso with decreased patient zzso This suggested that zzso known as a tumor zzso plays a different role in zzso cell lung zzso zzso of zzso expression in lung zzso cells inhibited zzso and zzso growth whereas zzso of zzso induced tumor cell zzso zzso with results of the survival analysis, zzso zzso of the protein was essential for this zzso zzso Analysis of signaling pathways potentially involved in this process demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso expression in the cell lines zzso These results indicate that zzso is deficient in its function as a tumor zzso in zzso cell lung zzso and is required for proliferation and zzso growth in cells expressing high levels of the zzso thus contributing to tumor progression in a subset of zzso cell lung zzso
