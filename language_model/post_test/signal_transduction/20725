During the development of zzso the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso is maintained at a higher level than during adult zzso This zzso is probably essential for both cellular growth and zzso of the zzso A high zzso zzso transport capacity zzso and a high plasma level of zzso D3 are considered to play a major role in the high zzso retention observed during zzso Experimental studies have shown that the high zzso observed in growing young compared with adult individuals is not associated with differences in other zzso functions, suggesting the existence of a selective zzso zzso Growth hormone zzso had no direct effect on zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso stimulation of zzso zzso transport in various zzso and zzso conditions is induced by zzso growth zzso zzso the zzso of the anabolic effects of zzso In zzso rats, administration of IGF-1 zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso per zzso zzso zzso and on plasma zzso zzso As for zzso the change in zzso per zzso zzso zzso induced by IGF-1 was zzso by a zzso zzso mechanism and was selectively expressed at the level of the zzso membrane of zzso zzso These observations are evidence that IGF-1 mediates the effect of zzso on the zzso handling of zzso and production of zzso D3 and might play a significant role in the control of zzso metabolism during zzso Recent observations suggest that other growth factors might be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
