zzso zzso I) has been recently described as a specific inhibitor of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso As zzso zzso is zzso important in zzso zzso zzso zzso large cell zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso can mediate significant zzso effects in this cell zzso In two zzso zzso cell lines zzso 299 and zzso zzso significantly reduced the number of viable cells to 50% of that of negative controls at a dose of zzso zzso at 24 h and zzso zzso at 48 zzso This decrease in viability was associated with zzso as confirmed by the increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of active zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in a zzso fashion, and these changes were coupled with significant decreases in several zzso downstream targets, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso also dramatically decreased the protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso and these effects were zzso by zzso Our data support that zzso is a potentially useful therapeutic agent for zzso zzso In addition to its role as a zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in regulating zzso degradation for proteins such as zzso and zzso
