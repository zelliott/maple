zzso is a disease characterized by an abnormal pattern of zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso forms part of the normal human skin zzso It may also be involved in the zzso of zzso To define the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso we investigated how zzso zzso regulates molecules involved in cell migration and zzso The experiments were performed using human zzso and skin zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we examined the signal zzso mechanisms zzso 

Western zzso analysis was performed on human zzso zzso treated or zzso with zzso zzso and on zzso from healthy and psoriasis zzso Signal zzso mechanisms involved were evaluated by zzso mobility shift zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso 

We found that zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso chain, and zzso expression in human zzso via zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients, an increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso zzso can induce the overproduction of molecules involved in cell migration and zzso thereby favoring the zzso of zzso
