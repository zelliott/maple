The role of zzso in zzso zzso has been studied extensively for more than 20 zzso However, little has been learned about the specific targeted zzso and zzso effects of zzso since no specific zzso interactions have been established between zzso and the so called zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and related hormones, such as zzso zzso zzso hormone and zzso zzso zzso acting through different zzso have similar effects in zzso zzso The recent cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences has clarified many aspects of its structure as well as its integrated role in the cell and the entire zzso The zzso contains seven zzso zzso and is zzso by a zzso zzso binding site and a large zzso domain containing the zzso zzso mainly involved in zzso zzso The zzso is expressed in liver, pancreatic beta cells, zzso zzso zzso heart, and vascular zzso as well as in some region of brain, stomach, and adrenal zzso The precise role of the zzso in most of these zzso is still zzso However, with the cloning of the coding zzso genetic zzso of the zzso should provide specific indications of the normal zzso effects of the zzso system on these zzso and how altered zzso zzso might contribute to the development of zzso
