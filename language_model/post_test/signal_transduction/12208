Stem cells are normally maintained in a zzso state and zzso only under certain zzso however, little is known about the biological stimuli that initiate the proliferation and differentiation of stem zzso In this study, we found that functional zzso receptors zzso are expressed on mouse embryonic stem zzso cells and that zzso zzso stimulate zzso cell proliferation and promote their zzso zzso zzso zzso activate zzso signaling zzso leading to the altered expression of numerous genes in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso efficiently stimulate the proliferation and expansion of adult stem cells and zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso as zzso We further found that zzso zzso zzso cells zzso express zzso complex and actively zzso resulting in the enhanced growth of zzso in response to zzso zzso Thus, mouse zzso cells and adult zzso stem zzso directly sense and respond to microbial products, which function as a class of foreign, but biological stimuli for stem zzso zzso This finding expands the biological role of zzso and has implications in understanding stem cell biology, tissue zzso and the role of infection and inflammation in zzso zzso
