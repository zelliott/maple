zzso is a mouse zzso line, which is a well-established model for studying signal zzso in B zzso normally responding to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex by the rapid zzso of protein zzso zzso activity, followed by increased zzso calcium and zzso of protein zzso zzso In zzso zzso of protein zzso C is functionally associated with zzso of DNA zzso followed by the induction of zzso We have found in zzso that at low and environmentally relevant exposure levels zzso zzso mercury is not toxic, but still interferes with signal zzso in that it zzso the growth zzso effects of zzso zzso The molecular target for mercury resulting in zzso of the zzso growth zzso signal is likely zzso to zzso of the zzso complex, as zzso had no effect on the negative growth signal generated downstream by direct zzso of protein zzso C with zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with high and toxic zzso of zzso results in a marked increase in protein zzso zzso in a great many zzso whereas treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso mercury is not zzso Under these conditions mercury selectively zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of a 75 zzso zzso without zzso affecting zzso zzso levels of most other zzso These data suggest that low levels of mercury, which are not toxic, may still contribute to immune dysfunction by interfering with zzso and zzso signal zzso in zzso
