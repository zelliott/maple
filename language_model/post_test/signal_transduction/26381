zzso acids zzso are considered to be zzso factors in zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso in the cellular environment influence proliferation of zzso zzso cell zzso Some zzso induced proliferation in several zzso cell zzso In the proliferation zzso significant increases in zzso cell proliferation were observed in response to zzso acid or zzso acid zzso Among the zzso derivatives of zzso especially zzso reduced zzso production in zzso zzso zzso toxin completely inhibited the zzso increase in zzso zzso suggesting zzso proliferation required zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso a zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso We confirmed an increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso by zzso clearly suppressed zzso zzso cell zzso A significant increase was observed in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells after exposure to zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that zzso increased the proportion of cells in S phase only after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso in the cellular environment are potent zzso of cell proliferation accompanied by zzso instability in zzso zzso
