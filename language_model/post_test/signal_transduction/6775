zzso zzso 3 zzso was originally identified as the zzso for viral zzso and represents a major host zzso defense zzso zzso may also recognize zzso zzso zzso released from injured zzso under certain stress zzso However, a role for zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso injury has not been zzso This study examined the role of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac dysfunction during zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient zzso mice were subjected to 45 minutes of coronary artery zzso and 24 hours of zzso Compared with zzso zzso or zzso mice had smaller zzso and better preserved cardiac zzso Surprisingly, unlike zzso zzso lack of zzso signaling had no impact on zzso zzso or zzso recruitment after zzso but zzso zzso was significantly attenuated in zzso zzso zzso of the downstream zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to release of zzso including zzso from injured zzso and zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso induced a robust and zzso zzso response in cultured zzso which was markedly reduced by zzso but not zzso and partially blocked in zzso zzso In zzso zzso administration reduced serum zzso level, attenuated zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cardiac protection against zzso zzso 

zzso signaling represents an zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso released during zzso may contribute to zzso inflammation and zzso
