Both zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso and as such, they represent an attractive therapeutic zzso Recent studies found that zzso is a downstream target of zzso protein zzso zzso while zzso has been found to be a zzso therapeutic target for zzso zzso In a wide range of human zzso the zzso zzso zzso is enhanced and the cellular response to growth signals is known to zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the zzso cascade regulates zzso signaling and zzso via the zzso zzso in a panel of zzso cancer cell zzso zzso growing human zzso zzso cervical zzso cervical zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells were used in culture treated with either control or zzso inhibitor or zzso before and after zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso in modified zzso zzso V and zzso zzso were zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso decreased the zzso potential and improved the radiation response in all cellular zzso The zzso of zzso upon zzso treatment positively correlated with the zzso of zzso and the reduction of zzso zzso zzso In addition, upon zzso treatment zzso protein expression was found to be zzso indicating that the improved radiation response may be caused by decreased DNA zzso damage repair zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso confirmed the zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso potential and zzso zzso by highly increasing zzso mechanisms in all zzso cancer cell lines zzso Evidence from our experiments show that zzso potential and radiation response in zzso cancer cells may ensue from a zzso or zzso zzso Together with the close correlation of zzso and zzso protein zzso this study zzso the potential role of a zzso axis whose interruption recovers the zzso effects of zzso
