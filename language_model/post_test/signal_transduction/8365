zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso associated with zzso blood and tissue zzso and zzso zzso We wondered whether zzso zzso in zzso results from the zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso in blood zzso leading to their prolonged zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso in blood zzso isolated from nine patients in zzso zzso zzso seven patients in zzso zzso zzso and 14 matched healthy zzso zzso zzso levels were also zzso 

In active zzso blood zzso were characterized by small zzso decrease in expression of a few zzso primarily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or involved in regulation of zzso zzso zzso but they did not differ in the rate of spontaneous zzso when compared with other zzso Only selected genes were positively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso correlated with disease zzso In active zzso zzso expressed zzso markers zzso zzso especially in subjects with most severe disease and elevated serum zzso 

High zzso of peripheral blood zzso to spontaneous zzso in zzso and minor changes in expression of zzso genes in zzso analysis, do not support the hypothesis on intrinsic zzso in zzso as the cause of zzso zzso in zzso
