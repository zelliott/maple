zzso zzso is a major zzso pathogen of freshwater fish capable of causing substantial economic zzso None of the available control measures have been able to address the problem of zzso zzso To combat this pathogen zzso it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of its life processes with information on various genes zzso The zzso studies can generate introductory information about genes participating in zzso processes of the zzso which could be targeted for their zzso In this study, the zzso sequencing of zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso 2000 platform which generated zzso high quality zzso A total of zzso transcript zzso were assembled with average length of zzso and zzso length of zzso In total, zzso zzso including 184 novel zzso and zzso open reading frames zzso were identified from the assembled zzso Gene zzso and zzso zzso of Genes and zzso zzso analysis were performed to zzso zzso into their functional categories and regulation zzso Additionally, zzso simple sequence repeats were identified from the assembled zzso Further, twelve zzso with high similarity with downstream molecules of the zzso toll like zzso zzso zzso were validated by their zzso expressions in response to zzso zzso of Gram negative bacteria, zzso coli and Gram positive bacteria, zzso zzso The zzso of an zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the downstream zzso molecules of Toll zzso zzso The zzso data generated will facilitate studies on functional zzso that will subsequently be applied for vaccine development and other control strategies against the zzso
