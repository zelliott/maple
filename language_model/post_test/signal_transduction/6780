A key zzso regulator of cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso also regulates zzso zzso but its role in zzso gene regulation is not well zzso Here, we asked whether genetic zzso of zzso zzso gene expression for the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso inflammatory zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in mice, we found significant zzso gene induction in zzso mice, whereas zzso zzso zzso failed to augment zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso regulation in zzso mice was accompanied by zzso stress shown by elevated zzso zzso and protein zzso In zzso analysis of the mouse zzso zzso promoter region revealed consensus binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated diminished zzso protein binding to the zzso response element promoter site zzso to the zzso start site in zzso zzso mice, implicating zzso in zzso of zzso DNA zzso Nuclear protein zzso demonstrated an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice that was greatly reduced in zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso expression through zzso zzso expression in zzso The presence of this new zzso signaling axis indicates that zzso opposes zzso zzso stress by means of selective induction of one or more zzso response zzso zzso By zzso exploitation of this axis could lead to new pharmacological interventions to improve the zzso defenses during zzso zzso zzso zzso
