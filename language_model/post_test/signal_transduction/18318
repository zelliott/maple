Signaling and tumor promoting functions have been zzso assigned to the zzso many of them linked to oxygen free zzso like zzso zzso and other zzso oxygen species zzso have been associated for many years with zzso and they are emerging as important signaling molecules connected to the classical signaling zzso the zzso the cell cycle control, and tumor initiation and zzso Complex and zzso relationships between these entities are being discovered and attributed to specific zzso zzso zzso analysis and experimental data indicate that small electronic currents may be carried by zzso electron transport along zzso zzso it is proposed in this paper that the zzso effects mentioned above might be under control or zzso of these tiny electronic currents originated in relation to zzso and transported through the zzso zzso zzso zzso
