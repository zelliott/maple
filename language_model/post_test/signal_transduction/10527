We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso by zzso cells of the two zzso regions of the adult zzso brain: the zzso zone zzso B zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We explored the possibility that adult zzso neural stem cells express zzso receptors and investigated their functional properties in zzso zzso cultured from the adult mouse zzso in the presence of zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor 2 expressed the zzso zzso and the tissue zzso zzso of alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso evoked rapid zzso zzso in zzso that were exclusively zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of these receptors and low zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation in the presence of growth zzso zzso cell proliferation was attenuated after application of the zzso zzso zzso and in zzso from zzso knockout zzso In zzso zzso identified zzso zzso in clusters of zzso zzso Our results zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso growth zzso cell zzso Together with the in zzso data, this supports the notion that zzso zzso contribute to the control of adult zzso
