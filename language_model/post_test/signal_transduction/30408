Large brain size is one of the defining characteristics of modern zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso a disorder of markedly reduced brain and body size, is associated with defective zzso DNA damage zzso Only a single zzso zzso of zzso has been identified in this genetically zzso zzso We now report that zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso in the loss of zzso from the zzso where it has key functions zzso both structural and regulatory zzso cause zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that cells of individuals with zzso syndrome due to zzso in zzso zzso have defects in zzso checkpoint zzso providing the first evidence linking a structural zzso protein with DNA damage zzso These findings also suggest that other known zzso genes implicated in either DNA repair responses or zzso function may act in common zzso pathways determining human brain and body zzso
