zzso protein zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso in various human tumors and participate in several signaling pathways involved in growth, differentiation and zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso only in growing cells and depend on Ras zzso and participate in the Ras signal zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso may be a new strategy for cancer zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a novel zzso zzso blocked the functions of zzso and markedly suppressed zzso cell growth through the induction of zzso The zzso bound with zzso which zzso with the interaction of zzso with zzso and further suppressed Ras signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso of zzso substantially decreased the proliferation of zzso cells and inhibited Ras signal zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso could enhance zzso zzso and growth zzso of zzso zzso We also found that zzso suppressed the growth of zzso mice bearing colon zzso tumors and nude mice bearing zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso might be useful in cancer therapy and that zzso is a promising new therapeutic agent for zzso
