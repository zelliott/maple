The median zzso nucleus zzso is an zzso site for the zzso and neural signals induced by a zzso in the zzso balance, and it is highly involved in controlling fluid and zzso zzso Here, we zzso that zzso zzso previously recognized to control zzso behaviors, may regulate the zzso of zzso zzso and that this regulatory action may depend on the zzso zzso status of body fluid zzso Our results show that zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso receptors zzso triggered a membrane zzso by recruiting a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, 24 h zzso depletion strengthened this zzso control of zzso zzso In zzso animals, the zzso population displaying the zzso zzso expanded to zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso restored this population to the control level zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among the zzso displaying zzso zzso zzso depletion specifically increased the zzso population responsive to variation in ambient zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso dramatically reduced the population that was unresponsive to zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso Neither the basic properties of the zzso nor the characteristics of the zzso response were altered by the body zzso zzso Our results indicate that an episode of zzso zzso zzso zzso the organization of the zzso network of the zzso Such network plasticity might be related to the avid salt zzso triggered by repeated zzso zzso
