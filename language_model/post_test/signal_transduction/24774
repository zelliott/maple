zzso zzso factor zzso plays a critical role in the development of neural zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso added zzso zzso an zzso signaling zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso The zzso promoter of the human zzso gene zzso zzso contains a functional zzso site, which is bound in zzso by zzso and zzso the preferential expression on a reporter gene in zzso and melanoma cells, as judged by the transient zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso site is required for the zzso of a reporter gene by zzso zzso or their zzso zzso added zzso protein also zzso the zzso promoter via the zzso zzso this zzso was abolished when a zzso form of zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling recruits zzso and zzso to the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso the present study identifies zzso as a direct target of zzso zzso
