zzso zzso zzso zzso is an immediate early zzso and its expression is regulated by a variety of zzso such as electric stimulation and zzso The function of zzso however, is zzso To explore this function, we carried out expression experiments by zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso or by using a protein zzso system in zzso cultured zzso We found that the zzso of Arc as well as Arc induction by seizure in zzso decreased zzso protein 2 zzso zzso in the zzso by zzso although zzso content was not changed on Western zzso Furthermore, Arc zzso with newly zzso zzso and zzso leading to blocking of the zzso of zzso The data suggest that Arc increased by synaptic activities would trigger zzso zzso by interacting with zzso zzso
