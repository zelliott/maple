zzso cells with zzso zzso and properties, known as cancer stem cells zzso have been identified in most solid tumors and are presumed to be responsible for driving tumor zzso zzso zzso or zzso A zzso of cells with increased zzso potential has also been identified within zzso These cells are endowed with increased zzso potential, zzso expression of embryonic zzso and side zzso zzso zzso zzso are soft tissue zzso presumably arising from zzso cells of zzso origin, the zzso Stem zzso zzso zzso recurrence of zzso and zzso of relapsed patients may likely result from the failure to target zzso zzso therapeutic cues coming from the cancer stem cell zzso field may drastically improve patient zzso 

We expanded zzso zzso cells from patient samples in zzso and examined the possibility to counteract zzso zzso through a zzso cell effective zzso zzso zzso cells were in zzso expanded both as zzso zzso and as zzso in zzso Stem Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cells displayed zzso zzso higher SP zzso and increased zzso extended proliferation potential, zzso and multiple differentiation zzso They were zzso highly zzso and faithfully reproduced the patient tumor in zzso Such cells displayed zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a possibility in overcoming their zzso through zzso zzso zzso plus zzso treatment determined zzso zzso impairment of SP zzso high zzso in zzso and strong zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting both zzso and differentiated zzso 

zzso blockade combined with zzso determines zzso cell effective zzso activity in zzso and in zzso against zzso thus providing a potential therapy for zzso zzso
