The zzso gene encodes a small zzso of replication factor C zzso complex in zzso zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is impaired in the zzso zzso In this report, we show that the zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso is necessary for slowing the zzso progression in response to DNA zzso The zzso of the essential central zzso zzso protein zzso is reduced in response to DNA damage in zzso zzso during the S zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso in response to DNA damage is dependent on zzso It has been shown that zzso of zzso is controlled by zzso and zzso members of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso of zzso suppresses the zzso growth zzso and DNA damage sensitivity of zzso zzso and restores zzso of zzso and zzso induction in response to DNA damage in zzso Our results, together with the observation that zzso of zzso suppresses the defects of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso is part of a mechanism zzso the DNA damage signal to the zzso of the central zzso zzso
