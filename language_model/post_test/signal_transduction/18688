Although zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso its role in the regulation of fetal growth and maturation is poorly zzso These issues were examined in a line of mice with a global deletion of the zzso zzso zzso which are characterized by lower blood zzso levels and by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was deleterious to fetal zzso it delayed zzso differentiation and zzso the proportion of zzso to zzso in embryonic zzso In adults, the zzso inhibited the progression of zzso to maturity, affected the expression of several zzso zzso and resulted in an zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This increase was due to an zzso in both zzso number and in the rate of proliferation of cells expressing zzso or zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso in a feedback loop that regulates the proportion of the different zzso cell types in zzso the number of zzso per zzso and development of the mature zzso zzso
