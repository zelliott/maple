The zzso virus zzso is a major viral disease that causes huge economic loss in the pig industry zzso Most viruses have been found to generate zzso factors that facilitate cell survival in the early stages of zzso This study aimed to investigate the zzso effects of zzso and study the underlying mechanisms in the early stage of zzso We investigated and compared whether the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could block zzso induced by virus infection, and further identified molecules involved in the signaling zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso elicits zzso dependent protein zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso signaling in the early stage of zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso enhanced cell death but no effect was observed on virus replication or zzso gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protect cells against zzso avian zzso or bovine ephemeral fever zzso zzso in the cell zzso zzso and zzso transient zzso zzso several zzso signaling events, and the zzso activity of zzso is greater than that of zzso zzso zzso point or double point zzso zzso lost the zzso activity of zzso which showed that zzso activity is required for the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso still occurred in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso study showed that zzso zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso signaling zzso including zzso zzso and zzso which is a similar result to that seen in the in zzso zzso Our study suggests that signaling mechanisms may play important roles in zzso zzso
