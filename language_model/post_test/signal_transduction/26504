Human obesity is characterized by chronic zzso inflammation in white zzso tissue and is often associated with zzso The potential induction of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso degradation pathway, by zzso zzso could be associated with these disorders but has remained unexplored in zzso Using zzso we detected zzso expression in white zzso tissue of obese patients, and we focused on its contribution in the regulation of vascular tone and on its zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were measured in zzso of 36 obese and 15 lean zzso The expression of zzso in corresponding zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso and liver was zzso zzso markers and zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso tissue via the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso In obese subjects, the ratio of zzso to zzso which reflects zzso zzso is higher than in lean zzso Furthermore, zzso expression in both zzso zzso and liver is increased and is zzso correlated with zzso blood zzso zzso is associated with a zzso zzso in obese zzso zzso with predominance of zzso in the zzso compartment and of zzso in the subcutaneous zzso The zzso balance is decreased in subcutaneous fat and zzso with zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso despite zzso zzso the zzso balance control is zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso represents a local zzso mechanism to limit zzso inflammation and zzso
