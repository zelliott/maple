zzso zzso is an important zzso modification that regulates almost every aspect of cellular function and many cell signaling pathways in zzso zzso of protein zzso have been linked to many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, zzso disorders and inflammatory zzso To understand the roles of protein zzso in these diseases and in cell signaling zzso it is necessary to identify zzso proteins and their modification zzso However, zzso to the nature of protein zzso it is challenging to identify the exact modification sites under zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso an zzso approach, which uses zzso zzso specifically to enrich for peptides derived from the zzso portion of proteins and mass zzso for their zzso was developed to determine zzso events from cell zzso This approach has now been widely applied to profile protein zzso in several cellular zzso In this review, we discuss zzso methods for the identification of protein zzso sites, analyze their advantages and zzso and discuss their application for zzso analysis of zzso
