Aging is commonly defined as a zzso phenomenon associated with zzso and functional deleterious changes in which zzso stress has a fundamental zzso therefore, readjusting the zzso balance should have beneficial zzso In our study, we tested the zzso zzso in old mouse brains and showed positive effects at the cellular and zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso protein expression and zzso deposits in the brain compared to aged zzso Furthermore, zzso stress was increased by aging and induced the nuclear zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso which was suppressed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso was increased in both control and zzso old mice, despite the different zzso states of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated in the old mice, which may be explained by this group's response to the increased zzso zzso this insult was inhibited in zzso animals, showing this group an increase in active zzso population that was not observed in old zzso We also report that zzso is capable of restoring the zzso potential of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso beneficial effects on brain aging are linked to the increase in zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso which probably reduces the zzso contribution to the zzso stress zzso
