zzso for zzso zzso zzso can be imported directly from the zzso derived from zzso or salvaged from zzso or external zzso All pathways must generate zzso zzso the activated form of zzso zzso or salvaged zzso is directly zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso from zzso is converted to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Normally, zzso provides the majority of zzso for zzso zzso To assess the contribution of zzso zzso we used zzso zzso to study zzso of zzso I, a highly sensitive indicator zzso In zzso cells, imported zzso and salvaged zzso make a significant contribution to zzso When these cells were grown in zzso medium along with the zzso zzso zzso to block the salvage zzso zzso of zzso I was almost completely zzso Adding approximately 13 zzso zzso to the medium completely restored normal zzso Treatment with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso also markedly reduced zzso of zzso I, but in this case only 8 zzso zzso was required to restore full zzso indicating that a zzso source of zzso made a significant zzso zzso levels were greatly also reduced in zzso zzso when zzso membrane trafficking was blocked by expression of a zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso cells can salvage zzso from both zzso and external zzso via zzso and zzso degradation zzso
