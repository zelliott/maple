The zzso switch from zzso cell proliferation to differentiation is essential for effective adult tissue zzso We previously reported the critical role of zzso signaling in the zzso expansion of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We now show that the onset of differentiation is due to a transition from zzso signaling to zzso signaling in zzso zzso and is associated with an increased expression of zzso in the tissue and an increased responsiveness of zzso to zzso zzso between these two pathways occurs via zzso which is maintained in an active form by zzso but is inhibited by zzso in the zzso zzso signaling zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso balance between zzso and zzso signaling zzso the precise progression of muscle precursor cells along the zzso lineage pathway, through stages of zzso expansion and then zzso during zzso zzso
