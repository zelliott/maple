zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and may play roles in the progression of neurodegenerative zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso remains zzso 

Our aim was to examine the regulation of activated zzso through their cell death and survival zzso 

We used mouse zzso zzso which are destined to die within a few days under ordinary culture zzso The zzso live for longer than 1 month, without any measurable increase in zzso or zzso cell death, when kept activated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed changes in zzso zzso treatment had no effect on the level of the zzso zzso X protein but increased the level of the zzso protein zzso at day zzso Furthermore, the level of zzso light chain zzso a marker protein for zzso was decreased 3 h after exposure to zzso 

An increase in zzso seems to inhibit both zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso resulting from exposure to the optimal dose of zzso may play critical roles in the progression of zzso
