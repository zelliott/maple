The release of zzso c from zzso is necessary for the formation of the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso However, the role of zzso c in zzso zzso in zzso cells is not well zzso We demonstrate here that zzso c remains associated with zzso during zzso of zzso cells and that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are activated after various death stimuli without any significant release of zzso c in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also fails to show any zzso c release from zzso A significant proportion of cellular zzso and zzso appears to zzso near zzso suggesting that an zzso may form in the vicinity of zzso in the absence of zzso c zzso In zzso zzso was recruited to a zzso complex, similar to the zzso zzso in cell extracts supplemented with zzso c and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in insects follows a more primitive mechanism that may be the precursor to the zzso zzso pathways in zzso
