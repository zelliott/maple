zzso anemia zzso stem cells display poor zzso capacity when subjected to a variety of cellular zzso This zzso raises the question of whether the zzso anemia proteins are stabilized or recruited as part of a stress response and protect against stem cell zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso anemia pathway, is zzso targeted for degradation by the zzso We confirm zzso that zzso is zzso with zzso zzso zzso of a series of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso fold may direct zzso In addition, our studies showed that zzso is stabilized in a complex with zzso when zzso zzso zzso is zzso This result leads us to investigate the potential regulation of zzso by upstream signaling pathways known to regulate zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso active, zzso increases zzso protein level by reducing zzso of zzso zzso PAGE analysis shows that zzso forms of zzso some of which are zzso are not subject to zzso These results indicate that a signal zzso zzso involved in zzso and survival of zzso stem cells also functions to stabilize zzso and suggests that zzso zzso directly in support of stem cell zzso
