We investigated the possible mechanisms of development of zzso learning and zzso dependence by the methods of behavioral pharmacology and confirmed them by using zzso zzso The zzso mice for the zzso zzso zzso gene and for the zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso binding protein zzso gene showed the impairment of zzso learning in the water finding task, and these mice did not develop zzso zzso The spatial learning and zzso long-term zzso zzso were normal in the both zzso zzso zzso mice showed a reduction of high zzso zzso release in the frontal zzso measured by the zzso technique and of zzso content in the zzso In conclusion, the results of zzso mice suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signal pathways may play a key role in development of zzso learning and zzso zzso and they zzso show that the expression of genes zzso by zzso zzso may be involved in the development of zzso learning and zzso zzso
