Members of the zzso family of zzso zzso regulate many zzso zzso including cell zzso We and others have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for cell migration and zzso zzso However, the roles in cell migration of all of the zzso zzso zzso genes and their candidate receptors have not been explored zzso We have extended our analysis to include all zzso zzso zzso and six candidate zzso zzso four zzso the sole zzso family zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso play major roles in directing cell zzso and that all five zzso direct specific cell zzso either by acting zzso or by zzso each other's zzso We report that all four zzso function to direct zzso cell zzso but only a subset of the putative zzso receptors function in directing zzso of other zzso Finally, we find striking differences between the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso quadruple zzso
