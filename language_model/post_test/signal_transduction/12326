The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso protein that possesses an zzso zzso domain, a central zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso could activate zzso expression in mature zzso zzso Here, we report its distinct role in zzso diverse hormone, stress, and zzso zzso We zzso discovered that zzso expression of zzso zzso was regulated zzso and controlled by the zzso clock, with maximum expression in the zzso This pattern of expression suggested that zzso zzso could be linked to the availability of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso whereas zzso nitrogen increased zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a hypersensitive response to both zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso thus supporting a role of zzso in sugar signaling in zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso imparted resistance to both zzso and zzso at zzso suggesting that zzso suppresses sugar and zzso zzso In support of the previously described zzso relationship between zzso and zzso we found that zzso positively regulated certain zzso responses in plants, as revealed by knocking down zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was affected by a variety of hormones, zzso and zzso and zzso was required for responses to many of these same zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a central component of an interconnected signaling network that detects and responds to multiple zzso
