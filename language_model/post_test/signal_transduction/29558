zzso communication zzso zzso zzso responses zzso by nuclear zzso While studies have zzso many of the components involved in this process, the energetic architecture within the zzso protein that mediates zzso remains zzso Using a zzso method designed to detect zzso of zzso acids in a zzso termed the statistical zzso analysis zzso we identify a network of energetically coupled zzso that link the functional surfaces of nuclear zzso zzso binding zzso zzso analysis of these predicted zzso demonstrates their participation in an zzso network that zzso the ability of zzso receptors to activate zzso in response to zzso binding by either zzso Interestingly, zzso of a single network zzso can discriminate between zzso zzso by zzso zzso and synthetic zzso These results reveal a structural network required for zzso zzso zzso communication and suggest that the specificity of zzso response and zzso zzso to enable signal zzso
