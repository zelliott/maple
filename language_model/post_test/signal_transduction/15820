zzso tumors zzso which arise from zzso embryonic germ cells, exhibit a wide range of zzso differentiation states with varying clinical zzso Although zzso zzso is the most common cancer of young men, the genes controlling the development and differentiation of zzso remain largely zzso Through a forward genetic screen, we previously identified a zzso zzso line, zzso which develops spontaneous zzso consisting of zzso germ cells zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cloning we have identified an zzso zzso in zzso a type zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso as the cause of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and early zzso and zzso zzso zzso display impaired zzso signal zzso altered expression of zzso target zzso and abnormal zzso zzso We find a similar absence of zzso signaling in zzso human zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso but not in normal zzso or in differentiated zzso These results indicate a zzso role for zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso and highlight the importance of the zzso zzso in human zzso
