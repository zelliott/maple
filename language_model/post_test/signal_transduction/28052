We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission in the rat zzso nucleus zzso an interface between zzso and zzso that is implicated in zzso zzso This work examined cellular zzso pathways that might zzso this zzso synaptic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso increased the evoked zzso but did not zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a preferential protein zzso A zzso zzso (10 zzso did not block zzso synaptic zzso zzso of slices with zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso or zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso for 20 zzso procedures used to zzso activate or zzso the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, did not change zzso zzso The putative zzso C zzso zzso (10 zzso and its inactive analogue zzso (10 zzso did not alter zzso reduction in the zzso zzso in zzso molecules downstream of zzso C including depleting internal calcium stores by zzso and zzso acid and blocking protein zzso C with zzso had no effect on zzso synaptic zzso Furthermore, zzso depression of the zzso response was not blocked by zzso an zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso depressed zzso zzso isolated zzso zzso synaptic responses while increasing zzso inward currents in the zzso These results indicate that zzso synaptic effects in the zzso are not through the zzso of zzso or zzso toxin sensitive G zzso Furthermore, it does not employ the zzso zzso zzso the zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms to zzso zzso synaptic transmission in the zzso
