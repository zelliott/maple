zzso zzso is considered to be a hallmark of cancer, because zzso in zzso regulators invariably accompany zzso Many zzso agents induce zzso and so disruption of zzso during zzso evolution can promote drug zzso For example, zzso is an zzso regulator that is activated in many zzso and may promote drug resistance in zzso Nevertheless, how zzso zzso zzso and its contribution to clinical drug resistance are zzso Using a zzso zzso model, we show that zzso promotes zzso and drug resistance by zzso zzso and that disruption of zzso zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso reverses zzso in zzso expressing zzso but not in those with other zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulator that acts downstream of zzso and zzso zzso zzso action in zzso and drug resistance, but is unable to zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso These results establish zzso zzso through zzso and zzso as an important mechanism of zzso and drug resistance in zzso and reveal how targeting zzso zzso can restore drug sensitivity in a zzso zzso
