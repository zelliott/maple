Recent findings indicate that zzso signaling is essential for plant resistance to zzso Besides zzso and zzso fatty acids known to play important signaling functions during zzso zzso the very long chain fatty acid zzso zzso zzso has been recently associated to plant defense through different zzso zzso are indeed required for the zzso of the plant zzso and the generation of zzso zzso of the roles of these lipids in zzso stress responses is the result of the use of genetic approaches together with the identification of the zzso involved in their zzso This review focuses on recent observations which revealed the complex function of the zzso and zzso signals, and the key role of zzso as zzso molecules involved in signal zzso and cell death regulation during zzso zzso
