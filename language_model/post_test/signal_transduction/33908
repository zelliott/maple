The zzso zzso has been implicated in restricting diffusion of plasma membrane zzso Here, simultaneous observations of quantum zzso zzso motion and zzso zzso dynamics provide direct evidence that zzso filament zzso define zzso zzso that zzso mobile zzso Dynamic reorganization of zzso structures occurs over seconds, making the location and dimensions of zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso often maintain extended close proximity without zzso correlated motion, suggesting that they are zzso within membrane zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso with zzso zzso We show that receptors become immobilized within seconds of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso results in delayed zzso zzso and increased diffusion of zzso zzso These results zzso zzso in membrane zzso that not only restricts diffusion of membrane zzso but also zzso influences their long-range mobility, zzso and response to zzso zzso
