zzso zzso to activated zzso zzso is the final common zzso of zzso zzso and has become a successful target for zzso zzso In the present study, we found that a small chemical compound, zzso zzso exhibited potent and zzso zzso effects on human zzso zzso caused by various zzso Moreover, addition of zzso to human zzso that had been zzso by zzso caused a rapid zzso We demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso is due to zzso of zzso zzso by measuring the binding amount of zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso is not a direct zzso of zzso because zzso did not affect zzso binding to fixed zzso zzso By investigating how zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso inhibited the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and prevented protein zzso zzso and zzso association of zzso and zzso but it had no direct effects on protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso and zzso and zzso acid zzso and it did not affect the cellular levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a new class of zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso without directly affecting other signaling pathways required for zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso functions in a manner different from zzso antagonists, this feature may provide a new strategy for treatment of zzso zzso
