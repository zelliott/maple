zzso leukemia virus zzso is associated with zzso bovine zzso and is closely related to human zzso leukemia virus type zzso The Tax protein of zzso is a zzso zzso of viral replication and a key contributor to zzso zzso We previously identified interesting zzso forms of Tax with elevated zzso or reduced zzso zzso effects on zzso replication and zzso However, the effects of these zzso on functions other than zzso zzso are zzso In this study, to identify genes that play a role in the cascade of signal events regulated by zzso and zzso Tax zzso we used a large-scale host cell zzso zzso 

Using a zzso containing approximately zzso human zzso zzso we found several zzso after the expression of Tax proteins in genes involved in many cellular functions such as transcription, signal zzso cell growth, zzso stress response, and immune response, indicating that Tax protein has multiple biological effects on various cellular zzso We also found that zzso strongly regulated more genes involved in transcription, signal zzso and cell growth functions, contrary to zzso which regulated fewer zzso In addition, the expression of genes related to stress response significantly increased in the presence of zzso as compared to zzso Tax and zzso By contrast, the largest group of zzso genes was related to immune response, and the majority of these genes belonged to the zzso zzso However, no significant difference in the expression level of zzso genes was observed among the Tax zzso Finally, the expression of important cellular factors obtained from the human zzso results were validated at the zzso and protein levels by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and western zzso respectively, after zzso Tax proteins into bovine cells and human zzso zzso 

A comparative analysis of zzso and zzso Tax proteins indicates that Tax protein exerts a significant impact on cellular functions as diverse as transcription, signal zzso cell growth, stress response and immune zzso zzso our study is the first report that shows the extent to which zzso Tax regulates the innate immune zzso
