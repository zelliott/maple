zzso zzso are zzso giant cells and are formed by the fusion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso It is known that zzso derived from different genetic backgrounds exhibit quite distinct characteristics of immune zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso from different genetic backgrounds show distinct zzso In this study, we showed that bone-marrow zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso mice exhibited considerably distinct zzso characteristics and cell differentiation into zzso The differentiation of zzso into zzso was comparatively quicker in the zzso and zzso mice, while that of zzso mice was rather zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a giant cell with a round shape, zzso zzso were of a moderate size with many zzso and zzso zzso had the smallest size with fewer zzso The zzso signaling of differentiation and expression levels of marker proteins of zzso were different in the respective zzso Treatment of zzso from the three different strains with the reducing agent zzso zzso or with the zzso agent hydrogen zzso zzso induced changes in the shape and sizes of the cells and caused distinct patterns of cell differentiation and zzso Thus, genetic backgrounds and zzso conditions regulate the zzso characteristics and cell differentiation of zzso
