Studies of chemical signaling between plants and bacteria in the past have been largely confined to two models: the zzso symbiotic association and zzso between zzso and their host zzso Recent studies are beginning to provide evidence that many zzso bacteria undergo chemical signaling with the plant host via zzso zzso zzso compounds interact with bacterial regulatory proteins that then affect gene zzso Similarly, bacterial zzso signals result in a range of functional responses in zzso This review attempts to highlight current knowledge in chemical signaling that takes place between zzso bacteria and zzso This chemical communication between plant and bacteria, also referred to as zzso zzso will likely become a major research field in the future, as it allows the design of specific strategies to create plants that are resistant to plant zzso
