Recent evidence indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso is also zzso and zzso through a zzso zzso To investigate this zzso pathway, we zzso the zzso zzso complex for zzso zzso and identified a protein complex containing the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso it to induce zzso zzso binding to the zzso induced the zzso of zzso from zzso In zzso cells, the degradation of zzso zzso was zzso however, zzso degradation was observed to the same extent as in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is regulated by two independent zzso zzso which are switched by zzso binding to zzso One zzso is necessary for the zzso of the zzso and the other is involved in the quality control of the zzso
