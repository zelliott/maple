To get access to iron, zzso produce and release into their environment small organic metal zzso called zzso In zzso they produce zzso outer membrane zzso (also called zzso zzso or zzso embedded in the outer zzso these proteins actively zzso the zzso loaded with iron from the zzso zzso This active zzso requires energy in the form of the zzso motive force transferred from the inner membrane to the outer membrane zzso via the inner membrane zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso are structurally very diverse with molecular weights of 150 up to zzso zzso zzso from the zzso medium by zzso is a highly selective and sometimes even zzso process, with each zzso having a specific zzso Unlike the zzso all zzso have similar structures and belong to the outer membrane zzso protein zzso The way in which the zzso complex passes through the zzso is still zzso In some bacteria, zzso are also partners of signaling zzso regulating the expression of proteins involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
