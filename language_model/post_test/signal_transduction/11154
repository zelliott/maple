This contribution moves in the direction of answering some general questions about the most effective and useful ways of zzso zzso We investigate the characteristics of models that are good at zzso We trained three fully zzso models with different zzso structures zzso zzso differential equations with inheritance of rates and a network of zzso on zzso zzso shake flask zzso data using genetic zzso The models were then tested on unseen data outside the range of the training data and the resulting performances were zzso It was found that constrained models with mathematical forms analogous to internal mass balancing and zzso relations were superior to flexible zzso models, even though no a zzso knowledge of this zzso was zzso
