To explore the presence of several zzso protein zzso in the zzso humor and to follow changes in levels and activity along chronic elevated zzso zzso 

zzso chamber once-a-week injections of zzso acid were used as a rat model of induced elevated zzso zzso zzso rats served as control and the counter zzso eye was used as sham zzso zzso humor was taken at different zzso and analyzed by Western zzso analysis for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso active form and total protein zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in the zzso humor of the entire tested zzso In rats exposed to elevated zzso pressure for longer than two weeks, a significant increase in the zzso zzso was zzso Total zzso expression following the zzso acid injections significantly zzso Higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso humor of the zzso acid injection zzso versus the saline and sham groups zzso zzso with elevated zzso pressure after two weeks expressed significantly higher zzso than the short-term injected zzso acid, zzso and sham zzso The amount of the two zzso zzso declined in the zzso acid injected rats, reaching significance when the elevated zzso pressure is longer than two weeks versus zzso Among the tested samples, zzso expressed the different zzso zzso independent of the zzso Along with the zzso zzso the majority were from the sham zzso There is a significant decrease in the total amount of the three zzso in the zzso acid injected rats after two weeks versus the sham and saline zzso 

We suggest that these signaling molecules might be a new target for intervention, opening new possibilities for zzso pressure zzso
