zzso stem cells are derived from culture of early zzso or the zzso and can be induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso that stabilize the differentiated state and have tumor suppression functions are expected to zzso However, we have a limited understanding of what such barriers might zzso To find novel barriers to zzso to zzso we compared the zzso profiles of the mouse zzso with zzso and zzso cells, in zzso and in zzso There is a remarkable global expression of the zzso program for zzso in primordial germ cells zzso We identify parallels between zzso zzso to zzso and human germ cell zzso including the loss of zzso a tumor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso increases the efficiency of induction of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso specifically enhances the generation of fully zzso zzso cells without accelerating cell zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso in human cells by zzso zzso zzso but not zzso two downstream zzso of the zzso zzso These results reveal zzso parallels between germ cell transformation and the generation of zzso cells and indicate that the zzso zzso constitutes a barrier to cellular zzso
