We report on the characterization of the interaction between zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso acid zzso gene network in ozone zzso stress zzso To identify the stress-related zzso pathways and possible zzso controlled by an zzso regulator, the protein zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso we performed a zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso and zzso knockout zzso zzso In addition, to better understand zzso zzso and the interactions between stress response zzso we performed a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso categorization of the identified genes showed that zzso is involved in the zzso of several cellular processes including zzso zzso development, information pathways and zzso zzso Comparisons with available zzso data sets revealed the extent of zzso involvement in both zzso and zzso gene zzso Furthermore, in zzso stress the zzso hypersensitivity of zzso resulted in a significant reduction of the zzso level, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the physical interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso We provide a model explaining how zzso can regulate both zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our findings indicate that zzso plays the role of a general signal zzso linking zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso pathways to zzso stress zzso
