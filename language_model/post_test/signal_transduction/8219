To study the effects of serum derived from rats treated with zzso at stomach zzso zzso on the expressions of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling substances zzso C zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso in gastric zzso zzso 

Sixty rats were randomly divided into normal group, stomach zzso group, gallbladder zzso group, stomach zzso plus zzso group and gallbladder zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and restrained stress methods were adopted for inducing gastric zzso injury in the zzso zzso zzso cells were separated by using zzso zzso method, and incubated by zzso a zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in the gastric zzso cells was tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso while the expression of zzso by isotope incorporate zzso and the expression of zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

In gastric zzso cells, weak expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen in the normal group, and relatively strong expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen in the stomach zzso group and the gallbladder zzso group, among which, the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the stomach zzso group were the zzso and there was a significant difference between the stomach zzso group and the gallbladder zzso group zzso Relative weak expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen in the stomach zzso plus zzso group and the gallbladder zzso plus zzso group, and there was a significant difference between the stomach zzso group and the stomach zzso plus zzso group zzso 

The serum derived from the rats treated with zzso at stomach zzso zzso can activate the zzso singling pathway, and this provides an evidence for the theory of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in traditional Chinese zzso
