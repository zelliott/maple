Human zzso zzso cells zzso have been the object of intense research due to their potential therapeutic zzso In this paper, we present molecular evidence of a bona fide zzso to zzso transition zzso undergone by zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso showed the presence of typical zzso markers such as zzso and zzso zzso in culture, however, underwent zzso changes acquiring a zzso zzso zzso cell markers were lost and typical zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Several genes associated with zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso increased their zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso was consistent with the zzso of zzso We have shown that zzso undergo zzso due to the zzso production of zzso Furthermore, the addition of the zzso zzso I zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso prevented zzso and preserved the zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that cultured zzso undergo zzso through the zzso production of zzso
