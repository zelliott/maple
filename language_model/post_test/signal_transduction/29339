Although there is evidence to link schizophrenia zzso and bipolar disorder zzso to genetic and environmental factors, specific individual or groups of zzso zzso of the disease have been elusive to the research zzso An understanding of the molecular aberrations that cause these mental illnesses requires comprehensive approaches that examine both genetic and zzso zzso Because of the overwhelming evidence for the role of environmental factors in the disease zzso our initial approach involved deciphering how zzso changes resulting from promoter DNA zzso affect gene expression in zzso and zzso Apparently, the central zzso but zzso zzso modification to DNA is derived from zzso of the zzso zzso that is potentially zzso and can affect gene expression and downstream zzso Environmental factors can influence DNA zzso patterns and hence alter gene zzso Such changes can be especially problematic in individuals with genetic zzso to specific zzso Recent reports from our laboratory provided compelling evidence that both zzso and zzso zzso changes of the regulatory regions play critical roles in defining the altered functionality of genes in major psychiatric disorders such as zzso and zzso In this chapter, we outline the technical details of the methods that could help to expand this line of research to assist with compiling the differential zzso zzso zzso that are responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso and other mental zzso We use the genes of the extended zzso zzso system such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso and related genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso to illustrate the associations between differential promoter DNA zzso and disease zzso It is our hope that comprehensive analyses of the zzso system as the zzso could provide the impetus and molecular basis to uncover early markers for diagnosis, help in the understanding of differences in disease severity in individuals with similar or identical genetic makeup, and assist with the identification of novel targets for therapeutic zzso
