zzso protein 4 zzso is zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso expression level was closely related to insulin resistance and type II diabetes zzso However, the exact mechanisms are zzso To clarify the zzso zzso zzso particles were packaged to zzso zzso zzso Then zzso zzso were activated by insulin or induced model of insulin zzso zzso interference efficiency and the gene expression of each treatment groups in zzso pathways were examined by zzso and Western zzso The result shows that zzso zzso and protein expressions were suppressed more than zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no matter under insulin stimulation or insulin resistance, zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with the zzso The protein zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso meanwhile enhanced the zzso zzso zzso total protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the insulin sensitivity through zzso zzso pathways related zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso This research will provide a new idea to treat insulin resistance related zzso
