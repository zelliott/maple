A number of hormones and growth factors stimulate target cells through receptors which are coupled to second zzso zzso The second zzso zzso for example, mediates a wide variety of cellular responses to hormonal signals, including changes in zzso zzso cellular proliferation and cellular zzso In zzso cells, all of these biological responses are triggered by the zzso of the zzso protein zzso A, a zzso consisting of paired zzso and regulatory zzso Upon hormonal zzso zzso binds tightly to the regulatory zzso thereby liberating zzso zzso and promoting the zzso of cellular zzso In the liver, zzso functions as a zzso state zzso zzso hormonal cues from the zzso and adrenal zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso production, in part, by regulating zzso of the gene for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso Following hormonal zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso within zzso zzso This induction appears to be independent of new protein zzso
