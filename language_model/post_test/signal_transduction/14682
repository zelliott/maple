There is a strong indication that zzso zzso in zzso are protected against zzso The late terminal differentiation program in zzso zzso is zzso 

Previously, minimal zzso has been demonstrated in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso B zzso and the zzso activated protein zzso zzso signaling zzso pathways have been reported to protect zzso cells against zzso Both pathways have also been proven to regulate late terminal differentiation of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be associated with terminal zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether in human zzso zzso protection against programmed cell death by means of zzso survival signaling is present and associated with zzso zzso and terminal zzso 

Fifteen human zzso and zzso zzso skin samples were zzso stained for zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Positive cells were counted by zzso digital image zzso 

zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were significantly increased when compared with zzso skin zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased zzso The positive correlation was confirmed between both zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
