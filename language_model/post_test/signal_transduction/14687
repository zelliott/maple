In a previous study, our laboratory reported that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso type 5 zzso reversed a learning impairment in rats induced by systemic zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To limit the peripheral effects of zzso and further zzso the site of action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was infused zzso into the lateral cerebral zzso 30 zzso prior to maze zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso 15 zzso before zzso Drug injections occurred 24 h after zzso rats to avoid foot shock on a one-way active avoidance straight zzso Following drug treatment, the rats received 15 training trials on a zzso zzso task that requires learning a complex sequence of turns to avoid mild foot zzso This complex maze paradigm is sensitive to aging and blockade of zzso zzso and zzso oxide signaling zzso zzso measures of performance included zzso from the correct zzso zzso zzso from start to goal zzso shock frequency and shock zzso zzso analysis revealed that central infusion of zzso impaired maze performance and that zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may serve as a cognitive zzso by modulating central zzso zzso signal zzso following zzso zzso zzso This zzso has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and may be a useful target for pharmacological intervention of neurodegenerative zzso
