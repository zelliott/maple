Plants have developed flexible mechanisms to respond appropriately to environmental zzso These stimuli are zzso by largely unknown zzso pathways that are likely to be modulated by zzso zzso signals to produce an integrated response that zzso regulates gene zzso Light is a critical environmental signal that controls many aspects of plant development via a series of zzso that are able to respond to different light zzso Light is also the principal energy source for zzso The zzso products are carbohydrates which are zzso in the form of zzso from the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso the control of zzso genes must integrate zzso zzso with signals derived from the zzso from the zzso apparatus and from zzso such as zzso
