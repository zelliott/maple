zzso a member of the zzso family, plays an essential role in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Upon zzso zzso is rapidly and zzso zzso While the zzso mechanism of zzso in these signaling pathways is well zzso how its activity is terminated still remains zzso To identify the zzso involved in zzso regulation, we performed tandem affinity zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso an zzso family zzso was identified as a previously unknown component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the prolonged zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso in the zzso signaling zzso
