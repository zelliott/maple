zzso zzso pumps mediate resistance to antibiotics and other toxic zzso We studied the role of zzso the main zzso pump in zzso coli, in regulating gene zzso 

zzso zzso an zzso fusion and reverse zzso quantitative zzso experiments were used to study the role of zzso and metabolism in regulating gene expression of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso gene increased the expression of the zzso zzso A similar induction of zzso was found when zzso or zzso was deleted, and when the pump function was inhibited using zzso The induction of zzso in the zzso strain was totally zzso or zzso or partially zzso or zzso prevented when the genes for these zzso regulators were also zzso The expression of zzso and zzso but not of zzso was increased in the zzso strain, which also showed altered expression of many other genes related to different cellular zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso of the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso 

These results together suggest a model in which the zzso pump zzso cellular zzso that are toxic and/or have a zzso zzso If the pump is zzso or zzso these zzso would zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso ultimately triggering the zzso of zzso expression to restore zzso
