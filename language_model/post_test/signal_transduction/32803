zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso that has two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso of zzso interact with the zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso cells, and this association results in a potent stimulation of the zzso activity of zzso Both zzso and zzso are highly expressed in the zzso brain, and they may play important roles in the regulation of synaptic zzso In this study, we found that nerve growth factor zzso treatment of zzso cells leads to the zzso zzso of zzso and a subsequent complex formation between zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso also induced the zzso zzso of zzso and the association with zzso in primary cultured rat zzso Our results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is a novel signal zzso mechanism of zzso that acts in response to zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso
