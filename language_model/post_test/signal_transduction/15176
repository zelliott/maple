The zzso zzso consists of highly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso These contain multiple types of zzso cells, including the zzso zzso The major task of the fully differentiated zzso is the tight regulation of blood zzso levels by zzso insulin into the blood zzso This requires molecular features to measure zzso and produce, process, and release insulin by zzso Now multiple interactions with zzso and zzso zzso cells as well as with other zzso have been shown to affect the developing as well as the mature zzso zzso failure of any of these interactions can inhibit zzso differentiation and zzso Here we review recent reports on zzso zzso interactions as well as signals derived from zzso zzso that affect the pancreatic zzso
