zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso complex that converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso activity has been demonstrated in breast tissue in zzso and expression of zzso is highest in or near breast tumor zzso Thus, local regulation of zzso by both zzso factors as well as zzso medicinal agents will influence the levels of zzso available for breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso increases zzso zzso levels and stimulates zzso zzso and our recent studies have shown a strong linear association between zzso expression and the sum of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in breast cancer zzso zzso of the signaling pathways that regulate the expression and zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso breast cells will aid in understanding the zzso of these two zzso systems and potentially identify novel targets for zzso The effects of zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso were studied in primary cultures of normal human zzso zzso cells and in cell cultures of normal immortalized human breast zzso cells zzso zzso human breast cancer cells zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were not altered by the various treatments in the cell systems zzso In breast zzso cells, zzso and zzso did not alter zzso levels at zzso while zzso induced zzso levels by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells significantly increased zzso activity while zzso did zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso and zzso significantly increased activity in zzso cells, while only a modest increase with zzso was zzso zzso normal zzso zzso cells exhibited high zzso levels of zzso but low to zzso levels of zzso A dramatic induction of zzso was observed in the zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in normal zzso zzso cells was significantly increased by zzso zzso and zzso after zzso of zzso In zzso the results of this investigation on the effects of several zzso and/or zzso signaling pathways in the regulation of expression of zzso zzso and zzso in breast cells has identified more complex zzso Overall, elevated levels of these factors in the breast cancer tissue zzso can result in increased zzso activity (and subsequent increased zzso zzso via zzso mechanisms in breast zzso cells and via zzso mechanisms in breast zzso zzso Furthermore, increased zzso of zzso such as zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in zzso and zzso cell compartments will result in both zzso and zzso actions to increase zzso expression in the zzso
