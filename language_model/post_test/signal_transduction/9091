The integrity and function of many zzso zzso depend on cellular barriers that are mainly formed by zzso protein complexes of the plasma zzso These zzso zzso tight junctions zzso exhibit the most zzso zzso in the lateral zzso they regulate the zzso of the zzso space between opposing zzso and zzso zzso This Forum reviews the currently available data on the influence of zzso stress and the effects of zzso mechanisms on zzso proteins and on tissue barrier functions inseparably linked to these zzso The contributions are focused on the most important zzso and zzso zzso proteins and on tissue barriers characterized by zzso involvement of the zzso and zzso at the molecular and functional levels induced by zzso signaling are also zzso This Forum demonstrates that cell barriers are highly sensitive to zzso stress but also respond to zzso zzso However, our knowledge of the molecular basis of the specific mechanisms responsible for functional disturbances remains limited and needs further zzso
