Our results presented here suggest that cortical zzso zzso via two zzso zzso pathways when challenged with zzso zzso zzso Although these two pathways can be attributed to the loss of zzso integrity, the triggers for these pathways are likely due to two separate subsequent events (the release of zzso c and the emergence of zzso zzso transition zzso Despite some reports suggesting that the release of zzso c is a consequence of zzso the results of our time course experiments suggest zzso In fact, we observed that the release of zzso c occurred much earlier than zzso zzso the former is unlikely to be a consequence of the zzso In addition, we observed that the presence of an zzso inhibitor did not zzso the zzso of zzso and that zzso cell death did not exhibit nuclear zzso and DNA zzso Taken together, these results suggest that there are two routes by which cortical zzso zzso during zzso injury or in neurodegenerative zzso
