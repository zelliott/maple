zzso of proteins is a zzso zzso which decides on the cellular fate of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to proteins is carried out by the sequential action of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso functions as Really zzso New Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso but its zzso zzso are not yet zzso zzso was reported to interact with zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and the two tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso was shown to inhibit nuclear zzso B zzso zzso However, recent results suggested a role for zzso in biological processes other than zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation and induced a block in the zzso phase of the cell cycle without affecting zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso development as zzso affecting the zzso zzso of zzso are maternal zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice die in zzso because of zzso regulation of cell proliferation and zzso These findings underline the tight link between zzso and cell zzso In this review, we zzso the data on zzso and put them into a larger perspective regarding the role of zzso in the control of tissue zzso
