The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso infection membrane protein 1 zzso mimics a zzso active tumor necrosis factor zzso family zzso in its ability to recruit zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso death domain protein zzso in a zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso engages signaling zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso and these activities may explain many of its zzso effects on cell zzso growth, and zzso In this study we demonstrate the ability of the zzso domain of zzso to signal on the zzso axis in a cell zzso dependent manner that critically involves zzso and zzso Thus, expression of this zzso domain in zzso zzso cells promotes significant zzso zzso which is blocked by zzso zzso but not zzso However, zzso is absent in many established zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso zzso biopsy zzso In these cells, zzso zzso by the zzso domain of zzso depends on the zzso of zzso zzso The critical role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso signaling is particular to the zzso domain of zzso since a zzso region in the zzso tail of zzso or the zzso domain of zzso signal on the zzso axis independently of zzso zzso These data further dissect the signaling components used by zzso and identify a novel role for zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso
