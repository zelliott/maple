Mouse embryonic stem zzso cells can be maintained in zzso state in the presence of a zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso Many investigators found that zzso zzso is important for the maintenance of zzso by zzso However, the downstream pathways of zzso zzso are still zzso To look for zzso target zzso we performed zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso Through further confirmation, we finally selected 8 genes whose expressions were significantly dependent upon the presence of zzso Among them, zzso was zzso after zzso withdrawal, and it was selected for further zzso Its expression started to decrease 1 day after the removal of zzso and disappeared on day zzso It was also shown that zzso could bind to the promoter region of zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso might be a critical signaling zzso underlying the maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso
