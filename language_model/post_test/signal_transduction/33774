zzso inflammation is a prominent feature associated with the severity of zzso injury and progressive kidney zzso We zzso an animal model of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to assess patterns of zzso and inflammation during the evolution of zzso damage and to relate them to the development of zzso 

Male zzso rats receiving zzso daily AA or vehicle were sacrificed between Days 1 and zzso zzso zzso cells were characterized by zzso The kidney zzso T zzso were zzso by flow zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of active transforming growth zzso zzso were zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso 2/3 protein was used to examine the zzso zzso zzso 

In AA rats, zzso and T zzso predominantly infiltrated areas of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and/or zzso by zzso cells reflected zzso proliferation and their zzso zzso The zzso of zzso T zzso was zzso by severe signs of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and of active zzso significantly increased at Days 10 and zzso An early and persistent nuclear zzso of zzso zzso 2/3 protein was detected in zzso and zzso zzso 

An early and massive zzso inflammation characterized by activated zzso and zzso zzso T zzso is demonstrated for the first time during the progression of experimental zzso The involvement in an zzso zzso onset of active zzso is highly suggested, at least via the zzso 2/3 zzso zzso zzso
