zzso function as zzso zzso and mediate trafficking of a variety of zzso zzso including zzso receptors zzso In the case of zzso zzso carry out these tasks while simultaneously zzso upstream zzso signaling and promoting alternate downstream signaling zzso The mechanisms by which zzso interact with a continuously expanding ensemble of protein partners and perform their multiple functions including trafficking and signaling are currently being zzso zzso changes at the level of protein zzso as well as zzso modifications of zzso probably form the basis for their dynamic interactions during zzso trafficking and zzso It is becoming increasingly evident that zzso originally discovered as zzso zzso zzso indeed have much broader and more versatile roles in maintaining cellular zzso In this review paper, we assess the traditional and novel functions of zzso and discuss the molecular attributes that might facilitate multiple interactions in regulating cell signaling and zzso zzso
