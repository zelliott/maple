zzso precursor cells have the potential to differentiate into several cell types, including zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling shifts zzso cell fate toward zzso at the expense of zzso however, molecular mechanisms by which zzso signaling alters zzso cell fate have not been fully zzso Our prior work indicates that zzso precursors express zzso and zzso zzso factors at zzso levels and that zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells suppresses expression of zzso protein alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and increases expression of zzso zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that transient zzso of zzso signaling rapidly suppresses zzso and zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso partially zzso zzso zzso and decreases zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso suggesting that suppression of zzso and zzso is required for zzso to alter cell zzso Furthermore, knocking down expression of zzso zzso or both greatly reduces zzso potential and causes spontaneous zzso in zzso cells and mouse embryonic zzso suggesting that zzso signaling alters the fate of zzso precursor cells primarily by suppressing zzso and zzso
