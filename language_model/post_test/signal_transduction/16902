The comprehensive mapping of gene promoters and enhancers has significantly improved our understanding of how the zzso regulatory zzso is zzso An important challenge is to zzso how these regulatory elements contribute to gene expression by identifying their zzso zzso Here, we present the generation of a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso frame clone library and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso to enable large-scale zzso interaction detection with mouse regulatory zzso Once specific interactions are identified, we then use a zzso method to validate and precisely map them within the respective DNA zzso Using zzso regulatory elements as well as orphan zzso we show that this zzso pipeline characterizes known and zzso many novel zzso zzso In addition, we provide evidence that several of these novel interactions are relevant in zzso and aid in zzso the regulatory architecture of zzso
