zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso and zzso in the thick ascending loop of zzso To gain novel insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the pathological mechanisms underlying a human disease associated with zzso dysfunction zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we generated a mouse model of zzso zzso Similar to patients, zzso mice displayed zzso and zzso zzso to zzso patients, zzso was absent in our model, indicating the existence of zzso pathways in zzso handling in this zzso In line with the zzso loss of zzso zzso mechanisms like zzso hormone and zzso were significantly zzso Also, gene expression profiling revealed zzso zzso of several zzso and zzso transport systems including zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression was also seen for the transcripts of two putative zzso transport zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, urinary pH was significantly lower when compared with zzso zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that loss of zzso activity leads to specific zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso mice represent a useful model to further zzso pathways involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
