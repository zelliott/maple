To compare zzso of G proteins by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso binding in the presence of excess zzso was zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma S binding consisted of a single class of zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced a zzso site zzso higher in affinity than the zzso zzso The zzso amplification factor zzso of activated G protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher for zzso zzso receptors than for zzso delta zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in an zzso loss of zzso zzso gamma S binding within 1 zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma S binding by zzso after 16 zzso with no effect after 1 zzso Loss of zzso response was due to a decrease in the zzso of activated G proteins with no change in the zzso These results provide a quantitative description of G protein zzso occurring on acute and chronic exposure to zzso zzso
