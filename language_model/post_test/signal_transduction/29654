The survival of mature resting B cells in the periphery depends on signaling from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso of both receptors promotes zzso B activity, which contributes to zzso survival through different zzso zzso signaling leads to zzso of the inhibitor of zzso B zzso zzso complex via zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso engagement promotes processing of zzso B2 protein zzso which is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso are potentially common to both zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso survival signaling are mutually zzso In addition, we propose that zzso signaling enhances the expression of survival genes through direct zzso modifications in zzso B target gene zzso
