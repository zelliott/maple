zzso programmed cell death zzso is a zzso zzso regulating the balance between zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, its role in zzso has not yet been zzso The hypothesis that zzso signaling actively promotes retinal zzso cell zzso death within the developing mouse zzso was zzso 

zzso retinal cell types expressing zzso were identified by zzso zzso of vertical zzso zzso zzso expression was localized by zzso and zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso involvement in zzso zzso survival was assessed in zzso using retinal zzso and in zzso using zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso gene expression was detected by zzso 

zzso is expressed in most adult zzso and zzso dynamic zzso during the early zzso window of retinal cell maturation and zzso programmed cell death zzso In zzso blockade of zzso signaling during this time selectively increases the survival of zzso Furthermore, zzso mice show a selective increase in zzso number in the zzso zzso at the peak of zzso zzso zzso Lastly, gene expression of the immune zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso was found throughout zzso zzso zzso 

These findings collectively support a novel role for a zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso
