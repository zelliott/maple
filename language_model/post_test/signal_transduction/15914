Until recently, most studies on the role of hormones in zzso interactions focused on salicylic acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso It is now clear that zzso zzso of signaling via other hormones contributes to zzso A picture is emerging of complex zzso and induced hormonal changes that zzso disease and resistance, with outcomes dependent on pathogen lifestyles and the genetic constitution of the zzso Recent progress has revealed intriguing similarities between hormone signaling mechanisms, with gene induction responses often achieved by zzso Here, we report on recent advances, updating current knowledge on classical defense hormones zzso zzso and zzso and the roles of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in molding zzso zzso We highlight an emerging theme that positive and negative regulators of these disparate hormone signaling pathways are crucial regulatory targets of hormonal zzso in disease and zzso
