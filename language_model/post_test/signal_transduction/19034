zzso zzso the third most frequent cause of bacterial zzso appears to be equipped with diverse zzso proteins showing zzso similarity to the zzso family of zzso zzso Among the putative zzso zzso surface zzso the previously characterized zzso zzso which shows specific binding to collagen and zzso was zzso in surface protein preparations only after growth at 46 degrees C, mirroring the finding that adherence was observed in 46 degrees C, but not 37 degrees C, grown zzso zzso zzso To zzso the influence of different growth and host parameters on ace zzso we investigated ace expression using zzso zzso zzso grown in routine laboratory media zzso heart zzso and found that ace zzso levels were low in all growth zzso However, quantitative reverse zzso showed zzso ace zzso amounts in cells grown in the presence of collagen type IV compared to the zzso Similarly, a marked increase was observed when cells were either grown in the presence of collagen type I or serum but not in the presence of zzso or bovine serum zzso The production of Ace after growth in the presence of collagen type IV was demonstrated by zzso zzso mirroring the increased ace zzso zzso Furthermore, increased Ace expression correlated with increased collagen and zzso zzso zzso Ace expression was also seen in three of three other zzso zzso strains of diverse origins tested, and thus it appears to be a common zzso The observation of host zzso zzso adherence of zzso zzso may have important implications on our understanding of this opportunistic zzso
