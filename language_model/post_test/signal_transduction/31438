Final motor zzso in sympathetic and zzso zzso receive synaptic zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses have shown that the spatial distribution of these zzso is mostly sparse and zzso Typically, only about zzso of the zzso surface is covered with zzso with the rest of the zzso surface being closely enclosed by zzso cell zzso The number of synaptic zzso is correlated with the zzso complexity of the target zzso and the total number of synaptic contacts is related to the surface area of the zzso zzso Overall, most zzso receive fewer than 150 synaptic zzso with individual zzso zzso providing between 10 and 50 synaptic zzso This variation is probably one zzso of synaptic strength in zzso zzso Many zzso in zzso sympathetic zzso receive additional zzso synaptic zzso from zzso zzso located in the enteric zzso The zzso support these additional zzso via larger zzso zzso together with a higher overall synaptic zzso There is considerable zzso zzso in zzso zzso Some zzso apparently lack most of the proteins normally required for fast zzso release and probably do not take part in conventional zzso zzso Furthermore, most zzso zzso in the zzso zzso do not form direct synaptic contacts with any zzso Nevertheless, these zzso may well contribute to slow transmission processes that need not require conventional synaptic zzso
