We sought to explore whether inherited differences in zzso sensitivity zzso by variation in the length of a zzso repeat in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso gene could be correlated with differing manifestations of zzso zzso in men with zzso In a sample of 15 men with zzso zzso zzso repeat length was zzso correlated with levels of zzso against zzso nuclear zzso and with the number of diagnostic criteria for zzso zzso zzso were used to assess levels of 86 different zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of these zzso zzso zzso were more frequently observed in male lupus patients with longer zzso zzso repeat length zzso while zzso zzso were more prevalent in subjects with shorter zzso repeat length zzso These data support a potential role for zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso class switching zzso with zzso impact on the zzso zzso in men with zzso
