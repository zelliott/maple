zzso tract zzso zzso is a lethal zzso This zzso is essentially attributed to both slow zzso occurring under complex pathological circumstances and to the zzso growth of zzso zzso the surrounding structures by varying zzso The disease is therefore usually detected at an advanced stage with a high frequency of distant organ zzso To date, conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been notably ineffective against zzso For an improved treatment outcome of zzso and prolonged survival, there is now a real and urgent need to focus on developing novel and potent therapeutic strategies aimed at exploiting select molecular targets associated with tumor zzso invasion, and/or zzso that would impact in a significant way on clinical zzso The outcomes of recent studies, by the analysis of zzso cells, zzso animal models, and clinical specimens of zzso patients, have revealed, in detail, the molecular mechanism of zzso and tumor progression of zzso and these studies have exploited select molecular targets that could significantly impact the clinical zzso In the near future, the development of new molecular targeting drugs with potent efficacy against zzso and the performance of zzso clinical trials of these drugs are urgent and essential for the treatment of patients with zzso
