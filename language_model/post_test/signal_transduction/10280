The usual paradigm for developing zzso zzso in zzso is to use a zzso zzso inhibitor with acceptable zzso properties for key target validation zzso This approach requires substantial medicinal chemistry and can be zzso by drug toxicity and zzso activities of the test zzso As a better alternative, we have developed zzso zzso zzso zzso models to examine the in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso Our results show that tumor zzso resulting from zzso suppression is zzso zzso and tightly regulated in these zzso Analysis of zzso tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for zzso to be increased tumor cell proliferation and zzso In a zzso melanoma model, conditional zzso suppression slowed systemic tumor growth as determined by in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso signaling is strongly associated with in zzso zzso confirming zzso as an important target for zzso and zzso zzso zzso
