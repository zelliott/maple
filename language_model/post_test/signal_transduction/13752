The zzso zone zzso is the principal zzso niche present in the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso generated in the zzso migrate along the zzso migratory stream to reach the zzso zzso Brain injuries stimulate zzso zzso and direct migration of new zzso to the sites of zzso To date, cortical zzso adult zzso zzso in mice remains ambiguous and migration of neural zzso to the site of injury has not been studied in zzso Here we report that aspiration zzso in the motor zzso zzso a zzso but significant increase in the proliferation as well as zzso in the zzso New neural zzso migrate zzso to the injured area with the assistance of blood vessels and zzso zzso The zzso origin of these zzso was further confirmed using zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso migration is regulated by zzso signaling zzso Finally, upon reaching the zzso area, these zzso differentiate mainly into zzso cells and, to a lesser extent, mature zzso These data provide a detailed account of the changes occurring in the zzso and the zzso following zzso and indicate the potential of the zzso neural zzso in cortical zzso
