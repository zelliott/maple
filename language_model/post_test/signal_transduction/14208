zzso promotes the proliferation of cardiac zzso zzso and collagen synthesis in zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of zzso on proliferation and collagen synthesis of zzso is not completely zzso 

The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the zzso proteins has a functional role in high zzso proliferation of zzso and collagen synthesis in zzso and whether the zzso signaling zzso and zzso signaling zzso have zzso effects on high zzso cardiac zzso proliferation and collagen zzso 

zzso zzso were cultured in zzso modified zzso zzso supplemented with zzso or 25 zzso zzso in the presence of absence of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso were measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the production of Type I and III collagen was evaluated using real-time quantitative zzso and zzso and the zzso expression of zzso and zzso were analyzed by Western zzso 

High zzso treatment promoted the proliferation of cardiac zzso and collagen types I and III zzso High zzso treatment induced zzso and zzso zzso in cardiac zzso the mode and level of zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso and zzso could both inhibited high zzso zzso proliferation of cardiac zzso and collagen types I and III synthesis with different zzso Combination of zzso and zzso or combination of zzso and zzso both exhibited stronger inhibitions on proliferation of cardiac zzso and collagen types I zzso but the effects and functional modes are zzso 

Both zzso and zzso mediate the proliferation of cardiac zzso and collagen synthesis induced by high zzso zzso and zzso both have zzso effects with zzso on regulating proliferation of cardiac zzso and collagen types I zzso
