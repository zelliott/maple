zzso zzso have been known for decades to enhance zzso immune responses in an zzso zzso This enhancement has been thought to be dependent on complement zzso by zzso zzso however, recent genetic studies render this mechanism zzso Here, we describe a likely alternative zzso mice lacking the recently identified zzso zzso for zzso zzso on B cells produced significantly less zzso to protein zzso during both primary and memory zzso This immune zzso was accompanied by impaired zzso center formation and decreased plasma and memory zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso survival but specifically enhanced the survival and proliferation induced by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice produced far more zzso than control mice as they aged, suggesting that zzso is also required for maintaining tolerance to zzso Our results thus define a unique zzso zzso by the zzso for regulating immunity and tolerance and suggest that zzso zzso promote zzso immune responses to foreign zzso yet suppress zzso production through at least two zzso complement zzso and zzso
