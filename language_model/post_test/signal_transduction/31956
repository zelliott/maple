The zzso Complex 1 zzso zzso regulates cell growth in response to numerous cues, including zzso zzso which promote zzso zzso to the zzso surface, its site of zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex that zzso the zzso to the zzso and the zzso form a signaling system that is necessary for zzso acid sensing by zzso zzso acids stimulate the binding of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso but the factors that regulate zzso zzso loading are zzso Here, we identify zzso and zzso as two additional zzso components that are required for zzso zzso by zzso zzso The expanded zzso has zzso exchange activity toward zzso and zzso and interacts with the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, we provide zzso insight into how zzso senses zzso acids by identifying zzso as a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso for the zzso zzso
