It has been shown that the expression of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso cells as well as in the zzso of patients affected by both solid tumors and zzso zzso We now report that zzso of zzso mice contain higher levels of zzso with respect to zzso mice and that zzso cells, in which zzso was knocked down by zzso release increased levels of zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso small zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated both spontaneous and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein release in zzso cell zzso zzso promoter functional zzso and zzso zzso experiments revealed zzso effects of zzso on the zzso zzso DNA binding activity to the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that, besides its well-documented functions within the zzso cancer cells, the ability of zzso to zzso zzso production by zzso cells may be an additional important mechanism zzso it exerts zzso tumor suppression zzso
