zzso reportedly functions as an amplifier of the zzso zzso signal using a zzso zzso However, the amplification mechanisms in human mast cells zzso are poorly zzso We previously reported the zzso of zzso of zzso in giant zzso from zzso zzso patients, compared with that in zzso from zzso conjunctivitis zzso zzso of the molecular mechanisms of the amplification induced by zzso should provide new targets for novel therapeutic zzso The aim is to understand in greater details the function of zzso in human zzso zzso expression and zzso 

zzso and Lyn expression was reduced using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Lyn and zzso in cultured zzso was examined by zzso microscopic zzso zzso were measured by zzso 

The diminution of zzso significantly zzso cell surface zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was not only due to the decrease in zzso zzso The diminution of zzso inhibited the zzso of Lyn within the cell membrane following zzso zzso The diminution of Lyn in zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso for zzso delivery disturbed the interaction between Lyn and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso release from zzso in zzso and from giant zzso specimens ex zzso 

The interaction between Lyn and zzso is indispensable for zzso human zzso zzso and specific zzso of the interaction may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human allergic zzso
