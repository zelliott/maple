zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso are both involved in the control of feeding behavior, but little is known about the interaction between these two signaling zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso zzso significant zzso of zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso free zzso involving zzso calcium zzso zzso results revealed that zzso increased the zzso calcium current via the zzso zzso zzso zzso C signaling zzso in ARC zzso that produce zzso Y, an important downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso calcium channel inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We found that zzso of zzso by either compound C zzso or the zzso zzso prevented the zzso effect of zzso This action can be zzso by zzso the blocker of the zzso calcium zzso Our results indicated that zzso activates zzso zzso signaling through a zzso mechanism involving the zzso zzso calcium channel, which may serve as a potential target for regulating feeding zzso
