zzso retrograde transport of zzso zzso and their receptors has been hypothesized to contribute directly to retinal zzso cell zzso loss in zzso However, strategies of supplementing zzso and zzso receptors have failed to avert ultimate zzso death in experimental zzso This study examines the response of major components of the zzso system and their interacting proteins in a rat glaucoma zzso zzso chronic zzso pressure zzso zzso was produced by zzso vein injection of zzso saline (N zzso zzso zzso were collected and grouped by extent of zzso nerve zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso western zzso analysis and zzso were used to determine zzso and protein levels and protein zzso Out of three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso only zzso was significantly zzso at the message level to 35 zzso zzso of fellow values with the zzso nerve zzso With zzso zzso no significant zzso were found in retinal zzso levels for zzso zzso zzso or zzso The abundance of mature retinal zzso protein was not significantly affected by elevated zzso while zzso protein decreased zzso with increasing injury grade zzso zzso zzso In zzso with the zzso nerve injury, zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels significantly declined to 67 zzso zzso and 44 zzso zzso of fellow values, zzso However, the levels of zzso protein and its zzso form were zzso zzso level for zzso was zzso zzso up to 219 zzso zzso with increasing injury zzso zzso zzso but no zzso was detected at protein zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in zzso with the greatest nerve zzso A positive correlation was found between injury extent and message levels for zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeling of activated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso levels demonstrated a positive linear correlation to the extent of injury zzso zzso zzso resulting in a nearly zzso increase zzso zzso zzso in eyes with the greatest nerve zzso Among downstream zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 157 zzso zzso of fellow values in zzso with the zzso nerve injury zzso zzso zzso A slight positive correlation was found between zzso message levels and injury extent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the most severely injured zzso were significantly reduced to 83 zzso zzso by elevated zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso zzso or zzso appeared zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso or zzso This study demonstrates that elevated zzso exposure does not result in a dramatic decrease in retinal levels of either zzso or its zzso zzso It shows that the responses of zzso pathways to elevated zzso are complex, particularly with regard to the role of zzso and zzso A better understanding of the roles of these proteins in zzso injury is likely to suggest informed strategies for zzso in zzso
