zzso zzso zzso tomato strain zzso is a pathogen of tomato and zzso The zzso type III zzso system zzso which zzso bacterial zzso proteins zzso called zzso or zzso zzso into plant cells, is required for zzso In addition to being regulated by the zzso alternative zzso factor, most zzso or hop genes zzso proteins with N zzso that have several characteristic features, including zzso a high percentage of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso or Pro at the third or fourth position, and zzso a lack of zzso charged zzso acids within the first 12 zzso Here, the well-studied zzso zzso was used to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter system for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso into plant zzso This system includes a cloned zzso zzso zzso gene cluster and the model plant zzso zzso zzso of truncated zzso proteins fused to zzso revealed that the zzso 16 zzso acids and/or zzso of zzso are sufficient to direct weak zzso into plant cells and that longer zzso fragments direct progressively stronger zzso zzso tested because it is poorly zzso in cultures by the zzso zzso zzso system, was zzso into plant cells as effectively as zzso The zzso of several zzso candidate zzso proteins was also examined by using zzso as a reporter, which led to identification of three new intact zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso as well as two truncated zzso proteins zzso by the naturally disrupted genes zzso and zzso We also confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso into plant zzso These results increased the number of zzso zzso proteins in zzso to zzso Although most of the newly identified zzso proteins possess N zzso that have the same features as the N zzso of previously described zzso zzso zzso has none of these zzso Our results indicate that zzso should be a useful reporter for exploring multiple aspects of the zzso system in zzso zzso
