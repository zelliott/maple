The zzso for human zzso zzso factor zzso is composed of two zzso alpha and zzso which are both required for zzso binding of the zzso To examine the transforming potential of zzso we have zzso zzso zzso the zzso alpha and beta zzso into zzso zzso cells, which normally do not express zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso into these cells resulted in focal zzso which was dependent on the presence of human zzso zzso factor zzso in the culture zzso No transformation was observed when zzso was replaced with other growth factors such as human zzso growth factor or human zzso 3 or when cells were zzso with the alpha or beta zzso zzso Individual conditional zzso isolated after zzso expressed functional zzso were susceptible to transformation by zzso levels of the zzso and were capable of zzso growth in soft zzso in the presence but not in the absence of zzso zzso analysis showed that treatment of these cells with zzso caused a rapid zzso of the beta zzso and other cellular proteins on zzso zzso zzso some of the events that take place during zzso signaling in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of the alpha and beta zzso of zzso in established zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso a functional zzso which is capable of causing zzso zzso The zzso potential of zzso lends support to the hypothesis that its zzso or abnormal expression may play a role in zzso
