The zzso zzso acid zzso treats and prevents the animal model of multiple sclerosis zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso In an effort to understand the therapeutic potential of LA in zzso we sought to define the cellular mechanisms that mediate the effects of LA on human natural killer zzso cells, which are important in innate immunity as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and tumor zzso We discovered that LA stimulates zzso production in zzso cells in a zzso zzso Studies using pharmacological zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that LA stimulates zzso production via zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso In addition, LA suppressed zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These novel findings suggest that LA may inhibit zzso cell function via the zzso signaling zzso
