The zzso exists within the zzso zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso These zzso cells metabolize the majority of the zzso within the zzso zzso complex and provide energy zzso and zzso such as zzso to the zzso The insulin zzso is present in zzso cells and zzso however, it is unknown whether zzso zzso zzso occurs in either cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be unique to zzso skeletal and cardiac muscle, and the zzso Here, we show for the first time that many of the components required for insulin signaling are present in both zzso cells and zzso We performed a set of experiments on mouse zzso cells and zzso and human zzso cells using the zzso zzso analog zzso to measure zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso occurs in both compact and expanded zzso cells of mice, as well as in human zzso zzso zzso however, do not display zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso through zzso zzso signaling as shown by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso To test the effect of systemic in zzso insulin resistance on insulin sensitivity in the zzso cell, zzso cells from high zzso zzso mice and women with zzso zzso syndrome were zzso Both sets of cells displayed blunted zzso zzso zzso Our studies identify another tissue that, through a classical zzso pathway, demonstrates zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these findings suggest insulin resistance occurs in these cells under conditions of systemic insulin zzso
