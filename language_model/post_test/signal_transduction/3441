zzso one of the main peptides in zzso zzso zzso system zzso has been suggested to mediate liver zzso and portal zzso zzso an zzso zzso has beneficial effect on zzso circulation in clinical zzso However, the mechanisms remain zzso The present study aimed to investigate the role of zzso on liver zzso and portal zzso 

Liver zzso was induced by zzso duct zzso zzso zzso was administered orally (20 zzso after zzso duct zzso was zzso Liver zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the measurement of zzso and type I collagen zzso The zzso of zzso was determined by analysis of alpha smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions and protein zzso were determined by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso levels by quantitative real time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso pressure and zzso resistance were examined in zzso 

Treatment with zzso significantly lowered portal zzso This was associated with zzso of liver fibrosis, zzso resistance and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso rat liver, zzso suppressed zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso significantly decreased zzso activity without affecting expression of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso markedly increased the levels of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and the activity of NO zzso zzso G zzso in the zzso 

zzso lowers portal hypertension by improvement of liver zzso and zzso of zzso zzso via zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso Thus, early zzso therapy might be the optional therapy in zzso and portal zzso
