zzso beta peptides zzso form zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is generally believed to be a key zzso event in several brain zzso Here we show that small amounts of zzso peptides activate zzso by promoting zzso cell proliferation and migration as well as zzso zzso zzso peptides functionally zzso with zzso growth factor zzso to promote zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Thus, zzso peptides at zzso zzso prime zzso effects on the zzso enhancing survival and sustaining zzso The zzso promoted by zzso peptides via zzso might have implications for understanding the initial stages of Alzheimer's disease and for the design of therapies targeting beta zzso
