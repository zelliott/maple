It is well documented that zzso zzso zzso clinical symptoms similar to those of idiopathic Parkinson's zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso is suggested, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso mediator, such as zzso oxide zzso remains poorly zzso zzso in this study, we investigated the mechanism of zzso on induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso regulated the zzso expression at the zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed that zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso were zzso Both protein and zzso levels of zzso expression were zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso but not by zzso (20 zzso a zzso specific zzso These data lead to the conclusion that zzso regulates the zzso expression at the zzso level in zzso zzso cells and the increased zzso protein expression is zzso via both zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso but not via zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso protein level was also found in zzso zzso zzso zzso
