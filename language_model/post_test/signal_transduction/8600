zzso the zzso zzso family of zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso has been shown to promote zzso invasion and zzso In the present study zzso zzso another member of the zzso family, was investigated for its role in regulating invasion, migration and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, like extra zzso zzso zzso express zzso transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso led to an increase in invasion across zzso zzso zzso without an increase in zzso There was a zzso increase in zzso of zzso under the influence of zzso with maximum zzso zzso by zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso for zzso led to an increase in expression of zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the nuclear fraction showed an increased zzso of zzso following zzso treatment while zzso was zzso zzso the expression of zzso by zzso caused a zzso reduction in invasion compared to control cells, however this was not zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso led to a significant increase in invasion compared to zzso cells without zzso but this was not significant compared to zzso control zzso zzso the expression of zzso but not of zzso zzso the increase in zzso of zzso cells following zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso of zzso appears to be critical for the zzso increase in zzso of zzso zzso
