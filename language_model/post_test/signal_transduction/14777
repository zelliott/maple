G zzso receptors zzso belonging to class A contain several highly zzso zzso zzso acids in their zzso zzso zzso of zzso studies of these highly zzso zzso suggest a common mechanism for zzso zzso in an inactive zzso and for their subsequent zzso upon zzso zzso Recently, a second set of sites in the zzso zzso has been identified in which zzso acids with small side zzso such as zzso Ala, zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso zzso when considered as a zzso These zzso zzso have not been recognized as having essential structural or functional zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid replacements guided by molecular modeling were carried out at key positions in zzso zzso zzso The most significant changes in zzso expression and activity were observed upon replacement of the zzso acids zzso and zzso in zzso zzso at these sites by larger zzso lowered the expression and activity of the zzso but did not affect specific binding to the zzso zzso zzso A second site zzso zzso rescued the low expression of the zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso in zzso by larger zzso acids lowered zzso activity in the order zzso zzso zzso and zzso Together these data provide comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso in a class A zzso and allow insights into the roles of these zzso in zzso structure and zzso
