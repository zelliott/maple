The fatty zzso composition of zzso determines the zzso character of zzso and impacts the function of membrane zzso Here, we define a nuclear zzso zzso for the dynamic zzso of membrane composition in response to changes in cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso of liver X receptors zzso zzso drives the incorporation of zzso fatty acids into zzso through induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity ameliorates zzso zzso zzso stress induced by saturated free fatty acids in zzso or by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammation both by regulating inflammatory zzso zzso through changes in membrane composition and by affecting zzso availability for inflammatory zzso zzso These results outline an zzso mechanism for the preservation of membrane zzso during zzso stress and identify zzso as an important zzso of zzso effects on zzso
