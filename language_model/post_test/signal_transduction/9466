zzso ill patients experience marked skeletal muscle zzso but the molecular mechanisms responsible for this are largely zzso zzso we investigated key genes and zzso identified from cell and animal studies to control protein synthesis and breakdown, in zzso zzso biopsy samples obtained from 10 patients and 10 zzso and zzso healthy zzso Muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso were higher in patients than in zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso From the perspective of muscle protein breakdown, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher in patients at zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso and protein zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and protein were higher in patients zzso P zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher zzso zzso zzso whilst zzso zzso P zzso zzso and protein zzso P zzso zzso lower zzso Another novel observation was the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso higher expression of myostatin zzso and protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso of proteins regulating translation initiation factor zzso and protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed in patients, which was paralleled by increases in their zzso Finally, zzso zzso and protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, higher zzso In conclusion, we showed comprehensive zzso in molecular events thought to reduce muscle mass and zzso zzso zzso in critically ill zzso zzso zzso events were matched by a cellular zzso of anabolic restoration at the zzso zzso This shows a high molecular plasticity in the muscle of patients, and strategies to preserve muscle mass and zzso function should focus on maintaining zzso zzso and zzso myostatin zzso
