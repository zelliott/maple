The mechanism of protective action of zzso acid zzso on collagen metabolism disturbances in zzso during inflammation is not zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in the regulation of collagen zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso of experimental zzso on the signaling pathways as well as on collagen zzso zzso and zzso activity in cultured human zzso and the effect of zzso on these zzso It was found that zzso zzso of collagen zzso was accompanied by increase in zzso zzso zzso expressions, and increase in zzso of zzso that resulted in stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso activities, but not zzso activity and zzso zzso decrease in expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso All those processes were zzso by zzso This suggests that cross talk between zzso and zzso receptors is disturbed by zzso and zzso recovers their proper signaling in cultured zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso signaling may play an important role in protective effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso of collagen zzso in cultured human zzso
