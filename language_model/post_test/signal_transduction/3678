zzso levels of zzso zzso in zzso cartilage have been linked to the progression of both zzso and zzso In this study, we examined zzso events which follow zzso of zzso to its zzso the zzso zzso In addition, we examined the regulatory influence of zzso oxide on these events, since this free radical has been implicated in cartilage zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso beads resulted in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which was accompanied by the zzso assembly of a focal zzso complex comprised of zzso the zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso the zzso related G protein zzso A, as well as zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso oxide zzso or zzso zzso which induce zzso oxide zzso blocked the assembly of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso proteins while not affecting the total number of beads bound per cell nor the zzso of zzso zzso Use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso either abolished or zzso the NO effect, zzso zzso of zzso to zzso enhanced zzso synthesis by twofold zzso zzso In addition, basic zzso growth factor zzso and insulin growth factor zzso induced zzso synthesis in zzso adherent to zzso but not zzso suggesting a zzso signal zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis were completely inhibited by zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso of zzso in the zzso induced the zzso assembly of an zzso complex comprised of the zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso and the signaling molecules zzso A and zzso We show that NO zzso the assembly of the zzso zzso complex and the synthesis of zzso but has no effect on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These observations provide a basis by which zzso oxide can interfere with zzso functions by affecting zzso zzso
