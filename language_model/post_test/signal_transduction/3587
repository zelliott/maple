Despite the high prevalence of zzso zzso and the poor outcome for patients, the processes of tumor zzso still remain poorly zzso It has been shown that zzso carbohydrates attached to proteins through the zzso acids zzso or zzso zzso are involved in tumor zzso with the roles of zzso varying depending on their zzso zzso zzso allow tumor cells to evade natural killer zzso cells of the immune system and survive longer in the circulatory system, thereby promoting tumor zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppress tumor formation and zzso by modulating zzso zzso Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms by which zzso promote or suppress tumor zzso
