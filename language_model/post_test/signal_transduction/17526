In zzso the zzso zzso zzso is one of the major routes by which zzso proteins are selectively zzso Recent work has shown that zzso of zzso to zzso proteins is zzso by a remarkably diverse array of zzso zzso targeting may also be regulated at steps between zzso of the zzso and its degradation to peptides by the zzso zzso zzso The complexity of the zzso system suggests a central role for protein turnover in zzso cell zzso
