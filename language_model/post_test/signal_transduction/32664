Using a zzso zzso screen, human zzso zzso protein was found to interact with human zzso In zzso binding zzso between human zzso zzso zzso and zzso was demonstrated by native gel zzso and the interaction was shown to be calcium zzso Our results, along with the association of the zzso zzso protein with other signaling zzso suggest that the zzso protein could provide a link between signal zzso and cell zzso
