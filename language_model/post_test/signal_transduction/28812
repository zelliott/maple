The zzso zzso regulates cell fate and differentiation through zzso zzso In recent years, several in zzso and in zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso functions as a negative feedback mechanism downstream of the zzso zzso that acts to finely shape the vascular zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso 4 zzso regulates different steps of blood vessel development ranging from proliferation and survival of zzso cells, to vessel branching and zzso zzso In addition, zzso notch zzso from zzso cells to zzso is critical for vessel stabilization and zzso Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that blocking the notch zzso can delay zzso zzso Unexpectedly however, zzso growth zzso by zzso was caused by an increased number of zzso vessels, which resulted in poor zzso zzso This approach of modulating notch zzso combined with the extended knowledge acquired on the basic vascular role of notch zzso will aid the development of treatments zzso human zzso such as tissue zzso and solid zzso zzso
