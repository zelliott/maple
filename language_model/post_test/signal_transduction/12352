zzso of G protein signaling 4 zzso regulates zzso signaling via G proteins and is markedly reduced in the prefrontal zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso the expression of zzso within individual zzso compartments is thus key to understanding its actions on individual G zzso receptors zzso Here we present an zzso reference map of zzso protein in zzso zzso based on zzso electron microscopic zzso At the zzso all labeling was zzso and affiliated with subsurface zzso zzso of zzso zzso The nucleus displayed most of zzso zzso levels were particularly high along zzso zzso zzso and markedly decreased with distance from the zzso clustered label was present at the zzso into zzso zzso In zzso zzso and in zzso the protein was found zzso or directly facing the zzso density of zzso and zzso zzso zzso also expressed zzso In fact, the density and distribution of zzso and zzso labeling was correlated with the zzso zzso and the type of established zzso The data indicate that zzso is zzso positioned to regulate not only zzso but also zzso signaling in response to synaptic and zzso zzso zzso having broad yet highly selective influences on multiple aspects of zzso cellular zzso
