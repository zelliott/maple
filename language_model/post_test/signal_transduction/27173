We studied the biological properties of insulin receptors zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso receptors in cultured zzso from a patient with zzso zzso zzso Patient cells displayed normal insulin binding capacity and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso activity of patient zzso were elevated twofold to zzso compared with control zzso and insulin had no further effect on these zzso Moreover, patient zzso were unable to promote the stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and DNA synthesis were not increased in the zzso state in patient zzso and were also insensitive to the zzso effect of zzso As for zzso although binding and zzso zzso activity were normal, the ability to stimulate zzso and DNA synthesis was altered in patient zzso Two zzso zzso of the zzso gene were detected by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and direct zzso The maternal zzso contained a point zzso in zzso 18 zzso the zzso substitution at position zzso and the paternal zzso had a point zzso in zzso 20 substituting zzso for zzso acid at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a compound zzso for two zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso The present investigation provides the first evidence that zzso can be zzso related to structural zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso These zzso result in severe impairment of insulin and zzso zzso
