zzso evidence suggests that species zzso is determined, at least in part, zzso Recent cloning works using zzso zzso zzso and worms zzso zzso revealed several potential candidate zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, and zzso a putative signal zzso zzso respectively, that may be involved in determining and/or regulating species zzso in lower zzso It is, however, not clear yet whether zzso zzso of these genes are also relevant to controlling longevity in higher zzso In mice and humans several zzso factors are essential for zzso specific gene zzso A variety of signal zzso molecules are also known to play important roles in zzso I will briefly zzso recent progress in molecular genetic studies on such zzso zzso and discuss these results with our recent findings on a zzso zzso factor and a zzso signaling zzso that are important for functioning of the nervous zzso
