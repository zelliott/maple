We studied the effects of Lyn zzso on the survival of drug-resistant chronic zzso leukemia zzso blast crisis cells using zzso Lyn zzso reduced Lyn protein in both normal zzso cells and zzso zzso blasts by zzso Within 48 zzso zzso zzso blasts underwent zzso whereas normal cells remained zzso This increased dependence on Lyn signaling for zzso blast survival provides the basis for rational treatment of drug-resistant zzso blast crisis, particularly when zzso in zzso
