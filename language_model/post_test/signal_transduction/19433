Acute zzso leukemia zzso is characterized by multiple zzso events that affect zzso survival, as well as zzso Recently, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso structure within the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso We identified four novel zzso zzso including a point zzso zzso and a putative zzso site zzso in zzso zzso zzso of these two zzso zzso revealed that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) or zzso zzso independent growth or zzso zzso zzso Growth of cells expressing zzso zzso required expression and zzso activity of zzso In addition to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso itself, transformation was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso and required functional expression of the small zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso led to zzso elevated zzso zzso oxygen species levels, which is commonly linked to increased zzso metabolism in cancer zzso zzso of zzso with zzso blocked the transforming activity of zzso zzso and reduced zzso of signaling zzso Overall, our data demonstrate that zzso of zzso alter cellular biology at multiple levels and require not only the zzso of zzso zzso signaling events but also an increase in cellular zzso zzso Pathways that are activated by zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently targeted by small zzso zzso
