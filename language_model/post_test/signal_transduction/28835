The zzso zzso signal zzso system in zzso coli and other pathogens senses diverse envelope stresses and promotes the zzso of a variety of genes that remedy these zzso An important member of the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been linked to stresses such as zzso proteins and alkaline zzso It also has been proposed that zzso zzso the intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, can activate the zzso of zzso in a zzso manner by zzso its zzso group to zzso We tested this hypothesis by measuring the zzso of zzso using zzso with zzso in the zzso pathway, zzso with zzso in the zzso pathway, and zzso with a combination of both types of zzso From this zzso analysis, we learned that zzso zzso diverse zzso The stimuli that originate in the envelope depend on zzso while those associated with growth and central metabolism depend on the zzso zzso While zzso could receive a zzso group from zzso zzso this global signal was not the primary trigger for zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso On the strength of these results, we contend that the interactions between central metabolism and signal zzso can be quite complex and that successful investigations of such interactions must include a complete zzso zzso
