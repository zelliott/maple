Although the critical role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is now widely accepted, the mechanisms of regulation of these zzso structures, which also contain zzso zzso and zzso remain poorly zzso Soon after zzso formation, several signaling proteins rapidly zzso from the zzso Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the movement of the adapters zzso for zzso of T cells zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso zzso away from initial zzso formation sites represents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso pathways are involved in the zzso events that zzso signaling zzso Several recent studies have indicated that zzso movement and zzso plays an important role in signal zzso We suggest that zzso movement is directly linked to zzso events, thus implicating zzso of zzso as a means to regulate signaling output of the T zzso
