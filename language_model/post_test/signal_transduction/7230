Death associated protein zzso zzso is a large, zzso zzso zzso whose activities zzso upon multiple signaling pathways that regulate zzso zzso cell death, cell zzso and zzso The cellular levels of zzso are zzso regulated by the combined activities of two degradation systems, including the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso At least three distinct zzso zzso zzso target zzso including zzso the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso In addition, it appears that the cellular levels of zzso are also regulated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso While protein quality control and recycling clearly benefit cells by removal of zzso or toxic proteins and recycling of their zzso the finding that multiple surveillance systems target zzso suggests that these protein degradation systems also act to fine tune zzso expression levels in response to specific signaling zzso
