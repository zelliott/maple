The zzso regulation of zzso proliferation is a critical issue in liver zzso Here, in normal and zzso liver as well as in developing liver, we examined its zzso of zzso which was most recently reported as a zzso proliferation factor associated with zzso contacts in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso showed a specific expression in zzso zzso positive for the zzso marker zzso the levels of expressions of zzso and proteins were significantly increased in zzso in liver zzso and zzso In zzso zzso was highly enriched at zzso contacts of zzso zzso and zzso were exclusively expressed in zzso and zzso zzso cells, respectively, in normal, zzso and developing zzso The expression of zzso but not of zzso was increased in zzso (but not in partial zzso liver zzso Exclusive zzso of zzso to zzso in the liver likely reflects the specific involvement of the zzso signaling cascade in zzso proliferation in addition to the previously identified signaling zzso possibly by zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso On the other hand, the zzso properties of zzso may be related to the distinct modes of zzso due to the different strategies which induced proliferation of liver zzso partial zzso zzso injury, or embryonic zzso Thus, the functional orchestration of Ras and the Ras zzso zzso family proteins zzso likely plays a critical role in liver zzso and zzso
