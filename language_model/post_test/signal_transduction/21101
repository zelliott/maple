Exposure of the zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immediate early gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression that may extend zzso h after zzso In order to determine the specificity of the prolonged zzso response to the zzso injection, the zzso pattern of zzso zzso expression was examined during the first 4 h after administration of saline or zzso (40 zzso As early as 30 zzso after zzso injection, both saline and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso In the saline group, this increase in zzso expression was only transient and returned to baseline by 1 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels within zzso animals continued to rise significantly at 1 and 4 zzso In a second experiment, rats received 4 zzso to zzso injections of zzso followed by sacrifice at 6 h to determine if increasing zzso doses caused the appearance of the prolonged zzso response zzso The prolonged zzso response was evident at 6 h only in animal groups that received higher dose ranges zzso zzso of zzso A final experiment was undertaken to determine if zzso of zzso zzso stimulation would also inhibit the prolonged zzso response at 6 h in relationship to zzso sparing evidenced at 24 h zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the prolonged zzso response at 6 h following zzso (40 zzso injection while also preventing zzso zzso zzso decline by 24 zzso zzso the zzso administration for 1-2 h zzso injection revealed that the intensity of the prolonged zzso zzso response may be zzso of zzso demise within the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that prolonged zzso expression is associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso
