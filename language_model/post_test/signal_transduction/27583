zzso zzso class II molecules human zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso cells was found to induce their entry into the zzso membrane fraction of the plasma zzso At the cellular level, this resulted in the synergistic zzso of class II with zzso zzso a marker of membrane zzso The accompanying induction of zzso protein zzso zzso could be inhibited by treating cells with zzso a drug that zzso membrane cholesterol and thereby zzso membrane zzso Signaling could also be inhibited by treating cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Together, these results show that the induced association of class II molecules with membrane zzso can contribute to their zzso on the cell surface and mediate an association with zzso zzso zzso
