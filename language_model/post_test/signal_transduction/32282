In this study, we evaluated the effects of obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet on prostate zzso focusing on cell zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso and proteins of the insulin signaling zzso Adult male zzso rats were fed a high-fat diet zzso zzso for 15 weeks, whereas control animals received a balanced diet zzso zzso Both groups were then divided and treated for 2 weeks with 1 zzso body zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso or vehicle zzso The zzso prostate was analyzed with zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso rats showed insulin resistance, zzso and reduced plasma testosterone zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso times higher in obese rats and affected zzso of the zzso compared with zzso zzso areas found in control zzso zzso doubled cell proliferation in both prostate zzso and zzso zzso content decreased in the prostate of obese rats and zzso zzso beta zzso increased in this zzso zzso levels of insulin zzso zzso 1 and protein zzso B diminished in the obese group, whereas zzso zzso zzso increased zzso Most structural changes observed in the prostate of obese rats zzso after zzso treatment, except for increased zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso which might be associated with insulin zzso This experimental model of obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet increases cell proliferation in rat zzso Such zzso are associated with decreased levels of zzso and increased zzso and zzso zzso This change can facilitate the establishment of zzso zzso in rat zzso
