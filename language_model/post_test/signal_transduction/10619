zzso and zzso family small zzso control dynamic zzso zzso and zzso trafficking zzso zzso is a dual GAP for zzso and zzso that is regulated by zzso zzso zzso a product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso function of zzso we used an zzso approach in an zzso cell zzso zzso cells showed increased activities of zzso and zzso zzso they were more rounded than control counterparts and displayed very fine stress zzso zzso cells were not capable of producing zzso upon growth factor zzso a process known to depend on zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated in zzso zzso zzso cells although its cellular zzso was altered, a likely consequence of increased zzso zzso We conclude that zzso recruitment to sites of elevated zzso is crucial to allow zzso zzso of zzso and cycling of zzso both of which are necessary to allow growth zzso formation of zzso
