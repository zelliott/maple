Our group previously reported that zzso zzso induced zzso via a zzso dependent zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso In the present study, the roles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways were investigated in zzso zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of zzso cells by colony formation and zzso incorporation zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest at zzso phase and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activated the zzso of zzso at zzso 15 zzso and its downstream zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso and prostate specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using its specific zzso reversed zzso D1 expression inhibited by zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso had no effect on the zzso signaling zzso activated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso did not cause cell cycle arrest and reduce zzso zzso zzso that zzso is essential to induce zzso arrest by zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, the findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest via zzso of zzso signaling and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
