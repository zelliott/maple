The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is less well understood because of the lack of animal zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is widely distributed in skin zzso has been shown to be an important factor that zzso zzso in human zzso zzso In this report, the authors performed a comparative study on zzso signal zzso in zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso harvested from 10 patients with zzso and zzso scars were used for this zzso At first, zzso induction using zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using electron zzso and flow zzso Second, the expression of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso were measured by means of flow zzso Third, zzso was measured by quantitative zzso to zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was investigated using zzso microscopic zzso 

In contrast to zzso zzso zzso those derived from zzso are significantly resistant to zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso There were no significant differences in the level of expression of zzso between the two groups, but zzso expression was higher in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso from the two groups were susceptible to zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso occurs upstream of the second zzso The abnormal zzso zzso in zzso may account for the imbalance of proliferation and zzso Enhancement of zzso sensitivity could be a promising therapeutic zzso
