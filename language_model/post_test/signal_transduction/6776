zzso inhibitor of protein zzso 2A zzso is zzso in most human zzso and has been described as being involved in the progression of several human zzso via the zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso activity toward zzso However, with the exception of this role, the cellular function of zzso remains poorly zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate here that zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso 2 zzso is a binding partner for zzso zzso exhibited dynamic changes in distribution, including the zzso and zzso depending on the cell cycle zzso When zzso was zzso zzso separation and the zzso zzso dynamics were impaired, resulting in the zzso of zzso assembly checkpoint signaling and, ultimately, extension of the cell division zzso Our data imply that zzso strongly interacts with zzso during zzso phase, thereby enhancing zzso zzso activity to facilitate zzso separation in a zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is involved in cell cycle progression through zzso separation and zzso zzso zzso
