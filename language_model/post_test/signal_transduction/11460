A genetic screen was performed to find new zzso with an zzso zzso zzso and to identify genes that may function with zzso a zzso zzso These zzso were named elk (for zzso and were placed into five zzso zzso We zzso cloned zzso and determined that it encodes zzso a putative zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso was renamed zzso zzso plants express similar fruit zzso as seen in zzso plants, but differ from zzso in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the zzso is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are zzso than those in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that it is likely a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso tested but is highest in the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso double zzso suggests that zzso may function in an zzso zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso but that it functions in parallel pathways affecting zzso length as well as leaf and stem zzso The finding that zzso is involved in the control of organ shape suggests that zzso zzso signaling is a zzso regulator in zzso
