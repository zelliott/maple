Wing patterning in zzso requires a zzso activity zzso created by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides long-range zzso while zzso signals zzso to cells near its source along the zzso (AP) boundary of the wing zzso How each zzso contributes to the signaling activity of each zzso is not well zzso Here, we show that while zzso mediates signals from both zzso and zzso zzso exhibits a novel function for a zzso type I zzso the ability to both promote and antagonize zzso Given its high affinity for zzso this dual function of zzso impacts the function of zzso in the zzso activity zzso more profoundly than does zzso We propose that this dual function of zzso is dependent on its zzso zzso When zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but when alone, zzso fails to signal effectively and sequesters zzso Overall, our model proposes that the balance between zzso and promoting zzso signaling varies across the wing pouch, modulating the level and effective range, and, thus, shaping the zzso activity zzso This previously unknown mechanism for modulating zzso availability and range raises important questions regarding the function of zzso zzso zzso
