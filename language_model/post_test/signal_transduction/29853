Despite the fact that zzso acid zzso has been identified as a main zzso zzso of mildly oxidized zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso it remains unknown whether it is capable of zzso zzso in zzso We found that zzso at zzso slightly above plasma levels zzso zzso shape change, zzso and zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso was almost zzso more potent than zzso zzso zzso directly induced zzso shape change in blood and zzso plasma obtained from all blood zzso However, zzso zzso zzso in blood was donor zzso It could be completely blocked by zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso These substances also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso plasma and zzso and zzso zzso of washed zzso These results indicate a central role for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in supporting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation zzso by zzso was insensitive to zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso at zzso approaching those found in zzso can induce zzso shape change, zzso and zzso zzso formation in whole blood and suggest that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors might be useful preventing zzso zzso formation in patients with cardiovascular zzso
