zzso the most abundant zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso mediates the transport of zzso and zzso into the zzso influencing plant development and contributing to salt zzso In this report, zzso expression profiles of wild type plants, a zzso zzso knockout zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso line zzso were exposed to both short (12 h and 48 zzso and long (one and two weeks) zzso of a zzso salt stress to identify key gene transcripts associated with the salt response that are influenced by zzso 

147 transcripts showed both salt responsiveness and a significant influence of zzso zzso of these genes showed an influence of the zzso across all salt treatments, while the remaining genes were influenced as a result of a particular duration of salt zzso Most zzso of the genes were zzso in the absence of zzso with the exception of transcripts zzso proteins involved with zzso and energy processes that were mostly zzso 

While part of the zzso transcripts were zzso other transcripts with known or putative roles showed the importance of zzso to key cellular processes that were not necessarily limited to the salt stress zzso namely calcium zzso sulfur zzso cell structure and cell growth, as well as zzso trafficking and protein zzso Only a small number of other zzso membrane zzso transcripts appeared significantly influenced by zzso
