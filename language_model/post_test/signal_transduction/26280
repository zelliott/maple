This study investigated the zzso effects of zzso A on zzso zzso and the mechanism of its action on downstream signaling zzso zzso A was isolated from the zzso bodies of zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso A were studied using rat zzso The effects of zzso A on zzso zzso zzso zzso release, production of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso binding to active zzso zzso were zzso zzso A, but not zzso B and C, inhibited zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso A did not affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso which act on different types of membrane zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso A significantly and zzso reduced zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso A induced the dynamic increase in zzso and zzso Increased zzso production was further confirmed by the simultaneous production of zzso zzso zzso with zzso A significantly blocked zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso A vaguely diminished the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso A zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of downstream signaling zzso zzso A may be beneficial against cardiovascular disease provoked by zzso zzso zzso
