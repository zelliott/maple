Three zzso zzso receptors have been cloned to date, two of which, zzso and zzso belong to the family of seven zzso domain receptors coupled to G proteins zzso zzso and zzso may activate multiple signal zzso zzso involving several G zzso However, whereas zzso acts as an zzso towards all zzso zzso this zzso may exert either zzso or zzso activities, depending on the zzso zzso in zzso Studies on these receptors reinforce the concept of independence between multiple signals potentially zzso through a single zzso generating a wide diversity of functional responses depending on the host cell and the zzso
