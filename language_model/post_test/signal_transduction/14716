zzso differentiated cells need never replicate their zzso and may therefore dispense with the daunting task of maintaining several repair systems to constantly scan their entire complement of zzso Obviously, transcribed genes need to be zzso so that cells can carry out their specialized functions, but dedicated mechanisms such as zzso repair and zzso repair can ensure the maintenance of those zzso active zzso Many groups have studied DNA repair in differentiated cells, often with divergent results, possibly because there are distinct classes of differentiated cells, with unique zzso Thus zzso ought to last for a zzso whereas zzso are backed by precursor cells, while white blood cells like zzso are constantly being zzso More importantly, different DNA repair systems can vary in their response to cellular zzso possibly depending on whether they can be coupled to zzso zzso zzso repair zzso is probably the most versatile DNA repair system and is coupled to zzso zzso was shown to be attenuated by differentiation in several cell types, including zzso The zzso occurs only at the global zzso level, with transcribed genes still being efficiently zzso We have determined that this zzso results from the lack of zzso of a zzso factor, most likely zzso to differences in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Because there is only one E1 in human cells, it is likely that other zzso pathways are similarly affected, depending on whether they rely on an zzso zzso which is sensitive to the state of E1 zzso
