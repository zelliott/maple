zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds a large variety of pathogens and zzso their zzso for subsequent zzso zzso This zzso is present in cell surface zzso but factors involved in zzso formation and their exceptional stability are not zzso To determine which zzso of zzso zzso its presence in zzso we studied zzso at key locations including zzso of the zzso tail, and zzso zzso that resulted in the removal of the zzso zzso site, the tandem repeats and the zzso recognition domain zzso as well as modification of the calcium sites in the zzso required for zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso recovery after zzso zzso showed that the zzso domain and the zzso zzso site do not affect the ability of zzso to form stable zzso However, zzso of the zzso results in complete loss of visible zzso and subsequent lateral diffusion of the zzso Apart from cell zzso membrane zzso are thought to be localized primarily via the zzso By contrast, we propose that interactions between the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso and/or zzso interactions with zzso scaffolding zzso play an essential role in organizing these zzso
