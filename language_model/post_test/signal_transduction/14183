zzso zzso such as zzso and loosely associated zzso are essential for zzso zzso to form zzso The role of another major component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contributes to colony zzso has been characterized in zzso zzso A zzso zzso whose zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was knocked out, formed significantly more zzso than wild type, due to increased zzso of the cell surface, adherence to zzso surfaces and cell zzso To zzso the direct effect of zzso on zzso structure, extracted zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were added in zzso zzso resulting in reduction and zzso of zzso sizes zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso play a critical role in determining zzso size by restricting continual growth of mature zzso Since zzso is required after zzso zzso zzso should be controlled in a cell zzso manner, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene cluster revealed that it was activated by zzso a zzso master regulator, via binding to the upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso was produced when zzso cell density reached high enough to turn on zzso regulation and limited zzso to appropriate zzso
