Changes in zzso protein zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso protein levels were determined in zzso zzso mast cells in response to zzso zzso zzso Ten minutes after the addition of zzso modified zzso to mast cells, whose high affinity zzso for zzso zzso contained bound zzso zzso zzso specific activity increased by 54 zzso zzso Time course studies showed zzso specific activity doubled during a zzso to zzso period after zzso cell zzso Also, an increase in zzso zzso protein during this time ( approximately zzso was zzso this protein increase was not accompanied by a similar increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had no significant effect on the activities of other zzso involved with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso was studied to determine what role zzso plays in mast cell zzso zzso profoundly inhibited zzso release in activated cells, indicating zzso is required for signal zzso involved with protein zzso from zzso mast zzso
