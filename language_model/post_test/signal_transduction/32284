The zzso forms an zzso layer on the surface of the zzso It is derived from a cluster of zzso cells, which is termed the zzso The zzso gives rise not only to the zzso but also to zzso zzso These cells populate the zzso wall and differentiate into smooth muscle cells, zzso and possibly zzso zzso In this review, the formation of the zzso is zzso zzso zzso suitable to identify these cells in the zzso and in the adult, are zzso Recent evidence suggests that the zzso is made up of distinct cell zzso These cell lineages can be distinguished on the basis of marker gene expression and differ in their differentiation zzso The role of the zzso as a resource for cardiac stem cells and its importance in cardiac zzso is also zzso
