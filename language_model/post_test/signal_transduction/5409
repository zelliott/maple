The zzso tumor zzso gene plays a crucial role in zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso injury zzso To further zzso the zzso pathway, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso related to zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are highly induced in the outer zzso zzso zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso zzso at 3, 12, and 24 h in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso the rate of zzso following zzso by inducing zzso zzso and subsequent release of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso 9 zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso gene with short hairpin zzso prevented zzso in zzso injury by zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso c and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso pathways and is a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
