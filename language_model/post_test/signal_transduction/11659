zzso factor zzso is a 41 zzso acid zzso which is involved in the stress zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso produce zzso effects on anxiety in the central nucleus of the zzso The molecular mechanisms of possible zzso interactions in regulating anxiety behavior is not zzso In the central nervous system, the action of zzso leads to zzso of zzso production while zzso is known to stimulate levels of zzso in the zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso may antagonize zzso behavior by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the protein zzso A zzso We have engineered an immortalized zzso cell line zzso zzso which express via zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, in these cells zzso treatment results in significant zzso increases in zzso zzso Furthermore, incubation of 3 zzso zzso with increasing zzso of zzso was able to significantly inhibit the increases in zzso compared to that observed with 3 zzso zzso treatment zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso may zzso each other in zzso zzso via zzso effects on the protein zzso A zzso
