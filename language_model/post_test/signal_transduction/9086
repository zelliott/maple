zzso zzso cells zzso play a central role in the control of blood vessel function and circulatory system zzso It is well known that that zzso functions are regulated by chemical zzso including hormones, zzso and zzso but it has recently become apparent that zzso functions are also controlled by zzso forces such as zzso stress and stretch zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso stress and zzso strain as mechanical zzso and transmit the signal into the interior of the cells, thereby triggering a variety of cellular responses that involve zzso in cell zzso cell function, and gene zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso stress and zzso strain lead to vascular diseases, including hypertension, zzso and zzso A great deal of research has already been conducted on the zzso of zzso stress and zzso strain, and its molecular mechanisms are gradually coming to be zzso However, much remains zzso and further studies of zzso should increase our understanding of the molecular basis of the zzso control of vascular zzso
