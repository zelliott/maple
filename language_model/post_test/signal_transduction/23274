To survive, animals need to minimize exposure to damaging zzso They can either stay away from noxious stimuli zzso as zzso requiring the detection of remote warning cues, or run away upon exposure to noxious stimuli zzso as zzso Here we combine zzso quantitative zzso simulations and zzso to determine how zzso zzso zzso exposure to noxious heat when navigating in zzso We find that worms use both escape and avoidance strategies, each involving the zzso of multiple parameters like speed and the frequency of steering and withdrawal zzso As some zzso parameters promote escape while zzso zzso and vice versa, worms need to zzso tune those parameters according to zzso Furthermore, selectively zzso avoidance or escape, through zzso affecting zzso or zzso channel zzso increases exposure to zzso We conclude that zzso switching between avoidance and escape regimes along the zzso temperature zzso efficiently zzso exposure to noxious zzso
