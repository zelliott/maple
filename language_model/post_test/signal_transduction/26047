The possible role of zzso in zzso tumors has been investigated in previous zzso however, to date, the conclusions remain under zzso zzso we investigated the serum zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signaling pathways were investigated in biopsy specimens collected from human patients with zzso zzso No significant difference in the mean serum zzso level was observed between the zzso zzso patients and the control zzso however, increased expression and zzso of the zzso zzso as indicated by findings such as the zzso of zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and increased zzso regulation of downstream target molecules were observed in zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso These results indicate zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways may be activated in human zzso zzso
