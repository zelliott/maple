zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso arising from skeletal muscle precursors zzso markers of proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso differentiation suppress zzso zzso zzso The zzso target gene zzso is zzso in zzso and prevents zzso cell differentiation in a zzso zzso However, zzso receptors regulating this phenomenon are zzso In agreement with data in zzso primary zzso we show here that the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cell lines versus normal zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso and zzso essential for zzso resulting in the differentiation of zzso cells into zzso zzso expressing zzso Heavy zzso These phenomena are associated to a marked decrease in zzso zzso an increase in zzso level and the zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso at least in part, the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso depletion also reduces the zzso potential of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso is sufficient to force zzso cells into completing a correct full zzso program providing evidence that it zzso partially through zzso sustained zzso to their zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest zzso as a novel potential target in human zzso
