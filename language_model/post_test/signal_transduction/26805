The zzso reward circuit is critical for zzso natural reward behaviors including food, sex, and social zzso Drugs of abuse take over this circuit and produce persistent molecular and cellular zzso in the brain regions and their neural zzso that make up the reward zzso Recent use of zzso technologies has provided novel insights into the functional and molecular role of the zzso and cell zzso within these circuits that constitute this zzso This perspective will address the current and future use of zzso zzso including those involved in modulating zzso activity, cellular zzso and molecular properties in the neural zzso zzso rewarding stimuli and zzso responses to drugs of zzso
