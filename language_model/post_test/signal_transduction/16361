zzso zzso zzso zzso are hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso mainly through zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of pathways controlling cell survival, including the zzso zzso zzso compounds were shown to have zzso zzso However, reports about their mechanism of action are contradictory, particularly in what concerns the signaling zzso that are zzso Here, the aim was to characterize the effects of zzso in zzso cancer cells harboring zzso 

Growth behavior of zzso cells was evaluated by the zzso B zzso cell cycle analysis and Terminal zzso zzso Nick End zzso zzso zzso parameters such as the zzso potential and production of zzso oxygen species zzso were also zzso Western zzso was used to study cellular zzso 

Low doses of the compound induce a zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso zzso of zzso results in increased zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso branch of the zzso signaling zzso These zzso of the drug also induce typical features of zzso including DNA zzso loss of zzso membrane potential, production of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso factor, a zzso zzso that acts through zzso could not completely block zzso growth zzso and cell zzso 

In this model, zzso zzso zzso zzso and interferes with the zzso zzso This work provides characterization of the effects of zzso and zzso the possibility of its usefulness as a cell death zzso
