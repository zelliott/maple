zzso zzso regulates many zzso zzso including the fate zzso zzso migration, and proliferation of zzso neural zzso The zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to play an important role in bone physiology and there is evidence for its zzso during organ zzso in lower zzso This study explores the role of the zzso zzso zzso in deer zzso frontal bone zzso that are the only zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso was used to map the distribution of the activated form of zzso zzso A low level of zzso zzso was detected in zzso and in zzso at sites of zzso bone zzso However, zzso was zzso in cellular zzso and in zzso in zzso bone, where it zzso with zzso The most intense zzso zzso was in dividing zzso cells in the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured from this region and when the zzso zzso zzso was inhibited at the level of zzso by zzso zzso zzso the cell number zzso zzso zzso revealed that this was as a result of increased zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cell number but inhibited alkaline zzso activity zzso a marker of zzso zzso whereas zzso increased zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of antler zzso cell survival and cell zzso It also provides evidence that zzso function in regulating bone formation by zzso may be zzso
