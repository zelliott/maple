Certain zzso including alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 zzso to zzso binding sites, and thus may participate in zzso zzso We demonstrated here the physical and functional associations of zzso alpha 2 beta 1 with zzso growth factor zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso alpha 2 zzso or zzso beta 1 zzso resulted in preferential zzso of zzso from zzso cell zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 beta zzso Chemical zzso confirmed the association of zzso alpha 2 beta 1 and zzso zzso of zzso alpha 2 beta 1 and zzso at zzso contact sites was observed by double zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation did not affect the association of zzso alpha 2 beta 1 and zzso However, zzso with the zzso specific to zzso revealed that zzso localized at zzso contact sites are zzso even in zzso conditions, while zzso localized to other sites is totally zzso in the same zzso The zzso zzso in zzso contact sites observed in a zzso culture was zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso alpha 2, but not with a zzso alpha 2 zzso or zzso alpha 3 zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso in zzso conditions was not observed in suspended cells, or largely zzso in sparse cells, indicating that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso alpha 2 beta 1 not only physically associates with zzso but also functions in zzso zzso zzso at zzso contact zzso The present results shed a new light on the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
