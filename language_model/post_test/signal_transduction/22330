zzso zzso zzso represents a group of zzso strains responsible for the zzso of agricultural zzso to zzso disease of zzso It produces the zzso zzso and aggressively zzso the roots of cereal zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso of zzso and identified a type III protein zzso system zzso gene cluster that has overall organization similar to that of the zzso gene cluster of the plant pathogen zzso zzso We also screened a collection of 30 closely related zzso zzso strains and detected the zzso genes in all but one of zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso type III zzso zzso which are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso as well as a novel type III zzso gene designated zzso These type III zzso genes zzso proteins that were zzso in culture and injected into plant cells by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso but zzso lacking a functional zzso were not altered in their zzso zzso The zzso type III zzso zzso zzso and zzso were capable of suppressing the hypersensitive response and production of zzso oxygen species, two plant immune zzso
