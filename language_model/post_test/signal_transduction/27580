We have recently identified two different pathways of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Peter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso zzso zzso in type I cells is initiated by large amounts of active zzso formed at the zzso signaling complex zzso followed by direct zzso of zzso In contrast, in type II cells very little zzso and small amounts of active zzso sufficient to induce the zzso activity of zzso are formed causing a profound zzso of both zzso and zzso Only in type II cells can zzso be blocked by zzso zzso or zzso We now show that a number of zzso or zzso stimuli only affect zzso in type II cells, indicating that they act on the zzso branch of the zzso zzso These stimuli include the zzso of protein zzso C, which zzso zzso zzso resulting in a delayed zzso of zzso and the induction of zzso by the zzso analog zzso In addition, we have identified the zzso high expressing cell line zzso as a zzso zzso type II cell that can be zzso by treatment with zzso without affecting formation of the zzso This also places the effects of zzso in the zzso branch of the type II zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was found to block zzso zzso in both type I and type II cells, because it acts directly at the zzso of both types of zzso
