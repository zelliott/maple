During a productive infection, the zzso strain of the zzso minute virus of mice zzso zzso dramatic zzso zzso in zzso A9 zzso culminating in cell zzso at the end of zzso These zzso effects zzso result from zzso and destruction of the zzso zzso and intermediate zzso while other structures such as the nuclear zzso and particularly the zzso network remain protected throughout the infection zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to unravel the zzso by which zzso trigger zzso we searched for zzso interaction partners by differential affinity zzso using distinct zzso zzso zzso specifically for this zzso zzso we isolated an zzso partner zzso whose interaction with zzso correlated with the competence of the viral product for zzso zzso and further identified it by tandem mass zzso and Western zzso analyses to consist of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso II, zzso This interaction of zzso with zzso suggested interference by the viral protein with zzso zzso Using permanent cell lines expressing zzso zzso zzso we were able to show that this zzso activity was indeed specifically involved in zzso zzso and progeny particle zzso Furthermore, the zzso complex proved to be able to specifically zzso viral zzso indicating a zzso function of zzso for zzso activity and zzso at least in zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso interference with zzso zzso zzso
