We earlier showed that the increased expression of zzso proteins exhibited by vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from spontaneously zzso rats zzso was attributed to the enhanced levels of zzso zzso Since the levels of zzso II zzso zzso are also enhanced in zzso from zzso the present study was undertaken to examine the role of enhanced levels of zzso zzso II in the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso from zzso and to further explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for this zzso The enhanced expression of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso from zzso compared to zzso was attenuated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso converting zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso respectively as well as by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by low zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso responses of hormones on zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in zzso from zzso was also attenuated by zzso Furthermore, the enhanced zzso of zzso in zzso from zzso was also restored to control levels by zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scavenger, whereas enhanced zzso zzso was attenuated by zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso also restored the enhanced zzso of zzso in zzso to control zzso These results suggest that the enhanced levels of zzso zzso II in zzso from zzso zzso zzso which through zzso zzso zzso enhance the expression of zzso proteins and associated zzso zzso zzso
