The ability of guinea pig enteric zzso to respond to zzso was examined using zzso zzso digital zzso in zzso cells derived from guinea pig zzso zzso Each zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso concentration zzso and in percentage of cells zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso similar zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso inhibited zzso responses to zzso zzso of zzso with zzso a zzso C zzso abolished the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso also eliminated zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso introduced into zzso cells by radio frequency zzso blocked zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was abolished by removal of zzso from the buffer and inhibited zzso zzso by zzso (1 zzso zzso of zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso (24 zzso also inhibited sustained increments in zzso by zzso The presence of zzso receptors in enteric zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso
