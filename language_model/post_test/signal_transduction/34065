zzso zzso protein 12 zzso is known to function as a scaffold protein and as a putative tumor zzso However, little is known about the biological role of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we performed zzso analysis to identify the downstream zzso of zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso the expressions of several zzso genes including zzso zzso and LDL zzso which have been reported to be controlled by zzso regulatory element binding zzso zzso It was found that zzso activates zzso in zzso cells, as demonstrated by the presence of its zzso product, whereas the zzso of zzso regulatory element binding zzso was not remarkably zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was found to depend on zzso zzso protein zzso as zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso blocked zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso caused dramatic movement of zzso from the plasma membrane to zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane zzso zzso caused a shift of zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso binding zzso revealed that the zzso region of zzso binds directly to cholesterol in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may activate zzso by increasing cholesterol zzso In conclusion, the present study suggests that zzso is a novel regulator of cellular cholesterol zzso
