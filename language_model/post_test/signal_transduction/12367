zzso are critical early innate immune zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been established that inflammatory zzso are released from the bone zzso and into the peripheral blood before entry into infected tissue zzso We previously reported a role for zzso in promotion of zzso recruitment of zzso into the liver in response to zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that support the migration of zzso from the bone zzso and into the peripheral blood under conditions of zzso infection have not been zzso zzso we demonstrate an zzso of zzso in the bone zzso of zzso zzso mice, whereas circulating zzso are profoundly zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are detected in bone zzso and in serum from zzso zzso Furthermore, bone zzso zzso from zzso mice produce high levels of zzso and zzso and moderate levels of zzso when zzso with zzso zzso in zzso We identify bone zzso zzso cells as major producers of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, induction of zzso zzso is dependent on zzso signals and zzso zzso Taken together, the results reveal a critical role for inflammatory zzso in stimulating production of zzso zzso from zzso cells in the bone zzso and they suggest that local production of zzso supports zzso zzso from the bone zzso into the blood during a virus zzso
