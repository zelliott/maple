zzso proteins finely tune zzso zzso zzso zzso the need for such zzso in the developing vascular system, in zzso zzso revealed a striking and extensive expression pattern of zzso in the zzso walls of zzso mouse zzso The distribution and location of the zzso cells typified that of zzso and zzso overlapped the known expression pattern of zzso growth factor zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso mice exhibited markedly reduced levels of zzso in their vascular zzso and small zzso This likely reflects the loss of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso acts as a potent zzso zzso protein for zzso and zzso and it attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together these results indicate that zzso exerts control over zzso and zzso signaling pathways active during fetal vascular zzso
