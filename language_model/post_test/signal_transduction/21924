zzso zzso potential zzso zzso channels are zzso detectors of multiple environmental factors, including temperature, zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhance zzso function through multiple signaling zzso The zzso and zzso products of zzso acid zzso metabolism have been shown to directly activate zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso channel with an intermediate temperature threshold of zzso degrees zzso We have previously shown that zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso Here we show that AA and other zzso fatty acids directly zzso zzso responses of zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso and mouse zzso The zzso zzso is observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clamp studies, as well as single channel recordings of excised zzso and zzso zzso The fatty zzso zzso is not blocked by zzso of protein zzso C and thus differs from that induced by the zzso The zzso does not require AA metabolism but is rather zzso by zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism regulating the zzso response to zzso which differs from zzso and zzso and involves a direct action of free fatty acids on the zzso
