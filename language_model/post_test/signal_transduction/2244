We have studied the in zzso effect of sodium zzso zzso on the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited significantly in a zzso manner zzso and zzso zzso zzso on isolated rat zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity measured in the presence of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso In contrast, zzso did not inhibit but slightly increased the zzso zzso zzso activity measured in the presence of zzso and zzso beta zzso a stable zzso zzso The effect of zzso was not zzso through either the zzso zzso zzso or the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was additive to that of zzso zzso and was not blocked by the addition of the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso toxin slightly attenuated but did not abolish the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso activity on membrane zzso These data suggest that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso does not imply only zzso protein but also other direct or indirect zzso zzso which remain to be zzso
