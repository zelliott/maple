zzso zzso an analog of vitamin A, plays multiple roles in the nervous system, including neural zzso zzso zzso and neural zzso and is also an zzso agent and thereby potential zzso for brain zzso The present study aimed at investigating the protective effects of zzso zzso against zzso brain injury in a bilateral common carotid artery zzso zzso model in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso zzso changes and zzso zzso proliferation in the zzso particularly in the zzso region, and these changes were accompanied by increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration before zzso reduced zzso zzso with zzso zzso the differences were statistically significant in both the zzso group and 12 zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso prevents brain zzso zzso injury with zzso expression and that zzso signaling could be involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a treatment option for human brain zzso
