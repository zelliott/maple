zzso oxide zzso zzso activity has been detected previously in the zzso zzso at a light microscopic zzso Here we present results of electron microscopic analysis for zzso zzso of zzso zzso I in the zzso of the guinea zzso Strong zzso zzso was identified in the zzso of inner and outer hair zzso zzso zzso I zzso were mainly located in zzso areas of the zzso whereas zzso regions of the zzso cells were nearly free from any zzso In both types of hair cells zzso I zzso were also visible in the zzso plates, hair zzso and zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso of the outer hair cells were nearly free from any reaction product, demonstrating that the whole zzso of this hair cell was not zzso Other zzso I zzso was identified in the zzso plates of the inner and outer pillar cells and in the zzso elements located in the zzso parts of zzso cells, forming the zzso zzso or in zzso regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were visible in the zzso of various cell zzso Our findings suggest that zzso oxide produced by NO I zzso in the organ of zzso may act as a zzso of hair cell physiology during the processes of signal zzso with frequency zzso
