zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso signaling is considered an important mechanism in the development of prostate zzso A recent study revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso was zzso in breast zzso and acted as an zzso zzso of zzso members has been reported in prostate cancer zzso but expression of zzso has not yet been studied in prostate zzso In this study, we attempted to explore as to whether expressions of zzso and zzso members zzso zzso and zzso are altered in prostate zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 107 prostate zzso zzso by zzso using a tissue zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells in normal prostate zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the prostate zzso in the zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso members zzso zzso and zzso which are considered zzso of zzso zzso were observed respectively in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso Nuclear zzso was detected neither in normal zzso cells nor in zzso However, none of the expression of zzso nor zzso nor zzso nor zzso was associated with zzso zzso including size of the zzso age, zzso score and zzso The increased zzso expression of zzso as well as the increased nuclear expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in the prostate zzso compared to normal zzso cells suggested that zzso of these proteins may be related to zzso of the zzso zzso and might play a role in zzso of prostate zzso
