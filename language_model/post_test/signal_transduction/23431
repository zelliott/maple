zzso signaling zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso Despite this concept, zzso zzso zzso have not been zzso Thus, we examined the effect of zzso a zzso signaling zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso zzso mice were placed on zzso zzso or zzso zzso saturated zzso zzso and zzso zzso One week prior to zzso mice were treated with zzso or zzso Mice fed the zzso diet developed significant zzso which was unchanged by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso significantly attenuated zzso liver injury as zzso by reduced serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso In line with the decreased zzso zzso prevented zzso strong zzso of death zzso zzso and its zzso zzso In addition, zzso mice, but not zzso animals, underwent significant liver injury and zzso following treatment with a zzso zzso however, this injury was prevented by zzso with zzso zzso with a reduction in liver injury, zzso zzso zzso markers of inflammation including zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a variety of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso signaling with zzso appears to reduce zzso liver injury in a zzso excess model of zzso thereby attenuating zzso inflammation and zzso We speculate that zzso signaling zzso may be zzso in human zzso
