We have developed a firing rate network model for working memory that combines zzso synaptic zzso with intrinsic or cellular dynamics that are zzso zzso While our approach is in the spirit of zzso and Wang zzso we include a specific and plausible mechanism for the cellular zzso zzso zzso are known to activate second zzso signaling systems, and our model includes an zzso zzso handling zzso whose dynamics depend upon the level of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso individual units with conditional intrinsic zzso for a range of zzso The full zzso network sustains zzso persistent zzso activity in response to a brief transient zzso The bump response in our hybrid model, like that of zzso is resistant to zzso its position does not drift with zzso
