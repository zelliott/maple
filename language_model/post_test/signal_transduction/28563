Based on zzso gene knockout animal models, the zzso signaling zzso has been suggested to play a role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso human B zzso cell lines, we have previously identified three zzso zzso zzso termed as zzso zzso and zzso A genetic mechanism has been proposed which determines the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso With respect to the contribution of zzso zzso to human disease, we further zzso that the zzso zzso may result from a partial zzso in zzso signaling which resembles zzso knockout animals in several functional zzso The characterization of the human zzso zzso zzso displayed by the zzso cell lines is easily zzso and possesses important implications with respect to zzso zzso imbalance in diseases such as cancer zzso and inflammatory zzso In this study, we have extended our investigation to the downstream regulatory consequences associated with these zzso zzso zzso of three important zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined in spontaneous zzso cell culture using zzso zzso Individual cell lines defined as zzso produced significantly higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso on day 4 in spontaneous culture in comparison with cell lines characterized as zzso and zzso These observations of the human zzso zzso together with those zzso from zzso knockout mouse model studies, suggest that the zzso signaling zzso may play a role in maintaining the zzso zzso balance by directly and indirectly zzso the production of zzso zzso a regulatory process which appears to go awry in inflammatory zzso Moreover, observations from signal zzso studies in our human B zzso model may be compatible with those in the chosen mouse B zzso for establishing signaling networks by the Alliance for Cellular Signaling zzso
