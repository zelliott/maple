zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso and zzso agent for the zzso However, whether zzso has a role in maternal zzso adaptation during pregnancy is zzso To address this issue, we characterized zzso and zzso zzso in pregnant mice lacking zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression were increased in pregnant zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed decreased zzso replication and increased zzso zzso at zzso day zzso The decreased zzso replication was associated with reductions in zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso nuclear zzso and zzso box zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mouse zzso were more sensitive to zzso zzso whereas zzso protected human zzso against zzso in zzso These zzso zzso in zzso proliferation and death led to incomplete maternal zzso mass expansion in zzso zzso mice at zzso and early zzso zzso The decreased zzso mass was accompanied by increased blood zzso decreased plasma insulin, and impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso failed to zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso insulin content, and zzso insulin zzso during zzso These studies indicate that zzso signaling is essential for maternal zzso adaptation during pregnancy and that its zzso leads to zzso diabetes zzso
