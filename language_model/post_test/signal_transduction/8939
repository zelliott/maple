zzso in zzso zzso is largely under control of the accessory gene regulator zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso detects its zzso zzso zzso zzso and generates an zzso signal resulting in zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso is a well-studied zzso system, little is known about the mechanism of zzso zzso By zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso zzso we showed that zzso forms zzso zzso that undergo zzso upon interaction with zzso zzso addition of specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso with only one functional sensor domain caused zzso zzso of either zzso domain despite the sensor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso involving one zzso zzso demonstrated zzso activity, irrespective of which zzso was zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso through either individual zzso zzso causes zzso zzso of both zzso zzso We suggest that such zzso across the zzso interface may be an important mechanism for zzso zzso receptors to rapidly elicit a response upon signal zzso
