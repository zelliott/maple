The physical nature of zzso cells, particularly in the functional and zzso segregation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso special importance on the integrity of their cell zzso for the zzso of function, generation of intrinsic second zzso and plasticity required for adaptation and zzso The component zzso of neural zzso are important sources of zzso zzso that participate in such diverse phenomena as memory formation and cellular damage following zzso A common role for zzso in these processes is established through the zzso effects of its zzso Furthermore, being both an zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in addition to being a product of zzso activity, zzso assumes a zzso role in the cellular metabolism following neural zzso The linkage of zzso to neural zzso gene zzso both in zzso and in zzso suggests that its effects are initiating to long-term formative and zzso zzso Such a common link between destructive and plastic responses provides an important view of cellular and tissue maintenance in the nervous zzso
