In zzso the Toll zzso signaling zzso is required for embryonic zzso patterning and at later zzso stages for innate immune zzso It is thought that zzso of the zzso by binding of the zzso zzso causes the formation of a zzso zzso complex at the zzso surface of the zzso Two components of this complex are the zzso tube and protein zzso zzso These proteins both have zzso zzso protein interaction motifs found in a number of signaling zzso particularly those involved in zzso cell zzso It is thought that zzso is bound by tube during formation of the zzso complexes, and that this interaction is zzso by the death zzso In this paper, we show using the zzso zzso system that the zzso tube and zzso death zzso bind zzso zzso tube proteins which do not support signaling in the zzso are also unable to bind zzso in the zzso zzso We have zzso proteins corresponding to the death zzso of tube and zzso and show that these form corresponding zzso complexes in zzso zzso zzso reveals a smaller core consisting of the minimal death domain zzso We have studied the zzso interaction with the techniques of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso produce a value of zzso for the complex of about zzso zzso
