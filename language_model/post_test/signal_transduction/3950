zzso dynamics and changes in zzso activity are consistent elements of cellular zzso associated with changes in zzso zzso In particular, the highly specific correlations and early zzso relationships between zzso loss in the absence of zzso activity and zzso zzso or crisis, on the one hand, and zzso zzso and cell zzso on the other, point to a new and important paradigm in the complementary fields of zzso and zzso Although the zzso pathways between zzso and zzso and cell cycle machinery remain zzso recently described zzso between zzso proteins and zzso zzso activities important in zzso stability provide evidence for the existence of pathways zzso signals originating in zzso structure to cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso between cell cycle arrest at zzso and the response of mortal cells to zzso damage suggest overlap in the signal zzso mechanisms culminating in irreversible and stable cell cycle zzso The feasibility of targeting zzso as a strategy for zzso zzso has been shown in studies in zzso in which zzso in specific zzso associated genes result in delayed cell zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in human zzso cells zzso results in delayed cell zzso The mechanism of cell death and possible escape from this fate require further zzso In human cells, however, it would seem reasonable to predict that in these circumstances, zzso is induced in the vast majority of cells either directly in response to a DNA damage signal arising from critically shortened zzso or as a secondary consequence of genetic zzso
