The biological availability and activity of zzso zzso zzso are regulated by their short life span, which can be additionally shortened by a zzso zzso The signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso death are classified in two zzso the intrinsic and the zzso In the present study the expressions of proteins participating in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the intensity of zzso of zzso from patients with cancer of the oral cavity were zzso The expression of proteins participating in the intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso were also examined in these zzso The results can be helpful in explaining the reasons for the decreased activity of these cells in oral cavity cancer zzso 

The examinations were carried out in patients with zzso cell zzso of the oral cavity before and after zzso The expressions of all the proteins were measured in zzso and, for comparison, in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Western zzso analysis was used to zzso the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cell zzso The zzso level was determined by flow zzso and zzso activity by zzso zzso 

A lack of changes in zzso expression associated with increased zzso protein expression and zzso activity accompanied the accelerated zzso rates in the zzso of the patients before zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein was associated with an unchanged expression of zzso zzso zzso There were no such changes in the patients zzso Increased expression of zzso in the zzso of the patients following surgical treatment was zzso 

The acceleration of the zzso of zzso of oral cavity cancer patients before treatment is dependent on both the intrinsic and zzso zzso
