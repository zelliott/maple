zzso zzso is an important signaling zzso in animals, specifically binding to the C1 domain of proteins such as protein zzso zzso In most plant species, however, zzso is present at low zzso and no interacting proteins have yet been zzso As a result, it has been proposed that the signaling function of zzso has been discarded by plants during their zzso In this zzso we zzso the accumulating experimental evidence which supports that notion that changes in zzso content in response to particular cues are a feature of plant zzso This behavior suggests that zzso does indeed act as a signaling zzso during plant development and in response to certain environmental zzso
