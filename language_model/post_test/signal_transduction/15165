There is growing evidence for a connection between inflammation and tumor development, and the nuclear factor zzso B zzso a zzso zzso factor, is hypothesized to promote zzso Although the genetic evidence for the hypothesis has been zzso recent papers have lent zzso to this zzso It has been reported that zzso zzso zzso in inflammatory zzso diseases zzso increases risk of zzso cancer zzso in the patients with the number of years of active zzso zzso zzso might induce cellular zzso mediate cellular zzso prevent the elimination of zzso and fully zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may contribute to the progression of zzso by regulating the expression of diverse target genes that are involved in cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings zzso zzso zzso as an important therapeutic target in zzso However, due to lack of knowledge about the specific roles of different zzso zzso in different stage of zzso and compounds to block specific zzso of zzso family, it will be a long time before the coming of targeting zzso in zzso zzso
