The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated the relationship between the disease related changes of expressed zzso zzso zzso density and the corresponding zzso signal zzso route in cortical and zzso brain structures in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso have been performed in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso samples obtained from six deceased zzso patients and six age matched control zzso zzso zzso were expressed as zzso tissue protein for zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was expressed in zzso tissue and its change was expressed in percentage values above zzso zzso Our results indicate that whereas there is a decrease of the zzso zzso receptors in the zzso demonstrated by classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding zzso zzso zzso binding zzso shows unchanged zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and, at the same time, no change in stimulation zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso binding displayed significant differences between zzso and age matched control brain samples, whereas the zzso binding values were markedly higher in zzso These preliminary findings may indicate a possible zzso mechanism in zzso regions of zzso zzso the loss of the zzso receptors in the zzso appears to be compensated by an increased zzso zzso signal zzso route zzso However, the accurate interpretation of the present findings requires detailed further zzso
