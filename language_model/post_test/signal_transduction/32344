zzso a dietary constituent and zzso signaling zzso mediates a number of zzso responses including zzso of zzso injury, zzso zzso and vascular zzso Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying zzso actions are unknown, the current paradigm suggests that these effects depend on the hypoxic reduction of zzso to zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso is a fundamental mechanism of cellular adaptation and zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso number has not been zzso zzso we report that zzso stimulates zzso zzso through a mechanism distinct from that of zzso We demonstrate that zzso significantly increases cellular zzso number by zzso the activity of zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso the master regulator of zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso does not require the zzso of soluble zzso zzso and results in the synthesis of more functionally efficient zzso Further, we provide evidence that zzso mediates zzso in zzso In a rat model of carotid injury, 2 weeks of continuous oral zzso treatment zzso prevented the zzso response of smooth muscle zzso This protection was accompanied by a zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso number in the injured zzso These data are the first to demonstrate that zzso mediates differential signaling compared to zzso They show that zzso is a versatile regulator of zzso function and number both in zzso and in zzso and suggest that zzso zzso may play a protective role in the setting of vascular zzso
