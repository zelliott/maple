zzso zzso including increased zzso smooth muscle zzso mass, contributes to zzso obstruction in zzso However, its mechanisms are complex and remain zzso Recently, a role of the zzso zzso 1 protein zzso has been evoked in zzso Indeed, zzso concentration was increased in zzso serum, and correlated with asthma severity and zzso membrane zzso Nevertheless, the role of zzso on zzso cells remains to be zzso 

To evaluate whether zzso altered the zzso properties of zzso cells in asthma in zzso and ex zzso 

We enrolled 40 subjects with zzso 13 nonsmokers, and 16 zzso zzso cells were derived from zzso specimens obtained by either zzso zzso or zzso We assessed cell proliferation using zzso flow zzso and cell zzso signaling zzso using Western zzso cell migration using zzso wound healing, and zzso zzso and cell synthesis using zzso and Western zzso The involvement of zzso activated zzso zzso was evaluated using blocking zzso and dedicated zzso small hairpin zzso We also determined the zzso area and the zzso zzso ex zzso using zzso on zzso from subjects with asthma and control zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso increased zzso cell proliferation and migration through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The increased cell migration was higher in zzso cells of subjects with asthma than that of control zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was positively correlated with zzso mass in zzso 

This study indicates that zzso promotes zzso cell proliferation and migration through a zzso zzso
