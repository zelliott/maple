The zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal through zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso with high affinity and provides zzso The importance of the zzso anchor is not fully understood; however, zzso proteins cluster into zzso zzso structures that may represent highly specialized signaling zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso recruits zzso to zzso zzso after zzso stimulation and results in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using either zzso or soluble zzso results in zzso zzso but zzso zzso signaling events are markedly attenuated as are zzso differentiation and survival zzso zzso proper membrane zzso of zzso via interaction with a zzso zzso zzso is of fundamental importance in zzso zzso
