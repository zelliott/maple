Nuclear factor zzso zzso essential zzso zzso a regulatory component of the zzso zzso zzso complex, controls zzso zzso through its interaction with zzso zzso We show here that stimulation with zzso zzso and zzso zzso a rapid and transient recruitment of zzso into zzso structures that are anchored at the cell zzso These structures are enriched in activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which suggests that they serve as organizing centers for the zzso of zzso These zzso structures zzso with activated zzso receptors but not with activated zzso zzso We investigated the involvement of zzso zzso in the formation of these structures, using cells deficient in zzso zzso chains or linear zzso chain assembly complex zzso linear zzso Our results indicate that, unlike zzso zzso requires zzso and linear zzso chains to recruit zzso into zzso zzso Thus, different mechanisms are involved in the recruitment of zzso into zzso complexes, which appear to be essential for zzso zzso
