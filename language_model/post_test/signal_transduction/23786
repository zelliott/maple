zzso infection in plants often zzso systemic acquired resistance zzso which provides long-term protection against subsequent zzso A signal originating in the zzso organ is transported to the zzso zzso where it stimulates salicylic acid zzso zzso and zzso a mechanism that results in more robust zzso of defenses in response to subsequent pathogen zzso In recent years, several zzso that promote long-distance zzso signaling have been zzso However, the mechanism or mechanisms by which plants perceive and respond to the zzso signals are largely zzso Here, we show that, in zzso zzso the zzso zzso D zzso is required for responding to the zzso signals leading to the systemic zzso of zzso and enhancement of disease zzso Although the zzso zzso was competent in accumulating the zzso zzso it was unable to respond to the zzso signal that accumulates in zzso zzso of zzso leaves zzso with a zzso zzso Supporting zzso role in systemic zzso zzso we observed that zzso and zzso acid, two zzso that, in zzso plants, promote zzso systemic zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, were unable to promote zzso in the zzso zzso zzso also zzso in zzso where it functions to repress expression of the flowering zzso zzso zzso C zzso However, zzso analysis indicates that zzso function in zzso is independent of zzso
