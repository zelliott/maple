Our objective here was to perform a quantitative zzso study on a zzso human skin tissue to identify low- and high-dose zzso zzso zzso in a complex three-dimensional zzso Application of an zzso zzso strategy using sham and three radiation doses zzso 10, 200 zzso resulted in the identification of zzso unique zzso zzso analyses identified 176 zzso showing significant changes in response to radiation and radiation zzso zzso responsible for maintaining skin structural integrity including zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3) had altered zzso levels following exposure to both low and high doses of zzso zzso zzso of multiple sites in zzso zzso zzso coincided with altered zzso processing suggesting a role for zzso zzso in human zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso human skin system zzso a coordinated response to both low and high doses of zzso radiation involving multiple layers of the zzso zzso that serve to maintain tissue integrity and mitigate effects of radiation zzso
