Previous studies have shown that the extracts obtained from zzso zzso zzso and its main compound zzso zzso exhibit pronounced zzso effects, supporting the zzso use of this zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms underlying the zzso action of an zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso its zzso fraction zzso and its main compound zzso in spontaneously zzso rats zzso 

The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared with classical zzso in zzso zzso zzso The urinary volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH and density were estimated in the sample collected for zzso The zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso converting zzso zzso activity were measured in samples collected at the end of the experiment (seventh zzso Using pharmacological zzso or zzso we determine the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso oxygen species zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso similarly to zzso and also presented zzso zzso All groups presented both zzso zzso levels and zzso activity zzso Previous treatment with zzso (a zzso zzso zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso or zzso (a NO zzso zzso fully avoided the zzso effect of zzso In addition, the zzso treatment with zzso resulted in increased zzso levels of zzso and reducing zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso activity was significantly decreased by zzso 

Our results suggest that the mechanisms through zzso and extracts of zzso zzso increase zzso in zzso rats are mainly related to zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso oxide, besides an zzso effect on zzso
