Recent improvements in zzso Mass zzso zzso technology have expedited zzso discovery of zzso interactions by providing a capability of detecting protein complexes in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein interaction networks and protein complexes from zzso data are zzso Advances are required in developing robust and seamlessly integrated procedures for assessment of zzso interaction zzso mathematical representation of protein interaction networks, discovery of protein complexes and evaluation of their biological zzso 

A zzso but zzso framework for identifying protein complexes from zzso pull-down data is zzso It zzso interaction affinity between two proteins based on similarity of their zzso patterns derived from zzso zzso It zzso a protein interaction network by adopting a zzso threshold selection zzso Based on the network, it identifies protein complexes and zzso their core components using a zzso zzso It deploys a statistical evaluation procedure to assess biological relevance of each found zzso On zzso zzso pull-down data, the framework outperformed other more complicated schemes by at least zzso in zzso and identified 610 protein complexes with zzso zzso based on the enrichment in Gene zzso zzso zzso Manual examination of the complexes brought forward the hypotheses on cause of false zzso zzso zzso of different protein complexes as zzso by a common zzso zzso such as DNA, might be a source of false zzso zzso identification bias in pull-down technology, such as the zzso bias could result in false zzso
