We previously reported that zzso zzso stimulates the induction of heat shock protein 27 zzso through zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso the major zzso found in green tea, affects the induction of zzso in these cells and its zzso since it was previously reported that zzso including zzso suppresses bone zzso zzso significantly reduced the induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in a zzso manner between 10 and 30 zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso certainly zzso the induction of zzso in the zzso of these cells, and that zzso clearly suppressed its zzso However, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso was not affected by zzso By contrast, zzso markedly suppressed the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso suppresses the induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso via zzso of, not the zzso zzso zzso pathway, but of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso
