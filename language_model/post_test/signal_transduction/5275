zzso and age are important risk factors for cardiovascular zzso However, the signaling mechanism linking obesity with age-related vascular zzso is zzso Here we show that mice fed a high-fat diet show increased vascular zzso and vascular dysfunction compared to mice fed standard zzso and are more prone to peripheral and cerebral zzso All of these changes involve long-term zzso of the protein zzso zzso In contrast, mice with zzso obesity that lack zzso are resistant to vascular zzso zzso treatment of zzso obese mice or of transgenic mice with long-term zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso complex 2 and zzso prevents vascular zzso without altering body weight, and reduces the severity of limb necrosis and zzso zzso These findings indicate that long-term zzso of zzso signaling links zzso obesity with vascular zzso and cardiovascular zzso
