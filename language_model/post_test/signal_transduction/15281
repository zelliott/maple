Regulatory factor X zzso zzso regulate the zzso of genes necessary for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso are necessary for zzso signaling and regulation of the activity of the zzso regulators known as zzso zzso which are targets of zzso zzso Here, we describe an zzso mouse zzso with distinct zzso patterning defects in the zzso spinal zzso and zzso due to zzso Sonic zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso We find that zzso which encodes an zzso transport protein necessary for zzso is a direct zzso target of zzso and the decrease in its expression in the developing zzso and spinal zzso of zzso zzso zzso with defects in patterning and zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a regionally specific zzso regulator of zzso and thus is also a regionally specific zzso of zzso signaling during development of the central nervous zzso
