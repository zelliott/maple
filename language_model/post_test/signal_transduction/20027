zzso is a zzso zzso process zzso zzso stem cells differentiate toward a progressively committed zzso lineage through intermediate zzso Although several downstream signaling molecules have been identified that regulate zzso zzso the major regulators under conditions of stress remain poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to a family of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso mice, we show that lack of zzso in zzso zzso stress model results in enhanced recovery from zzso anemia as well as enhanced zzso stress zzso compared with control zzso zzso of zzso also results in enhanced survival, whereas zzso mice die rapidly in response to zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice is associated with reduced level of zzso oxygen zzso zzso transplantation studies revealed that enhanced stress zzso in zzso mice is stem cell zzso We show that zzso binds to zzso and regulates its stability and zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso and expression is significantly zzso Our findings reveal that zzso functions as a zzso regulator of zzso under conditions of zzso zzso These findings are expected to offer new perspectives on stress zzso and may provide a potential therapeutic target in human disease characterized by zzso
