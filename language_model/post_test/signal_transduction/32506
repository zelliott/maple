Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso stimulate release of calcium from internal sources and increase proliferation of zzso Swiss zzso zzso acting in a fundamentally different, protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was accompanied by an increase in the levels of zzso acid zzso a potent zzso for a variety of cell types, that may function as an zzso second zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced early increases in zzso zzso zzso levels that preceded the increase in PA zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso itself produced a more rapid increase in zzso thus suggesting that it may mediate the effects of zzso on PA zzso The concentration dependence for the formation of PA induced by zzso correlated with its effect on DNA zzso Similar to zzso zzso also zzso the activity of zzso D, although a significant effect was observed at a much lower zzso However, in contrast to previous reports with zzso zzso did not inhibit the PA zzso activity in cell zzso Thus, in addition to its effect on zzso of zzso zzso can increase the level of zzso most likely via zzso of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso mediates the effect of zzso on PA zzso in Swiss zzso zzso and may regulate cellular proliferation by affecting multiple zzso signaling zzso
