To study whether the signaling zzso is activated in the inflammatory reaction of cerebral zzso and its zzso The mice were randomly divided into sham group, zzso group and zzso group with different time points of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed the different expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso and zzso protein levels in each group at different time point after zzso Mice cerebral zzso was induced by zzso of common carotid arteries zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso could be inhibited by specific zzso binding protein to prevent zzso from interacting with its zzso We determined the result of zzso zzso and mice cerebral zzso injuries by Western zzso and evaluated zzso damage in zzso We also determined the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso and the expression of zzso protein by Western zzso zzso binding zzso receptors before zzso was zzso There was distinct difference among each group respecting zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso protein showed clear difference as zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso activated by zzso may be involved in the mechanism of zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso
