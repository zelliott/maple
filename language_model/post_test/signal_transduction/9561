zzso zzso are the zzso cells of the zzso zzso nervous zzso wrapping zzso in zzso zzso to ensure effective transmission of neural zzso The regulation of OL development, from precursor to mature zzso cell, is controlled by a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso spinal zzso contains signals that inhibit OL development, possibly to prevent premature and zzso precursor zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways have been identified as zzso spinal zzso signals with overlapping zzso activity, and both have similar zzso effects on OL zzso Both these pathways feature prominently in many zzso processes and zzso events after injury, and they are known to interact in complex zzso zzso and synergistic manners in many developing zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in OL development, however, has not been extensively zzso In the present study, we examine the relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We use pharmacological and genetic zzso to show that both zzso and zzso will inhibit OL differentiation in zzso We also show that when the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso neither zzso nor zzso have zzso effects on OL zzso In contrast, zzso the zzso zzso zzso does not alter the actions of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to exert its effects on OL development, but not vice versa, suggesting that zzso signals upstream of zzso
