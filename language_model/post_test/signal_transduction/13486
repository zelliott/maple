Human zzso zzso possess at least two distinct mechanisms for the zzso of zzso zzso one is independent of and the other is dependent on products of the respiratory zzso zzso zzso is not induced by exposure to the zzso target but requires additional stimulation by zzso zzso or zzso The purpose of the present work is to zzso the signal zzso pathways underlying these two distinct zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso targets and zzso zzso production were inhibited by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, neither zzso nor zzso zzso generation induced by stimulation with zzso targets alone was affected by either of these zzso even when zzso zzso was increased to generate equal levels of zzso and zzso zzso as that observed with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso target stimulation of zzso showed marked zzso in zzso of zzso activity from the zzso to the plasma zzso These data indicate that a zzso for zzso of the respiratory burst which is dependent on protein zzso C is involved in zzso amplification of zzso zzso stimulation of zzso not only zzso zzso zzso and generation of zzso zzso but also changes the signaling zzso for these two zzso functions from zzso to zzso In this regard, zzso stimulation zzso two pathways for zzso of zzso by zzso
