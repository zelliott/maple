zzso signaling is essential for the development of zzso zzso Indeed, membrane traffic is required for the correct sorting and function of receptors and zzso In the past decades, many genetic screens performed in zzso zzso and zzso have been crucial to identify the role of zzso traffic in zzso In this review, we discuss recent work that led to the identification of zzso a sorting zzso for zzso and of the zzso a protein complex required for the recycling of zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso
