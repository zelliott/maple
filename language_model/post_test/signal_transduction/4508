zzso is an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso T cells are biased toward zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that lungs from zzso mice showed increased numbers of zzso and zzso zzso This was not because zzso T cells are biased toward zzso zzso In fact, fewer zzso T cells differentiated into zzso cells in zzso due to high zzso zzso Rather, zzso differentiation was increased in zzso mice due to increased numbers of zzso zzso zzso levels in mice that lacked both zzso and zzso were similar to zzso controls, and these mice had fewer zzso cells in their zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso such as that observed in zzso mice, can increase zzso differentiation by recruiting zzso zzso into secondary zzso zzso and zzso This may explain why zzso cells develop within an ongoing zzso inflammatory zzso
