zzso or excessive exposure to zzso leads to zzso damages in the brain regions, including zzso We reported that zzso medium zzso protected the zzso of the primary zzso cultures against the zzso zzso zzso added to the cultures resulted in a significant number of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso labeling was suppressed as for zzso zzso To delineate the molecular basis underlying the zzso of zzso we assessed the zzso of zzso and zzso signal pathways in response to zzso zzso zzso Western zzso test revealed that zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso grown in zzso medium supplemented with zzso and 500 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the increase of zzso and zzso levels was much pronounced and the time course of zzso was altered in zzso suggesting that both signaling pathways might participate in zzso zzso Furthermore, the selective inhibitor of zzso rather than zzso blocked the zzso activity against zzso in zzso zzso In zzso our data showed that zzso had a potent zzso effect in cultured zzso zzso signal pathway, but not zzso was involved in the protective activity against the zzso zzso
