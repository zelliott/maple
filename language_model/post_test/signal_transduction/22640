zzso in Met have been identified in human cancer, and we have previously shown that these zzso zzso the zzso activity of this zzso zzso zzso thereby unleashing its zzso zzso Signal zzso via wild type Met has been shown to require the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso which functions to enhance zzso activity, and zzso which provides zzso sites for signaling zzso and in the present investigation we examine the importance of these zzso for signaling via zzso activated zzso We find that zzso zzso introduced into a zzso Met zzso circumvent the normally stringent requirement for zzso zzso and do so in a largely zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso introduced into a zzso zzso zzso form of Met zzso zzso facilitate its zzso and zzso activity in the absence of zzso zzso We also find that zzso zzso allow a zzso Met zzso to overcome the requirement for the zzso zzso in a manner which is largely zzso These findings support a model zzso zzso zzso stabilize an active zzso of the Met zzso via a mechanism which can function independently of zzso zzso and suggest that signaling via wild type Met and zzso activated Met may proceed through distinct zzso
