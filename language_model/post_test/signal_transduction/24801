zzso zzso pathways have not been investigated in melanoma zzso Two different zzso zzso zzso pathways are presently known in other cell zzso zzso direct zzso of zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso both leading to subsequent zzso zzso In the present study, five of 11 melanoma cell populations were shown to release zzso c from zzso which activates zzso and finally results in DNA fragmentation upon treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, this zzso zzso was not activated in the remaining six melanoma cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso of melanoma cells to zzso cell death was clearly correlated with zzso zzso Our results are in line with a zzso upstream of zzso zzso c release in resistant zzso
