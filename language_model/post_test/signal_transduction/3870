zzso growth factor zzso and zzso are zzso in human pancreatic zzso In this study the role of zzso in human pancreatic cancer was investigated, as zzso has a classical signal sequence for zzso not found in zzso or zzso Northern zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts in both normal and zzso pancreatic zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts levels were increased zzso and zzso in the zzso by comparison with normal zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso localized in the cancer cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso protein was present in zzso medium of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the growth of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cells expressed the zzso zzso of the type I zzso zzso the preferred zzso zzso for zzso These observations suggest that zzso may participate in zzso and zzso pathways promoting pancreatic cancer cell growth in zzso
