The zzso zzso zzso a member of the G zzso zzso family, contains a relatively large zzso zzso domain, accounting for about half of the zzso and responsible for high affinity zzso zzso and a standard zzso portion with connecting zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and the other two zzso hormone zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso contain an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso in the zzso domain separated by only a few zzso acid zzso from the beginning of zzso zzso zzso In view of the zzso nature of this region in the three zzso hormone receptors and preliminary data in the literature on the importance of zzso and zzso in signal zzso we undertook a systematic investigation of all 10 zzso acid zzso because this region may function as a switch or trigger for zzso zzso binding to the zzso domain with a zzso change of the zzso zzso half of the zzso to activate G zzso particularly zzso A total of 36 single, zzso and multiple zzso as well as two zzso of zzso were prepared and characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso 26 expressed on the cell surface in sufficient numbers that quantitative assessments could be made of human zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso binding to intact cells, although binding could be detected after zzso of the zzso zzso of the other nine zzso acid zzso that did not interfere with zzso folding or trafficking had no significant effect on zzso binding zzso however, replacements of zzso zzso and zzso resulted in diminished zzso especially for the two zzso zzso An interesting observation was made in which replacement of zzso with Ala or zzso while having no profound change on zzso function, could overcome to some extent limited expression of replacements at positions 332 and/or zzso thus permitting a more definitive analysis of zzso Replacement of the zzso sequence with zzso prevents zzso whereas deletion of all 10 zzso and deletion of zzso prevents functional expression at the cell zzso Thus, this zzso sequence in the zzso hormones is required for proper zzso trafficking, and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and to a limited extent, zzso are important in zzso signaling but not zzso zzso
