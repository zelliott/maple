The mechanisms of zzso effects on zzso transport and metabolism were investigated in human zzso Human zzso obtained from surgical zzso were differentiated in zzso into zzso and the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and the involved signaling pathways were zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso without altering cell viability and oxygen zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso expression and protein content but increased zzso zzso expression and cellular protein content, leading to increased zzso protein content in the plasma zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso were enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso however, reduced zzso zzso expression and stimulation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso without impairment of cell zzso is crucial for zzso increase in zzso protein content and zzso zzso in human zzso
