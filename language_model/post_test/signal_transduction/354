zzso zzso stimulation was reported to increase the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso colonies in a zzso colony zzso using cells from mouse zzso Here, we investigated the expression of zzso the zzso zzso in the cells from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso proper zzso zzso in zzso population in the mouse zzso expressed zzso Using liquid cultures, we found that zzso from zzso and zzso proliferated in the presence of zzso and stem cell factor zzso whereas their numbers were maintained by zzso zzso In contrast, proliferation induced by zzso and zzso was not observed in zzso of the bone zzso Interestingly, examination of zzso from the fetal liver indicated that their zzso activity was intermediate between that of early embryonic and adult zzso These data suggest that early embryonic zzso switch to adult zzso in the zzso Furthermore, the proliferation of early embryonic zzso was suppressed by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be replaced by zzso active signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso for the zzso Thus, zzso and zzso mediate at least a part of the zzso signal in early embryonic zzso
