zzso efficiency of zzso kinetic zzso depend on factors such as the overall species population, the total number of zzso and the average number of zzso interactions or connectivity in a zzso These size measures of the network model can have a significant impact on zzso zzso In this study, two zzso biological networks are used to compare the size zzso efficiencies of two popular and zzso distinct zzso kinetic simulation zzso random zzso method of zzso and Bray zzso and the zzso zzso as implemented using the zzso method zzso The zzso zzso efficiencies of these two zzso respectively, scale with the square of the total species population and the zzso of the total number of active zzso The two zzso models considered are the size zzso model zzso a four compartment reaction model for a signal zzso network involving receptors with single zzso binding sites, and the variable connectivity model zzso a single compartment model where receptors possess multiple zzso binding zzso The zzso has fixed species connectivity while the connectivity between species in zzso increases with the number of zzso zzso For zzso we find that, as the total species population is increased over four orders of zzso the zzso zzso performs significantly better than FB for all three zzso compartment models zzso In contrast, for zzso we find that as the overall species population decreases while the number of zzso sites increases zzso an increase in network zzso there exists a crossover point where the zzso demands of the zzso method exceed that of the zzso
