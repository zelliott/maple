Since the early 1990s, DNA zzso repeat expansions have been found to be the cause in an ever increasing number of genetic zzso zzso A subset of this large family of genetic diseases has the expansion of a zzso DNA zzso in the open reading frame of a coding zzso The result of this DNA expansion is the expression of expanded zzso zzso acid repeat tracts in the affected zzso leading to the term, zzso zzso which is applied to this zzso of zzso To date, nine distinct genes are known to be linked to zzso diseases, including zzso disease, zzso Disease and zzso muscular zzso or Kennedy's zzso Most of the zzso diseases are characterized clinically as zzso zzso Here we discuss recent successes and zzso in zzso disease research, comparing these different diseases with a common genetic flaw at the level of molecular biology and early drug design for a family of diseases where many new research tools for these genetic disorders have been zzso zzso disease research has successfully used interdisciplinary collaborative efforts, zzso multiple mouse genetic models and advanced tools of pharmaceutical industry research to potentially serve as the zzso model of therapeutic research and development for rare neurodegenerative zzso
