zzso syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso disease causing zzso zzso associated with a complex syndrome that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene zzso in type 1 zzso encodes a protein associated with the base of the zzso in zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso studies in cell culture have reported conflicting results on the role of zzso in zzso Here we show that loss of function of mouse zzso results in an accurate model of human zzso with structural abnormalities in the neural tube, zzso zzso limb zzso bone development and the kidney that mirror the human zzso In contrast to cell culture studies, loss of zzso in zzso does not interfere with zzso zzso of zzso zzso bodies but rather leads to defective zzso formation in most, but not all, zzso Analysis of patterning in the neural tube and the limb demonstrates altered zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso some zzso zzso although both zzso show an expansion of the domain of response to zzso zzso unlike the zzso seen in other zzso with zzso zzso Other defects in the skull, zzso rib cage and long bones are likely to be the result of the disruption of zzso zzso and the basis of defects in the liver and kidney require further zzso Thus the disruption of zzso signaling can explain many, but not all, of the defects caused by loss of zzso
