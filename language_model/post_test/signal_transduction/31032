zzso dysfunction is a major consequence of septic shock and contributes to the high mortality of zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso significantly increased survival in a zzso model of zzso zzso and puncture zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso on cardiac dysfunction in zzso septic zzso zzso was administered to zzso mice 1 h before induction of zzso zzso surgically operated mice served as zzso zzso function was significantly decreased 6 h after zzso zzso compared with sham zzso In contrast, zzso administration prevented zzso cardiac zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso has been implicated as a major factor in zzso zzso and cardiac dysfunction during septic zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with sham zzso zzso administration, however, prevented zzso zzso expression and decreased zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso decreases in zzso zzso and zzso levels in the zzso of septic zzso These data suggest that zzso treatment zzso cardiovascular dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso administration also activates the zzso zzso pathway, decreases zzso zzso zzso and reduces zzso zzso
