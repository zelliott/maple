The zzso of zzso zzso mice, and human zzso zzso mice that zzso zzso indicate that zzso is a response regulator of zzso surface zzso zzso To further characterize the function of zzso during zzso zzso zzso immune responses to a zzso type 1 zzso zzso a zzso type 2 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed in zzso and zzso zzso B cells from zzso mice differentiated and underwent zzso zzso switching in zzso in response to zzso and zzso In zzso zzso mice generated zzso responses to zzso and zzso that were dramatically lower than those of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso response to zzso was significantly greater in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso but were zzso to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is not required for zzso differentiation and zzso switching but serves as a response regulator which zzso zzso zzso Since zzso responses to both zzso and zzso zzso were similarly affected by zzso in zzso zzso these differences are most likely to result from intrinsic changes in zzso function rather than from the selective disruption of zzso interactions with T zzso
