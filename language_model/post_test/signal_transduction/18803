The establishment of the zzso between zzso plants and zzso bacteria depends on the production of zzso zzso signals (the zzso zzso that are specifically recognized by roots of the host zzso In zzso zzso specific recognition of zzso zzso and its zzso factors requires the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of this protein contains three tandem zzso motifs zzso a short zzso domain that is implicated in zzso or zzso binding in various bacterial or zzso zzso zzso We report here the zzso modeling of the three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso based on the structure of a zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso system zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protein is highly zzso probably with both zzso and complex zzso Surface analysis and zzso calculations performed on the models of the three zzso were used to predict the most favored binding modes for zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model can be proposed where the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso binds in similar orientation to the three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is not expected to interfere with zzso factor binding in this zzso
