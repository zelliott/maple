zzso growth factor zzso is established as an zzso of signaling events critical for zzso and zzso formation during early zzso zzso However, less is known about the role zzso signaling plays in zzso zzso Here, we show for the first time that zzso genes are induced when zzso signaling is blocked in animal cap zzso This block of zzso signaling is also responsible for a significant enhancement of zzso gene expression in animal cap zzso that are injected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or treated with zzso however, neural and zzso gene expression is zzso zzso with these results, the injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expands zzso cell fate boundaries while zzso treatment dramatically reduces zzso in whole zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso of zzso signaling promotes zzso formation, whereas the presence of active zzso signaling is necessary for zzso zzso
