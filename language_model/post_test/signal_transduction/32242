Many bacterial pathogens produce zzso signal factor zzso zzso sensing zzso signals in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Previous work on zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso system is involved in sensing and responding to zzso signals, but little is known in other zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso acid zzso zzso controls the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level through a zzso protein zzso which contains zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the same zzso as zzso including swarming zzso zzso formation, and zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso could be rescued by in trans expression of zzso or its zzso domain that functions as a zzso zzso zzso is shown to bind to the zzso domain of zzso with high affinity and stimulates its zzso activity through induction of zzso zzso zzso Our work presents a unique and widely zzso zzso signal zzso that directly links the signal perception to zzso turnover in regulation of bacterial zzso
