zzso zzso zzso alters smooth muscle zzso zzso generally produces a sustained zzso of zzso In zzso this effect of zzso is poorly understood although zzso is frequently observed in patients with pulmonary zzso This study was designed to examine the effect of zzso on both the zzso contraction of isolated rings and the zzso calcium concentration zzso using zzso in freshly isolated cells from rat zzso smooth zzso zzso were obtained from both chronically hypoxic rats maintained in a zzso chamber zzso zzso for 15 days and zzso zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of airway smooth muscle to zzso zzso This increase observed in the mechanical activity zzso of zzso producing 50% of the zzso force zzso in zzso from zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso was related to an increase in the sensitivity of zzso zzso release zzso zzso in cells from zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso It was concluded that chronic zzso alters calcium zzso in airway smooth muscle cells, which was associated with an increase in airway responsiveness in zzso Whether a similar phenomenon contributes to zzso zzso in chronically zzso patients remains to be zzso
