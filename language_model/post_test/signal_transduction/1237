zzso is a network alignment and search tool for comparing protein interaction networks across species to identify protein pathways and complexes that have been zzso by zzso The basic method searches for zzso alignments between pairs of protein interaction zzso for which proteins of the first path are paired with putative zzso occurring in the same order in the second zzso This technique discriminates between zzso and zzso interactions and allows for functional zzso of protein interaction pathways based on similarity to the network of another, zzso zzso zzso is now available at zzso as a zzso zzso In this zzso the user specifies a short protein interaction path for query against a target zzso interaction network selected from a network zzso zzso returns a ranked list of matching paths from the target network along with a zzso view of these paths and the overlap among zzso Target zzso interaction networks are currently available for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Just as zzso enables rapid comparison of protein sequences between zzso tools such as zzso are enabling comparative zzso at the network zzso
