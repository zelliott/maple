zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso by binding to zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso and signaling proteins and is zzso by zzso zzso a calcium regulated zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated in more detail the zzso of the zzso zzso domain during zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso Our data show that zzso is zzso in all three zzso The time course of zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso depends on the way zzso are activated and on the complete zzso of zzso zzso with a maximum of zzso of zzso zzso obtained when zzso is zzso Furthermore, our results also show that the zzso zzso is mainly distributed in the zzso soluble zzso indicating its inability to bind to the zzso Interestingly, in the absence of zzso or following zzso of zzso binding to zzso there is a reduction in the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso domain by zzso zzso might be an important step regulating the link between the zzso and zzso during zzso zzso and that zzso could function as a zzso for the complete zzso of zzso by zzso
