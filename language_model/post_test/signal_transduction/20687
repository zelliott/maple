The zzso zzso zzso activity zzso of the insulin zzso zzso plays an essential role in insulin zzso Thus, zzso of zzso might be an important element in the states of insulin zzso A zzso rat zzso zzso zzso acting as an inhibitor of zzso has been zzso In search of the human zzso of zzso we isolated a zzso clone from a human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis reveals identity with the zzso product of a human gene zzso zzso a serum zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso unknown zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates a zzso zzso in human liver and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso from human serum, specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso also zzso both zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the association of zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso but does not affect zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso does not compete with insulin for binding to zzso Finally, the action of alpha zzso is specific toward the zzso its effect does not extend to zzso growth zzso zzso Our results allow us to assign a zzso function for human alpha zzso namely regulation of insulin action at the zzso zzso
