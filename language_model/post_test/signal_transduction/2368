Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family play important roles both in normal growth zzso differentiation and in the genesis and progression of human zzso In the present study, we zzso distinct zzso zzso signals zzso by the zzso receptors zzso and zzso In zzso cell systems, we demonstrate that zzso transformation by zzso zzso is dependent on zzso of zzso active zzso In cells zzso zzso and zzso however, both zzso significantly contribute to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso is no zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in a panel of human zzso cell lines revealed mainly zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso is also zzso to various zzso Evidence for zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso indicates relevance of zzso expression patterns of these zzso and zzso zzso receptors in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and definition can be demonstrated further by distinct time courses of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which are induced by distinct zzso zzso via differential binding to zzso versus zzso In concert, these mechanisms of signal zzso may be decisive for the diverse biological activities of zzso in different cell zzso
