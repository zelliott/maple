zzso Ras and activated forms of the zzso protein zzso share similar abilities to alter cell zzso However, in contrast to zzso we found previously that zzso fails to activate the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso must zzso zzso zzso to regulate cell zzso In this study, we determined that zzso interacts strongly with some zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with other Ras small middle zzso zzso In addition, library screening identified novel zzso zzso We also determined that zzso similar to zzso mediates zzso of zzso zzso We then examined if zzso a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, or zzso are zzso for zzso signaling and cell proliferation in zzso zzso We found that zzso of full-length zzso reduced the focus forming activity of activated zzso Furthermore, expression of activated zzso but not zzso enhanced zzso loading on zzso In fact, zzso attenuated zzso zzso small middle zzso zzso In contrast, like zzso expression of activated zzso resulted in membrane zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso activity zzso with zzso focus zzso Finally, unlike zzso zzso did not activate the zzso small zzso indicating that Ras may not activate zzso by zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso but not zzso is an important zzso of cell proliferation by zzso
