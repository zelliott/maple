The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to correlate with adverse clinical outcome in human zzso in zzso However, the question of how this survival network can be successfully targeted to restore the sensitivity of zzso to zzso induction has not yet been zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso by zzso broadly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to both death zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient to restore zzso zzso zzso significantly enhances zzso triggered by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or several zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a highly synergistic zzso In addition, zzso zzso with TRAIL or zzso to suppress colony formation, thus also showing a strong effect on long-term zzso Similarly, genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso by zzso interference zzso zzso zzso cells for zzso or zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso or genetic blockade of zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso fails to enhance zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso pathways reveals that zzso zzso acts in concert with TRAIL or zzso to trigger zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso by zzso zzso primary cultured zzso cells obtained from surgical specimens to zzso or zzso cell zzso By showing that zzso zzso broadly zzso zzso cells for zzso our findings provide the rationale for using zzso zzso in combination regimens to enhance zzso or zzso zzso in zzso
