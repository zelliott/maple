The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which upon zzso binding to zzso receptors activates zzso zzso to produce the second zzso zzso constitutes one of the zzso signal zzso molecules that have been studied in much zzso Over the past few years, however, genetic as well as zzso approaches have led to a range of novel insights into the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso its alternative protein products and its regulation by zzso zzso which leads to zzso parental zzso expression of the various zzso Here, we zzso the major characteristics of this complex gene locus and describe the zzso roles of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and adult stages as defined by genetic zzso zzso and potentially zzso functions of the two proteins in the regulation of energy zzso and metabolism have been identified in zzso and zzso zzso mice, which are zzso by obesity and zzso zzso A comparison of findings in mice with symptoms of the corresponding human genetic disease zzso zzso zzso indicates highly zzso functions as well as unresolved zzso zzso
