zzso zzso that is, seizure disorders that do not respond to currently available therapies, are difficult, often zzso neurological zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in some intractable zzso including zzso syndrome zzso zzso but little progress has been forthcoming in zzso Here we examine a zzso model for intractable zzso the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso that resembles zzso syndrome in some aspects zzso et zzso zzso In particular, we identify zzso zzso that interact with zzso seizure zzso and seizure zzso We describe one zzso zzso named zzso zzso The zzso gene normally encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that reduces the severity of several zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene normally encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso is an unexpected but promising new target for seizure zzso
