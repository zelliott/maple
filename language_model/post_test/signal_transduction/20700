Our recent study demonstrated the direct involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso in the regulation of DNA synthesis by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso Since zzso has been reported to possess dual signal zzso systems zzso and zzso zzso C zzso present study was performed to characterize the involvement of zzso signal zzso system in the regulation of DNA synthesis by zzso in these zzso Human zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid increase in zzso zzso zzso followed by return to the zzso level within 1 zzso zzso with zzso M zzso or zzso M zzso zzso of calcium release from zzso calcium store, significantly blocked the zzso increase in zzso but did not affect the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly blocked the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso with zzso M zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso significantly blocked the zzso of DNA synthesis by zzso Present study indicates that in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso is coupled to the regulation of DNA synthesis by zzso in zzso
