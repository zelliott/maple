Due to their capacity to differentiate into zzso memory cells, zzso T cells are able to resolve subsequent infections faster than during the primary zzso Among other factors, zzso T cells play a crucial role during primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso However, the timing and mechanisms by which they influence zzso T cells may differ in primary and secondary zzso Here, we demonstrate that during both primary and secondary zzso virus infection, zzso T cells are necessary to promote zzso zzso zzso While zzso T cells contributed to memory zzso zzso development, they were even more important during memory recall responses during challenge, as absence of zzso T cells during challenge resulted in markedly decreased proliferation and increased zzso zzso help during primary and secondary responses was zzso via zzso zzso with zzso being an integral part of that zzso As opposed to primary zzso zzso responses where only a combination of zzso zzso signaling and provision of zzso could substitute for zzso help, zzso zzso triggering alone was sufficient to rescue memory zzso zzso responses in absence of zzso help in the context of zzso virus zzso
