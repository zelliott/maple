zzso is a zzso of zzso which is zzso and accumulated by zzso in zzso This substance is present in zzso quantities in all brain regions investigated as well as in several peripheral zzso zzso zzso releases zzso into the zzso space in a zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are present only in zzso with a restricted specific distribution in the zzso zzso and zzso structures of rat brain (the zzso in general, zzso bulbs and zzso frontal cortex, zzso zzso A9, A10 and zzso zzso of these receptors with low amounts of zzso zzso in general zzso in zzso structures with a reduction of zzso zzso However, in the zzso and the frontal cortex, it seems that zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso and an increase in zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso effects of zzso are blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso while some others are strongly attenuated by zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso freely into the brain when administered zzso or zzso This is a unique situation for a zzso with zzso properties in the zzso Thus, the zzso concentration in brain easily can be increased more than 100 zzso Under these conditions, zzso receptors are saturated and probably zzso and zzso It is unlikely that zzso receptors could be zzso directly by zzso Most probably, zzso is released in part under the control of zzso receptors in specific pathways expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors might be specifically zzso by the zzso formed via the metabolism of zzso in zzso In animals and man, these zzso and zzso zzso induce zzso zzso (which follows the first phase of zzso terminal zzso a strong sedation with zzso and some zzso changes with zzso zzso It is presumed that, under pathological conditions zzso failure, alcoholic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso synthesis or degradation in the peripheral organ is modified and zzso increased zzso levels which could interfere with the normal brain zzso This pathological status could benefit from treatments with zzso and/or zzso receptors zzso Nevertheless, the regulating properties of the zzso zzso system on the zzso pathways are a cause for the recent interest in synthetic zzso acting specifically at zzso receptors and devoid of any role as zzso precursor of zzso in zzso
