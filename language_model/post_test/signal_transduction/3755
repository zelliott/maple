zzso and zzso both are zzso zzso zzso binding zzso with zzso active in cellular membrane trafficking and zzso in zzso signal zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso physically and functionally interacts with zzso zzso in neuroendocrine zzso cells, on stimulation with zzso hormone and zzso The interaction appears to be of high affinity and zzso on zzso zzso activity, zzso by the zzso zzso domain and regulated both by the zzso zzso and by zzso zzso Thus, zzso may target particular sites for zzso zzso by sharing zzso with the alpha zzso of zzso in neuroendocrine zzso
