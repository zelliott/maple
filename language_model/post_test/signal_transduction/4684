zzso is the common name for the three zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso formerly known as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to have zzso activities; however, the zzso function of these zzso remains zzso zzso of zzso by zzso implies its possible involvement in innate immune responses in the zzso We observed that, of the three zzso zzso human zzso express high levels of zzso zzso zzso expression was dramatically induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Surprisingly, the zzso protein was released by cells treated with zzso but remained zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced cell death and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso blocked zzso release of zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the gene zzso was dependent on zzso but not zzso zzso This demonstrates that the pathways leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso branch after zzso This divergence of the pathways allows the cells to enter a state of de zzso protein synthesis before committing to zzso Overall, our observations suggest that zzso may be an zzso that signals the cause, zzso viral infection, of cell zzso
