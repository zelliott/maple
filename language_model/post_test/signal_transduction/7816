The signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso zzso factors, which form zzso when activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor receptors as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, where they bind to specific zzso elements in the promoters of target zzso thereby inducing unique gene expression programs often in association with other zzso regulatory zzso The functional consequence of different zzso proteins zzso varies, as their target genes play diverse roles in normal zzso functions, including growth, zzso differentiation and zzso Certain activated zzso have been implicated in human zzso albeit only few studies have focused into their role in lung zzso zzso evidence zzso their molecular zzso and complex zzso regulation, rendering some of them appealing targets for lung cancer treatment with new developing zzso
