One important component of the zzso communication that occurs during zzso patterning is zzso zzso In particular, the zzso of the tail in zzso zzso zzso both requires, and can be initiated at zzso stages by, specific regulation of zzso signaling zzso in resting membrane potential and a subsequent change in sodium content of zzso zzso Although standing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso concentration can provide zzso guidance and other zzso cues, these zzso parameters must be zzso into zzso responses within zzso A number of mechanisms have been described for linking slow zzso changes to gene zzso but recent data on the importance of zzso regulation for zzso suggest a novel zzso that zzso zzso link zzso flows to influx of small molecules needed to modify zzso zzso Here, we briefly review the data on zzso in zzso tail zzso present a technique for convenient zzso of zzso potential in zzso that does not require zzso show zzso of zzso in zzso by manipulation of zzso and present new data in the zzso tail consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso may link zzso zzso modification with upstream changes in zzso zzso
