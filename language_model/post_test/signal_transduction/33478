The zzso tissue inflammation accompanying obesity has important consequences for zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso tissue zzso plays an important role for zzso the effect of inflammation on zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso E zzso is highly expressed in zzso tissue where it plays an important role in modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso mass, and zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso reduces zzso zzso and the current studies were undertaken to evaluate the molecular mechanism for this zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso gene expression required an intact nuclear factor zzso binding site at zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at this site completely eliminated zzso regulation of an zzso gene zzso zzso treatment activated binding of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Two structurally distinct zzso of zzso complex zzso or zzso zzso the zzso effect on the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that treatment of zzso with zzso led to increased binding of zzso zzso and decreased binding of zzso and zzso to this region of the zzso promoter in living zzso The key role played by increased zzso binding was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso expression using small interference zzso completely eliminated zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These results establish the molecular link between zzso tissue inflammation and zzso gene expression in zzso The suppression of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso tissue milieu associated with obesity will have important downstream effects on zzso zzso turnover and zzso
