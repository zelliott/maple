Unlike zzso cellular zzso such as zzso zzso whose structure has recently been determined in a zzso zzso zzso II from contracting muscle filaments necessarily spends most of its time detached from zzso By using zzso and sea zzso sources, however, we have now obtained similar zzso atomic structures for muscle zzso heads zzso The significance of the hallmark closed zzso zzso in these crystal structures is supported here by zzso zzso These structures reveal how different duty ratios, and hence cellular functions, of the zzso zzso may be accounted for, in part, on the basis of detailed differences in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso position of switch II turns out to be unique for zzso zzso The overall arrangements of zzso in the motor are relatively zzso in each of the known zzso states, and we explore zzso the zzso of these zzso
