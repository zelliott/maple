zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed as an zzso and free radical scavenging zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso mediates its therapeutic effects are zzso In this paper, we investigated the capability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the possible underlying mechanisms in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso induced zzso expression both at the level of zzso and protein in zzso zzso manners in zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso The pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso regulated zzso and zzso did not block zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso was initiated by zzso indicating the involvement of this zzso in the observed zzso zzso increased the nuclear zzso of zzso factor 2 zzso and enhanced its binding to the zzso response zzso zzso of zzso synthesis by small interfering zzso molecules subsequently inhibited zzso expression induced by zzso indicating zzso role in inducing zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso these findings, the present study identified zzso as a novel zzso of zzso expression and identified the underlying mechanisms involved in this zzso
