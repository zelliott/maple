The composition of zzso proteins changes during lineage zzso altering cellular responses to their zzso The changes that characterize maturation of early neural stem cells zzso remain poorly zzso Here we use mass zzso cell surface capture technology to profile the cell surface of early zzso and demonstrate functional requirements for several enriched zzso zzso zzso arise from embryonic stem cells upon removal of zzso growth zzso zzso while definitive zzso arise from primitive zzso upon zzso removal and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is sufficient for the initial exclusion of definitive zzso from zzso zzso while zzso signaling limits progeny of primitive zzso Furthermore, we zzso zzso in primitive zzso survival signaling and zzso as being required for zzso zzso This work zzso several key zzso of zzso function whose relevance is confirmed on zzso populations and identifies a host of other candidates that may regulate zzso
