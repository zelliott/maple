zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso and zzso have well-established roles in promoting the maintenance of zzso embryonic stem cells zzso In contrast, the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulated target of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling promotes zzso by suppressing zzso activity and restricting its access to nuclear zzso such as zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and nucleus in zzso but accumulates in the zzso in an inactive form due to zzso nuclear export and zzso zzso When zzso signaling declines following leukemia zzso factor withdrawal, active zzso accumulates in the nucleus, where it targets zzso through zzso on zzso 58 zzso promoting its zzso zzso nuclear zzso of active zzso promotes zzso but this process is blocked by a zzso form of zzso zzso that zzso zzso by zzso This novel mechanism explains how zzso promotes zzso by regulating the activity and zzso of zzso This zzso zzso on zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso
