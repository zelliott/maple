The zzso zzso is a novel protein that mediates the zzso of zzso channels by zzso drugs through a unique zzso mechanism depending neither on G proteins nor protein zzso The present study investigated zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso receptors modulated zzso zzso channels zzso or zzso in different ways in the presence and absence of zzso Association between zzso channels and zzso receptors was demonstrated by zzso These results indicate a novel mechanism of signal zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso accessibility experiments suggested a structure for the zzso zzso with two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso effects on channels suggest that zzso receptors serve as auxiliary zzso to zzso zzso channels with distinct functional zzso depending on the presence or absence of zzso
