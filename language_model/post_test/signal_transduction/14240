zzso zzso is one of the most common birth zzso Both environmental and genetic factors are involved in this zzso Here, we investigated the function of zzso in proliferation and zzso of mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso at both the zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso cells containing zzso small hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was significantly increased in zzso cells of zzso gene zzso Finally, the expression of zzso was markedly reduced in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso signaling zzso was involved in the zzso of cell proliferation and zzso induced by zzso zzso Thus, our findings reveal that zzso regulates proliferation and zzso of zzso cells at least partially through the zzso zzso signaling zzso
