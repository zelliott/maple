To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso in protecting zzso zzso subjected to zzso zzso and to study the role of zzso regulated protein zzso zzso in zzso such zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso operation was performed on zzso zzso mice to establish left zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso mouse hearts were mounted onto the zzso zzso system and randomly divided into 4 equal group: zzso zzso group undergoing stable zzso for 30 zzso zzso for 30 zzso and zzso for 120 zzso (an zzso zzso to cause zzso zzso zzso injury, zzso zzso group undergoing zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso totally 3 cycles zzso before zzso for 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso group undergoing zzso of zzso zzso buffer with zzso zzso for 15 zzso and zzso of zzso buffer without zzso at the beginning of zzso and zzso zzso + zzso group undergoing 3 cycles of zzso and zzso of zzso buffer with zzso zzso for 15 zzso at the beginning of zzso zzso examination was conducted 120 zzso after zzso to measure the left zzso zzso pressure zzso left zzso end zzso pressure zzso zzso uprising zzso of left zzso pressure zzso and minimal uprising zzso of left zzso pressure zzso After the zzso procedure the zzso of the left zzso was isolated to detect the zzso size zzso Western zzso was used to detect the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso levels of the zzso group were (85 zzso 4) zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both significantly higher than those of the zzso group zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso Compared with the zzso group, the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group were all significantly higher, the protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso index were significantly lower (all P zzso zzso and the IS was smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso showed no effects on the zzso zzso However, the results of the zzso + zzso group showed that in the first 15 zzso of zzso addition of zzso reversed all changes observed in the zzso group and eliminated the zzso protection by increasing IS to a level similar to that in the zzso zzso 

zzso has protective effect in zzso zzso with zzso injury in zzso zzso signaling zzso is involved in the protection of zzso by regulating the zzso zzso
