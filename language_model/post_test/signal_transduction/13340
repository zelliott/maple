Plant zzso released in response to feeding insects are known to attract enemies of the feeding zzso In this study, egg deposition by a zzso insect was shown to induce a zzso plant to emit zzso that attract egg zzso zzso from zzso of zzso zzso laden with egg masses of the pine zzso zzso zzso attracts the zzso egg zzso zzso zzso zzso released from pine zzso without zzso eggs are not zzso zzso by the zzso onto pine needles zzso not only a local response in pine needles laden with eggs but also a systemic zzso Needles without eggs but adjacent to those bearing zzso eggs also release the zzso that attract the egg zzso The zzso of the attractive zzso was shown to be present in the zzso zzso coating the eggs of zzso zzso When pine zzso are treated with zzso acid, a well-known plant wound zzso they emit zzso that attract the egg zzso These results show, for the first time, that a zzso plant is able to attract zzso as soon as a zzso has deposited its eggs on zzso Thus, the plant appears to defend itself against zzso prior to being damaged by feeding zzso
