zzso encodes a zzso signaling zzso zzso key roles in embryonic zzso This study analyzes the expression pattern, regulation, and function of this growth factor in the zzso zzso of the avian zzso In the mature zzso expression of zzso is restricted to a zzso of zzso cells, zzso most, but not all, zzso and zzso muscle zzso Following zzso of the zzso and floor plate, zzso expression is not activated in the zzso in either the zzso or the zzso domain, while zzso of the zzso neural tube does not affect zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso to the view that zzso muscle precursors are independent of regulatory influences from zzso structures, these findings provide the first evidence for a regulatory influence of zzso but not zzso zzso structures on the zzso muscle zzso Sonic zzso can substitute for the zzso neural tube and zzso in the initiation of zzso expression in the zzso It is also shown that zzso protein leads to an increase in zzso cell proliferation and enhances rib cartilage development in mature zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso causes deletions in developing zzso These observations zzso zzso a regulatory influence of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso muscle zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso expression of zzso by Sonic zzso and zzso independent regulation of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso It is zzso that the zzso and zzso neural tube influence zzso expression of zzso in the zzso and that, in turn, zzso has a functional role in rib zzso
