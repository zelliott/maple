The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to associate physically and functionally with members of the protein zzso C zzso family of zzso zzso in a variety of cell zzso Here we show evidence for a novel interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso activated through the zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A, a snake zzso component capable of zzso both receptors in zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso downstream of zzso family zzso zzso of zzso by the selective zzso zzso causes a reduction in calcium entry, although zzso of zzso is zzso zzso is also zzso on zzso zzso in a zzso manner and associates with zzso upon zzso zzso by either zzso A or zzso of zzso zzso alone by von zzso zzso zzso in turn becomes zzso in a manner dependent upon zzso family and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso leads to enhancement of zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso I leads to reduction in zzso zzso We propose a zzso feedback interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso in which zzso positively zzso activity of zzso which in turn feeds back zzso upon zzso
