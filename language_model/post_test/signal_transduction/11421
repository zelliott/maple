The aim of this study was to identify zzso zzso factor zzso responsive zzso 

Potential zzso responsive genes were identified by comparing the zzso expression pattern of the zzso zzso cell line zzso grown in either zzso zzso or zzso by differential zzso Human and zzso zzso clones of one of the bands having increased expression in zzso were zzso zzso expression of the gene was examined by Northern zzso zzso and studies with a green fluorescent fusion protein were used to determine its zzso zzso Growth zzso proliferation of zzso cells zzso with zzso expressed sense and zzso zzso zzso of the gene was measured by zzso zzso 

A zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was shown to be rapidly induced when cells were switched from zzso to zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso showed it contained a zzso signal zzso but not any other known functional zzso The human and zzso clones zzso nearly identical zzso proteins that localized to the zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in all zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso proliferated similarly to zzso cells when cultured in zzso or zzso In contrast, cells with reduced protein levels grew normally in zzso but had impaired proliferation in zzso 

zzso is a zzso protein involved in zzso signal zzso
