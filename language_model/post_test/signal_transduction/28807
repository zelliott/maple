Mice lacking the zzso protein zzso zzso show disrupted cortical topography and no zzso zzso patterns of cells are normal in the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso while the pattern in zzso zzso zzso zzso is somewhat zzso To better understand the basis for zzso and cortical zzso we used small zzso of zzso to trace zzso projections between zzso zzso and barrel zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso from cells in the zzso zzso that project to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso crossed the zzso from zzso and projected to zzso zzso zzso consistent with normal zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso projection was highly zzso zzso zzso showed delays of 1-2 days in initial zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed multiple zzso errors near intermediate targets, and were zzso zzso within the internal capsule zzso Interestingly, most individually labeled zzso zzso terminated in deep layers instead of in layer IV as in zzso This zzso is consistent with zzso analysis in zzso mice, which revealed that zzso normally destined for layer IV remain in deep cortical zzso Early outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar for both zzso However, at zzso zzso zzso fibers remained bundled as they entered the zzso and exhibited few terminal branches in zzso Thus, the establishment of zzso projections between zzso and zzso are disrupted in zzso zzso zzso
