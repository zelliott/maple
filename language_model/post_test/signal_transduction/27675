The 68 zzso zzso zzso associated during zzso is an zzso binding protein with zzso zzso 2 and 3 domain binding zzso A role for zzso associated in zzso 68 as an zzso protein in signaling zzso has been proposed in different systems such as zzso zzso In the present work, we have sought to assess the possible role of zzso associated in zzso 68 in insulin zzso zzso We performed in zzso studies in zzso cells and in zzso studies using zzso zzso associated in zzso 68, zzso insulin zzso and fusion proteins containing either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso zzso We have found that zzso associated in zzso 68 is a zzso of the insulin zzso both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso associated in zzso 68 was found to associate with zzso zzso in response to insulin, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso associated in zzso 68 may be part of the signaling complexes of insulin zzso along with zzso In zzso studies demonstrate that zzso associated in zzso 68 associates with the zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso after zzso zzso by the activated insulin zzso Moreover, zzso zzso associated in zzso 68 binds with a higher affinity to the zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso suggesting a preferential association of zzso associated in zzso 68 with the zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso This association may be important for the link of the signaling with zzso zzso
