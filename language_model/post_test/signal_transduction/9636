zzso zzso zzso a Ras zzso protein family member, is highly expressed in zzso cells and vascular smooth zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso disease is not zzso 

We used mouse graft zzso models characterized by zzso zzso and zzso expansion to determine the function of zzso 

In a single minor zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso transplantation model, zzso deletion in the graft zzso zzso formation, an effect reversed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso transplantation model in which zzso or zzso mouse zzso were transplanted into zzso recipients and in which zzso formation was induced by intravenous administration of an zzso that zzso a mouse zzso zzso donor zzso from zzso mice enhanced zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso knockout or zzso of zzso in zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso migration and zzso 2 critical steps in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically bound to zzso and inhibited its zzso 

zzso functions as a negative regulator in zzso zzso formation, in part by zzso zzso migratory and zzso signaling in zzso
