zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso signals to the nucleus through the zzso and zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cell zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso signaling has been implicated in regulating the zzso growth of the zzso considerable controversy persists as to its role in maintaining versus initiating zzso its role in pathological versus zzso zzso and its role in heart zzso To address these issues, zzso reporter transgenic mice were generated and zzso These mice showed robust and zzso zzso in the heart that was inhibited with zzso zzso In the adult heart, zzso activity was zzso in a delayed, but sustained manner throughout eight weeks of pathological cardiac zzso induced by zzso or more dramatically following zzso zzso heart zzso In contrast, zzso zzso as produced in two separate models of exercise training failed to show significant zzso zzso in the heart at multiple time points, despite measurable increases in heart to body weight zzso Moreover, stimulation of zzso with growth zzso growth zzso zzso failed to activate zzso signaling in the heart or in culture, despite zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice also showed a normal zzso response after zzso zzso Lastly, zzso or zzso cardiac growth failed to show induction of zzso marker gene expression compared with zzso zzso Although a direct zzso relationship between zzso activity and pathological zzso was not proven here, our results support the hypothesis that zzso signaling pathways regulate pathological versus zzso zzso growth of the zzso with zzso potentially serving a regulatory role that is more specialized for zzso zzso and heart zzso
