zzso are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental zzso External signals are zzso processed and integrated by cellular signal zzso networks, which translate input signals into specific cellular responses by means of zzso zzso These networks have a complex nature, and we are still far from having a complete characterization of the process through which they integrate information, specially given the noisy environment in which that information is zzso zzso by the many instances of constructive influences of noise that have been reported in the physical sciences in the last decades, here we explore how multiple signals are integrated in an zzso cell in the presence of background noise, or zzso To that end, we use a zzso model of a typical human signal zzso zzso Despite its complexity, we find that the network is able to display simple patterns of signal zzso Furthermore, our zzso analysis shows that these integration patterns depend on the levels of fluctuating background activity carried by other cell zzso Taken together, our results indicate that signal integration is sensitive to environmental zzso and that this background noise effectively determines the information integration capabilities of the zzso
