It has been proposed that part of the zzso mechanism of caloric restriction zzso involves a reduction in both the generation rate of zzso oxygen species zzso by zzso and a reduction in zzso of zzso zzso It was hypothesized that these effects may be due to upstream changes in hormonal status, since certain hormones (such as zzso are zzso for zzso production, effect fatty acid zzso and are lowered by zzso To investigate this hypothesis, young male zzso rats on zzso zzso (4 months zzso were subjected to insulin replacement by use of zzso zzso zzso and free zzso zzso production were significantly lower in zzso from zzso animals compared to those from fully zzso and these effects were reversed by zzso It is concluded that the beneficial changes induced by zzso as seen at the zzso may in part be downstream effects of zzso in hormonal zzso
