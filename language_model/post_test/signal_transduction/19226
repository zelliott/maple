Although the zzso regulatory events triggered by zzso are well zzso understanding the zzso networks that mediate the diverse functions of this zzso domain zzso protein remains a major zzso Here, we present genetic and zzso studies that suggest an unexpected novel strategy for zzso regulation of zzso and cell lineage zzso Our data suggest that zzso specifically interacts with nuclear zzso and zzso its zzso degradation, resulting in the maintenance of an zzso early embryonic zzso both in zzso zzso and embryonic stem zzso zzso Our data also show that zzso control of zzso stability has an important function in regulating zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso increases zzso protein levels, enhancing zzso zzso and initiating invasive cellular activity characteristic of zzso zzso Our data suggest a novel mode of regulation by which a delicate balance between zzso zzso and zzso regulates maintenance of stem cell zzso zzso the balance between these proteins can direct cell fate decisions and zzso
