Advances in our understanding of the signaling pathways and cellular functions regulated by protein zzso zzso have paved the way to study their role in the response of brain and spinal zzso to traumatic zzso Mechanical forces imparted by trauma stimulate zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso as well as cause changes in the state of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso released by mechanical strain stimulates zzso zzso receptors that are coupled to these protein zzso signaling zzso These zzso regulate gene zzso cell survival, zzso zzso growth arrest, and zzso thereby affecting cell fate, repair and plasticity after zzso zzso of the molecular responses of protein zzso zzso to mechanical strain and the genes regulated by these signaling pathways may lead to therapeutic opportunities to minimize losses in motor skills and cognitive function caused by trauma to the central nervous zzso
