zzso generated in the adult zzso zone zzso migrate through the zzso migratory stream zzso to the zzso bulb zzso Previous work uncovered zzso ranging from straight to complex, but it was unclear if directional changes were zzso or exhibited stereotypical zzso Here, we provide the first in-depth zzso zzso zzso study of zzso and dynamic features that accompany turning and direction zzso in the zzso We identified three specific kinds of turning zzso zzso zzso of the leading process zzso to the cell body zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso leading process zzso zzso or branching of the leading process or zzso zzso zzso and branching angles were remarkably constrained and were significantly different from one zzso zzso reversed direction zzso 90 zzso through zzso zzso branching zzso or de zzso growth of processes from the zzso zzso but not zzso Direction reversal was often composed of several zzso of zzso or branching as opposed to novel zzso Individual zzso could turn or change direction in multiple patterns suggesting that the patterns are not specific for different zzso These findings show that zzso in the zzso use a limited number of distinct and constrained zzso to turn or reverse zzso
