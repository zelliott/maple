The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is involved in various processes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso induction after zzso zzso It is also considered to play a major role in cell proliferation and zzso Recent zzso have suggested a zzso between zzso functions and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We now report that zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso elicits a marked increase in zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels associated with a significant increase of zzso activity in primary rat zzso and a human zzso cell zzso This induction occurred independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by its ability to zzso zzso responsive element zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso with an zzso zzso construct in the human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was abolished by a zzso with zzso an established zzso zzso arguing for zzso zzso by zzso Such an effect was demonstrated by direct in zzso zzso binding competition zzso using rabbit liver zzso showing that this compound binds zzso with an zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso is a zzso for several zzso including human zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that the widely used specific inhibitor of zzso zzso also acts as a potent zzso zzso and an zzso of related zzso Such effects on the zzso may have an impact on biological functions attributed previously to zzso zzso
