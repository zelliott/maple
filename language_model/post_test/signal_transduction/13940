zzso D zzso and its product zzso acid zzso are incorporated in a complex zzso network in which the individual zzso zzso are suggested to regulate specific zzso and stress responses, including plant programmed cell death zzso Despite the accumulating knowledge, the mechanisms through which zzso operate during zzso are still poorly zzso In this work, the role of zzso in zzso and the associated zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso synthesis in tomato suspension cells was zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were exposed to the cell zzso chemicals zzso zzso zzso B1 zzso and zzso A range of zzso zzso effectively suppressed zzso zzso in zzso cells, but failed to alleviate cell death in zzso zzso Compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, reduced cell death and decreased production of zzso were zzso Application of zzso significantly enhanced zzso cell death both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the PA zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso of zzso zzso downstream of G zzso caused severe cell zzso zzso specific to zzso and zzso remarkably decreased the zzso cell zzso Taken together with our previous findings, the results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso cell death possibly communicated through zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso The dead cells expressed zzso features of zzso such as zzso shrinkage and nucleus zzso The presented findings reveal novel elements of zzso cell death response and suggest that zzso is an important factor in zzso zzso signal zzso
