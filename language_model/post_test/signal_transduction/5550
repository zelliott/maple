zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of people living with zzso has markedly decreased mortality but also increased the zzso of zzso zzso causes of which are not well zzso Here, we report that zzso is exacerbated when zzso zzso rats are exposed to a zzso for 7 zzso suggesting that chronic zzso exposure adversely affects pancreatic zzso zzso zzso In support of this possibility, we find increased zzso as reflected by zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso capacity in zzso cells and human pancreatic zzso cells after in zzso zzso zzso zzso to clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, pancreatic zzso isolated from rats administered an zzso for 3 zzso exhibit greater cell death than zzso isolated from zzso zzso The higher zzso of zzso cell death was associated with zzso and, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or induction of zzso stress zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Exposure to the zzso however, led to zzso of zzso zzso caused a loss in zzso membrane potential, and promoted the release of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso currently in clinically use can induce zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso These findings therefore highlight the importance of considering zzso viability and function when assessing loss of zzso control and the course of development of diabetes in zzso subjects receiving a zzso zzso
