zzso 3 zzso zzso has high affinity and specificity to gamma zzso hormone zzso a zzso zzso involved in regulation of blood pressure zzso and sodium zzso Recent studies showing increased zzso expression and elevated plasma zzso in normal rats fed a zzso diet support the role of this system in sodium zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso response to dietary salt may contribute to salt retention and zzso zzso in zzso zzso We examined zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and response to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats fed zzso zzso or zzso zzso diets for 3 zzso zzso of zzso diet significantly increased zzso in the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso diet led to a zzso increase in plasma zzso and a zzso increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso zzso abundance in zzso rats were zzso elevated on zzso diet and remained unchanged on zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso II significantly lowered zzso and raised fractional Na zzso in the zzso but not the zzso rats consuming zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso significantly raised zzso and lowered fractional Na zzso in both zzso Thus, the data suggest that zzso zzso zzso is activated and appears to be biologically functional in the zzso zzso
