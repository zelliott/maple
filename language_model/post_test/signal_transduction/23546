zzso zzso studies hold great promise for functional investigation of the significance of genetic variations and zzso as well as potential synthetic zzso for understanding and treatment of cancer, yet technical and conceptual issues currently diminish the potential power of this zzso While numerous research groups are zzso employing this kind of functional zzso methodology to identify molecular zzso of disease severity, response, and resistance to treatment, findings are generally zzso by zzso zzso These effects arise from a variety of issues beyond zzso zzso behavior, such as biological zzso and feedback processes so thus can occur even with specific zzso Interpreting zzso results in a network framework instead of merely as individual zzso or zzso zzso contributions from all zzso contributions to pathways via their relationships with other network zzso This interpretation can zzso dependence upon individual zzso performance and increase confidence in biological zzso Here we provide background on zzso studies in cancer applications, review key challenges with functional zzso and motivate the use of network models grounded in zzso zzso
