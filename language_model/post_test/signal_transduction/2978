The zzso zzso of zzso is the major mechanism of zzso cell death in zzso In this pathway, zzso members of the zzso family cause zzso outer membrane zzso zzso allowing the release of zzso zzso which interacts with zzso to trigger zzso zzso and zzso Despite conservation of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the existence of the zzso zzso in any zzso is, at best, zzso Here we show that zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso and that zzso c triggers zzso zzso in zzso extracts from these zzso Further, zzso zzso family proteins can induce and/or regulate cell death in zzso and can replace zzso proteins in zzso cells to regulate zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso in animals predates the emergence of the zzso but was lost in some lineages zzso zzso In further support of this hypothesis, we surveyed the ability of zzso c to trigger zzso zzso in zzso extracts from a variety of organisms and found this effect in zzso extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso
