We hypothesized that vascular zzso growth factor zzso contributes to zzso stimulation of zzso and that zzso of its signaling zzso contributes to the zzso activity of zzso an zzso zzso zzso 

For in zzso studies, 2 zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were treated with zzso For in zzso studies, zzso zzso was established by intravenous administration of zzso tumor cells in zzso mice prior to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso increased cell counts after 48 h zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso cells, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, P zzso the addition of zzso zzso this zzso In zzso mice with zzso disease treated twice weekly with zzso zzso had a decreased tumor burden at day 14 and prolonged survival zzso 50 zzso 2 vs 43 zzso 2 days, P zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso 3 vs 42 zzso 1 days, P zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and basic zzso growth factor expression was increased in treated zzso tumors, which likely occurred in response to zzso signaling zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso has a role in zzso zzso zzso Maintenance therapy with zzso may be useful for disease suppression after zzso zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso factors may provide resistance to this approach, which suggests that zzso zzso efficacy may require combination zzso
