The molecular mechanisms controlling sex determination and differentiation in zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso A zzso analysis may provide comprehensive insights into the processes zzso The zzso expression in zzso zzso has been fairly well zzso but much less data on the corresponding protein expression are available, although the proteins are considered to be more relevant markers of gene zzso Because zzso and protein zzso rarely correlate well, zzso profiles need to be zzso with the information on protein zzso The work presented here analyzed the zzso of adult zzso zzso by a zzso protein identification technology, generating the zzso most populated lists of proteins expressed in mature zzso zzso The acquired zzso data partially confirmed existing zzso information for several zzso including several novel zzso However, disagreements between zzso and protein zzso were often observed, further stressing the necessity to assess the expression on different levels before drawing conclusions on a certain zzso expression and zzso Several gene groups expressed in a sexually zzso way in zzso zzso were zzso Their potential importance for zzso development and function is zzso The data gained in the current study provide a basis for further work on zzso processes occurring during zzso development with use of zzso zzso
