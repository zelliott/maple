zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals govern the development of zzso zzso a zzso and zzso member of the zzso family, is required in the development of zzso Here we found that zzso binds and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso crucial in initiating zzso and zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso to maintain the inactive state of zzso at zzso Upon being zzso zzso zzso is removed and zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso and further zzso zzso to initiate further downstream zzso At rest, zzso may be recruited to the plasma membrane by zzso which also binds zzso resulting in zzso zzso Additionally, the presence of zzso enhances the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was found to bind zzso inactive zzso indicating that, upon zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso resulting in zzso zzso and its release from zzso Thus zzso is a critical part of the zzso for maintaining the inactive state of zzso Furthermore, we found that the reduction of zzso levels results in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is a key adapter protein that maintains zzso in the inactive state, contributing to the regulation of both zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso The data also supports a model for zzso signal zzso by zzso
