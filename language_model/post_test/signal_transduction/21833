zzso sensing is a process by which bacteria communicate using zzso chemical signaling molecules called zzso In this study, the opportunistic plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to zzso type II signaling zzso A zzso of zzso the gene required for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of the zzso To determine the potential role of zzso in zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and tested for its ability to cause tissue zzso The findings reported here demonstrate that the zzso signaling affects the progression of disease symptoms during the early stages of infection by modulating the expression of zzso zzso
