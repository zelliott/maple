The expression of protein zzso C zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso were investigated in the human zzso duct cell line zzso Three new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in this cell zzso No classical zzso zzso zzso were zzso The effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso I zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso and to zzso zzso were zzso zzso to zzso inhibited zzso formation, zzso release and zzso influx in response to zzso zzso to zzso or zzso slightly enhanced zzso formation but inhibited the zzso release and the zzso influx induced by zzso In contrast, zzso to zzso did not modify the zzso release induced by zzso but reduced the influx of zzso seen in the presence of this zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso elements of the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso turnover and altering the sensitivity of the zzso channels to zzso zzso altering the activity, the sensitivity to zzso or the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso modulating zzso entry zzso
