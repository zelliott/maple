The objective of this research was to identify potential biological pathways associated with zzso zzso lip with or without zzso zzso zzso and to explore the potential biological mechanisms underlying these associated pathways on risk of zzso This project was based on the zzso of a previously published zzso association zzso study on zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso trios used here originated from an international consortium (The zzso Environment Association Studies zzso zzso formed in zzso A total of zzso individuals from zzso zzso zzso trios zzso complete trios and 317 incomplete trios where one parent was zzso were collected and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways were selected using a list of zzso genes that may be related to oral zzso In total, 42 candidate zzso which included zzso genes and zzso zzso were zzso Using a zzso analysis approach proposed by Wang et al zzso we conducted a zzso test to assess the statistical significance of the nominal zzso of 42 candidate zzso The analysis revealed several pathways yielding zzso significant zzso However, controlling for the family wise error rate, none of these pathways could retain statistical zzso Nominal zzso of these pathways were concentrated at the lower tail of the distribution, with more than expected low zzso A zzso based test for examining this type of distribution pattern yielded an overall zzso of zzso Thus, while this zzso analysis did not yield a clear significant result for any particular pathway, we conclude that one or more of the genes and pathways considered here likely do play a role in oral zzso
