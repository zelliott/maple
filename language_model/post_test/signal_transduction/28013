zzso was studied in zzso zzso cells to determine the effect on zzso and zzso metabolism as well as the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso a zzso cellular zzso that occurs within 4 zzso and persists over 18 h as a result of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Cellular zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso production and decreased zzso formation from zzso zzso The shift in zzso metabolism from zzso to zzso appears within 3 h and is associated after 18 h with both a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as cellular zzso The relative contribution of zzso cellular zzso zzso the decrease in zzso zzso activity to zzso production could be zzso The zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso reversed both the zzso cellular zzso and zzso but enhanced the zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso induction of zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso mimics zzso effects, whereas zzso zzso reverses the effects on zzso consistent with zzso zzso regulating the zzso zzso Although functional zzso signaling occurs in this cell line, the major zzso zzso responses appear to be zzso by zzso involving zzso
