Signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial for the regulation of zzso cell zzso proliferation and survival, which involves the zzso zzso of the DNA repair protein zzso at zzso Because zzso is a short-lived protein with a high zzso degradation rate, we investigated the regulation of zzso protein levels by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso protein abundance in human zzso vein zzso However, zzso of the zzso site zzso into zzso zzso did not increase its protein zzso We therefore investigated whether a zzso downstream of zzso regulates zzso protein zzso In various cell types, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon serum stimulation of zzso zzso was zzso at zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso in zzso zzso zzso specifically at zzso within the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso protein levels in zzso whereas the specific zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso degradation and increased zzso protein about zzso in zzso and cardiac zzso (30 zzso p zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso triggers zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation of zzso increases zzso via zzso zzso of zzso
