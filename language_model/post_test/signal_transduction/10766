The zzso and zzso of slow and fast zzso muscle fibers are crucial for muscle zzso In zzso zzso is required for slow muscle fiber zzso However, less is known about signals that promote development of fast muscle zzso which constitute the majority of zzso zzso We show that when zzso signaling is zzso fast muscle cell zzso is zzso Using genetic zzso we show that zzso signal perception is required by slow muscle cells but not by fast muscle cells for fast muscle cell zzso Furthermore, we show that slow muscle cells are sufficient to pattern the zzso to lateral wave of fast muscle fiber zzso even when fast muscle cells cannot perceive the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso to lateral migration of slow muscle fibers through the zzso creates a zzso signal that patterns fast muscle fiber zzso in its zzso
