A detailed understanding of trafficking pathways in mature zzso is essential for addressing issues aimed at controlling zzso by modulating zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that viral marker proteins zzso and zzso G, on reaching the zzso and zzso surfaces of polarized zzso cells, respectively, are primarily transported to the plasma membrane and zzso sheet, respectively, in zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that in zzso zzso sorting signals similar to those in zzso cells may target proteins to the zzso sheet, emphasizing the zzso and zzso nature of the zzso sheet and plasma zzso zzso Thus, substitution of essential zzso acids reverses the direction of targeting of these zzso whereas elimination of zzso targeting of zzso zzso with its dissipation from zzso zzso Furthermore, protein zzso C zzso zzso regulated transport of the zzso resident zzso protein zzso to the zzso sheet, like that of zzso G as shown zzso but did not affect the zzso of the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso These data imply that several distinctly regulated pathways operate in zzso sheet zzso that at least partly rely on a zzso zzso sorting zzso
