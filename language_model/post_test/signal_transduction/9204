zzso is an essential zzso for many zzso but at high zzso it is toxic for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso The zzso response to 20 zzso zzso was studied using DNA zzso and revealed 20 genes that showed a zzso zzso increased zzso level, including zzso Several genes in this zzso region code for proteins presumably involved in the zzso to zzso stress, zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso In addition, this region includes the zzso genes zzso named zzso which zzso a zzso signal zzso system composed of the zzso zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso zzso of the zzso genes increased the sensitivity of zzso zzso towards copper zzso but not to other heavy metal zzso Using comparative zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and the wild type in combination with zzso mobility shift zzso and reporter gene studies the zzso zzso and the zzso motif of zzso were zzso Evidence was obtained that zzso binds only to the zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and activates expression of the zzso oriented gene clusters zzso and zzso Altogether, our data suggest that zzso is the key regulatory system in zzso zzso for the zzso sensing of elevated copper zzso zzso and for induction of a set of genes capable of diminishing copper zzso
