zzso and zzso zzso are widely used zzso drugs that inhibit the normal function of zzso causing zzso arrest and cell zzso Despite these similarities, the signaling pathways that mediate and regulate cell death induced by these agents remain incompletely zzso The purpose of this study was to directly compare the two drugs in terms of their ability to activate components of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, and to establish the importance of these signaling events in zzso induced by these zzso We show that both drugs induce zzso arrest and subsequent zzso cell death with highly similar zzso and that both activate zzso and induce zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso although zzso failed to do zzso However, zzso of zzso or an absence of zzso protected against both zzso and zzso cell zzso These results suggest that although zzso zzso plays an important role in cell death induced by both agents, zzso and zzso differ markedly with respect to signaling downstream of zzso with zzso and zzso mechanisms, zzso In addition, these results show, contrary to popular belief, that zzso zzso is not necessarily accompanied by zzso zzso and thus zzso is not an zzso zzso of zzso
