zzso zzso is a zzso zzso blocker with inverse zzso activity at zzso Previous studies in our laboratory showed that chronic treatment with zzso decreased airway resistance response (R zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso model of asthma while acute treatment with zzso increased R zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S A zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso also caused decreased airway inflammation and zzso content in a zzso asthma model zzso et zzso Am J zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso levels and signaling components downstream of the zzso using a line of zzso cells expressing human zzso zzso treatment with zzso increased zzso protein levels and decreased zzso degradation, consistent with zzso stabilization by the inverse zzso zzso zzso levels decreased after zzso of treatment with zzso but increased after a zzso zzso A zzso treatment with zzso decreased zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site zzso 262 while a zzso treatment with zzso increased zzso In contrast, chronic treatment with zzso had no effect on zzso of the zzso zzso site at zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso cellular levels of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso treatment therefore increases cellular zzso levels by mechanisms that include the zzso of zzso and zzso This effect may explain in part the beneficial effects of chronic zzso treatment on airway zzso
