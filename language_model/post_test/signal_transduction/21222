zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso zzso inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation in zzso after stimulation by growth zzso Similar results are obtained in zzso after zzso injury, suggesting that zzso zzso might also control smooth muscle cell proliferation in zzso However, available data from clinical trials are conflicting and currently do not support the concept that these compounds might be successfully used to suppress excessive smooth muscle cell growth in response to tissue injury, specifically zzso after zzso One possible explanation for these different results is an zzso zzso of zzso receptors in vascular smooth muscle zzso It is possible that enhanced zzso zzso zzso subsequent to induction of zzso and/or in relation to the formation of a zzso from media smooth muscle cells, might have a similar zzso There is still uncertainty regarding the cellular signal zzso pathways and their possibly complex interaction, although zzso reactions are probably zzso In addition, zzso zzso might also interfere with the generation and action of other growth modulating factors, including zzso zzso growth factor and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso might be considered as growth modulating zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso
