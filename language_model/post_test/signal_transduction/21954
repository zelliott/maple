We have examined gene expression in zzso neural precursor cells zzso derived from human fetal zzso brain tissue and compared its expression profiles with embryonic stem zzso cells, zzso body cell zzso and zzso precursors using the technique of zzso parallel signature sequencing zzso Gene expression profiles show that zzso express core neural stem cells markers and share expression profiles with zzso precursor cells zzso rather than zzso or zzso Gene expression analysis shows that zzso differ from other adult stem and zzso cells in their marker expression and zzso of specific functional networks such as the transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso In addition, our results allow us to identify novel genes expressed in zzso and provide a detailed profile of zzso
