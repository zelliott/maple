Plants respond to almost any kind of external stimulus with zzso in their zzso free calcium concentration zzso A huge variety of zzso recorded by optical techniques has been reported in the zzso This variety has been credited the specificity needed to explain how information about incoming stimuli is evaluated by the zzso and turned into the right zzso responses which provide advantages for survival and zzso A zzso response often takes place away from the site of zzso This requires zzso zzso zzso responding cells are not necessarily directly zzso but rather receive an indirect stimulus via zzso zzso It appears unlikely that the zzso zzso in the primarily zzso cell is conveyed over long distances via zzso communication from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Here, a novel aspect is highlighted to explain the variety of zzso zzso seen by zzso methods of zzso zzso Plants can generally be seen as cellular zzso with specific zzso and capable for zzso zzso Just a few rules are needed to demonstrate how waves of zzso zzso through the zzso and thereby deliver a broad variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a possible way to find explanations for different kinds of signal transmission, signal amplification, wave formation, zzso and zzso zzso The basic examples presented here show that care has to be taken when interpreting cellular zzso zzso recorded by optical techniques which integrate over a big number of cells or even whole zzso
