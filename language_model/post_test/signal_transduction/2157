A soluble form of the human zzso zzso zzso that contains the zzso zzso binding domain has been evaluated for its effect on zzso binding to and zzso of human zzso and zzso The truncated zzso was expressed in zzso coli and recovered in biologically active form following zzso and zzso exchange zzso The soluble zzso formed a zzso complex with zzso in solution and bound zzso with affinity comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso with zzso for binding to the native alpha beta zzso on human cells and inhibited zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso In this regard, the soluble zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso of zzso C4 release by human zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso in longer term zzso including zzso survival and zzso cell zzso possibly due to its propensity to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, we observed that a soluble zzso derived from zzso cells was less prone to zzso and effectively antagonized zzso cell proliferation and zzso These findings indicate that the zzso portion of the human zzso chain can prevent association of zzso with cell surface receptors and can zzso signal zzso zzso release, and survival of inflammatory zzso As such, soluble zzso may be useful in treating diseases such as human zzso in which pulmonary injury is associated with the activity of zzso zzso
