The transient zzso potential protein zzso is a putative zzso zzso entry channel present in fly zzso which use the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso for zzso By zzso studies, we find that zzso is associated into a zzso complex with the zzso zzso C, an zzso protein zzso C zzso and with the zzso protein zzso zzso is a putative zzso of zzso and contains two zzso repeats, putative zzso interaction zzso These proteins are present in the zzso membrane at about zzso zzso The zzso zzso analyzed here is isolated together with zzso zzso and zzso from blowfly zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso acid zzso The highest sequence conservation is found in the region that contains the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso As investigated by zzso labeling with specific zzso directed against zzso and zzso the zzso signaling complex is located in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The spatial distribution of the signaling complex argues against a direct zzso zzso of zzso to an zzso zzso supposed to be present in the membrane of internal zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the organization of signal zzso proteins into a zzso complex provides the structural basis for an efficient and fast zzso and regulation of zzso entry through the zzso zzso
