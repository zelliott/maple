Early growth response zzso zzso and zzso zzso play important roles in the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso but little is known about their zzso zzso we zzso zzso with either zzso zzso zzso zzso a DNA zzso designed to target zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and examined changes in zzso and zzso expression at the zzso and protein zzso zzso expression levels were increased in cells that were zzso zzso with zzso zzso By contrast, both zzso and zzso expression were reduced when zzso was zzso into zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, while zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso binds to the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, treatment with the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso We find that zzso and zzso positively regulate each other in zzso
