zzso zzso include zzso (an zzso zzso (an zzso and zzso (an zzso In the brain, these molecules are formed from zzso zzso by a specific zzso D, called zzso or through zzso zzso zzso as illustrated in the current study employing zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso is presumably a major class of zzso zzso in the brain, its zzso conversion to zzso is poorly zzso In the present study, we focused on the formation of zzso from zzso While zzso zzso zzso direct release of zzso from zzso zzso the same reaction occurred in the brain zzso of zzso mice, suggesting that this reaction occurs through both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a remarkable zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the brain of zzso zzso We also found that brain zzso formed zzso zzso and zzso from their corresponding zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the brain levels of zzso zzso zzso the other products from zzso zzso by zzso D, also increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso In addition, we discovered that zzso zzso has a weak activity to generate zzso from its corresponding zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is at least in part responsible for the zzso D zzso These results strongly suggest that brain tissue zzso including zzso can be formed from zzso zzso through an zzso zzso as well as by their direct release via zzso
