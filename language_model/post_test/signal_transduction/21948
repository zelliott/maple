In response to pathological stresses such as hypertension or zzso zzso the heart zzso a zzso process that is associated with zzso zzso zzso death, and zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is a zzso zzso of cardiac zzso that is subject to zzso zzso in response to stress zzso Recent studies have suggested a role for protein zzso C zzso and its downstream zzso protein zzso D1 zzso in the control of zzso zzso While zzso are well-documented regulators of cardiac zzso the function of zzso in heart muscle remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso activity is zzso in cardiac zzso by diverse zzso zzso that signal through G zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso occurs through zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cardiac zzso is activated in multiple zzso models of pathological cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso nuclear export of zzso and reduction of zzso zzso expression with small interfering zzso suppresses zzso shuttling and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso in mouse heart leads to zzso zzso These findings support a role for zzso in the control of pathological zzso of the heart via its ability to zzso and neutralize zzso
