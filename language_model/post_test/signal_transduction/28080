zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins comprise a large family that zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein family has a common zzso domain and functions as zzso proteins for the zzso of zzso zzso located at the plasma zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso protein was zzso to the plasma membrane from the nucleus on zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we first examined which zzso of zzso can induce the zzso of zzso When the zzso family was zzso the zzso of zzso did zzso To investigate the mechanism of this zzso we generated a zzso zzso with reduced affinity to zzso and an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso experiments with both zzso revealed that disruption of the zzso interaction abolished the zzso of zzso despite the apparent membrane zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso is recruited to the plasma membrane where zzso are activated mainly by direct association with zzso
