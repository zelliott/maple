zzso zzso zzso the zzso equivalent of zzso zzso is an zzso growth factor for zzso its zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical cell survival zzso it is zzso regulated by the zzso tumor zzso zzso We have recently found that poorly differentiated zzso express decreased zzso protein zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso zzso a member of the zzso coupled zzso family, zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso cell zzso zzso we sought to determine whether zzso or zzso activates zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment rapidly increased zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso as well as its cell cycle zzso zzso increased zzso phase progression in zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation was blocked by zzso Our findings identify zzso as an important signaling zzso for zzso zzso cell zzso A novel therapy targeted at zzso zzso may prove to be an effective treatment option to inhibit zzso in zzso
