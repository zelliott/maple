zzso 2 zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso to other cells and zzso Although zzso is required for cell zzso little is known regarding the way beta 2 zzso affect the zzso network in zzso In the present study zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso human zzso have been measured by zzso zzso after zzso zzso of beta 2 zzso zzso engagement of beta 2 zzso resulted in a rapid and sustained zzso and zzso after 30 and 300 zzso zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso This is in contrast to stimulation with zzso zzso which causes a prompt and pronounced but rapidly declining rise in zzso zzso and zzso after 15 and 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso with 1 zzso zzso a low concentration that did not influence the zzso content per se, increased the magnitude of the beta 2 zzso response but had no effect on the zzso zzso after 30 s and zzso after 300 zzso zzso of zzso zzso only marginally affected the beta 2 zzso zzso response for cells that were zzso with zzso whereas the response for zzso cells was reduced by zzso This suggests that even though zzso zzso has a zzso effect it is not an absolute requirement for beta 2 zzso zzso zzso beta 2 zzso engagement did not affect the resting cellular level of zzso arguing against a role of zzso in beta 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
