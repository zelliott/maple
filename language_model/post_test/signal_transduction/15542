We define shell zzso in a network as the set of zzso at distance zzso with respect to a given zzso and define zzso as the fraction of zzso outside shell zzso zzso In a transport process, information or disease usually zzso from a random zzso and reach zzso shell after zzso Thus, understanding the shell structure is crucial for the study of the transport property of zzso We study the statistical properties of the shells of a randomly chosen zzso For a randomly connected network with given degree distribution, we derive zzso the degree distribution and average degree of the zzso residing outside shell zzso as a function of zzso Further, we find that zzso follows an zzso functional form zzso , where zzso is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the zzso Our results can explain the zzso distribution of the number of zzso zzso found in shells with zzso larger than the network diameter d , which is the average distance between all pairs of zzso For real-world networks the theoretical prediction of zzso deviates from the empirical zzso We introduce a network correlation function zzso identical with zzso to characterize the correlations in the network, where zzso is the empirical value and zzso is the theoretical zzso zzso indicates perfect agreement between empirical results and zzso We apply zzso to several model and real-world zzso We find that the networks fall into two distinct zzso zzso a class of poorly connected networks with zzso , where a larger zzso fraction of zzso resides outside zzso distance zzso from a given zzso than in randomly connected networks with the same degree zzso Examples include the zzso model and networks characterizing human zzso such as citation networks and the actor collaboration zzso zzso a class of well-connected networks with zzso zzso Examples include the zzso model and the autonomous system Internet zzso
