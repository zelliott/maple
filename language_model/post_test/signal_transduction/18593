Inner ear develops from an induced surface zzso zzso that zzso and closes to form the zzso zzso which then zzso a complex zzso process to form the zzso zzso Inner ear zzso is severely affected in zzso deficient mouse zzso but the onset and basis of the zzso has not been zzso We show here that zzso zzso leads to severe and unique abnormalities during zzso zzso zzso The zzso problems are accompanied often by the formation of a zzso boundary between the zzso and zzso zzso cup and by the precocious appearance of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso domain often zzso from the rest of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso The expression of several cell zzso zzso genes is altered in zzso deficient ears suggesting that zzso controls zzso and zzso movements in early zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads also to a loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso and auditory zzso demonstrating that zzso is an important regulator of zzso during zzso zzso
