zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which provide zzso to the zzso and cortex, are required for memory and learning, and are primarily affected in Alzheimer's Disease zzso resulting in related cognitive zzso Therefore generation of a source of zzso from human zzso stem cells zzso is crucial for in zzso disease modeling and development of novel zzso zzso In addition, for the advancement of zzso approaches there is a requirement for an accurate zzso model to study the zzso and survival of this zzso Here we demonstrate the efficient production of zzso using a novel zzso body zzso based zzso differentiation zzso zzso We establish a specific zzso zzso neural stem cell zzso zzso via expression of the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso as well as the general zzso marker zzso We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via zzso of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic zzso zzso through the use of a zzso zzso differentiation zzso This is the first example of zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso via zzso in prolonged zzso zzso upon terminal differentiation these zzso zzso zzso generate high numbers of zzso zzso expressing the specific markers zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study zzso related zzso zzso loss in the zzso zzso Examples are expression of the therapeutic target zzso the release of zzso and demonstration of a mature, and functional zzso zzso In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional zzso zzso for studying zzso specifically in the zzso system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human zzso zzso
