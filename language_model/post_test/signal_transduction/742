To explore the role of zzso oxide zzso signaling zzso in the differentiation of human zzso T zzso into zzso zzso 

Human zzso T zzso were isolated from zzso zzso Various zzso of NO donor sodium zzso zzso NO inhibitor NAME and zzso inhibitor zzso were added to the culture medium to induce the differentiation of zzso T cells towards zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by flow zzso 

The treatment of zzso NAME and zzso made no difference on the percentage of cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso in comparison with that of the control group zzso zzso zzso 

Signaling zzso of zzso had no effect on differentiation of human zzso T zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of types 1 and 2 zzso may occur mainly at the level of mature zzso zzso
