The formation and execution of a productive immune response requires the maturation of competent T cells and a robust change in cellular activity upon zzso zzso Such changes in cellular function depend on regulated zzso to protein zzso Previous research has focused on defining zzso changes that regulate protein expression during zzso maturation and zzso zzso Here, we globally analyze another critical process in gene regulation during zzso zzso alternative zzso Specifically, we use zzso profiling to identify 178 zzso in zzso genes that exhibit robust changes in inclusion in response to stimulation of a human zzso zzso Supporting an important role for the global coordination of alternative zzso following zzso zzso these zzso zzso are significantly enriched in genes with functional zzso specifically related to immune zzso The vast majority of these genes also exhibit differential alternative zzso between zzso and activated primary T zzso zzso of the responsiveness of zzso to various stimuli in the cultured and primary T cells further reveals at least three distinct networks of zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso we find that each regulatory network is specifically associated with distinct sequence features, suggesting that they are controlled by independent regulatory zzso These results thus provide a basis for zzso mechanisms of signal zzso regulation of alternative zzso during zzso zzso
