Leaf aging is a highly regulated zzso process, which is also influenced profoundly by diverse environmental zzso zzso evidence in recent years supports that plant responsiveness to zzso stress is intimately related with leaf zzso However, molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling zzso and regulatory schemes are yet zzso In this work, we demonstrate that an zzso acid zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress signals into leaf aging by regulating a subset of zzso zzso and zzso TO zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was induced by high zzso in an zzso zzso In addition, spatial and zzso expression patterns of the zzso gene are correlated with leaf aging and zzso zzso leaf aging was delayed in transgenic plants zzso the zzso gene but significantly accelerated in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor regulates the zzso and zzso genes by binding directly to their zzso zzso transgenic plants zzso the zzso or zzso genes exhibited prolonged leaf zzso These observations indicate that the zzso zzso factor serves as a molecular link that zzso plant responses to environmental stresses into zzso of leaf zzso
