zzso of zzso is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso molecules produced by activated zzso contribute to zzso damage in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso has been reported to zzso zzso zzso and exert zzso effects in zzso transgenic zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso activated zzso is poorly zzso 

In this study, the primary zzso were obtained from the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by Western zzso and the levels of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso 

zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed zzso zzso degradation and nuclear zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
