zzso that may allow circulating zzso to persist as zzso T cells diminish in zzso infection have not been zzso We have characterized zzso gene expression signatures in circulating zzso from zzso subjects and have identified a stable zzso gene signature comprised of 38 genes associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso The significance of this gene signature is indicated by our demonstration of cadmium zzso or zzso zzso zzso resistance in circulating zzso in contrast to increasing zzso in zzso T cells from the same infected zzso As potential mechanisms in zzso we show that zzso zzso binding by zzso virus or zzso zzso serves as independent viral and host zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso resistance in zzso We also show evidence for zzso between circulating zzso zzso gene expression in zzso infection in zzso and available zzso following viral infection or envelope exposure in zzso zzso in zzso The identification of in zzso gene expression associated with zzso resistance to zzso is of relevance to AIDS zzso since it would contribute to: 1) maintaining viability of infection targets and long-term reservoirs of zzso infection in the zzso zzso and 2) protecting a cell subset critical to host survival despite sustained high viral zzso
