The zzso system zzso and the zzso of advanced zzso end products zzso have been implicated in the zzso of diabetic zzso Whether there is a functional interaction between the zzso and zzso in diabetic zzso is not zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso could activate zzso zzso II zzso zzso signaling and subsequently induce transforming growth zzso zzso signaling in cultured rat zzso zzso 

The zzso formation of zzso oxygen species zzso was detected using the fluorescent probe zzso zzso II was measured by zzso zzso released into media was zzso analyzed in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso protein expression were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was analyzed by a zzso zzso DNA synthesis was evaluated by zzso zzso incorporation and de zzso protein synthesis was determined by zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso generation in zzso cells, and this effect was significantly inhibited by an zzso against zzso zzso also were found to stimulate zzso II production in a zzso and zzso manner, which was completely prevented by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overproduction was completely blocked by zzso an zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso against zzso completely prevented zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso were found to inhibit DNA synthesis and to stimulate de zzso protein synthesis and zzso production in association with zzso of zzso All of these phenomena were completely prevented by zzso or a zzso zzso against zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso zzso generation activates zzso signaling and subsequently zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso synthesis by zzso production of zzso zzso This zzso may provide an important link between zzso and zzso factors in promoting the development and progression of diabetic zzso
