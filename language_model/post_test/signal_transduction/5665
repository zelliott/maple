In order to reveal zzso cell interactions after peripheral nerve zzso we began to analyze the impact of zzso nerve zzso on zzso cells in zzso Both cell types are considered to have opposite effects on zzso zzso Few data are available on how repulsive nerve zzso affect zzso zzso cells and thus might indirectly influence zzso zzso Using different culture systems in conjunction with zzso video recording, zzso zzso pharmacological intervention, zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis, we found that nerve zzso zzso modify the various responses of zzso zzso In the presence of collagen type IV and zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso factors slow down zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso factors increase the migratory activity of zzso cells without being zzso One zzso zzso factor turned out to be zzso The zzso activity of nerve zzso and of zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso pharmacological intervention and by zzso zzso zzso We show for the first time that nerve zzso play zzso and zzso roles for zzso cells in a zzso zzso The data shed light on cellular mechanisms and have implications for some zzso engineering zzso
