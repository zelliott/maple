zzso is expressed on a variety of cells, including B cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso interacts with zzso a zzso zzso zzso T cell surface zzso zzso interactions are known to play key roles in B cell zzso and differentiation in zzso and in zzso We now report that normal human zzso cells also express zzso in zzso and zzso interactions induce zzso cell zzso in zzso Frozen sections from normal zzso zzso skin, muscle, zzso zzso or zzso zzso were studied for zzso expression by zzso zzso cells from all zzso studied express zzso in zzso Moreover, human zzso vein zzso cells zzso express zzso in zzso and zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso is functionally significant because zzso zzso T cells or zzso zzso kidney cell zzso but not control cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso expression in zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso are zzso Finally, zzso interactions do not induce zzso zzso or major zzso complex class II expression on zzso in zzso These results demonstrate that zzso interactions induce zzso cell zzso in zzso Moreover, they suggest a mechanism by which activated zzso T cells may augment inflammatory responses in zzso by zzso the expression of zzso cell surface zzso zzso
