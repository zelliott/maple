The cardiac cell is a complex biological system where various processes interact to generate electrical zzso (the action potential, zzso and zzso During zzso generation, membrane zzso channels interact zzso with zzso changing zzso zzso and varying zzso zzso and are subject to regulatory zzso In recent years, a large body of knowledge has accumulated on the molecular structure of cardiac zzso channels, their function, and their modification by genetic zzso that are associated with cardiac zzso and sudden zzso However, zzso channels are typically studied in isolation (in expression systems or isolated membrane zzso away from the zzso environment of the cell where they interact to generate the zzso A major challenge remains the integration of zzso properties into the zzso complex and highly interactive cell system, with the objective to relate zzso processes and their modification by disease to zzso function and clinical zzso In this article we describe how zzso biology can be used to achieve such zzso We explain how mathematical zzso models of zzso zzso are incorporated into integrated models of cardiac cells to zzso the zzso We provide examples of mathematical zzso simulations of zzso and pathological phenomena, including zzso adaptation to changes in heart rate, genetic zzso in zzso and zzso genes that are associated with fatal cardiac zzso and effects of the zzso regulatory zzso and zzso cascade on the cell zzso zzso
