The efficiency of neural circuits can be enhanced not only by increasing synaptic strength but also by increasing zzso intrinsic zzso Three major types of zzso long-term zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso have been well zzso decreased action potential (AP) zzso reduced zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso The zzso basis and induction pathways for these three types of zzso have been largely revealed zzso These intrinsic zzso and their cooperation enrich the functions fulfilled by zzso and may serve as a supplementary mechanism for learning and zzso
