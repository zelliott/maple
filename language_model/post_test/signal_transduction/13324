zzso acquired resistance zzso is a plant defense state that is zzso for example, after previous pathogen infection or by chemicals that mimic natural signaling zzso zzso is associated with the ability to induce cellular defense responses more rapidly and to a greater degree than in zzso plants, a process called zzso zzso plants were treated with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso before stimulating two prominent cellular defense responses, namely zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso itself was essentially inactive at the immediate induction of these two responses, the zzso with zzso greatly zzso the subsequent PAL gene expression induced by zzso zzso zzso tomato infection, zzso or zzso the leaves with zzso The zzso zzso also enhanced the production of zzso which was induced by wounding or zzso the leaves with zzso It is interesting that the zzso by zzso zzso of PAL gene zzso and zzso deposition was not seen in the zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso immunity 1 zzso which is compromised in zzso In a converse manner, zzso PAL gene zzso and enhanced zzso zzso were found, without zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso of zzso genes 5 zzso in which zzso is zzso Moreover, zzso for zzso defense gene zzso was also found in zzso zzso In sum, the results suggest that zzso is an important cellular mechanism in acquired disease resistance of plants that requires the zzso of zzso genes zzso immunity 1 zzso
