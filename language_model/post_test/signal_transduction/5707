zzso is a zzso that is essential for the expansion and survival of activated T zzso Although adoptive transfer of zzso T cells with zzso is one of strategies for cancer zzso it is essential to replace zzso that exerts severe side effects in zzso To solve this problem, we propose to use an zzso zzso which can zzso a growth signal in response to a zzso zzso We constructed two zzso in which zzso of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or gamma zzso When the zzso were zzso in zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso T cell line zzso zzso cells were selectively expanded in the absence of zzso and zzso respectively, by adding zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso Growth zzso revealed that the cells with the zzso zzso a growth signal in a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are hallmarks for zzso zzso were all activated by the zzso in zzso zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso were functional in zzso primary T zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso could substantially mimic the zzso zzso and could specifically expand zzso T cells in the presence of the zzso zzso
