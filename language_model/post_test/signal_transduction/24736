In order to evaluate the possible contribution of zzso D zzso stimulation to the zzso response, a screening of a variety of different compounds, some of which are known to be potent zzso was performed using the well characterized Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso cell zzso In wild type zzso cells, or derivatives expressing high levels of either the human zzso zzso zzso zzso or the human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), zzso a potent zzso for all three cell types, zzso the rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which is not a zzso zzso produced a similarly rapid although greater zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso clone was able to provoke both a zzso response and stimulate zzso albeit a comparatively small zzso In each case, the stimulation of zzso correlated closely with the ability to stimulate zzso zzso breakdown and was entirely dependent on the zzso of protein zzso zzso Moreover, the ability of both zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso was found to be rapidly zzso with a similar time course of zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso It has recently been reported that an increase in zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso by either addition of zzso or by zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso constitutes a zzso zzso In this regard, in addition to stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso were both able to stimulate the activity of a zzso zzso C zzso which did not appear to zzso within the time course zzso By contrast, zzso was unable to elicit the stimulation of zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso which bind to and activate receptors with intrinsic zzso zzso activity, are potent zzso for zzso cells but were unable to stimulate either zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso although able to induce a strong and lasting zzso of PC, was unable to produce a zzso signal on its zzso On the basis of these results, we conclude that the zzso of both zzso and zzso is neither sufficient nor required to produce a zzso zzso
