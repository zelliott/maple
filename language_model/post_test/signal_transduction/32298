zzso interaction zzso network analysis has been considered as a useful approach to explore the mechanisms of complex diseases, such as zzso To date, many proteins have been reported to involve in the development of zzso zzso of cancer proteins in the human zzso network may provide important biological information to uncover molecular mechanisms of zzso Here, we have explored network characteristics (including degree, zzso zzso zzso and zzso distance) of cancer proteins of the human nuclear and zzso zzso receptors network zzso constructed in our earlier zzso We found that the network zzso of cancer proteins in this network have some specific zzso Relative to the zzso zzso the cancer proteins have likely higher degree, higher zzso similar zzso zzso and similar zzso zzso Finally, we found that the cancer proteins were involved mainly in zzso pathways which dysfunction is directly related to cancer zzso These findings are helpful for cancer candidate protein zzso and zzso and identification of key pathways involved in cancer zzso
