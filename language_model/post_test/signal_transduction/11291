zzso zzso zzso in the rat carotid body zzso is zzso in part by zzso acting on zzso zzso zzso Here, we use zzso cloning and sequencing techniques to show zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso some of which develop functional zzso units with CB zzso clusters in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso identified zzso in zzso expressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 % zzso pH zzso caused zzso of zzso units in zzso This zzso depended on chemical transmission, with zzso acting as a zzso since it was inhibited by reduction of the zzso zzso ratio and by the zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could separately zzso the same zzso unit, and together the two stimuli zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein was demonstrated in many zzso zzso and CB zzso terminals in zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso play important roles in the peripheral control of zzso by carotid body zzso
