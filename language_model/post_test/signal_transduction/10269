During zzso zzso migrate into the zzso space where they zzso deposited zzso accumulate zzso and transform into foam zzso It is unclear why these zzso do not remove their zzso loads from the zzso This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that zzso behavior is altered when membrane cholesterol levels are zzso as might be the case for cells in contact with zzso within zzso zzso 

We examined the effects of zzso membrane cholesterol on zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with either zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso zzso to increase membrane cholesterol zzso Our results show that zzso the membrane cholesterol of zzso zzso induced dramatic zzso zzso cell zzso and affected zzso zzso Cellular zzso was required for these effects, and zzso signaling pathways were zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that migration of zzso zzso was significantly inhibited when membrane cholesterol levels were zzso 

These findings indicate that increased membrane cholesterol causes dramatic effects on zzso cellular functions related to the zzso zzso They should provide new insights into the early steps of zzso
