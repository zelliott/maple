The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso signaling mechanism that is essential for zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene regulates zzso signaling in a positive manner, and its gene product physically interacts with the zzso domain of zzso through its zzso zzso zzso has two other zzso that are presumably involved in zzso zzso a zzso motif that binds to zzso and a zzso finger zzso Using an zzso zzso we have analyzed the functional involvement of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso that binds to the zzso repeats of the zzso zzso domain was indispensable for the function of zzso A zzso form of zzso that lacked the zzso motif behaved as a zzso zzso This zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling upstream of an zzso nuclear form of zzso and downstream of full-length zzso suggesting the zzso zzso might prevent the zzso of the zzso zzso We found that zzso formed a zzso and zzso in the zzso finger domain abolished this zzso The same zzso in the zzso finger motif of zzso disrupted the function of zzso in zzso However, when the same zzso was fused to a zzso zzso domain zzso the zzso protein had normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso finger motif is an integral step in the signaling function of zzso
