The differentiation of zzso zzso zzso stem cells is a zzso process that is associated with the progressive repression of zzso responsiveness to serum growth factors that ultimately results in expression of the terminally differentiated zzso zzso The repression of zzso zzso by differentiation zzso with repression of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, the differentiation of zzso transformed cells does not repress zzso responsiveness or zzso or zzso zzso Because the zzso and zzso promoters both contain serum response elements zzso the current studies tested the possibility that differentiation might repress the ability of serum response factor zzso to bind to the zzso in normal cells but not in transformed zzso We now report that differentiation zzso zzso serum zzso using zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso containing an intact zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells also markedly zzso the ability of zzso to bind to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and other zzso as determined by mobility shift and gel zzso zzso without affecting the DNA binding characteristics of the nuclear protein zzso By comparison, the ability of zzso to bind zzso is not zzso by the differentiation of zzso large T zzso zzso zzso The results further establish that zzso differentiation blocks the nuclear zzso of zzso thus preventing its interaction with zzso in zzso cells but not in transformed zzso
