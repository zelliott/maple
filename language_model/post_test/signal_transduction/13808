Positive feedback zzso can produce zzso resulting in different zzso zzso However, many zzso networks contain zzso positive and negative zzso Here we explore the dynamics of an zzso positive and negative feedback motif based on the zzso control system of zzso zzso modified to make the strength of each feedback zzso zzso Our results show that although the positive feedback loop determines the range of zzso and the zzso of the regions where intermediate zzso is possible, the transition rates between states are mostly sensitive to the negative feedback zzso Thus, our results suggest that the function of the negative loop in this motif is to allow separate tuning of the range and transition rates between zzso zzso This could enhance fitness by allowing improved matching of the zzso switching to the frequency of environmental zzso
