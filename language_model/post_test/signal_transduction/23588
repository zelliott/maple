zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso necessary for cellular growth, is regulated by zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso Among zzso regulatory binding partners, the role of zzso Rich zzso zzso of 40 zzso zzso in controlling zzso activity and cellular growth in response to pathological and zzso stress in the heart has never been zzso This report shows zzso is regulated by zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso in zzso blocks zzso in zzso and decreases pathological zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso pathological zzso after pressure overload and preserves cardiac zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso promotes protective zzso signaling in chronic diseased zzso In contrast, strong zzso zzso by zzso allows for zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso zzso of a zzso zzso lacking capacity for zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso is necessary for induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a molecular switch allowing zzso zzso during zzso growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the zzso complex to mitigate zzso zzso zzso by zzso
