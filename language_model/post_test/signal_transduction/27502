The zzso family of protein zzso zzso zzso regulate cellular processes involved in cell growth, differentiation and transformation through their association with zzso zzso We have recently identified the zzso zzso zzso that zzso various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by binding to the zzso domain zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso region zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso has been shown to bind to the zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso We also identified another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, or zzso that zzso zzso of various zzso However, the mechanism of zzso signal zzso by zzso has not been zzso 

We showed that zzso zzso bound to zzso in intact zzso The zzso domain bound to the zzso zzso of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso activity through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity by an essentially similar zzso However, we found that the affinity of the zzso domain of zzso to zzso was weaker than that of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso showed stronger potential for both binding to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity than that of zzso zzso with this notion, zzso containing zzso and zzso domain inhibited zzso zzso activity more efficiently than the zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by binding to the zzso loop through the zzso domain, and zzso is necessary for zzso zzso Although the zzso mechanism by zzso is similar to that by zzso the contributions of the zzso domain and zzso for binding are different between zzso and zzso Our study defined the zzso mechanism of zzso and provides a useful information for creating a novel zzso zzso zzso
