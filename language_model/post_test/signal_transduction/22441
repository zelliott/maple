zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso hormone released from the gut in response to food zzso Whereas zzso acts in the periphery to inhibit zzso zzso and stimulate insulin release, it also acts in the central nervous system to mediate zzso control of zzso body temperature, and cardiovascular zzso Because of its role as an zzso hormone, zzso zzso zzso are used as a treatment for type 2 zzso Central or peripheral administration of zzso increases blood pressure and heart rate, possibly by zzso zzso zzso zzso and increasing zzso nerve zzso However, the zzso by which zzso zzso stimulation affects cardiovascular function are zzso We used the long-lasting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso central zzso control of heart zzso 

using a zzso system, we assessed heart rate in mice during central zzso zzso Heart rate was increased by both acute and chronic central zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the high frequency and low frequency powers of heart rate zzso were diminished by zzso zzso Finally, zzso decreased both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso 

these data suggest that central zzso zzso stimulation diminishes zzso zzso of the heart thereby increasing heart zzso
