Bone zzso is the unique function of zzso zzso and is critical for both bone zzso and zzso bone diseases including zzso zzso arthritis and tumor bone zzso Thus, searching for natural compounds that may suppress zzso formation and/or function is promising for the treatment of zzso zzso In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that zzso suppressed zzso zzso differentiation and bone zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso is supported by the reduced expression of zzso zzso Further molecular analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso which subsequently impaired zzso nuclear zzso zzso signaling zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso studies further verified the bone protection activity of zzso in zzso animal zzso Together our data demonstrate that zzso suppressed zzso zzso formation and function through zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso is a potential natural agent for the treatment of zzso zzso
