The innate immune response is critical for the zzso zzso zzso The human zzso are small, zzso zzso peptides that are made by zzso cells and that play a role in zzso and skin zzso Human zzso 1 zzso is expressed zzso in zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or zzso Previous studies showed that zzso was induced by zzso zzso cell wall extract without the involvement of the zzso zzso factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and zzso The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in zzso induction in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso human oral and zzso zzso were treated separately with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and then zzso with oral zzso zzso zzso oral pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso or skin pathogen zzso zzso Different bacteria induced different levels of zzso and in response to the various zzso tested, although certain common patterns were observed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso However, in addition, zzso induction by zzso bacteria in both oral and zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso bacteria zzso different pathways in zzso induction and suggest that zzso cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso
