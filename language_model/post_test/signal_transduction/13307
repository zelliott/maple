The developing heart in avian zzso has been examined extensively over the past several decades using classic zzso and, more recently, molecular and genetic zzso Still, conflicting reports arise as to the location and regulation of early heart zzso in the zzso In addition, a new source of zzso has been identified recently that contributes to the zzso tract after the heart initially zzso The focus of this review is the examination of the tissue zzso signaling zzso and gene regulatory mechanisms that, together, control heart formation from primary and secondary heart forming fields of the zzso Early studies of the induction and regulation of the secondary heart field indicate that at least some of the events of primary zzso are zzso when the zzso zzso is recruited into the zzso The consideration of classic zzso studies of the heart forming fields in terms of modern molecular and genetic tools provides reinforcing evidence for the location of cardiac zzso in the zzso The accurate definition of early cardiac regulatory events provides a necessary foundation for the generation of new therapeutic sources of zzso
