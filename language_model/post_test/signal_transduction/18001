These studies examine the zzso played by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso after exposure of zzso prostate zzso cells to zzso zzso (2 zzso was found to cause both immediate primary zzso zzso and prolonged secondary zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso of the zzso zzso were abolished by zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The secondary zzso was also abolished by addition of a zzso zzso zzso against transforming growth factor alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could be induced in zzso cells by the transfer of medium from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso blocked this effect, indicating that radiation causes secondary zzso of the zzso zzso by release of zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced a transient zzso growth arrest that was prolonged for up to 24 h by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso significantly increased the ability of radiation to cause zzso 24 h after zzso The ability of zzso cells to zzso after zzso became dependent on zzso zzso When cells were subjected to single doses or zzso radiation exposure, continuous zzso of the zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso Only a small fraction of this cell killing could be accounted for by zzso within the first 96 zzso Thus zzso of the zzso zzso increased zzso cell killing likely by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that disruption of the zzso zzso may represent a strategy that could be exploited to manipulate prostate zzso growth and cell survival after zzso
