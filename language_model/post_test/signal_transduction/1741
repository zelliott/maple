The central role played by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and hence in zzso zzso has led to the development of a number of zzso and oral zzso zzso zzso zzso for use in cardiovascular disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes and zzso The zzso effect of these agents is to inhibit zzso zzso although studies of zzso zzso zzso function and various zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated the potential for these agents to produce effects on other aspects of zzso function, in addition to zzso zzso Overall, clinical studies have demonstrated an impressive beneficial effect for zzso agents in reducing zzso complications following zzso intervention, and a more modest beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with acute coronary zzso Trials with oral zzso zzso zzso in similar patient populations have demonstrated zzso zzso by an increased mortality in treated zzso Increased understanding of molecular aspects of both zzso zzso zzso function and the effects of zzso zzso zzso may help explain some of the inconsistency in recently reported clinical studies with zzso agents, and the frank toxicity of oral zzso Such studies may also hold the key to the development of newer agents with enhanced therapeutic zzso
