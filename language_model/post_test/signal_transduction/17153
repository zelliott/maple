zzso damage often results in zzso of spared zzso due to zzso cell death and dysfunction near the injury zzso Although new zzso are generated following zzso injury and disease, the process of zzso is typically incomplete resulting in long-term functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso and white matter following injury and disease and are a major component of the zzso zzso that suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso at least in part, by the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence demonstrates that zzso inhibit OL process zzso however, the means by which their effects are zzso remains zzso Here we investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso of OL zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso all imposed an zzso effect on OL process outgrowth and zzso These zzso effects were reversed by degradation of zzso with zzso ABC prior to OL zzso zzso zzso of zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso on OL process outgrowth and zzso Likewise, zzso zzso of process outgrowth and zzso was significantly reduced in cultures containing zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased OL process outgrowth and zzso during exposure to zzso These results suggest that in addition to their zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso have multiple zzso actions on zzso that result in incomplete zzso following zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a zzso for zzso and the participation of ROCK downstream of zzso exposure, reveal potential therapeutic targets to enhance white matter repair in the damaged zzso
