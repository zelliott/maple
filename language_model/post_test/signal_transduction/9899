zzso deletion zzso syndrome is characterized genetically by zzso deletions within zzso zzso and clinically by a constellation of zzso zzso of the zzso arch, heart, zzso and zzso zzso described as zzso syndrome zzso Here, we report that compound zzso of mouse zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in a striking increase in the zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso compared to zzso at either zzso Furthermore, we show that these two genes have critical zzso functions in zzso zzso patterning of the zzso apparatus along the zzso zzso and local regulation of zzso acid zzso metabolism and zzso We can partially rescue one salient feature of zzso in zzso zzso by genetically reducing the amount of zzso produced in the zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso is a zzso gene syndrome involving zzso interaction of zzso and zzso and locally zzso zzso zzso
