zzso zzso zzso is present within zzso cells in the central nervous system zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso patients, possibly playing a role in zzso zzso zzso is linked with disease progression in the animal model of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso but the role of specific zzso proteins is zzso Here we report that the progression of zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso sensors zzso and zzso and their common downstream zzso zzso zzso interacting protein 2 zzso also known as zzso and zzso We found that zzso but not zzso zzso 2 zzso played a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso in the zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso and zzso zzso
