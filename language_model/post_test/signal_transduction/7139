This study investigated if zinc plays a role in zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso rat hearts were subjected to 30 zzso regional zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by 6 cycles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso were measured with zzso coupled plasma optical zzso zzso zzso zzso size was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso were decreased dramatically upon zzso in the control zzso In contrast, zzso increased zzso zinc levels at zzso The zzso effect of zzso was inhibited by the selective zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso levels of the zzso injury salvage zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso which were nullified by zzso zzso decreased the activity of protein zzso 2A zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zinc zzso zzso inhibited the protective effect of zzso on zzso injury in zzso zzso These results suggest that zinc plays an important role in the zzso effect of zzso presumably by enhancing the zzso of the RISK zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zinc may, at least in part, account for the zzso of the RISK zzso
