We have previously shown that the expression of zzso is significantly zzso in human zzso cancer zzso and that zzso suppresses cell zzso and zzso of cancer zzso To clarify the molecular mechanism of this suppression by zzso we searched for zzso proteins and identified zzso which interacts with and activates zzso by mass analysis of proteins zzso with zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso The association between zzso and zzso was confirmed by a zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with expression plasmids of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso with zzso in this zzso zzso experiments in zzso also showed that zzso could activate zzso Introduction of zzso for zzso suppressed zzso zzso by zzso zzso with deletion zzso of zzso revealed that the zzso region of zzso was necessary and sufficient for the association with zzso and the zzso zzso The suppression of zzso by zzso was attenuated by zzso targeting zzso or zzso in zzso zzso embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These findings indicate that zzso is involved in the suppression of cell zzso via the zzso signaling zzso
