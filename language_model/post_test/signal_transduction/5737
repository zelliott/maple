zzso signaling is critical for multiple aspects of zzso but how it regulates the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells zzso and intermediate neural zzso zzso has not been well zzso especially in zzso In this study, we zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso which mediates signaling from all four zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso mouse and a newly established zzso zzso We found that at early stage of zzso zzso the frequency of zzso increased significantly in the zzso zzso The majority of the zzso deficient zzso were composed of zzso suggesting the precocious differentiation of zzso into zzso Meanwhile, zzso differentiation was reduced in the same regions at zzso inconsistent with the precocious differentiation zzso in most zzso zzso At late zzso stages zzso and zzso as expected from zzso exhausted zzso pool, zzso frequency and zzso decreased in the zzso regions, accompanied by a significant increase of both zzso and zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso signaling might inhibit the differentiation of zzso into zzso and support the generation of certain early born zzso at early zzso zzso
