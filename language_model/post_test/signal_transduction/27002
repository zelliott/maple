The expression of zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is rapidly and zzso increased by nerve growth factor zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of this gene includes four serum response elements zzso a zzso response element, an zzso response element, and an zzso zzso From deletion analysis of zzso zzso reporter zzso we have established that the first 106 zzso zzso of the zzso start site are sufficient for induction of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso deletion beyond this point results in dramatically reduced induction of the zzso Using defined zzso in the zzso promoter and zzso zzso hybrid zzso we have defined three elements zzso zzso and zzso in the first 106 zzso of upstream DNA, each of which contributes to induction of zzso by zzso Cooperation by two of these elements zzso the two zzso or one zzso and the zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso induction by zzso but the combination of all three elements increased induction by zzso more effectively than a pair of zzso This suggests that the response of zzso to zzso is zzso by a zzso sequence that is composed of at least three distinct zzso An zzso composed of zzso and zzso that can zzso the ability for zzso induction to zzso promoter zzso complexes with proteins in zzso cell nuclear zzso but the zzso complexes do not appear to be altered by zzso treatment, as measured by DNA mobility shift zzso We have also established that the regulatory region of zzso that mediates zzso induction also mediates the induction by serum and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that multiple signal zzso pathways must zzso on these sequences to regulate the expression of this zzso
