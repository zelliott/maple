A zzso and zzso zzso current has been described in sensory zzso which probably has a role in temperature zzso Here we describe the zzso channels underlying this zzso zzso activated zzso zzso channels zzso about 22 zzso reversal potential, zzso zzso in zzso patches from zzso rat zzso root zzso zzso and their activity was strongly increased by zzso The zzso threshold was zzso degrees C, shifting to zzso degrees C in 100 zzso zzso about 10 degrees C colder than observed in intact zzso zzso in excised patches did not adapt to sustained zzso unlike the current in intact zzso We conclude that the zzso channels underlying the zzso and zzso current are directly activated by these zzso although other zzso factors appear to be important in determining threshold and zzso
