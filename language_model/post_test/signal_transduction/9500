Although proteins are translated on zzso zzso many of these proteins play essential roles in the nucleus, zzso key cellular processes including but not limited to DNA replication and repair as well as zzso and zzso zzso Thus, understanding how these critical nuclear proteins are accurately targeted to the nucleus is of paramount importance in zzso zzso and structural studies in the recent years have jointly revealed some general rules on the specificity zzso of the recognition of nuclear targeting signals by their specific zzso at least for two nuclear import zzso zzso the classical pathway, which involves the classical nuclear zzso sequences zzso and the receptors zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso pathway, which employs the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The understanding of specificity rules allows the prediction of protein nuclear zzso We review the current understanding of the molecular zzso of the specificity of nuclear import, focusing on the zzso recognition, as well as the currently available databases and zzso tools relevant to nuclear zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso of Signaling and Cellular Fate through zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso
