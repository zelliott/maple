zzso inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso injury, result from zzso factors, including zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso of innate zzso and zzso of zzso zzso At the same time, a number of zzso or zzso pathways are also zzso and the extent of zzso damage is ultimately determined by the balance between these two zzso In liver zzso members of the zzso protein zzso zzso family are known to be zzso but their individual roles are largely zzso In this study, we show that one zzso member, zzso is protective in zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso knockout mice experience significantly worse organ damage after zzso and are deficient in zzso zzso zzso Restoration of zzso signaling with zzso reduces organ damage in zzso knockout mice to zzso zzso In zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso and that zzso zzso protects zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso In conclusion, the protective zzso signaling zzso serves to reduce organ damage following zzso and is regulated by zzso of zzso signaling in zzso
