During zzso division, a cell zzso and zzso distributes components to its opposite zzso The subsequent division zzso zzso the two component pools to the daughters, which thereby inherit different zzso zzso In zzso sensory organ precursor cells, the zzso of zzso protein to the cell's anterior zzso is a key patterning event and is achieved by the combined action of many zzso including zzso which itself is localized zzso Here, a role is described for the zzso G protein Go in the anterior zzso of zzso and daughter cell fate zzso Go is shown to interact with zzso In addition to a role in recruiting zzso to an zzso location in the cell's cortex, Go zzso a signal from the zzso zzso that directs the position in which the complex zzso Thus, Go likely zzso the signaling that directs the formation of the complex with the signaling that directs where the complex zzso
