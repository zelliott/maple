The dental pulp is a loose zzso tissue located within rigid zzso zzso zzso when subjected to a zzso the zzso tissue has little expansion zzso The defense mechanisms of this tissue include the formation of zzso zzso as well as the production of signaling molecules that help in the zzso The zzso zzso is rich in growth factors zzso that, when diluted and diffused into the pulp zzso aid the healing process of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso participate in this zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso for zzso cells, promotes zzso cell survival and zzso Among its zzso zzso seems to be the most intimately associated with zzso activities, cell migration, vascular zzso and survival of zzso zzso This literature review addresses the zzso process that occurs in response to a pulp stimulus up to its zzso in the target cell, describing the zzso as well as its characteristics and zzso The reported studies have correlated the expression of zzso and its potential functions that may have an impact on several dental zzso thus indicating that further clinical investigations should be conducted in order to translate the results obtained until this moment primarily in laboratory zzso
