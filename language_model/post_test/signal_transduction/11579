The budding zzso zzso zzso generates calcium signals during the response to mating zzso that promote survival of zzso zzso A zzso channel composed of zzso and zzso was previously shown to be necessary for the production of these calcium zzso However, we find that the zzso zzso zzso influx system zzso contributes very little to signaling or survival after treatment with zzso in rich zzso zzso activity was much greater after zzso zzso or zzso suggesting the zzso zzso channel is subject to direct or indirect regulation by zzso Instead a distinct zzso zzso influx system zzso was zzso by zzso signaling in rich zzso zzso activity was insensitive to zzso activity, independent of zzso and zzso and sufficient to elevate zzso free zzso zzso zzso in spite of its zzso lower affinity for zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of this zzso factor in zzso zzso double zzso had no effect on zzso activity but zzso zzso activity when zzso was also zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of another target of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso required treatment with mating zzso even in zzso zzso double zzso and also required zzso zzso and zzso which are necessary for proper cell cycle arrest and polarized zzso These results show that distinct branches of the zzso zzso independently regulate zzso and zzso activities, either of which can promote survival during long-term zzso
