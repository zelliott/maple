To investigate the expression of zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso and explore its significance in the progression of zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso was detected in 116 normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso specimens using zzso zzso and the relationship between the expression of zzso zzso protein and the zzso factors was zzso 

The zzso rates of the expression of zzso zzso protein increased gradually in the progression of zzso cancer and showed significant differences between the zzso zzso A significant difference was also noted in the zzso rates of the zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso at different zzso stages zzso No obvious correlation was found between zzso zzso expression and the degree of the tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression occurs in the progression of zzso cancer in close relation to the clinical stage, and the zzso zzso plays an important role in the progression of zzso zzso
