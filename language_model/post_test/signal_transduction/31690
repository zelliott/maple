A previous study has shown that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of gastric cancer cells through blocking zzso zzso signal zzso indicating that the zzso may be a potential zzso zzso In the present study, the role of zzso II in the zzso zzso of zzso factors in the zzso signal zzso zzso was zzso zzso human gastric cancer cells were infected with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to increase the expression of zzso II and treated with zzso to activate the zzso Using zzso reporter zzso it was revealed that zzso II markedly suppressed the zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso effect of zzso on zzso activity, the expression levels of zzso and zzso components of zzso were also zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso treatment increased the zzso content through inducing the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, this combination was efficiently blocked by activated zzso While zzso with zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not the zzso of zzso induced by zzso These data suggest that zzso II zzso the zzso proliferation of gastric cancer cells through suppressing zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
