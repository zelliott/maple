zzso zzso comprises zzso replication and differentiation into zzso zzso zzso Agents that interfere with zzso replication are important tools for the understanding of zzso Recently, we showed that cholesterol depletion by zzso zzso enhances the differentiation step in zzso zzso cells, involving the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso However, the effects of cholesterol depletion on zzso replication have not been carefully zzso Here we show that zzso treatment increases cell proliferation in primary chick zzso cell zzso Treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso immediately following cholesterol zzso blocks the zzso effects on zzso zzso depletion induced an increase in the number of zzso zzso cells, and an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in the expression of the cell cycle regulator zzso and the master switch gene zzso Treatment with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso induced effects similar to zzso on cell zzso while treatment with zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso pathway, neutralized the effects of zzso These findings indicate that rapid changes in the cholesterol content in cell zzso of zzso can induce cell zzso possibly by the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
