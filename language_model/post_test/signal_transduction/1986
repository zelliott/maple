The budding zzso zzso exit network zzso is a zzso signal zzso cascade that controls the release of the zzso zzso from the zzso in zzso and thereby drives zzso zzso We show that zzso is partially released from the zzso in early zzso independent of the action of the zzso components zzso zzso and zzso Upon release, zzso binds to the zzso pole body zzso via association with the zzso zzso zzso protein complex, which is known to regulate the activity of the G protein zzso zzso also interacts with this zzso The association of the zzso component zzso with the zzso acts as a marker of zzso zzso The simultaneous binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso in early zzso suggests that zzso initially activates the zzso In a second, later step, which zzso with zzso exit, zzso zzso the zzso complex by zzso zzso This zzso the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso These data indicate that zzso activates the zzso in early zzso but later zzso it through zzso zzso and so restricts zzso activity to a short period in zzso
