zzso increases the tolerable zzso time for zzso in zzso zzso but precise mechanisms are not clearly zzso Here we studied zzso of zzso cell survival zzso in a zzso model of emergency preservation and delayed zzso 

zzso rats underwent zzso blood volume zzso zzso during 10 minutes and were zzso into 2 groups based on core body temperatures zzso zzso zzso zzso (15 degrees zzso and zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso was induced by zzso cold zzso solution using zzso bypass zzso zzso After reaching target body temperature, zzso state zzso flow rate of 20 zzso was maintained for 60 zzso zzso rats were zzso to baseline zzso all rats were zzso on zzso and monitored for 3 zzso The zzso group underwent identical zzso zzso zzso rats (no zzso no zzso were used as controls zzso zzso zzso zzso were harvested at the end of zzso 

zzso of zzso increased survival rates zzso versus zzso in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of cardiac tissue revealed increased levels of zzso zzso in zzso and sham groups compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Among downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were considerably elevated in the zzso group compared with the zzso zzso zzso also showed decreased activity of zzso protein compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting decreased zzso 

zzso zzso increases survival in a zzso model of zzso shock and prolonged zzso zzso zzso preserves zzso signaling zzso in zzso with a concurrent decrease in cardiac zzso
