Recent findings indicate that the function of metabolically relevant genes is finely regulated at the level of gene zzso zzso of these regulatory pathways often lead to zzso zzso and to the onset of socially relevant diseases, zzso diabetes, zzso syndrome, zzso and cardiovascular zzso The ability of zzso zzso such as fatty acids and zzso to signal to cells and zzso and to affect gene zzso by zzso specific nuclear receptors has been known since several zzso zzso acids have been known in the past as cholesterol end products, purely acting as zzso Only recently new biological properties of zzso acids as signaling molecules have been disclosed and zzso In this review, we will describe how zzso acids can regulate their own synthesis and other zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso by modulating gene zzso through multiple zzso These findings also open new perspectives towards the exploitation of zzso acid metabolism as a pharmacological zzso
