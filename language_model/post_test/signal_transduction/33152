zzso zzso elicits zzso signals in many cell zzso This study analyzes the effect of zzso zzso on human cells capable of spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso Such cells have been induced in zzso and represent a highly mature B cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso B cells inhibited zzso of their spontaneous zzso zzso The effect was exerted early in the culture and could be reversed by a zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso although not a close zzso also reduced zzso zzso to a similar zzso The inclusion of a zzso inhibitor for certain zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso B zzso B cells capable of spontaneous zzso zzso obtained from blood of zzso volunteers were also inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, bone zzso zzso B cells capable of spontaneous zzso zzso were unaffected by these zzso This zzso zzso zzso of zzso and blood zzso B cells could not be reversed by zzso with demonstrated activity on these B zzso Human mature B cells induced in zzso are identifiable as zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that a fraction of zzso zzso cells expressed low levels of zzso Moreover, about zzso of these cells exhibited zzso zzso as defined by zzso V zzso This phenomenon was markedly increased by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso cells showed neither zzso expression nor zzso zzso V zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso might play a role in the control of human zzso responses by inducing zzso in susceptible mature B zzso
