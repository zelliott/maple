zzso growth restriction zzso is related to a higher zzso of type 2 diabetes zzso We previously reported reduced zzso and increased zzso 6 zzso zzso in zzso zzso which are features of insulin zzso We aimed to investigate zzso insulin zzso zzso function and zzso in human zzso and subsequently the relationships of insulin zzso peptides with zzso protein content in zzso insulin, zzso and zzso and with parameters of fetal zzso 

Whole zzso tissue was collected from 18 zzso and 24 appropriate for zzso age zzso zzso of comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by using western zzso or specific research zzso 

The amount of total zzso was similar in both groups but activated zzso significantly higher in zzso Total zzso zzso zzso was increased in zzso whereas total zzso and activated zzso were zzso zzso content was reduced and activated zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content was reduced in zzso Total and activated zzso was similar in zzso and zzso groups, and total zzso was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso content and activated zzso zzso were found also with zzso and zzso zzso correlated zzso with all growth parameters at zzso 

zzso was more activated in zzso of zzso compared with zzso however, signal zzso downstream of the zzso was zzso The increase in activated zzso could be in zzso of a zzso mechanism to increase insulin zzso Close relationships of insulin action in zzso with fetal growth were zzso
