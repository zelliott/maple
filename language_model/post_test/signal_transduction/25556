The liver displays a remarkable phenomenon known as zzso zzso zzso specialized zzso fulfill different zzso functions that depend on their position along the zzso zzso distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso is established have been extensively investigated since its initial zzso Using zzso models with zzso conditional zzso or zzso in the liver, a major role for the zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated in this functional zzso of zzso Under zzso conditions, this zzso is activated in zzso zzso This is partly due to the absence in the zzso area of zzso zzso coli, a negative regulator also known as the zzso of the liver zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso genetic program and zzso a zzso genetic program in these zzso In mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling also controls zzso proliferation through a zzso zzso This zzso therefore controls metabolism and proliferation in liver cells, its role in proliferation being consistent with its involvement in liver zzso Finally, the zzso zzso factor zzso has been shown to play a role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso From these findings, it now appears that the zzso interplay of different zzso factors with zzso supports liver zzso zzso We propose that zzso approaches using zzso zzso will allow to further explore the molecular zzso of zzso liver zzso
