Global cellular responses induced by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso occur immediately with a less than zzso occupancy among tens of thousands of zzso molecules on single cell zzso zzso of zzso requires the formation of a signaling zzso of zzso bound with a single zzso to each zzso How sufficient numbers of signaling zzso are formed at such low occupancy rate is still not zzso Here, we have analyzed the zzso of zzso binding and the formation of the signaling zzso using zzso imaging and mathematical zzso A small number of zzso on the cell surface formed zzso binding sites, which bound zzso two orders of magnitude faster than the zzso binding zzso There was a positive cooperative binding of zzso to the zzso binding sites through a newly discovered kinetic zzso These two mechanisms facilitate the formation of signaling zzso of zzso zzso
