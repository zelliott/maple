Many cellular functions are carried out by zzso zzso The last five years of research have revealed that many zzso coupled zzso zzso functions that are not zzso by G proteins involve protein networks, which interact with their zzso zzso This review focuses on one family of zzso activated by zzso the zzso zzso family, which comprises three closely related zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso These receptors still raise particular interest, because a large number of psychoactive drugs including zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate their action, at least in part, through zzso of zzso zzso Recent studies based on zzso screens, zzso zzso and cell biology approaches, have shown that the zzso zzso of zzso receptors interact with zzso zzso To date, the protein network associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso has been the most extensively zzso using a zzso approach combining affinity zzso mass zzso and zzso It includes scaffolding proteins containing one or several zzso zzso zzso proteins and proteins of the zzso Data indicating that the protein complexes interacting with zzso zzso zzso tightly control zzso trafficking and zzso zzso will also be zzso
