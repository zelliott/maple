Exposure of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso from zzso bacteria activates the zzso signaling zzso At early times, this leads to their production of zzso zzso but zzso they produce zzso zzso zzso to quell the immune zzso zzso induction of zzso gene expression requires the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso As zzso exerts modest effects upon zzso zzso stability, we hypothesized that zzso controls the expression of signaling zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso restores both signaling zzso To define the molecular mechanisms by which zzso controls zzso zzso we focused on the zzso zzso in search of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso serves to maintain proper levels of the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso complex to activate zzso zzso However, zzso does not control the zzso zzso levels but instead promotes the translation of the zzso Thus, zzso regulates a critical zzso within the zzso signaling zzso to permit zzso induction for the zzso arm of an innate immune zzso
