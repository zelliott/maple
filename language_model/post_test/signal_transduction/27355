The survival, zzso and maintenance of responsive zzso are regulated by nerve growth factor zzso which is zzso by the target and interacts with receptors on the zzso zzso It is uncertain how the zzso signal is communicated zzso from zzso zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso transport of activated receptors in zzso zzso could convey the zzso However, little is known about zzso of zzso zzso and there is no evidence that zzso receptors continue to signal after zzso We have examined early events in the membrane traffic of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced rapid and extensive zzso of zzso in these cells, and the zzso subsequently moved into small zzso located near the plasma zzso Some of these zzso contained zzso and zzso which implies that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Using mechanical zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso were separated from the plasma zzso After zzso treatment, zzso was bound to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and bound to zzso suggesting that these receptors were competent to initiate signal zzso These studies raise the possibility that zzso zzso formation of signaling zzso containing activated zzso They are an important first step in zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso retrograde zzso
