zzso has been recognized to be a zzso stress to the zzso zzso The cell zzso pathways linking zzso stress and inflammation have not been well zzso This study investigated whether exposure of human zzso zzso cells to zzso stress activates the zzso protein zzso zzso pathways and zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso cultures in normal zzso media zzso zzso were exposed to media with higher zzso zzso zzso by adding zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso or zzso for different lengths of zzso The zzso media were collected after 24 zzso of treatment for zzso Total zzso was extracted from cultures treated for 6 zzso for zzso zzso zzso treated for zzso zzso were zzso in zzso buffer and subjected to Western zzso with zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in 24 zzso zzso media of zzso zzso cells progressively increased as the media zzso increased from 312 to 500 zzso Active zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso and peaked at 60 zzso in cells exposed to zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso were positively correlated with the medium zzso zzso zzso and zzso markedly suppressed the levels of zzso and/or zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins zzso by zzso zzso These findings provide direct evidence that zzso zzso inflammation in human zzso zzso cells by increasing expression and production of zzso zzso and zzso a process that appears to be zzso through zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso in treating zzso surface diseases may be due to its ability to suppress zzso and zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso production in the zzso zzso
