zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso gait and zzso In this zzso the cerebral and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso components are zzso located in these laminated zzso Since zzso the gene responsible for the zzso zzso was discovered by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remarkable progress has occurred in this zzso The zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso zzso that is crucial for zzso zzso During zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso cells in the cerebral zzso and in the outer zzso cells in the zzso zzso Although zzso structures such as facial nucleus, inferior zzso complex, and zzso cochlear nucleus are also zzso zzso in this zzso only a few studies have been done to clarify the detailed abnormalities in these zzso zzso In this review, we focused on the zzso zzso in the facial nucleus of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the facial nucleus are generated from the zzso zone of the floor of the fourth zzso migrate zzso and finally settle near the zzso surface of the zzso Time schedules for the generation, zzso formation and migration of facial zzso are similar both in the normal and zzso mice, but the zzso zzso becomes identifiable at the end of zzso zzso Although the reason why the facial nucleus is zzso abnormal in the zzso mouse is still unknown, the long migration of the facial zzso seems to be susceptible to the absence of zzso in the zzso zzso In spite of the zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso zzso study confirmed that the zzso arrangements within the facial nucleus of the zzso mouse are still zzso suggesting that zzso migration and target recognition are regulated zzso More recently, other zzso zzso have been zzso Among them, zzso and zzso mice arise from zzso in zzso a mouse gene related to zzso gene disabled zzso More than 10 years ago, an zzso zzso rat zzso shaking rat zzso zzso was described that exhibits a zzso identical to zzso but the gene responsible for this rat zzso remains zzso Interestingly, the facial nucleus is zzso more zzso in zzso and zzso than their zzso zzso Although the reason why zzso exhibits a zzso identical to zzso in the laminated structures but not in zzso structures such as the facial nucleus has remained obscure, zzso and zzso proteins may function as signaling molecules in a different way between laminated and zzso zzso zzso resembling that of zzso are seen with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are respectively the zzso and regulatory zzso of a zzso zzso that could potentially operate in a common zzso zzso with zzso and zzso These plausible partners for zzso and zzso should help us to understand how the activities of these proteins coordinate zzso migration and zzso
