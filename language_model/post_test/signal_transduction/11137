zzso cells play a pivotal role in regulation and maintenance of zzso They are zzso regulated predominantly by zzso hormone zzso and testosterone zzso Although zzso and T have distinct mechanisms of action they act zzso in promoting zzso zzso of freshly isolated zzso cells with zzso evokes a prompt rise in zzso calcium which is zzso reproduced by zzso The zzso calcium response to zzso in zzso cells is predominantly attributable to serial signaling after the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells may also be regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormones such as zzso II zzso and zzso acting via zzso zzso generation induce zzso calcium rise predominantly derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso action on zzso calcium reveal a common mechanism of action between the zzso and steroid regulators of zzso cell function, indicating that zzso calcium zzso may represent a unifying zzso mechanism that could explain the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso rapidly and specifically increase zzso zzso consistent with a plasma membrane site of zzso This argues for the possible existence of a short term zzso signaling zzso in hormonal regulation of zzso cell function in addition to the classical longer term, slower zzso zzso
