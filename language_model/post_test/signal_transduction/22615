zzso syndrome zzso is the zzso phase of zzso T cell zzso characterized by the proliferation of zzso derived zzso T cells that release zzso of the zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso are markedly depressed as is expression of zzso a pivotal zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells express both the beta 1 and beta 2 chains of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso T cells express only the zzso beta 1 and thus do not zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso To determine whether SS cells are zzso at the level of zzso signal zzso we analyzed zzso from seven patients for the presence of message for the zzso beta 1 and beta 2 genes using zzso protection zzso and assessed whether zzso induced zzso of zzso by zzso In zzso from six of seven SS patients tested, beta 2 message was expressed at low to zzso levels and its expression could not be zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso which zzso beta 2 expression in control zzso The absence of beta 2 expression is further supportive evidence for the zzso lineage of SS zzso However, unlike normal zzso cells, SS cells also showed severely reduced levels of zzso suggesting that they have a depressed response to any zzso of the zzso signal zzso pathway, including zzso This is the first observation linking zzso gene expression with a human disease and suggests that zzso of zzso expression may be significant to the development and/or progression of zzso
