G protein zzso zzso have potential as a target for therapeutic treatment of a number of zzso We performed virtual zzso of a zzso library to a site on zzso zzso that mediates protein zzso We hypothesized that differential targeting of this surface could allow for selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso Several compounds bound to zzso zzso with affinities from zzso to 60 zzso and selectively modulated functional zzso interactions in zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso and zzso zzso analgesia in zzso These data demonstrate an approach for zzso of G zzso zzso signaling that may represent an important therapeutic zzso
