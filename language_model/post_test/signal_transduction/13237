zzso acid zzso is a natural zzso with multiple biological zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso a zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso can be zzso by expression of zzso or zzso in cells lacking zzso zzso Compared to insulin, zzso stimulates only modest zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso B zzso that does not correlate with the magnitude of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso block zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the effect of zzso but not that of insulin or zzso growth factor zzso is sensitive to protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity selectively reduces zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, several zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso To confirm a specific role for zzso in regulation of zzso we further studied signaling properties of zzso zzso beta zzso zzso in zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso In clones expressing a zzso zzso wherein the zzso that couple to zzso and other signaling functions are zzso with the link to zzso zzso zzso left intact, zzso is fully capable of stimulating zzso zzso The process is sensitive to zzso zzso in contrast to the response through the zzso zzso zzso growth factors, such as zzso which control zzso mainly through the zzso zzso possess the ability to regulate zzso through an alternative, redundant zzso zzso zzso and potentially other natural zzso primarily zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso
