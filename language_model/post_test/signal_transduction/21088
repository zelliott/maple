Members of the nuclear factor zzso family zzso factors are induced during zzso selection and in mature T zzso after zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso Despite these findings, disruption of individual zzso genes has revealed no intrinsic zzso in the development of mature T cells, perhaps reflecting functional zzso To circumvent this possibility, the T cell lineage was targeted to express a zzso form of zzso that zzso zzso the activity of multiple zzso zzso zzso cells expressing this inhibitor exhibit a significant zzso zzso which is not reversed by the addition of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso stimulation of zzso leads to increased zzso of transgenic T cells as compared with zzso In addition to zzso T cell growth and survival, zzso expression zzso the development of normal T cell populations as evidenced by diminished numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was significantly amplified in the periphery and was accompanied by a decrease in zzso T zzso Taken together, these in zzso findings indicate that the zzso signaling zzso contains zzso components that are essential for the establishment of normal T cell zzso
