zzso are regarded as one of the well-known foods and zzso materials with a great deal of zzso zzso zzso is the major component of mushrooms that displays various biological activities such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we compared the zzso potency of zzso zzso prepared from liquid culture of zzso zzso zzso with a potent zzso zzso zzso and their molecular mechanisms on the functional zzso of zzso We found that fraction II zzso was able to comparably zzso or highly enhance the zzso functions of zzso such NO production and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso triggered the zzso of zzso a critical step for zzso zzso and zzso Of the upstream signaling zzso tested, zzso and zzso were thought to be the responsible upstream signaling components in induction of NO production, although zzso strongly zzso the zzso of all zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso may exert its zzso activities with similar potency to zzso via zzso of multiple signaling pathways linked to zzso zzso
