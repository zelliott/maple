Bone zzso proteins zzso and growth differentiation factors zzso control the development and zzso of multiple tissue types in many organisms, from humans to zzso These zzso are expressed in a zzso manner and they signal by binding to zzso zzso zzso resulting in coordinated changes in gene expression that regulate the differentiation and development of multiple tissue zzso In addition, these proteins are regulated zzso through binding to several soluble zzso In this review we focus on a subset of zzso and zzso that have been implicated in the zzso of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso
