With over eight million cases of tuberculosis each year there is a pressing need for the development of new vaccines against zzso zzso zzso vaccines consisting of zzso proteins are an attractive vaccine approach due to their inherent safety compared to attenuated live vaccines and the uniformity of zzso zzso of properly formulated zzso zzso zzso to zzso protein vaccines enhances the zzso zzso T cell response characterized by zzso and zzso both of which are critical for the control of zzso We have developed a clinical stage vaccine candidate consisting of a zzso fusion protein zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Here we examine whether zzso can be improved by the addition of a second zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing DNA to zzso enhanced the magnitude of the zzso zzso response against zzso characterized by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso also improved the protective efficacy of zzso Finally we demonstrate that this zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is independent of zzso zzso whereas zzso is necessary for the zzso activity of zzso in the absence of zzso
