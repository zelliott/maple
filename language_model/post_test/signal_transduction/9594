It is well known that bone zzso zzso differentiate into zzso in response to zzso and zzso in zzso However, the characteristics and dynamics of zzso precursors in zzso are not zzso Cell cycle arrest in zzso precursors is a prerequisite step for their differentiation into zzso We named such precursors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso potent analogue of zzso 25 zzso zzso , zzso or zzso to mice induced zzso differentiation from zzso Moreover, zzso appearing in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone were also differentiated from zzso without cell zzso These results indicate that zzso are formed from zzso in response to bone zzso stimuli in zzso zzso zzso circulate in the zzso and settle in the right place for zzso Here I review recent advances in our understanding of zzso precursors in zzso
