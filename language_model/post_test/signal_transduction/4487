We previously reported that zzso which belongs to the zzso family of zzso is elevated in the serum of patients infected with influenza A virus zzso Here, we show that the expression of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso human lung zzso cells and human peripheral blood zzso cells infected with zzso Additionally, zzso triggered zzso expression through protein zzso A and zzso zzso protein zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso replication by zzso zzso and activated zzso factor protein zzso R zzso Clinical analysis showed that zzso levels were significantly elevated in a cohort of patients infected with zzso compared with healthy individuals and that circulating zzso levels were tightly and positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso expression is one host immune factor produced in response to zzso infection and that elevated zzso levels inhibit viral zzso
