In recent years inherited variations in zzso proteins have emerged as potential risk factors that could zzso individuals to zzso zzso Although many studies have examined the association of zzso gene zzso with particular disease states, the underlying mechanisms by which most of these zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso have remained largely zzso This review will focus on the cellular and molecular features by which these genetic changes affect zzso zzso Although many genes have been investigated in this regard, only the genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied in any zzso In some cases (such as zzso zzso evidence supports a quantitative trait zzso For other zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to structural and functional zzso A large portion of this review will focus on the widely studied zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and will consider the potential mechanisms by which the zzso zzso could induce a zzso zzso A detailed understanding of how zzso zzso zzso physiology will be important for understanding individual differences in response to zzso zzso
