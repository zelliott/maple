zzso zzso are essential for life, but zzso formation in zzso zzso such as the vascular system or heart is poorly zzso Two studies in this issue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso reveal unexpected roles for the zzso signaling system during zzso zzso heart zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso the cell shape changes and zzso of zzso zzso that drive zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to the well-known zzso role of zzso and zzso in guiding cell zzso here zzso and zzso may act by zzso zzso In addition, the two groups demonstrate that heart zzso formation is even more distinct from typical zzso zzso mechanisms because the heart zzso is bounded by membrane surfaces that have zzso rather than zzso zzso As the zzso zzso zzso are thought to have significant evolutionary similarity to zzso zzso and cardiac zzso these findings are likely to provide insights into mechanisms of zzso heart and vascular zzso
