The zzso that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso is ubiquitous in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous zzso However, little is known regarding its cellular mechanisms of zzso This zzso has been recently zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso permitting detailed study of the pharmacology and coupled biological activities of this zzso In the present study, we compare the ability of zzso receptors to alter cell function with that of receptors zzso expressed in small numbers by the rat zzso cell line zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso with high affinity in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso and zzso lower zzso respectively, for zzso receptors in either cell zzso For both cell systems, zzso binding was observed between 5 and 15 zzso at 22 zzso Both cell types zzso zzso at similar rates, with zzso zzso of bound zzso being zzso by 60 zzso at 22 zzso The zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso was zzso in causing a decrease in binding of zzso due to decreased zzso affinity in both cell types, without a change in zzso number, demonstrating that the zzso zzso remained coupled to a zzso zzso protein in both native and zzso zzso In both cell systems, zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased in a zzso fashion, with similar zzso values being obtained for zzso in both cell types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso analogue zzso 1855 zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso mobilized zzso zzso in both cell systems, and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso of the zzso for zzso stimulates zzso C and increases zzso zzso These results also demonstrate that zzso and native zzso receptors behave similarly, suggesting that the zzso cell line will be useful in future studies investigating zzso zzso as well as in molecular biological studies of the zzso relationship of the zzso
