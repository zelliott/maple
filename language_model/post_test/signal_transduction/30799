zzso resistance of skeletal muscle is a major zzso in obesity and type 2 zzso zzso resistance has been associated with a chronic zzso inflammatory state in zzso studies and specifically with zzso of the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether this zzso plays a role in zzso insulin resistance in muscle in zzso We separately zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in single muscles of rats using in zzso zzso and compared the effects after 1 zzso zzso paired zzso control zzso A zzso increase in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to cause muscle fiber zzso but had no effect on zzso disposal or zzso storage in muscle under zzso clamp zzso Similarly, a zzso increase in zzso expression zzso zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in zzso protein but also had no effect on clamp zzso disposal after zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso in particular caused increases in zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso a moderate increase in flux through the insulin signaling zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso resulted in a negative feedback reduction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso zzso in muscle does not seem to be an important local zzso of insulin zzso
