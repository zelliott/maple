Many plant species can modify their root architecture to enable them to forage for zzso distributed nutrients in the zzso The zzso response normally involves increased proliferation of lateral roots within zzso soil patches, but much remains to be understood about the zzso mechanisms that enable roots to sense variations in the external zzso of different mineral nutrients and to modify their patterns of growth and development zzso 

In this review we consider different aspects of the way in which the nitrogen supply can modify root zzso focusing on zzso zzso Our current understanding of the mechanism of nitrate stimulation of lateral root growth and the role of the zzso gene are zzso In addition, evidence supporting the possible role of zzso in regulating the systemic zzso of early lateral root development by high rates of nitrate supply is zzso Finally, we examine recent evidence that an zzso acid, zzso can act as an external signal to elicit complex changes in root growth and zzso 

It is clear that plants have evolved sophisticated pathways for sensing and responding to changes in different components of the external nitrogen supply as well as their own internal nitrogen zzso We speculate on the possibility that the effects zzso by external zzso represent a novel form of zzso response that could potentially enhance a plant's ability to compete with its zzso and zzso for localized sources of organic zzso
