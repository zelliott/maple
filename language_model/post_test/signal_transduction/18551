zzso cells in growing tumors express activated zzso which when modeled by transgenic zzso expression of zzso was sufficient to zzso the abnormal structural and functional features of tumor blood vessels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused increased blood vessel size and generalized zzso from chronic vascular zzso while acute zzso in response to zzso was zzso These changes were zzso demonstrating an ongoing requirement for zzso signaling for the maintenance of these zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso vascular changes from zzso tumor growth, and tumor vascular zzso zzso signaling in the tumor vascular zzso was sensitive to zzso suggesting that zzso may affect tumor growth in part by acting as a vascular zzso zzso
