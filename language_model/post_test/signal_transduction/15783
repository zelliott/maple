zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in the development of zzso associated with fatty liver, insulin resistance, and impaired suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is emerging as a critical player in various zzso zzso pathways and regulates zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso In this study, we zzso the critical role of zzso in zzso zzso signaling to regulate zzso zzso in primary rat and human zzso zzso and protein levels and zzso production were analyzed in primary rat and human zzso zzso zzso were performed together with various zzso analyses using standard zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso specifically induced zzso gene expression via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso binding to the zzso binding site in the zzso gene zzso zzso treatment significantly induced zzso zzso gene expression and zzso production in primary zzso and we demonstrated that the zzso binding site zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso gene expression and zzso production, and the zzso zzso zzso or insulin exhibited repression of zzso gene induction and subsequently inhibited zzso in both rat and human primary zzso These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of activated zzso signaling to induce zzso zzso via direct zzso of zzso thereby contributing to a better understanding of the zzso signaling mechanism involved in regulating the zzso zzso zzso
