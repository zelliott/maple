zzso are a zzso of zzso molecular motor zzso among which the bipolar filament forming zzso II have been the most zzso The activity of smooth zzso zzso II is regulated by zzso of the regulatory light zzso that in turn is modulated by the zzso activity of zzso light chain zzso and zzso light chain zzso The zzso activity is mainly regulated through zzso of its zzso binding zzso zzso To identify the function of these zzso events, we have zzso characterized the zzso zzso of zzso and analyzed its zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso is required for cell sheet movement during zzso closure, zzso of the eye, and ring canal growth during zzso Our results indicate that the regulation of the zzso of zzso regulatory light zzso or dynamic zzso and zzso of zzso II, is essential for its various functions during many zzso zzso
