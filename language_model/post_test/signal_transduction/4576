zzso peptides are involved in the balance between cell division and differentiation throughout plant development, including zzso Previously, two zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had been identified whose expression correlated with zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that both zzso and zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to control zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso which is essential for zzso organ formation, regulates zzso zzso In addition, simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in an increase in zzso number, zzso that both genes play a role in controlling zzso zzso Additionally, a weak link may exist with the zzso mechanism that locally controls zzso zzso
