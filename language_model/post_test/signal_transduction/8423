This study was initiated to find small zzso zzso that would induce a functional response when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso mimics of zzso were designed for this zzso These mimics are zzso zzso yet easily folded into zzso zzso and zzso readily accessible from zzso acids bearing most of the natural side zzso Gram quantities of 16 of these turn mimics were prepared and then assembled into 152 zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of these molecules using cells zzso with the zzso receptors identified 10 potential zzso of zzso the zzso for zzso zzso of these zzso zzso with zzso replacing the zzso label were then prepared and tested to confirm that binding was not due to the zzso Several zzso were conducted to find the mode of action of these zzso zzso Thus, direct zzso survival and zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso showed 8 of the original 10 hits were zzso zzso binding to the zzso of zzso zzso some zzso afford discrete signals leading to either cell survival or zzso zzso The significance of this work is zzso First, we succeeded in finding small, selective, zzso stable zzso for the zzso zzso there are very few of these in the zzso Second, we show that it is possible to activate distinct and biased signaling pathways with zzso binding at the zzso of zzso zzso Third, the discovery that some zzso initiate different modes of cell signaling increases their potential as pharmacological zzso and therapeutic zzso
