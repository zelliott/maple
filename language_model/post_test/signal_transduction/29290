Rapid progress has recently been made regarding how the niche controls stem cell function, but little is yet known about how stem cells in the same niche interact with one zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso can zzso normal ones for niche occupancy in a zzso zzso The zzso bam or zzso zzso zzso invade the niche space of neighboring zzso zzso and gradually push them out of the niche by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso competition requires zzso and normal zzso division, but not the zzso zzso niche zzso while different zzso levels can sufficiently stimulate zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso have a competitive relationship for niche occupancy, which may serve as a quality control mechanism to ensure that accidentally differentiated stem cells are rapidly removed from the niche and replaced by functional zzso
