Plants have unique features that evolved in response to their environments and zzso A full account of the complex cellular networks that zzso zzso functions is still zzso We describe a zzso zzso zzso interaction map for the zzso network of the plant zzso zzso containing about zzso highly reliable interactions between about zzso zzso A global organization of plant biological processes emerges from community analyses of the resulting network, together with large numbers of novel hypothetical functional links between proteins and zzso We observe a dynamic zzso of interactions following gene zzso events, providing evidence for a model of evolution acting upon zzso zzso This and future plant zzso maps should facilitate systems approaches to better understand plant biology and improve zzso
