In addition to their original function as cell cycle regulators, zzso zzso family members were recently reported to zzso the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible role of zzso in the sensitivity of zzso cancer to zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso cancer cell line, and the effect of zzso zzso on sensitivity to zzso zzso by zzso doses of different drugs was evaluated by various methods, including zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and Western zzso zzso 

The results reported in this study support the conclusion that zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cancer cell line lacking zzso zzso is able to inhibit zzso triggered by zzso and zzso through the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death is not influenced by the zzso protein zzso 

A careful analysis of zzso expression in tumor specimens could help to identify the best clinical protocol to be used for each patient, improving efficacy and tolerance and therefore offering additional progress in the treatment of advanced zzso zzso
