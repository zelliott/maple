zzso acid zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso that activates the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade through zzso toxin zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso We recently detected a 100 zzso protein zzso that binds to the zzso zzso domain of zzso protein 2 zzso and becomes zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1997) zzso zzso 16, zzso Through zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso we have now identified zzso as zzso a zzso that regulates zzso zzso We show that in zzso cells, zzso zzso is rapidly zzso zzso in response to zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso zzso may be a critical event in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cascade in zzso
