A zzso zzso fusion was mapped zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of this region identified three novel zzso zzso zzso dot zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is zzso and that a polar zzso in zzso located 5 zzso upstream of zzso blocks the zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso nature of zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso are part of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso signals produced by strains zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and their chemical structures were zzso In addition to the zzso signal zzso both zzso produced modified compounds that are not produced by the parent strain zzso The most prevalent difference observed was the absence of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso In addition, zzso were found in which the zzso zzso at the reducing end was zzso linked to zzso These zzso in the profiles of zzso signals produced by strains zzso and zzso were accompanied by reduced zzso efficiency on all hosts zzso
