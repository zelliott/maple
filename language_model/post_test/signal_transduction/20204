zzso play a critical role in recognizing and responding to infection and zzso Central to this function is an array of zzso receptors that lack sequence zzso Many of these receptors have in common the fact that their signaling involves zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso receptors zzso share a number of other features, including small size and optimal stimulation by zzso zzso We argue here that zzso are also likely to share the same zzso triggering zzso which involves segregation of the engaged zzso from zzso zzso zzso with large zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso signal through zzso zzso zzso which recruit distinct zzso signaling proteins when zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso They have two features that make them uniquely well suited to their role in immune recognition of infection and zzso Their modular structure enables the zzso of many rapidly evolving receptors with diverse zzso zzso to the same zzso signaling zzso Their similarity in size and shared signaling machinery enables them to zzso at zzso zzso when they engage zzso zzso the integration of zzso and zzso signals from multiple receptors at the cell zzso
