zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disabling neurological disorder with low zzso that is caused by the deletion of a zzso acid zzso in the protein zzso We previously showed that zzso is zzso through zzso while zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso zzso The different zzso of zzso and zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso gaining a zzso understanding on how the protein quality control machinery zzso zzso in zzso may uncover important regulatory steps in disease zzso Here, we asked whether zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso zzso known to degrade zzso zzso is implicated in the degradation of zzso by the zzso In a first set of studies completed in cultured cells, we show that zzso interacts with and influences the zzso levels of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso achieves this effect promoting the degradation of zzso not only through the zzso but also by zzso To determine the potential clinical significance of these findings, we asked if eliminating expression of zzso triggers a motor zzso in zzso knock in zzso mice, a model of zzso zzso zzso zzso We detected differences in spontaneous locomotion between aged zzso zzso knock out and control zzso Furthermore, zzso levels of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso mice, indicating that redundant systems likely compensate in zzso for the absence of this zzso zzso In zzso our studies support a zzso role for zzso on the degradation of zzso and uncover a novel link of zzso to the zzso zzso
