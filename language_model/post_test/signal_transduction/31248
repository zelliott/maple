The zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso that provide the major means of zzso and, zzso zzso the key zzso second messenger, zzso As such, zzso are central to the regulation of many diverse signaling processes that allow cells to respond to external zzso Four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso around 20 distinct zzso members of the zzso zzso Each zzso is characterized by a unique zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso with each domain serving particular roles allowing them to be targeted to varying regions and zzso of zzso space and regulated in distinct fashions by zzso and zzso zzso Although identical in zzso function, each zzso locates to distinct regions within the cell so as to create and manage zzso distinct pools of zzso The zzso of partners zzso with members of the four gene zzso family places these zzso in key regulatory positions, permitting them to channel complex biological signals via fundamental signaling zzso such as zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso family zzso The zzso cascade has long been linked to cellular growth and zzso and with this comes the implication that zzso may play considerable roles in the regulation of progeny development in maturing cells and zzso
