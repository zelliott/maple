To examine the functional role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso presentation to T cells, the zzso zzso zzso L cell line zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and tested for their abilities to stimulate zzso zzso zzso T zzso The expression of zzso or zzso on zzso cells significantly increased the stimulation of T cells in an zzso zzso manner as determined by zzso zzso This enhanced T cell response was also observed when combinations of zzso zzso cells and zzso or zzso L cells were used as zzso indicating that zzso and zzso deliver a zzso signal instead of merely enhanced T cell zzso to zzso presenting zzso The T cells zzso with zzso zzso in the primary response vigorously responded to zzso zzso zzso cells in a secondary zzso zzso In contrast, T cells zzso with zzso zzso in the primary response did not respond to zzso zzso cells in the secondary zzso zzso secondary responses to a third party zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were observed regardless of zzso expression on zzso cells in the primary zzso These results indicate that zzso as well as zzso not only enhance zzso presentation zzso by zzso class II zzso but also provide a zzso signal to T zzso This zzso signal may be important in the zzso of an zzso zzso
