To determine whether zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso initiation factor zzso zzso pathways downstream of the zzso target of zzso zzso contributes to zzso growth arrest, clones of zzso zzso cells were selected for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso growth were enhanced in resistant zzso Resistance was unstable in each of three clones zzso In resistant cells, as compared with parental cells, approximately zzso less zzso protein zzso was bound to zzso and total cellular zzso was markedly zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso transcript remained zzso but the rate of zzso synthesis was reduced in resistant zzso In cells that reverted to zzso sensitivity, levels of total zzso returned to those of parental zzso Compared with parental cells, resistant clones had either similar or lower levels and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso levels were elevated in both resistant and zzso zzso Several colon zzso cell lines with intrinsic zzso resistance were found to have low zzso zzso In stable clones of zzso zzso engineered to zzso zzso zzso sensitivity increased markedly zzso as zzso expression zzso These results suggest that the zzso ratio is an important zzso of zzso resistance and controls certain aspects of the zzso zzso
