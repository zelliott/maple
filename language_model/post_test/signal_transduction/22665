The zzso of signal zzso machinery at zzso is a fundamental organizational feature of the nervous system that allows for highly complex integration of information coding zzso zzso communication evolved as zzso organisms became more complex, and as selection pressures were placed on such organisms such that those capable of responding rapidly and specifically to environmental demands zzso Two obvious advantages of synaptic transmission (as opposed to zzso or zzso zzso are that it provides for rapid zzso communication over great distances and that it provides a high level of spatial zzso There are several structural and functional aspects of zzso that set them apart from other cellular zzso with many of the zzso zzso roles in synaptic signal zzso zzso neurotransmitter release from the zzso terminal and zzso zzso zzso and second zzso zzso However, studies of developing nervous systems have shown that many synaptic signaling mechanisms are operative prior to zzso and play important roles in regulating growth cone behaviors, zzso and even programmed cell zzso Indeed, the concept that zzso zzso zzso can be effectively applied to the evolution of the zzso As the zzso rapidly grows, zzso must elaborate zzso and zzso establish functional synaptic connections, and maintain and adjust those connections as the zzso zzso The purpose of this introductory article is to set the stage for the following articles by briefly reviewing fundamental aspects of the molecular and cellular biology of zzso in an evolutionary zzso
