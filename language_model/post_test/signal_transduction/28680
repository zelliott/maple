zzso plays a key role in the regulation of zzso zzso in liver and its expression is strongly enhanced by insulin and modulated by zzso zzso In primary rat zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso zzso gene expression was abolished by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso active protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso The zzso of zzso promoter zzso together with expression zzso for zzso or zzso active zzso revealed that the zzso promoter region zzso mediates the response to zzso zzso experiments and gel shift zzso show that this element is able to bind zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso to activate the zzso promoter was enhanced by zzso nuclear zzso zzso acting via the sequence zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by insulin was dependent on the intact zzso region and zzso stimulation was achieved when zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso promoter Luc construct in primary zzso zzso stimulation of zzso promoter activity by insulin was inhibited when a zzso zzso was used containing a zzso within a zzso zzso zzso Thus, a regulatory zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso and zzso appears to be involved in zzso zzso gene zzso
