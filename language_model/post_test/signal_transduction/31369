zzso interference zzso in both plants and animals is zzso by small zzso of approximately zzso zzso in length for regulation of target gene expression at multiple levels through partial sequence zzso Combined with widespread zzso sequencing, experimental use of zzso has the potential to interrogate systematically all genes in a given zzso with respect to a particular zzso However, zzso to a tolerance for zzso and gaps in zzso with targets, small zzso could have up to hundreds of potential target sequences in a zzso and some small zzso in zzso systems have been shown to affect the levels of many zzso zzso besides their intended zzso The use of long zzso zzso zzso in zzso where zzso processing produces small zzso inside cells, has been thought to reduce the probability of such zzso zzso zzso Here we show, however, that zzso zzso by short zzso stretches within long zzso are prevalent in zzso We have performed a zzso zzso screen for novel components of zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso + cells, and found few, if any, legitimate zzso Rather, many of the top candidates exert their effects on zzso response through zzso on known zzso components or through zzso zzso produced by tandem zzso repeats present in many zzso and zzso Genes containing such repeats are zzso in candidate lists from published screens, suggesting that they represent a common class of false zzso Our results suggest simple measures to improve the reliability of zzso zzso screens in zzso and other zzso
