The zzso region of the prion protein zzso contains a series of zzso zzso This region has been implicated in the binding of zzso metal zzso particularly zzso zzso has been suggested to be involved in copper transport and metabolism and in cell defense mechanisms against zzso zzso possibly through the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso or a zzso activity of zzso zzso However, up to now the link between zzso expression and copper metabolism or zzso activity has still to be formally zzso particularly because conflicting results have been obtained in zzso In this study, we report a link between zzso copper zzso and resistance to zzso zzso zzso copper zzso was used at a zzso concentration to demonstrate that binding of copper to the outer plasma cell membrane is related to the level of zzso expression in a cell line expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso zzso indicated that zzso was not involved in copper delivery at zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso expression increases several zzso zzso activities and zzso zzso zzso protein may be a stress sensor sensitive to copper and able to zzso following copper zzso a signal zzso process acting on the zzso systems to improve cell zzso
