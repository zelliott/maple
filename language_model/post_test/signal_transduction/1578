In this study we show that embryonic zzso zzso protein zzso binds to zzso N zzso previously identified on zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is a zzso for the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso contains two potential N zzso sites, we hypothesized that N zzso on zzso may mediate its interactions with zzso In support of this, zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso and zzso F treatment reduces its molecular mass by zzso zzso suggesting that the native zzso is a zzso The binding potential of zzso to zzso decreases significantly in presence of soluble zzso zzso or when the zzso is zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso contains complex type zzso N zzso with zzso acid zzso groups, but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the functional zzso of zzso and zzso at the leading edges of developing zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth cones of mouse embryonic cortical zzso and zzso zzso outgrowth on zzso zzso The zzso zzso themselves promote zzso outgrowth in embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso This outgrowth requires zzso zzso zzso as cells expressing zzso zzso zzso are zzso These results indicate that zzso N zzso on zzso play an important functional role in zzso zzso
