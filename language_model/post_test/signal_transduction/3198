zzso inflammation has been proposed to contribute to various stages in the zzso of cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream inflammation zzso To assess whether this zzso is zzso relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic zzso known to affect zzso zzso 

In a collaborative zzso we studied zzso zzso in zzso in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation zzso in zzso zzso We also compared the frequency of zzso in zzso patients with coronary heart disease and in zzso zzso To gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed zzso in relation to zzso gene expression and to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso 

The minor zzso frequency of zzso was zzso zzso was not associated with zzso zzso blood pressure, zzso zzso or smoking zzso value for association per minor zzso zzso for zzso By contrast, for every copy of zzso zzso mean concentration of zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso 6 by zzso zzso and mean concentration of zzso protein was reduced by zzso zzso and of zzso by zzso zzso For every copy of zzso zzso risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by zzso zzso zzso was not related to zzso zzso levels or zzso production in zzso 

zzso human genetic and zzso data are consistent with a zzso association between zzso pathways and coronary heart zzso
