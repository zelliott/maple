The bone zzso and zzso although both zzso zzso induce very distinct differentiation zzso The former supports zzso stem cell zzso and multiple zzso zzso while the latter supports T zzso almost zzso This distinction suggests that the zzso environment acts to restrict the zzso fates available to zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the addition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to an in zzso system that otherwise supports zzso greatly reduces the zzso potential of stem cells or zzso zzso In contrast, committed zzso zzso mature regardless of the presence of zzso The block in zzso is the direct result of zzso signaling within the zzso zzso and zzso signals cause a rapid increase in the expression of the zinc finger zzso factor zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso signals fail to inhibit commitment to the zzso zzso Taken together, our results support a role for zzso in allowing zzso to restrict zzso cell lineage differentiation zzso
