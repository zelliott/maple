In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso signal that specifies the future embryonic zzso axes by altering the fate of the surrounding zzso zzso zzso We previously identified a number of zzso binding proteins that associate specifically with the 64 zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso To test whether zzso is required for correct zzso zzso or protein function, we used zzso to validate the association of zzso with zzso zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is a component of zzso zzso complexes but zzso zzso clones show that zzso is not required for zzso zzso zzso Instead, we identify a novel function for zzso in the zzso and show that it is required for proper zzso protein zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is required in the zzso for the correct organization of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results highlight a requirement for an zzso binding protein in the zzso of zzso zzso which is independent of zzso zzso and we propose that zzso is required in the zzso for efficient zzso zzso to the zzso zzso cells during zzso zzso
