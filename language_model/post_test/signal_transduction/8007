zzso zzso regulates the production of red blood cells primarily by preventing zzso of zzso zzso More recently, however, EPO has emerged as a major zzso zzso in several zzso zzso in the setting of stress or zzso The underlying mechanisms of the protective responses of EPO have not been fully zzso Here we show that EPO triggers a zzso zzso survival zzso that zzso zzso cell zzso The protection zzso by zzso relies on the subsequent induction of zzso a zzso member of the zzso protein zzso In addition, EPO zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso which is induced by serum zzso EPO also activates zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso which are involved in a zzso zzso zzso EPO caused a prolonged zzso of nuclear factor zzso which was blocked by zzso of zzso but not by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso requires zzso zzso However, the zzso of the zzso zzso was not required for the ability of EPO to counteract zzso zzso Thus EPO promotes survival of zzso cells through zzso zzso and zzso regulation, as well as through a separate mechanism involving the zzso zzso
