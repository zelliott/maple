zzso differentiation in zzso cells induced by nerve growth factor zzso requires sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although classical Ras zzso zzso and zzso activated by zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso pathway, the zzso is transient and not sufficient for zzso cell zzso Instead, it has been widely accepted that zzso zzso zzso zzso causes sustained zzso of zzso zzso There has been no direct evidence, however, that zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso signaling zzso sustained zzso of zzso and subsequent sustained zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso leading to zzso cell zzso zzso expressed zzso active zzso of zzso caused zzso outgrowth in zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso whereas activated zzso did zzso zzso of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso as well as the expression of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Since zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this differentiation zzso Furthermore, zzso brought about zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso cell differentiation requires zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the zzso and zzso of mouse brain and in the gray matter of the spinal zzso All these properties of zzso were apparently indistinguishable from those of zzso However, zzso stimulation caused transient zzso of classical Ras proteins but sustained zzso of zzso as well as sustained zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso differentiation in zzso cells by inducing sustained zzso of zzso zzso
