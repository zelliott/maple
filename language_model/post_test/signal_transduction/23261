zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and the subsequent onset of systemic zzso zzso is associated with a high zzso even when patients are treated with conventional zzso We hypothesized that treatment of lethal zzso rat model with zzso zzso have therapeutic effects on the laboratory findings and clinical course and zzso 

To create a zzso model, zzso rats were subjected to bilateral hind limb zzso with rubber tourniquets for 5 hours and randomly divided into three groups as zzso zzso zzso group, zzso groups treated with low zzso zzso and high doses zzso zzso of zzso zzso for the zzso group or zzso for the zzso zzso groups was zzso administered immediately before zzso Under continuous monitoring and recording of zzso blood pressures, blood and tissue samples were collected for zzso and zzso analysis at designated period before and after zzso 

zzso zzso of rat hind limbs reduced the zzso content in the crushed muscle, and the subsequent zzso induced zzso oxygen zzso circulatory collapse and systemic zzso finally resulting in a mortality rate of zzso by 48 hours after zzso A single injection of high-dose zzso immediately before zzso activated zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso by sequential zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso also exhibited zzso effects by modulating zzso and zzso zzso consequently suppressing zzso activities and subsequent systemic zzso showing a complete recovery of the rats from lethal zzso 

These results indicate that high-dose zzso reduces systemic inflammation and contributes to the improved survival rate in a rat zzso zzso
