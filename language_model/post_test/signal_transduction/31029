zzso attention has focused on the role of protein zzso C zzso in triggering the profound zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the involvement of zzso zzso zzso the second zzso generated in parallel with the zzso pathway, remains poorly zzso We hypothesized that, if zzso signaling zzso release of zzso and subsequent binding to zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso then the reduction of zzso size achieved with PC would be attenuated in mice that are deficient in zzso zzso zzso To test this concept, hearts were harvested from 1) zzso zzso displaying reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso wild types from the zzso and 3) zzso zzso All hearts were zzso and zzso to receive two zzso episodes of PC zzso zzso with zzso zzso salt of native zzso the zzso zzso zzso channel opener zzso or no intervention zzso After the treatment phase, all hearts underwent zzso global zzso followed by 2 h of zzso and zzso size was delineated by zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso area of necrosis in hearts that received PC, zzso and zzso averaged zzso of the total left zzso zzso significantly smaller than the values of zzso seen in controls zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso protection was only seen with zzso neither PC nor zzso limited zzso size zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso These data provide novel evidence that zzso signaling contributes to zzso size reduction with zzso
