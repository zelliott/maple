zzso is a common cause of cell death and is implicated in many disease processes including stroke and chronic degenerative zzso In response to zzso cells express a variety of genes which allow adaptation to altered zzso demands, decreased oxygen demands, and the removal of zzso damaged zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that regulates the zzso response to zzso in zzso In this study, we reported an early, zzso gradual zzso of zzso and a moderate increase in vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso following transient focal zzso Moreover, we demonstrated, for the first time a specific zzso of the zzso regulator zzso in zzso and cortical zzso after transient focal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with delayed zzso zzso zzso showed protein increases on Western blots of brain tissue with zzso at zzso after zzso zzso responds to zzso in an early stage, whereas zzso and zzso accumulate in cells at later times after zzso This suggests the possibility that zzso proteins might be one of the major downstream zzso of zzso in hypoxic cell zzso These findings open the possibility that the zzso zzso protein zzso enters the nucleus and could interact with other proteins involved in DNA structure, zzso or zzso zzso after focal brain zzso
