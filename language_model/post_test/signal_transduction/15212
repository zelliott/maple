zzso zzso B zzso signals control T cell proliferation and differentiation but their effect on the generation and function of regulatory T cells zzso and zzso cells is not well zzso In this study, we show that elevated zzso signals antagonize the zzso effect of zzso on cell size, zzso and zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso and zzso zzso Conventional zzso T cells expressing active zzso are less susceptible to suppression by natural regulatory T zzso Although zzso signals do not affect the development of natural regulatory T cells, they enhance their zzso zzso Upon zzso triggering and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cells transgenic for zzso readily express zzso thereby acquiring zzso zzso These effects of elevated zzso signals on T cell function involve a marked and sustained zzso of zzso and zzso and reduction in nuclear zzso zzso In contrast, zzso signals impair zzso differentiation of zzso zzso T cells into the zzso zzso This zzso with an increased signaling of zzso zzso and zzso Finally, elevated zzso signals reduced the severity of experimental zzso zzso in zzso mice but induced experimental zzso zzso in mice deficient for zzso Altogether, these data indicate an important role of zzso signals on control of zzso T cell responses and, zzso on zzso and inflammatory immune zzso
