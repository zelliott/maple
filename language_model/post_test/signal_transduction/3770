Growth hormone zzso has previously been reported to influence the zzso conversion of zzso zzso zzso partly by causing these cells to exit the cell cycle and to become unresponsive to zzso zzso To better understand this process, zzso zzso were treated with fully zzso doses zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso in the presence or absence of zzso human zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis was attenuated by zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso of approximately zzso zzso and a zzso effective dose of zzso zzso This effect appeared to be the result of zzso of DNA synthesis and exclusive of a time shift in the initiation of the S phase of the cell zzso Additionally, zzso growth zzso zzso which can act as an important in zzso zzso of zzso failed to mimic the zzso effects of zzso The ability of zzso to antagonize zzso zzso did not appear to be due to the zzso of zzso zzso mass or to pronounced changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso was administered at various times after zzso addition, zzso continued to be effective at zzso zzso DNA synthesis for up to 9 zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell cycle progression was further evidenced by the ability of zzso to promote a marked decrease in the zzso expression of D zzso In comparison, zzso inhibited zzso DNA synthesis for up to 18 zzso after zzso addition and also zzso zzso zzso mass and zzso these observations suggest that the mechanism of zzso action is largely distinct from that of zzso We conclude that zzso can selectively and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis exclusive of any rapid or extensive effects on zzso zzso mass or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso even when administered 9 zzso after zzso addition, and the zzso zzso of zzso expression of D zzso suggest that there are zzso effects on systems involved in the transition of these zzso through the zzso phase of the cell zzso In sum, these data support a specific interaction of this zzso zzso with zzso in the control of cell cycle progression in zzso zzso
