zzso resistance observed in cancer chemotherapy is commonly attributed to zzso of zzso zzso zzso These proteins act as zzso drug zzso pumps, actively zzso zzso agents from cells and causing a decrease in zzso drug zzso Besides the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso the breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso is becoming increasingly accepted as playing an important role in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso only a few zzso of zzso are zzso According to the literature, zzso zzso zzso zzso can be considered to be zzso zzso interacting with zzso zzso and zzso Here, we investigated seven different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for their potential to restore zzso sensitivity to zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the zzso of zzso expression caused by zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso reduced both total and surface expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells by interaction with the zzso signaling zzso The reduced zzso content led to an increased effect of zzso a well-known zzso zzso lowering the concentration required for half zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso had no influence on zzso expression and zzso zzso Interestingly, a combination of an zzso inhibitor with the zzso inhibitor zzso led to a significant reduction of zzso expression at low zzso of the zzso Based on our results, we assume that zzso exerts a zzso enhancing effect on zzso expression via the zzso signaling pathway, which can be attenuated by zzso zzso zzso the key signaling zzso regulating zzso expression with zzso zzso combined with the zzso of zzso with potent zzso might be a promising approach to circumvent zzso in cancer zzso
