It is known that free fatty acid zzso contributes to the development of insulin resistance and zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism in zzso insulin resistance is still zzso In the present investigation we have demonstrated that zzso significantly zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso the key insulin signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso of plasma membrane bound zzso was also zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso zzso was greatly zzso by zzso this was then zzso to the nuclear region and associated with the zzso of insulin zzso zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suppressed this zzso effect of zzso suggesting requirement of zzso migration to implement zzso zzso Experimental zzso indicate that zzso adversely affected zzso Since zzso regulates zzso promoter activity, expression of zzso gene was impaired causing reduction of zzso on cell surface and that compromises with insulin zzso
