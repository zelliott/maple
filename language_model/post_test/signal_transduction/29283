zzso zzso zzso of startle is a measure of zzso gating that is deficient in certain psychiatric disorders, including zzso Sprague zzso zzso rats are more sensitive to zzso effects of zzso zzso at long zzso intervals zzso zzso zzso and less sensitive to zzso effects of zzso at short zzso zzso zzso compared with Long Evans zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was tested in zzso and zzso rats after zzso zzso zzso or vehicle in a zzso subject design and sacrificed 14 days zzso Total zzso was extracted from the nucleus zzso zzso zzso 700 zzso transcripts on the zzso 230 zzso zzso were zzso 

As previously reported, zzso rats exhibited greater zzso zzso deficits at long intervals and less zzso zzso enhancement at short intervals compared with zzso zzso One hundred four genes exhibited significantly different zzso expression levels in these two zzso zzso analysis revealed that many of these genes contribute to zzso zzso zzso synaptic long-term zzso or zzso zzso zzso The expression of some genes significantly correlated with measures of zzso zzso sensitivity in either zzso or zzso zzso The expression of select genes was validated by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso sensitivity in zzso versus zzso rats are robust and zzso and may be related to strain differences in the expression of genes that regulate signal zzso in the zzso These genes could facilitate the identification of targets for zzso zzso gating deficits in brain disorders such as zzso
