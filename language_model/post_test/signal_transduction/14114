zzso zzso (the Warburg zzso is a core hallmark of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying it remain zzso Here, we identify an unexpected central role for zzso in cancer zzso zzso where it controls zzso metabolism by ultimately regulating the cellular level of zzso We show that zzso promotes zzso zzso of class zzso zzso zzso which leads to the zzso of zzso and zzso and this in turn releases zzso from a zzso zzso zzso These central features of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels are highly zzso in clinical samples and with shorter survival of zzso zzso These results identify a specific, zzso role for zzso in regulating zzso metabolism in zzso
