zzso receptors zzso are zzso receptors that function in zzso and zzso as well as in the inflammatory and zzso responses triggered by tissue zzso We have previously shown that zzso or zzso occupancy by specific zzso peptides zzso zzso tissue factor zzso expression in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso where zzso regulation by zzso (but not by zzso requires intact zzso zzso membrane zzso in which zzso and zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of cholesterol-lowering agents zzso and zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso induction in zzso 

zzso completely prevented zzso induction by zzso in an zzso manner, induced the zzso of zzso from zzso membrane zzso without affecting zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso also prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso which is crucial for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is accompanied by the relocation of the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which we previously showed to play a key role in signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso cholesterol loading zzso amplified zzso zzso probably as a result of the increased abundance of zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso signaling molecules in the zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso 

As zzso have important functions in zzso cancer, zzso and inflammatory zzso our findings that statins prevent zzso induction by zzso altering the membrane zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso suggest that they may provide health benefits other than reducing zzso
