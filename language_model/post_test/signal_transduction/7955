zzso zzso a zzso zzso isolated from the marine sponge zzso zzso is a potent zzso with therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso diseases and zzso The zzso zzso 4 zzso one of the promising molecular targets for zzso drugs, is commonly expressed in innate immune cells especially zzso and zzso zzso Currently, whether zzso can activate zzso signaling pathways remains zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso and its various structural zzso zzso approximately 47, on zzso zzso We found that one zzso analog zzso but not zzso itself, strongly zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso in a zzso manner and zzso zzso production in bone zzso cells of zzso zzso mice but not in those of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in a zzso cell line zzso expressing human zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso also activated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced expression of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and promoted production of zzso characteristic of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso cells acquired a distinct zzso similar to that of zzso zzso and exhibited higher zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with a zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso In zzso we identify a novel synthetic compound zzso that can activate zzso via zzso signaling zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an immune zzso and may serve as a potential drug lead for zzso
