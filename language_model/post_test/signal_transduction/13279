We present a complete DNA sequence and zzso analysis of the dominant oral zzso zzso zzso Although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own, this zzso zzso the zzso and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the zzso zzso suite zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso open reading zzso organized on a single circular zzso with zzso zzso zzso Despite its zzso position among the zzso bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso Nine zzso outer membrane proteins are predicted from the zzso none of which has been reported in the zzso More than 137 zzso for the zzso of a variety of zzso such as zzso zzso metal zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso pathways exist for only three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The remaining zzso acids are imported as such or as zzso or zzso that are subsequently zzso in the zzso A principal source of energy appears to be the zzso of zzso to zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso and zzso yields zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are capable of arresting zzso growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the zzso zzso The zzso capabilities of zzso zzso revealed by its zzso are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the zzso
