Signaling through the T cell zzso zzso zzso is important for the zzso of zzso and memory zzso T zzso The significance of zzso signaling in regulatory T zzso cells has not been systematically zzso Using an zzso zzso that is prominently expressed in zzso cells, and a conditional zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso we have examined the importance of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in abnormal zzso zzso characterized by impaired zzso preferential zzso to the zzso zzso loss of zzso function, and striking changes in gene zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and function did not reflect the involvement of zzso in zzso function because these effects were not observed when zzso expression was zzso by zzso results make clear multiple aspects of zzso cell zzso and zzso that are dependent on a sustained capacity to signal through the zzso
