zzso 1 zzso is a representative zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and it provides zzso signals to T zzso However, the relevance of zzso zzso to T cell zzso in systemic lupus zzso zzso remains zzso We undertook this study to perform a quantitative and functional analysis of zzso zzso signaling to T cells in patients with zzso 

zzso of cell surface molecules was assessed by flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed by zzso using a specific zzso zzso To assess zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the cells were zzso with a zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso or a zzso zzso expression zzso via zzso 

zzso 1 zzso expression was significantly zzso on peripheral blood T cells from patients with active zzso particularly those with the complication of World Health Organization class IV zzso whereas zzso was significantly decreased in patients with active zzso compared with normal zzso zzso 1 zzso expression closely correlated with serum zzso zzso of zzso zzso on T cells from patients with active zzso but not on those from normal individuals, induced cell proliferation as well as zzso expression on T zzso zzso of zzso expression and T cell zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso were completely inhibited by zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso 

These results suggest that engagement of zzso zzso on zzso T cells could induce zzso signaling and subsequent zzso expression and zzso Thus, the zzso zzso signaling cascade might serve to enhance zzso T cell zzso
