We recently reported that the zzso of adrenal G zzso zzso zzso zzso causes enhanced zzso zzso zzso by desensitizing zzso alpha zzso receptors zzso zzso of zzso cells, and thereby zzso heart failure zzso In this study, we sought to develop an efficient and zzso in zzso adrenal gene transfer method to determine whether manipulation of adrenal zzso zzso regulates zzso CA zzso in zzso We specifically investigated two different in zzso gene delivery zzso direct injection into the zzso zzso and retrograde delivery through the zzso zzso We delivered zzso zzso zzso containing either zzso or an inhibitor of zzso activity, the beta zzso We found both delivery approaches equally effective at supporting robust zzso of the whole zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the cortical region as well as in the zzso zzso Additionally, rats with zzso zzso exhibit enhanced plasma CA levels when compared with control rats zzso zzso whereas plasma CA levels after Ad beta zzso infection were significantly zzso Finally, in isolated zzso cells, alpha zzso of zzso cells failed to inhibit CA zzso whereas Ad beta zzso cells showed normal alpha zzso zzso These results not only indicate that in zzso adrenal gene transfer is an effective way of manipulating adrenal zzso zzso but also identify zzso as a critically important zzso involved in CA zzso
