zzso is a potent zzso of insulin release in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is still unclear whether locally released zzso zzso the zzso responsiveness of neighboring zzso in the intact zzso The present study investigates this question in the zzso zzso by examining the effects of zzso for zzso receptors zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso on the insulin zzso response to zzso The specificity of both zzso was demonstrated by their selective interaction with zzso signaling in rat zzso and zzso signaling in Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso In zzso rat zzso the zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited the effect of 1 zzso zzso upon zzso insulin release by 78 plus minus zzso In the zzso rat zzso neither of these zzso inhibited the potent zzso response to 20 zzso zzso although they effectively suppressed the zzso effect of, respectively, an infusion of zzso (1 zzso or zzso (1 zzso on insulin zzso When zzso zzso release was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso no amplification was seen in the simultaneous or subsequent insulin zzso response to zzso It is concluded that, at least under the present selected conditions, the zzso insulin release by the zzso rat zzso seems to occur independent of an amplifying zzso signal from neighboring zzso
