zzso zzso zzso exist in a large number of proteins that are functionally important in development or associated with zzso We have previously demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso the bone zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso is able to interact with zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso which acts as a zzso activated tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso we further demonstrated that zzso additionally associates with the zzso member, the zzso beta zzso zzso and hence zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso mainly through the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso experiment further revealed that zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interacts with zzso via their zzso zzso The zzso interaction zzso the zzso of zzso and the recruitment of zzso factors 2 and 3 zzso and zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In sum, our data demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso abrogates zzso function through a zzso zzso These findings may provide a direction for the treatment of zzso of zzso zzso
