It has been firmly established that the zzso factor zzso is a critical element in the survival of healthy cells in response to zzso stress because it zzso a wide array of zzso genes by binding to the zzso element zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso system after an exposure of cancer cells to chemotherapy can be hypothesized, zzso the acquisition of zzso by zzso In this study we have investigated the potential role of zzso signaling in the development of acquired resistance to zzso The human zzso zzso cell line zzso which is highly sensitive to zzso showed low levels of ARE binding and zzso zzso activity, as well as zzso expression of its target genes compared with resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, established after exposure to zzso increasing zzso of zzso displayed a zzso to zzso cell zzso Acquisition of zzso resistance in zzso cells was accompanied by an zzso in zzso activity and zzso increase in the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and total zzso zzso A critical role for zzso in the acquired zzso of zzso cells could be confirmed by the restoration of zzso sensitivity after stable expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso could not further enhance zzso sensitivity in the parental zzso zzso These results suggest that the level of zzso activity might be a determining factor for zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso of the zzso system can participate in the development of acquired resistance to zzso zzso
