The newly described adapter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to contribute to zzso organization through assembly of zzso filaments and to be pivotal in embryonic development and in zzso zzso We characterized the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso induced rapid zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso albeit zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by collagen or zzso was transient in zzso zzso zzso became zzso in a manner dependent on zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso While zzso (an zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso induced by collagen or zzso zzso (a zzso zzso rather prolonged zzso Under the conditions, this zzso inhibitor suppressed zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso involvement in focal zzso in other cells, zzso zzso zzso preceded the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso of alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but in suppression of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was insensitive to zzso D, an zzso zzso zzso The failure of zzso to associate with zzso in zzso studies also suggests that zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso Of the signaling molecules investigated in this study, zzso seemed to associate with zzso Finally, zzso existed mainly in zzso and membrane zzso zzso in the resting state, and remained unchanged during zzso zzso when zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Our findings on zzso zzso suggest that zzso rapid zzso zzso zzso occurs following zzso turnover by zzso zzso and may be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by itself, may elicit sluggish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso is dependent on zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to provide a unique model system to fully zzso the functional zzso of zzso
