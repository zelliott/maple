Development of the adult zzso system of the zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growing in from the periphery and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induce a subset of zzso cells to zzso and migrate to form an zzso zone, in which zzso zzso zzso will change their zzso neighbors and change their direction of outgrowth in order to travel with like zzso to their target areas in the zzso zzso zzso These newly zzso zzso zzso will terminate in zzso the formation of which zzso other zzso cells to migrate to surround zzso zzso cells do not migrate unless zzso zzso are present, zzso fail to zzso and target correctly without sufficient zzso cells, and zzso are not maintained without a zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso Growth Factor receptors and the zzso zzso and zzso II play a role in the zzso responses to zzso zzso In the present work, we present evidence for the importance of zzso zzso Growth Factor receptors in zzso migration, zzso and survival in this developing zzso We also report changes in growth patterns of zzso zzso and of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso following blockade of zzso zzso zzso that suggest that zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso communication between zzso and zzso zzso
