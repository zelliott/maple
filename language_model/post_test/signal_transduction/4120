The human zzso zzso and a zzso form, zzso zzso in which all zzso and zzso zzso from the third zzso loop and zzso domain were changed to Ala, were studied after expression in zzso zzso Although the zzso receptors had similar affinities for zzso and zzso values for zzso of zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso the zzso were almost zzso zzso suggesting a role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso After chronic zzso or zzso the zzso values of the zzso were about zzso increased at both receptors but the zzso values were not zzso upon zzso withdrawal zzso zzso levels were increased to almost zzso of control zzso zzso and rapid zzso of the zzso zzso were induced by zzso and zzso but not zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was not zzso and was zzso zzso after treatment with zzso The results indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso in the third zzso loop and zzso of the zzso zzso are not involved in the limited zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso promoted by zzso but that their integrity and/or their zzso is required in the intricate and zzso regulated pathways involved in zzso signaling and zzso
