zzso zzso interactions zzso are pivotal molecular switches that are important for the regulation of signaling processes within zzso zzso Cellular signaling is altered in various disease conditions and offers interesting options for pharmacological zzso zzso zzso are usually zzso by large interaction zzso In contrast, zzso zzso often depend on small zzso modifications and are thus better suited targets for drug zzso However, the detection of zzso zzso with zzso methods still remains a zzso and zzso task, and many pivotal zzso that are potentially suited for pharmacological intervention most likely remain to be zzso The availability of methods to easily identify and zzso zzso potentially also transient interaction events, is therefore zzso The zzso should be zzso to intact zzso cells, zzso also to primary cells in zzso 

In this study, we adapted the zzso system to zzso zzso and transient zzso that occur at the membrane and in the zzso of living zzso zzso zzso is based on a zzso functional zzso of two inactive zzso zzso fragments fused to interaction partners of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter systems were used to convert the zzso activity into an easily quantifiable zzso We measured the zzso interaction between the zzso protein Bad and the adapter proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and in primary cultured zzso Using zzso zzso we show that Bad specifically interacts with zzso zzso when zzso by protein zzso zzso at zzso We also measured the zzso zzso interactions zzso by zzso and transient zzso zzso We zzso applied zzso zzso to measure the zzso interactions of zzso zzso receptors with several adapter zzso 

zzso zzso are well suited to measure zzso and transient zzso that occur specifically at the membrane and in the zzso of zzso and primary cultured zzso zzso Given the high sensitivity of the zzso system, all zzso were performed in zzso formats and could be adapted for higher zzso to screen for zzso active zzso
