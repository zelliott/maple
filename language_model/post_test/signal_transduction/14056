Although the expression of cell signaling proteins is used as zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein levels within tumors is not well zzso We assessed zzso zzso of protein expression within primary zzso zzso zzso proteins were extracted from 88 zzso and zzso tissue samples of 13 primary high-grade zzso zzso zzso with zzso samples zzso In addition, 14 samples of normal zzso tube zzso served as zzso zzso reverse phase protein zzso were used to analyze the expression of 36 cell signaling proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways as well as 15 activated zzso zzso We found considerable zzso zzso in the expression of proteins with a mean zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso zzso differed between proteins zzso Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the extent of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In comparison, we assessed the variation of protein levels amongst tumors from different patients, which revealed a similar mean zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso samples from the same patient clustered more closely together compared to samples from different zzso However, a clear separation of tumor versus normal tissue by zzso was only achieved when mean expression values of all individual samples per tumor were zzso While differential expression of some proteins was detected independently of the sampling method used, the majority of proteins only demonstrated differential expression when mean expression values of multiple samples per tumor were zzso Our data indicate that assessment of established and novel cell signaling proteins as diagnostic or zzso markers may require sampling of zzso zzso zzso at several distinct locations to avoid sampling zzso
