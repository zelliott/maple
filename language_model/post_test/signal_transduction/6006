zzso is a recently identified zzso zzso binding zzso domain containing negative regulatory zzso that was discovered on the basis of its ability to undergo zzso zzso upon stimulation by zzso growth factor in zzso zzso The protein was originally obtained as a zzso clone zzso zzso from the zzso DNA Research Institute which maintains the zzso protein zzso database devoted to the analysis of long zzso clones zzso large proteins zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to cause zzso of zzso promoter activity and to inhibit zzso zzso in cell zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in growth factor zzso signaling and to zzso its biological function in zzso we have generated mice deficient in zzso by gene zzso zzso mice do not display any obvious zzso and zzso examination of the zzso lung and liver does not show any major abnormalities as compared to zzso zzso However, mouse embryonic zzso zzso generated from zzso mice exhibit a zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso consistent with its role as a negative regulator of growth factor zzso zzso Our results confirm that although zzso expression in mice is not essential for any major zzso pathway, it could play a significant functional role to zzso regulate growth factor zzso signaling zzso
