zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the prolonged lifespan of chronic zzso leukemia cells zzso although the exact mechanisms implicated remain elusive as zzso In this work, we have examined zzso expression in normal B zzso and zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso Our results zzso zzso The existence of a new zzso zzso characterized by a complete deletion of zzso 14 zzso zzso which was zzso detected in normal B zzso and may represent an zzso that could play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso The existence of another alternatively spliced zzso zzso transcript involving a partial deletion of the zzso region zzso zzso was correlated to a decreased zzso cell zzso The zzso or zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso transcript zzso whereas zzso enhanced both the zzso of zzso including these zzso zzso zzso and the expression of a 122 zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso a regulation process involving zzso oxide zzso zzso levels could occur by a zzso mechanism zzso by soluble zzso Our results also provide an insight into a new complementary zzso action of zzso in zzso by the induction of particular zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso
