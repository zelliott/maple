zzso zzso for the G protein alpha zzso zzso alpha 1, zzso alpha 2, zzso alpha 3, and Go alpha were expressed in zzso coli, and the four proteins were zzso to zzso The zzso proteins exchange and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso and interact with beta gamma zzso The rates of zzso of zzso from zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha 3 zzso zzso are an order of magnitude slower than that from zzso zzso release of zzso from zzso alpha 2 is also relatively slow zzso zzso However, the values of zzso for the zzso of zzso by zzso alpha and the three zzso alpha proteins are approximately the same, about 2 zzso at 20 degrees zzso The zzso proteins restore zzso of zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso in response to zzso Y and zzso indicating that the proteins can interact functionally with all necessary components of at least one signal zzso zzso The two different receptors function with different zzso of G proteins to mediate their responses, since all four G proteins restored responses to zzso while zzso alpha 2 was inactive with zzso zzso Despite these results, high zzso of activated zzso alpha proteins are without effect on zzso zzso activity, either in the presence or absence of zzso or zzso zzso the G protein that activates zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that G protein beta gamma zzso are primarily responsible for zzso of zzso zzso zzso
