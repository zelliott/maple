The experience of pregnancy plus zzso produces long-term enhancements in maternal behavior as well as reduced zzso of zzso a key hormone for the initial establishment of maternal zzso Given that zzso acts centrally to induce maternal care as well as regulate its own zzso we tested whether zzso receptors in brain regions known to regulate behavioral and neuroendocrine processes were zzso and more responsive to zzso in reproductively experienced zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso after zzso and zzso virgin rats were treated with 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle and the brains collected 2 h later for measurement of zzso for genes involved in zzso zzso zzso experienced rats had lower serum zzso zzso compared with virgin rats, suggesting enhanced zzso feedback on the zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso In the zzso zzso area and zzso nucleus zzso involved in regulating maternal behavior and zzso zzso respectively), the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso rats, and zzso treatment induced a further increase in zzso expression in these zzso In the same regions, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were also markedly increased after zzso treatment in reproductively experienced but not virgin zzso These results support the idea that zzso experience increases central zzso zzso The induction of zzso receptors and enhanced zzso responsiveness as a result of pregnancy and zzso may help account for the retention of maternal behavior and shifts in zzso zzso in reproductively experienced zzso
