zzso of pancreatic clock genes zzso pancreatic zzso function, leading to the onset of zzso Despite the importance of pancreatic zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and in diabetes zzso nothing is known about the role of clock genes in these zzso Here, we identify the clock gene zzso alpha as a new zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and led to a decrease in key genes of the zzso zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium signals in zzso cells and mouse primary zzso whereas the zzso alpha zzso zzso produced the opposite zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited intrinsic zzso zzso alpha expression zzso that were inhibited by 11 zzso zzso In mouse primary zzso zzso induced similar effects zzso High zzso inhibited key genes controlled by zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso alpha in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso by zzso completely reversed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso expression zzso and zzso release zzso These findings identify zzso alpha as a new zzso regulator of zzso zzso via zzso zzso
