TRAIL zzso zzso inducing zzso like other members of the zzso family of zzso is able to induce zzso in sensitive target zzso Recently, zzso TRAIL has been shown to be expressed by activated human and mouse T zzso raising the possibility that TRAIL might be involved in T zzso zzso and/or immune zzso In the present study we show by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis that zzso but not resting, mouse T cells express abundant TRAIL zzso TRAIL transcripts were zzso within 4 h of T cell zzso A panel of zzso zzso was used to investigate the signal zzso pathways involved in TRAIL gene induction following T zzso zzso TRAIL gene expression was sensitive to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A, as well as the more general zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso family zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso C, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also prevented TRAIL zzso zzso by activated T cells, indicating a role for zzso and zzso In addition, TRAIL induction was inhibited by zzso A, implicating the zzso protein zzso zzso TRAIL expression was also blocked by zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, TRAIL zzso expression was not induced by zzso suggesting that TRAIL gene induction is not coupled to the zzso zzso Data obtained by zzso were confirmed at the protein level by zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that TRAIL gene induction is initiated through a T cell zzso signaling zzso similar to that responsible for the expression of zzso genes such as zzso
