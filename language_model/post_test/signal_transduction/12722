Several published functions associated with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resemble those of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso To explore this further, we have compared zzso lacking the proteins mentioned above and have constructed a double zzso zzso zzso to determine relationships among these zzso We observed that the sensitivity to zzso red zzso zzso white zzso as well as zzso of cells, was slightly increased in the double zzso compared to the single zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso zzso via zzso which occurs during log phase growth in the presence or absence of zzso in zzso cells, does not require zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are components of parallel but independent signal zzso In addition, bulk zzso of strains was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Compared to zzso and a zzso zzso strain zzso that contained high, intermediate and low zzso zzso species, we found that the zzso of strains zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the double zzso consisted only of low zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso only demonstrated a reduced intermediate type of zzso zzso blue binding was lower in zzso zzso and the double zzso zzso zzso lacking high and intermediate zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso which had a partial loss of intermediate zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso is part of a functionally similar but parallel zzso to the zzso zzso that zzso resistance to the cell wall zzso zzso and zzso However, a functional relationship in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso exists that only partially requires zzso
