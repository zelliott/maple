zzso attachment of zzso is well-known to target proteins for zzso Here, mass zzso was used to identify the site of zzso in zzso the G protein alpha zzso in zzso zzso zzso The modified zzso is located at zzso within the zzso domain of zzso a region of unknown zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso results in a substantial decrease in zzso In addition, zzso expressing the zzso zzso are moderately resistant to zzso in growth zzso zzso zzso consistent with enhanced zzso signaling zzso These findings indicate that the zzso domain may serve to regulate the turnover of zzso
