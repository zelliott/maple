Tight junctions of zzso play crucial roles in the barrier to keep zzso in zzso zzso away from the blood zzso which we call the zzso zzso et zzso zzso Tight junction proteins of zzso are regulated by various zzso and growth factors via distinct signal zzso zzso They are also considered to participate in signal zzso pathways that regulate zzso cell zzso gene zzso differentiation and zzso This review focuses on recent findings about the relationship between tight junction proteins and signal zzso pathways in zzso
