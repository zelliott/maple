zzso has been shown to zzso regulate zzso and zzso but its role in zzso II zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso remains zzso zzso the present study investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso induced by zzso II zzso zzso cardiac disease was induced in zzso gene knockout zzso and zzso zzso mice by subcutaneous infusion of zzso II zzso zzso for 28 zzso Although equal levels of high blood pressure were developed in both zzso zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso mice developed more severe cardiac injury as demonstrated by zzso cardiac function including a significant increase in left zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso ejection zzso and fractional zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso detected that deletion of zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso cardiac zzso and zzso including zzso of collagen I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso T cells and zzso zzso Further studies revealed that enhanced zzso of the zzso pathways and zzso of zzso were mechanisms though which deletion of zzso promoted zzso zzso cardiac zzso In conclusions, zzso plays a protective role in zzso cardiac zzso via mechanisms involving the zzso regulatory zzso
