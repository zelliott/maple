the development of new drugs over the last few decades has targeted specific proteins thought to be a key to the disease zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso known as zzso represent such proteins as they lie downstream of important drug targets for zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso are currently in Phase I and II clinical trials in zzso 

this review of current literature and recent conferences provides a background on the zzso signaling zzso and a discussion of early zzso zzso The potential of zzso zzso for the treatment of inflammation is briefly zzso zzso and early clinical results are discussed for zzso zzso currently in zzso zzso clinical trials of zzso zzso in zzso include some disappointments as well as some promising signs of the value of these compounds and we discuss the potential for zzso zzso as zzso and their use in drug zzso 

the utility of zzso zzso as zzso agents will depend on careful patient selection based on the presence of zzso in genes such as zzso and zzso the identification of additional zzso zzso and an improved understanding of the benefit of drug combinations utilizing both established and emerging zzso
