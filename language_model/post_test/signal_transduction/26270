zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment during the zzso stage is known to affect zzso zzso However, it is still unknown whether zzso stress activates zzso hormone zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso which could have pronounced zzso action on zzso hormone zzso zzso leading to delayed zzso zzso This study was designed to determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso exposure on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coupled receptors zzso 147 and zzso zzso levels were measured using quantitative real-time zzso in female mice at zzso zzso days 21, 30 and in zzso stage mice, aged between zzso zzso females of zzso had delayed zzso zzso and irregular zzso cycles and lower zzso expression in the zzso area zzso when compared with zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso increased significantly in zzso female mice of zzso and zzso compared to zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso expression was observed in laser captured single zzso zzso in the zzso Although there was no difference in zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso cell numbers in the zzso increased in zzso females of zzso compared to zzso Taken together, the results show that the delayed zzso onset could be due to the zzso of zzso gene expression after zzso zzso treatment, which may be accounted for in part by the zzso signals from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso
