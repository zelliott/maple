zzso is a tumor zzso gene on zzso frequently zzso by promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso target genes in zzso we have investigated the expression profile of the stable zzso zzso and controls by zzso zzso zzso A total of 57 genes showed differential expression in the zzso zzso These zzso target genes were involved in multiple cellular regulatory processes such as transcription, signal zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression of eight selected genes with the highest fold changes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso was confirmed in both stable and transient zzso Compared with the zzso zzso an inverse expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was shown in the immortalized zzso zzso cells treated with zzso against zzso The findings imply that the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was tightly regulated by zzso and may associate with its tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is common in zzso and zzso repression of zzso was zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso The results suggest a novel zzso zzso in which both zzso zzso and zzso are zzso
