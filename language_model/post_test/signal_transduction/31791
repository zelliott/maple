To evaluate direct versus indirect zzso zzso protein zzso signaling and to identify the cellular producers and zzso for zzso during zzso zzso zzso development in vein zzso 

zzso analysis revealed an overrepresentation of 13 inflammatory pathways in zzso vein zzso compared with zzso knockout vein zzso Further investigation with various vein zzso combinations of zzso and zzso mice was used to modify the zzso of cells both inside zzso zzso and outside zzso zzso the vein zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso only when present in cells zzso to the graft wall, and zzso zzso required its effectiveness in cells both intrinsic and zzso to the graft wall to suppress zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso was equally effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell population had no impact on zzso zzso zzso stimulation of primary zzso smooth muscle cells had minimal influence on cell proliferation and zzso zzso confirming an indirect mechanism of zzso 

zzso axis zzso zzso via its signaling in zzso cells, particularly circulating inflammatory cells, with cells both intrinsic and zzso to the graft wall being critical zzso zzso These findings underscore the importance of systemic treatment for zzso zzso
