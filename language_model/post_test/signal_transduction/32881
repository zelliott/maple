zzso binding sites of D1 and zzso zzso had been detected in the rat peripheral zzso system and zzso to account for zzso enhancement of zzso memory and zzso of zzso input within the zzso bulb, zzso We further zzso in the present study, the mechanisms of these zzso actions by using zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso bulb and zzso The D1 zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity on zzso of the zzso bulb, but not on those of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso bulb was dose dependent, with a zzso effect zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso reaching zzso over zzso zzso zzso activity, and was blocked by the D1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities in the zzso bulb and zzso These zzso zzso inhibitions were dose dependent, with zzso values of zzso zzso for zzso and 1-3 zzso for zzso equal to zzso of zzso zzso activity at zzso of zzso zzso and were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was devoid of any effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities in the zzso bulb and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which suggests zzso regulation of odor detection in the zzso zzso By using zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown to occur only in zzso zzso thus zzso with zzso binding zzso zzso zzso on tissue sections revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso nerve and zzso layers of the zzso bulb, and in the zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate functional zzso of the zzso receptors with zzso zzso in both the zzso bulb and zzso and document novel aspects of zzso zzso involvement in zzso and of zzso signal zzso
