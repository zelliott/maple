Modern tissue engineering concepts integrate cells, zzso zzso molecules and growth zzso For the purposes of zzso medicine, fetal development is of great interest because it is widely accepted that zzso zzso in part zzso zzso In tissue engineering of cartilage the growth plate of the long bone represents an interesting, well-organized zzso structure with a spatial distribution of zzso in different proliferation and differentiation zzso embedded in a scaffold of zzso zzso zzso The proliferation and differentiation of these zzso is regulated by various hormonal and zzso zzso Thus, members of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso loop and a number of zzso factors, such as Sox and zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso proliferation and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a role in the complex regulation zzso The present paper summarizes the zzso organization of the growth plate and provides a short but not exhaustive overview of the regulation of growth plate development, giving interesting insights for tissue engineering of zzso
