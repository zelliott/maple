The ability to sense and respond to a wide variety of mechanical zzso touch, zzso pressure, or the resistance of the cell zzso a critical feature of every plant cell, whether or not it is specialized for zzso zzso events are an essential part of plant life, required for normal growth and development at the cell, zzso and zzso level and for the proper response to an array of zzso and zzso zzso One current challenge for plant zzso is to link these zzso responses to specific zzso and signal zzso zzso Here, we describe recent progress in the identification and characterization of two classes of putative zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso We also discuss how the secondary zzso zzso operates at the zzso of many of these mechanical signal zzso zzso
