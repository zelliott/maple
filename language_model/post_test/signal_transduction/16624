zzso belong to an extremely diverse group of zzso zzso They are all able to perform zzso photosynthesis, but differ in zzso ecological zzso and zzso This diversity is also reflected in the complexity of regulatory proteins involved in protein zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso For those strains whose zzso are completely zzso for example, the number of genes identified so far that zzso zzso and zzso zzso range from none to zzso zzso molecular as well as functional zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of a variety of activities according to changes in growth conditions or cell zzso such as cell zzso carbon and nitrogen zzso photosynthesis and stress zzso The major challenge in the near future is to integrate these components into signaling pathways and identify their zzso Some of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are expected to interact with classical zzso signaling zzso
