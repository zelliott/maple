zzso plays an essential role in the removal of activated zzso T cells that are no longer required during or zzso The zzso intrinsic zzso of zzso removes zzso zzso T cells upon clearance of viral infection, which is driven by withdrawal of growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso mediates zzso T cell death in zzso and zzso with zzso to eliminate zzso T cells during chronic infection in zzso but it is less clear how this zzso of zzso is zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso provides a dual trigger that can enhance survival of zzso T cells, but also removal of activated zzso T cells through zzso zzso Using in zzso stimulation zzso of zzso T cells with zzso zzso we show that zzso increases T cell survival after stimulation with low doses of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso after stimulation with high doses of zzso In zzso the impact of zzso zzso stimulation on the zzso of memory and zzso zzso T cells is limited by zzso zzso Furthermore, introduction of zzso signaling during acute infection with influenza virus zzso zzso elimination of zzso zzso T zzso These findings suggest that zzso suppresses its zzso effects on T cell survival through zzso of zzso T cell zzso to maintain T cell zzso during zzso
