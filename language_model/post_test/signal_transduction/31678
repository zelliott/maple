zzso virus zzso is a highly prevalent zzso associated with zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso membrane protein 2 zzso is expressed in zzso tumor tissue and has been shown to induce zzso inhibit zzso and promote migration of zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on migration of human zzso cells was further zzso zzso expression induced migration in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso measured by wound healing scratch zzso and zzso zzso migration zzso The induction of migration by zzso required the zzso signaling domain of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration required the zzso signaling pathway, and zzso of zzso by zzso required the zzso signaling domain of zzso zzso also induced zzso of the zzso target zzso a zzso signaling zzso that has been shown to regulate the activity of focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso activated by zzso and zzso interaction of zzso zzso of either zzso or its signaling zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was greatly increased in zzso zzso by zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso blocked migration, suggesting that the effects of zzso on zzso zzso promoted zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso expression in human zzso cells zzso zzso migration through a mechanism requiring zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inducing membrane zzso or stabilization of zzso and zzso zzso The specific effects of zzso on an zzso with a diverse repertoire of zzso zzso could promote migration of different cell types and be initiated by multiple zzso
