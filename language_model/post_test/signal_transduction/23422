zzso zzso occurs in about zzso of all breast zzso being a poor zzso factor for breast cancer zzso In a cellular background of zzso zzso we have previously shown that its expression promotes invasion, zzso and migration of breast cancer cells due to the induced zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso medium and to the zzso shedding of a zzso soluble form of this protein zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso after its preferential penetration in human cancer cells relative to normal zzso Three different breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso doses of zzso Invasion of these cells was measured using zzso Invasion zzso and zzso zzso were performed to determine cell viability upon treatment and the effects on zzso expression was determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to determine activity of zzso in the zzso media of zzso treated and zzso cells and the zzso levels of zzso signaling proteins were determined by Western zzso The invasive zzso of these breast cancer cells was significantly reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused a specific decrease on zzso protein levels from zzso in zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines, but the levels of zzso remain zzso zzso the levels of zzso and the activity of zzso were reduced in the zzso media of zzso treated cells and we also observed a decrease in the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso zzso Our data show that zzso specifically targets zzso not zzso zzso zzso invasive effects and zzso zzso zzso could possibly be considered a therapeutic tool to treat zzso breast zzso zzso zzso in a wild type zzso zzso
