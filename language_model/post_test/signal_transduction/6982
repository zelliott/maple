zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso is a nuclear zzso protein zzso that acts downstream of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in response to stress or zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence has shown that zzso is closely associated with zzso transformation and cancer zzso zzso should be an effective target for cancer zzso and zzso However, very few zzso zzso especially natural compounds, have been zzso We used virtual screening of a natural products database and the active zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso structure to identify zzso and its zzso compound zzso as zzso of zzso Compared with zzso compound zzso more strongly inhibited proliferation and zzso zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells with lower zzso Western zzso data demonstrated that compound zzso suppressed zzso of the zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso down the expression of zzso effectively reduced the sensitivity of zzso zzso cells to compound zzso Moreover, topical treatment with compound zzso before zzso application significantly reduced zzso development in terms of number and size in a zzso mouse skin zzso zzso The reduction in zzso development was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso in tumors extracted from mouse zzso The results indicated that compound zzso exerts zzso effects on skin zzso by directly binding with zzso and zzso the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which makes it an ideal zzso agent against skin zzso
