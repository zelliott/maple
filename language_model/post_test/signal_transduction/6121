Fetal brown zzso are zzso growth zzso zzso target zzso To assess the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in brown zzso during fetal life, we have generated immortalized brown zzso cell lines from the zzso zzso Using this experimental model, we demonstrate that the lack of zzso in fetal brown zzso increased the zzso to zzso induced by serum zzso Culture of cells in the absence of serum and growth factors produced rapid DNA fragmentation (4 zzso in zzso brown zzso compared with the wild type (16 zzso zzso cell viability was decreased more rapidly in fetal brown zzso in the absence of zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was induced much earlier in cells lacking zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso in fetal brown zzso altered the balance of the expression of several zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso This imbalance was irreversible even though in zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso c levels increased rapidly in zzso cells compared with the wild zzso A rapid entry of zzso into the nucleus accompanied by a rapid exit from the zzso and an earlier zzso of zzso were observed in brown zzso lacking zzso upon serum zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by 50% in both cell types by zzso zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso brown zzso with zzso active zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso decreased zzso and induced zzso and zzso activities, with the final outcome of DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso with zzso or zzso ameliorated zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso Finally, insulin treatment prevented zzso in both cell zzso However, the survival effect of insulin on zzso brown zzso was zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time the unique role of zzso in maintaining the balance of death and survival in fetal brown zzso
