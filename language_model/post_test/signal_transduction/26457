The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso critical signals for zzso in zzso zzso This zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso stem cells and in a subset of zzso though a possible role of zzso in zzso zzso remains to be zzso To investigate a possible effect of zzso on zzso zzso we have used both normal zzso cells induced to zzso differentiation and the zzso cells engineered to express the zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may have a role in zzso zzso zzso is predominantly produced and released by immature normal zzso cells and by zzso zzso cells and slightly zzso zzso cell zzso zzso production is markedly induced during zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso released zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso particularly for that concerns the process of zzso According to these data it is suggested that an zzso zzso loop controls zzso proliferation and zzso
