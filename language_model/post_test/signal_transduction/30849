The fetal and newborn brain is particularly susceptible to zzso which increases the risk for zzso deficits, seizures, zzso and zzso zzso behavioral and cognitive zzso Here, we report that prenatal zzso at gestation day 17 in mice caused an immediate decrease in fetal cerebral zzso levels of zzso zzso a key proteins in the zzso zzso While maternal zzso treatment prior to zzso did not have an early effect, it did accelerate maturation at a later stage based on the observed protein expression zzso In addition, zzso reversed the zzso loss of a zzso of zzso zzso that express zzso in zzso at zzso day zzso In the zzso responses to prenatal zzso were also evident 4 days after the zzso However, in contrast to the observations in cerebral cortex, zzso zzso key protein expression in the zzso The zzso response to zzso was also reversed by maternal zzso zzso The data presented here suggests that decreased levels of key proteins in the zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso may lead to high zzso to zzso and zzso in newborns after prenatal or zzso zzso and that maternal zzso treatment can reverse the zzso deficits in the zzso zzso
