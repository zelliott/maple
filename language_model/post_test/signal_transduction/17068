zzso zzso presentation by major zzso complex zzso molecules represents a critical process in zzso zzso Class II zzso zzso is considered the master regulator of zzso class II zzso zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso expression is zzso in smooth muscle cells deficient in zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso II zzso in lung zzso cells as a result of zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through promoters III and zzso zzso with a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso zzso II zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso achieved the same effect as zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso by altering zzso modifications and recruitment of key factors on the zzso promoters in a zzso zzso zzso blocked the antagonism of transforming growth factor beta zzso in zzso induction by zzso gamma zzso alluding to a potential dialogue between zzso and zzso signaling zzso Finally, zzso signaling attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified an zzso zzso zzso axis that influences zzso zzso II zzso in lung zzso cells and as such have provided invaluable insights into the development of novel zzso zzso
