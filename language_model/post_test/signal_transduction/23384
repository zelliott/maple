zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor with the ability to activate zzso and zzso zzso in response to elevated calcium zzso We previously showed that beginning at 1 month of age, zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso of long term depression in the zzso region of the zzso of zzso Here we show that beginning at 2 months of age, when mice first acquire the ability to discriminate between closely related zzso zzso begins to contribute to the induction of long term zzso zzso in the zzso zzso by zzso the action of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso Surprisingly, zzso induction by zzso through zzso occurs via zzso of zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso which has more frequently been linked to zzso Moreover, contextual discrimination is blocked by zzso of zzso expression specifically in the zzso zzso infusion of a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor into the zzso zzso or the injection of an inhibitor of zzso These findings zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso dependent capacity to distinguish closely related contexts through the appearance of a novel zzso signaling zzso
