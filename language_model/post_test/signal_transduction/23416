zzso growth zzso zzso is an zzso zzso and is expressed in the injured spinal zzso zzso signals through receptors to activate zzso zzso which zzso into the zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso zzso and cellular locations of the zzso signaling zzso following spinal zzso injury zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that the concentration of zzso zzso in injured spinal cords significantly increases immediately after zzso while the concentration of zzso gradually increased after zzso peaked at 2 days, and then gradually zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso was mainly expressed in zzso of the spinal zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso was stained within the motor zzso in the anterior horn, while zzso zzso at the zzso regions zzso was expressed in zzso within gray zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso gradual increases in zzso and zzso different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso after zzso and zzso may play a role in zzso zzso formation by zzso
