How rice zzso itself against pathogen infection is well zzso but little is known about how it zzso itself against zzso zzso We measured changes in the zzso and chemical profile of rice when the plant is infested by the striped stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso resulted in changes in the expression levels of zzso rice zzso this number accounts for about zzso of the zzso and is made up of 18 functional groups with broad zzso The largest group comprised genes involved in zzso followed by cellular zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso by zzso modulated many genes responsible for the zzso of plant hormones and plant zzso zzso acid zzso salicylic acid zzso and zzso were the major hormones that shaped the zzso zzso responses of zzso Many secondary signal zzso zzso such as those involved in zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso factors were involved in the zzso responses of zzso zzso and zzso synthesis from zzso were restricted by zzso zzso In addition, zzso infestation induced the zzso of zzso compounds, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and volatile organic zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso required rice to reconfigure a wide variety of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso
