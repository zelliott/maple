zzso an inhibitor of zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso extends the life spans of zzso flies, and zzso zzso zzso which increases life span and insulin sensitivity, is proposed to function by zzso of zzso yet zzso chronic administration of zzso substantially zzso zzso tolerance and insulin zzso We demonstrate that zzso disrupted a second zzso complex, zzso in zzso and that zzso was required for the zzso suppression of zzso zzso Further, decreased zzso signaling was sufficient to extend life span independently from changes in zzso zzso as female mice zzso for both zzso and zzso exhibited decreased zzso activity and extended life span but had normal zzso tolerance and insulin zzso Thus, zzso disruption is an important zzso of the effects of zzso in zzso
