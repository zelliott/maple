During T cell zzso zzso selectively zzso a zzso within its own zzso domain and a zzso within zzso We find that the remote zzso domain in each of these zzso is required to achieve efficient zzso zzso by zzso and extend this observation to two other zzso family zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, we detect a stable interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso and find that addition of specific, zzso zzso zzso to the in zzso zzso zzso competes directly with zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we show that the kinetic parameters of a generic zzso zzso of zzso are significantly improved via fusion of the zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso This work is the first characterization of a zzso zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso and provides evidence of a novel, zzso regulatory role for the ubiquitous zzso zzso
