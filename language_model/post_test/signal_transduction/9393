Cancer is a complex and zzso disease, demonstrating variations with respect to tumor types and between individual zzso This zzso has complicated the search for zzso zzso genes or pathways that could be targeted and have beneficial effects for large numbers of zzso Instead, recent studies suggest that cancer can be more effectively analyzed through the use of systems biology techniques that examine multiple pathways and account for interactions between these zzso In this review, we outline the various ways in which systems biology can be zzso to translate zzso data into a signaling network and then zzso analyze how cells make decisions based on the information flow through this zzso We then discuss recent studies utilizing zzso analysis to reveal therapeutic targets, predict which tumors will be sensitive to existing drugs, and develop zzso therapies that target multiple zzso demonstrating the potential for systems biology to revolutionize cancer zzso
