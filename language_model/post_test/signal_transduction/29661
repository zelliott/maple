zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cause multiple zzso abnormalities in zzso including defects in zzso boundary formation and failure in maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in establishing the zzso polarity within maturing zzso and in regulating the activity of a molecular zzso clock operating in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso obscures the roles of this zzso in different steps of zzso One possibility is that distinct zzso zzso mediate different aspects of zzso zzso In this study, we focus on two zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso which are expressed at the transition zone between zzso zzso and the segmented zzso The results of zzso and of zzso zzso experiments show that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso that feedback on the clock and take part in the maintenance of zzso gene expression coordination among adjacent cells in the zzso zzso
