Rice zzso zzso zzso is the second zzso in zzso zzso catalyzing zzso into zzso zzso rice plants, in which the expression of zzso zzso was either zzso or zzso were examined for zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed reduced levels of zzso while the repression zzso had elevated levels with an average increase of zzso With regard to zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso but zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso compared with the wild zzso In contrast, the repression zzso had zzso higher zzso levels than the wild zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were present at higher levels in the repression zzso than in both the zzso and the zzso zzso The enhanced zzso synthesis in the repression zzso was closely associated with a zzso increase in zzso When these rice plants were challenged by zzso zzso such as zzso much higher zzso synthesis was also observed in the repression zzso than in either the zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso increase through the suppression of zzso plays an important signaling role in triggering zzso zzso in rice, although the exact role of zzso remains to be zzso
