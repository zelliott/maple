zzso zzso zzso in the plasma zzso are known to be involved in G zzso zzso signal zzso however, their involvement in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling remains to be zzso We examined whether two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for multiple G protein signal zzso zzso density zzso zzso followed by western zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso or zzso revealed the zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso which destroys zzso raft structure by depleting cholesterol, influenced G protein signaling zzso by zzso and zzso to varying zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso stimulation was markedly inhibited by zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso but failed to affect zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso was specific to zzso and zzso because zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso depend on zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso while zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso does zzso Moreover, zzso seems to be more zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso than zzso These results indicate that the two zzso of the zzso mediate multiple signal zzso with varying degrees of zzso raft zzso Moreover, our results provide a deeper understanding of the function of zzso zzso in G protein signaling and the zzso meaning of zzso zzso
