Base zzso DNA repair zzso is fundamentally important in handling diverse zzso produced as a result of the intrinsic instability of DNA or by various zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso process have been associated with cancer zzso and neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso diverse base zzso into a common zzso zzso (AP) zzso The repair of zzso sites is initiated by the major human zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso activities associated with some DNA zzso zzso steps follow either of two distinct zzso zzso distinguished by repair DNA synthesis of either a single zzso zzso zzso or multiple zzso zzso zzso As the major repair mode for regular zzso sites, the zzso zzso zzso removes the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and replaces a single zzso using DNA zzso zzso However, zzso zzso may have difficulty handling some types of zzso as shown for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent work indicates that zzso is processed efficiently by zzso but that zzso zzso is derailed by the formation of stable zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso effectively removes zzso and thereby prevents the formation of zzso zzso In coping with zzso the cellular choice of zzso zzso may either completely repair the zzso or complicate the repair process by forming a zzso zzso
