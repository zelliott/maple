The zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso The fusion of zzso sequences to zzso zzso activates the zzso protein zzso zzso We have recently shown that expression of zzso in bone zzso cells by zzso zzso efficiently zzso in mice a zzso disease resembling human zzso and that zzso zzso activity is essential for zzso to induce a zzso zzso zzso However, it is not known if zzso of the zzso zzso alone is sufficient to induce a zzso zzso In this study, we examined the role of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in induction of zzso disease and tested whether zzso activated by zzso deletion can induce a zzso zzso We found that zzso with an zzso zzso deletion still induced a zzso disease in zzso In contrast, zzso activated by zzso deletion induced only zzso zzso in mice and did not stimulate the growth of zzso colonies from zzso bone zzso cells in zzso These results indicate that zzso sequences in zzso play additional roles in inducing zzso disease beyond simply zzso the zzso zzso domain and that functions of the zzso zzso domain are either not required or redundant in zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that the type of zzso zzso induced by an zzso zzso is influenced not only by what type of zzso cells the zzso is targeted into but also by the intrinsic zzso properties of the particular zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso induced less zzso of zzso and zzso than did zzso suggesting that zzso of these pathways plays a critical role in inducing a zzso zzso
