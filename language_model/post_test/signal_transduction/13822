The life cycle of higher plants zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The female zzso zzso surrounded by the zzso develops within the zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso This polarity is important in cell zzso and development for both the zzso and zzso Previously, zzso was shown to act in the zzso tissue to regulate zzso zzso In the highlighted study, we further showed that enriched zzso signaling in zzso the central domain of the zzso is required for the zzso of the functional zzso which usually occurs in the zzso zzso after zzso The restricted zzso signaling in the zzso is achieved by localized zzso zzso and zzso Here, we discuss the implications of this and other studies for the understanding of the role of zzso signaling in zzso development and the genetic and cellular interactions between zzso and zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso zzso display distorted cell zzso in the inner zzso and elevated zzso activity in the maternal zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates cell proliferation in the zzso zzso surrounding the developing zzso consistent with previous results indicating that zzso zzso causes an increase in the number of cells in the zzso and consequently an enlarged seed zzso
