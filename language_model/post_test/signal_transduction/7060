The majority of zzso tuberculosis zzso infections are clinically zzso characterized by drug tolerance and little or no bacterial zzso Low oxygen tension is a major host factor inducing zzso but the molecular mechanisms driving zzso replication are poorly zzso Here, we tested the role of zzso zzso in the zzso response to altered oxygen status, using an in zzso model of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Broad zzso zzso compromised survival of zzso in zzso zzso protein profiling and genetic zzso identified zzso as the zzso critical for surviving zzso zzso replication was highly sensitive to changes in zzso levels in zzso culture, and even more so in zzso A zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso showed a zzso loss in viability and gross zzso defects in low oxygen zzso In contrast, chemically reducing zzso activity during zzso specifically compromised resumption of growth during zzso These data support a model in which zzso activity is reduced to achieve zzso and elevated when replication zzso Together, these data show that zzso controls zzso transitions associated with zzso and zzso that zzso is a major regulator of these zzso and that zzso could provide a highly vulnerable therapeutic target at every step of the zzso life zzso disease, zzso and zzso
