The zzso zzso 2 zzso orphan zzso binds to hormone response elements zzso consisting of two zzso zzso direct repeat consensus sequences zzso with various spacing in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When binding to natural zzso zzso orphan zzso remains flexible with higher binding affinities to zzso cellular zzso protein II promoter region zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso and zzso acid response element beta zzso zzso zzso than to zzso zzso response element zzso and also to zzso the zzso zzso hormone response element zzso This wide spectrum of zzso recognition sequences suggests possible versatility of the zzso orphan zzso in zzso with other signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso orphan zzso competes with zzso and zzso zzso gene expression activated by zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso In addition, this suppression may not be zzso by the formation of zzso between zzso orphan zzso and either zzso alpha or zzso zzso Instead, a minimum of zzso higher affinity of the zzso orphan zzso for zzso than zzso alpha may explain why the zzso orphan zzso dominates zzso alpha in zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that the zzso orphan zzso may be a master regulator in modulating the zzso of two key zzso zzso beta and zzso involved in the zzso acid signal zzso zzso
