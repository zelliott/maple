Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Chow, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso This function most probably reflects the ability of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso two zzso zzso abundantly expressed in T zzso zzso we have attempted to better understand the mechanisms by which zzso zzso in the zzso phase of zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are crucial for its negative impact on zzso zzso zzso As these two sequences were not essential for zzso of the zzso zzso of a zzso product in zzso cells, we zzso that they mediate zzso interactions allowing the recruitment of zzso in the vicinity of activated zzso and/or zzso in T zzso In complementary studies, it was observed that linkage of a zzso membrane targeting signal to the zzso zzso of zzso rescued the deleterious impact of a point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso This observation suggested that the zzso sequence is in part necessary to zzso zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso where zzso zzso are zzso Nevertheless, zzso membrane zzso was unable to correct the effect of complete deletion of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso that these zzso provide additional functions necessary for the biological activity of zzso
