zzso zzso injection of zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso behavioral changes in rats in a putative animal model of zzso The binding of zzso to zzso affects signaling molecules in zzso including zzso and zzso which promote protein zzso We have also reported that zzso and zzso in the brain are involved in the zzso zzso of zzso In this study, rats were given an zzso injection of zzso and then their frontal zzso were examined to determine the effects of zzso on the zzso signaling zzso and protein translation, which are important in modifications of neural circuits and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso up to zzso following injection, and increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 2, 4, and zzso following zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that increased zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso was evident in the zzso cingulate, and zzso zzso These findings suggested increased translation initiation in response to zzso The rate of protein synthesis was measured as the amount of zzso incorporation in the zzso extracts of frontal cortical zzso and showed a significant increase at zzso after zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso injection of zzso induced zzso of the protein translation initiation zzso regulated by zzso and zzso and prolonged zzso in zzso In conclusion, protein translation zzso could play an important role in zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso
