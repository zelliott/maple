zzso signaling controls cell fate decisions of zzso zzso by zzso certain steps of differentiation and inducing either zzso or differentiation toward zzso or zzso zzso In addition, truncated zzso zzso could be associated with zzso of all cases of human T zzso leukemia and, when introduced into mouse bone zzso stem cells, cause zzso zzso However, functional links between the abundant expression of intact zzso and zzso are still zzso Here we show that zzso is highly expressed in zzso and zzso tumor cells of zzso and zzso large cell zzso We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the zzso capacity of zzso by showing that the interaction between intact zzso on tumor cells and its zzso zzso dramatically zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso in zzso We further provide evidence that in zzso and zzso large cell lymphoma, zzso is expressed in zzso and in bystander cells zzso with zzso tumor zzso zzso signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by zzso through zzso or zzso zzso zzso and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to zzso in zzso Thus, our data suggest that activated zzso signaling plays an important role in the zzso of zzso and zzso large cell zzso and that it might be a potential new target for zzso
