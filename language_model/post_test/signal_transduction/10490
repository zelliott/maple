The zzso zzso zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso is known to play an important role in zzso signaling and has been implicated in the aggressiveness of a number of different human zzso including acute zzso leukemia zzso The progression of zzso syndromes zzso to zzso is thought to be associated with zzso of zzso control zzso However, little is known about signal zzso pathways which may be involved in enhanced survival of zzso zzso In this report, we have performed zzso and flow zzso analysis to evaluate the levels of activated zzso in bone zzso or peripheral blood zzso cells from patients diagnosed with zzso We observed high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the cases zzso diagnosed as high-risk zzso whereas zzso cells from normal bone zzso or low-risk zzso patients showed low or absent zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, all high-risk zzso patients also demonstrated high expression of the Class I zzso zzso zzso zzso and a decreased expression of zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso might be one of the factors contributing to the decreased zzso rate observed in patients with high-risk zzso
