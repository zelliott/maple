zzso zzso cells zzso are resistant to chemotherapy and associated with zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso and/or alcohol-related chronic liver zzso Using zzso zzso mouse models and patients with zzso we isolated zzso zzso and identified the zzso marker zzso as a direct target of zzso which drives the zzso activity of zzso These zzso zzso were defective in the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of a zzso zzso library identified zzso and zzso as zzso genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso mediates zzso retention of zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso restored zzso zzso inhibited zzso genes and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Mice with defective zzso signaling zzso zzso exhibited enhanced liver zzso expression and developed zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the activated zzso zzso zzso is linked to suppression of zzso zzso signaling and could potentially serve as a therapeutic target for zzso zzso
