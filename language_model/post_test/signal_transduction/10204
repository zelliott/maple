We investigated the mechanisms by which zzso alters insulin signaling in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso association, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso but inhibited these effects at zzso zzso A concentration of zzso m zzso enhanced zzso zzso of zzso at zzso which was abolished by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso was zzso by zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso but inhibited it at zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso decreased the amount of zzso zzso alpha at the plasma membrane at zzso zzso but increased it at zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso distribution of zzso zzso beta was not altered by the zzso These results indicate that zzso affects the zzso action of insulin in a zzso manner, that high zzso of zzso inhibit insulin signaling by modulating zzso of zzso at zzso via a zzso zzso zzso pathway, and that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha in response to zzso may explain the dual effect of zzso
