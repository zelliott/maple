The zzso zzso is a major zzso whose signaling activity depends on its correct zzso to zzso charged zzso zzso and zzso in membrane zzso Selective zzso and zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso but the mechanisms and molecular zzso involved are largely zzso In a combined chemical biological and zzso approach we investigated the zzso of zzso fully functional zzso zzso proteins into zzso zzso model zzso and zzso composed of viral zzso zzso Independent of zzso zzso is zzso localized in zzso zzso zzso zzso and forms new zzso fluid zzso that are recruiting zzso zzso lipids by an effective, zzso zzso sorting zzso In addition, zzso exchange and, zzso Ras zzso results in a higher concentration of activated zzso in the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins partition into the zzso phase and concentrate at the zzso phase boundary of zzso zzso Next to the zzso anchor system, the results reveal an involvement of the zzso in the membrane interaction process by determining minor but yet significant structural zzso of the zzso proteins at zzso zzso A molecular mechanism for zzso Ras signaling from separate membrane zzso is zzso from the results of this zzso
