The biological and zzso effects of zzso have been ascribed to its known zzso which function as zzso zzso zzso However, zzso also triggers rapid zzso of classical second zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso signaling zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These latter events are commonly activated by membrane receptors that either possess intrinsic zzso zzso activity or couple to zzso zzso We have shown that zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso to zzso K signaling axis via the zzso zzso zzso zzso through the release of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cells zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso This finding is consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that zzso of zzso by zzso is a zzso theme in cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso provides a previously unappreciated mechanism of zzso between zzso and serum growth factors, and explains prior data reporting the zzso effects of zzso This novel mechanism by which zzso activates growth zzso signaling and its implications for breast cancer biology are discussed further in this zzso
