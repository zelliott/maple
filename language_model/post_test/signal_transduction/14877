zzso in the zzso features the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso into zzso growing aerial zzso This transition requires the activity of zzso genes and the zzso of zzso that reduce the surface tension at the zzso interface enabling the emergence of nascent aerial zzso zzso zzso produces two classes of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso While both molecules are important for aerial development, nothing is known about the functional zzso or interaction of these zzso apart from the observation that aerial zzso formation can proceed via one of two zzso a zzso zzso when cells are grown on rich medium and a zzso zzso on poorly zzso carbon sources such as zzso We used zzso analysis to show that while the zzso are important, but not required, for development on rich zzso they are essential for differentiation on zzso zzso flour zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso defects could be suppressed by the presence of zzso Furthermore, the zzso are produced by conditional zzso zzso during aerial zzso formation when grown on the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the previously zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso blocked in aerial zzso on all media makes neither zzso nor zzso Finally, we show that a constructed zzso zzso that lacks all zzso and zzso zzso genes fails to differentiate in any growth zzso We propose that the zzso activities of both zzso and the zzso are essential for normal aerial zzso formation on rich zzso while zzso zzso and zzso alone drives aerial zzso on zzso zzso
