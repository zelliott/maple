zzso in zzso beta zzso zzso leads to high plasma homocysteine zzso and causes zzso a common risk factor for vascular disease, stroke and possibly neurodegenerative zzso Various zzso diseases have been associated with zzso but the molecular mechanisms of homocysteine toxicity are zzso We investigated the pathways involved in the pathological process, by analyzing differential gene expression in zzso zzso We used a combination of differential display and zzso zzso to identify genes zzso expressed during zzso in brain of zzso zzso In this zzso model of zzso both plasma and brain homocysteine zzso were zzso Several genes were found to be zzso expressed in the brains of zzso mice, and the identities of some of these genes suggested that the zzso zzso was altered in the brains of zzso zzso We therefore investigated the zzso of proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were activated in the zzso zzso of zzso mice, suggesting that the zzso zzso may play an important role in the development of zzso defects associated with zzso
