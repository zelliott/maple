To investigate the relationship between zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of hypoxic vascular zzso zzso 

zzso Human vascular zzso cell line zzso cells were planted onto zzso plates zzso and divided into control group (without zzso zzso and zzso for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 h groups zzso to zzso zzso and zzso for corresponding zzso according to the random number table, with 5 zzso in each zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso target zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso in cells were detected by Western zzso The ratios of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso cells were planted onto zzso plates zzso and the zzso cells were divided into control group (without zzso zzso and zzso for 6 h group zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 6 zzso according to the random number table, with 5 zzso in each zzso zzso of zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso Data were processed with one-way analysis of zzso or zzso test, and zzso method was used in paired comparison among zzso 

zzso zzso protein expression in control and zzso for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 h groups was obviously zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso protein expression in zzso for 2, 3, 6 h groups were obviously higher than that in control group (with P values all below zzso zzso There was significant statistical difference among all groups in zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso protein expression in zzso for 2 h group zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio in control and zzso for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 h groups was respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso ratio in zzso for 3, 6, 12 h groups were obviously higher than that in control group (with P values all below zzso zzso zzso ratio in control and zzso for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 h groups was respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso ratio in zzso for 3, 6 h groups were obviously higher than that in control group (with P values all below zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso for 6 h group zzso zzso zzso was obviously higher than that in control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso of ROCK signal zzso may be involved in the zzso of vascular zzso cell zzso induced by zzso
