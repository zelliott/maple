zzso patterning of zzso into zzso and zzso involves zzso actions of zzso and zzso signals originating from zzso surrounding the zzso The zzso and the floor plate of the neural tube provide a zzso zzso directing zzso development, whereas the surface zzso and zzso neural tube provide a zzso zzso directing zzso zzso Evidence has been provided that Sonic zzso mediates the zzso effects of zzso and floor plate, but the zzso zzso that patterns the zzso has not been zzso The documented expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso neural tube and of zzso and zzso in the surface zzso at the time of zzso zzso prompted us to investigate the involvement of zzso proteins in patterning the zzso Here we show that tissue culture cells expressing these zzso family members can maintain and induce zzso marker expression in zzso zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso proteins mediate the zzso effects of the surface zzso and zzso neural tube on zzso
