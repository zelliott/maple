The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major component controlling the invasive growth program in embryonic development and in invasive zzso The discovery of therapeutic zzso against zzso has been difficult, and zzso that compete with zzso growth factor zzso act as zzso By applying zzso technology and zzso panning strategies, we discovered two fully human zzso against zzso zzso and zzso which zzso inhibit zzso binding to zzso and elicit zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso and zzso abrogate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso migration and zzso zzso experiments suggest that the zzso effect is zzso by zzso zzso zzso in a state with zzso which then increases zzso of zzso for the zzso domain of zzso thus blocking zzso binding without zzso the zzso In zzso studies demonstrate that the combination of zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in various colon tumor zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth was associated with induction of zzso Global gene expression analysis shows that zzso of zzso zzso significantly zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso the negative regulator of zzso zzso and significantly suppressed zzso and zzso both enhancers of proliferation and zzso Moreover, in an experimental zzso model, zzso increased survival by preventing the recurrence of otherwise lethal lung zzso Taken together, these results underscore the utility of a zzso approach for targeting zzso and possibly other zzso zzso zzso Our approach could be expanded to drug discovery efforts against other cell surface zzso
