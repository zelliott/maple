zzso occurs in zzso conditions zzso high zzso or during zzso states zzso zzso Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to adaptation and survival or injury to hypoxic stress using zzso as a model zzso To identify genes involved in zzso zzso we screened the zzso zzso zzso lines available for all the zzso of zzso We screened for the zzso rates of zzso developing under zzso zzso condition and the number of adult flies surviving one week after zzso in the same hypoxic zzso Out of zzso lines zzso zzso zzso screened, 44 zzso lines representing 44 individual genes had significantly higher zzso rates zzso zzso than those of the controls zzso zzso under zzso The molecular function of these candidate genes ranged from cell cycle regulation, DNA or protein zzso zzso binding activity, and zzso zzso In addition, based on zzso analysis, we found these genes are involved in multiple zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that 20 out of the 44 candidate genes are linked to zzso signaling pathway, strongly suggesting that this zzso is essential for zzso tolerance in zzso By employing the zzso system, we discovered that genes such as zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play an important role in survival and development under zzso in zzso Based on these results and our previous studies, we conclude that zzso tolerance is a zzso trait including the zzso zzso
