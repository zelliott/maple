zzso is an essential cellular mechanism for cell zzso and survival by which damaged cellular proteins are zzso in zzso zzso and cleared through zzso zzso The zzso zzso also plays an important role in immunity and inflammation via pathogen clearance mechanisms zzso by immune cells, including zzso and zzso In particular, recent studies have revealed that zzso activity is required for the release of zzso zzso traps zzso representing a distinct form of active zzso death, namely zzso Although zzso formation is beneficial during host defense against invading zzso the mechanisms that promote excessive zzso under pathological conditions remain ill zzso In the present study, we aimed to characterize the role of the zzso target of zzso zzso in zzso As zzso zzso is known as a key regulator of zzso in many zzso cells including zzso we hypothesized that zzso may play a regulatory role in zzso release by regulating zzso zzso Our data show that the pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso accelerated the rate of zzso release following zzso stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso formation was enhanced by zzso zzso This increased zzso zzso release was sensitive to zzso of respiratory burst or blockade of zzso zzso Overall, this study demonstrates a pivotal role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso signaling events downstream of zzso zzso leading to zzso
