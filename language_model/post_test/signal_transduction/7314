The zzso signaling zzso regulates organ size, tissue zzso and stem cell zzso The two key downstream zzso zzso in this pathway, zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso with zzso motif zzso mediate the major gene regulation and biological functions of the zzso zzso The biological functions of zzso and zzso in many zzso are zzso however, their roles in skin wound healing remain zzso To analyze whether zzso and/or zzso are required for zzso wound healing, we performed small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso skin zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the nucleus and zzso in the zzso and hair zzso Interestingly, zzso is expressed in the nucleus in the zzso at 2 and 7 days after zzso zzso normally zzso to the zzso in the zzso but is distributed in both the nucleus and zzso at 1 day after zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso markedly delayed the rate of wound closure and reduced the transforming growth zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso and zzso also zzso the expression of zzso signaling zzso components such as zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso to the nucleus is required for skin wound zzso
