zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso expression is largely restricted to smooth muscle cells, zzso and specialized zzso known as zzso Liver injury, associated with zzso zzso transformation of resident zzso zzso cells into liver specific zzso also known as activated zzso Here, we have used in zzso and in zzso wound healing models to explore the functional role of zzso in this zzso zzso was abundant in activated cells isolated from injured zzso but was zzso in zzso cells isolated from normal zzso Both cellular zzso and contraction were dramatically increased in injured liver cells, paralleled by an increase in zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso using several different techniques had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso but led to reduced cellular zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was associated with a significant reduction in zzso zzso compared to control zzso The data indicate that zzso is important specifically in zzso cell zzso and contraction and raise the possibility that the zzso zzso beyond its structural importance in the cell, could be important in regulating signaling processes during wound healing in zzso
