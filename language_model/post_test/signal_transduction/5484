zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso abundant in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a long history of use as a complementary and alternative zzso The zzso activity of zzso has been well demonstrated and is thought to arise partly from the associated zzso zzso Recent studies have indicated that the zzso activity of zzso is zzso by its zzso of zzso zzso zzso Since the cellular expression of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso we hypothesized that an alternative zzso exists in immune cells, such as zzso where zzso could mitigate the expression of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso target zzso genes in zzso Western zzso zzso reporter and zzso analyses revealed that zzso strongly blocked the zzso of zzso induced by zzso whereas zzso which lacks the zzso zzso zzso group, was zzso Moreover, zzso was able to decrease nuclear zzso levels in zzso zzso where the expression of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso coupled with interaction studies using zzso zzso as well as zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso modified by zzso at zzso causing significant zzso of its zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate the potent zzso activity of zzso
