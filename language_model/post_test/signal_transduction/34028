zzso death is a pathological hallmark of prion zzso zzso prion zzso zzso can convert zzso into zzso zzso which can cause zzso in zzso and in zzso Various cell surface proteins can participate in the infection process of zzso zzso can interact with zzso and has a zzso effect on zzso However, for zzso lacking intrinsic zzso activity domain in zzso zzso zzso signaling molecular and the signaling events in zzso in zzso zzso responding to zzso remain still zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was investigated in this zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso expression on zzso and protein zzso For the first time we found that zzso induced zzso of zzso by Western zzso zzso and blocking the interaction of zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with inhibitor zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso and attenuated the zzso effect by zzso This study offers a possible interpretation that zzso signaling zzso was activated by the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso activity showed the zzso effect in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso may partially account for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
