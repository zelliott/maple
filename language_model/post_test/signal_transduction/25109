zzso interactions between zzso and its natural zzso in the presence of zzso signals, elicit T cell zzso functions, whereas subtle changes in the structure of zzso peptides may induce only selected T cell zzso function including zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso activity of an altered zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso derived from the zzso T cell zzso of the group 2 zzso of house dust zzso in which zzso at positions 34 and 36 were zzso by zzso zzso zzso synthesis was induced by zzso zzso of the analogue compared with native zzso zzso 2, zzso and was paralleled by increased zzso of cell surface zzso zzso and zzso production exhibit the same sensitivity to both zzso zzso that the induction of T cell zzso functions are not all zzso to zzso zzso Both native zzso and the analogue bound to zzso class II zzso molecules with similar zzso Furthermore, p 2, zzso induced T cell zzso at lower zzso than native zzso During the induction of zzso zzso production was comparable for both zzso whereas zzso zzso was markedly increased but more so in response to p 2, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was similar for native zzso and p 2, zzso and increased in zzso whereas only zzso was elevated during zzso The zzso of T cell zzso function with altered zzso zzso may have practical applications in zzso allergic inflammatory responses through the induction of T cell zzso and/or the promotion of zzso zzso
