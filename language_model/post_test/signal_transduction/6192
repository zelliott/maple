zzso zzso signaling is an zzso zzso mechanism that regulates many zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso that binds to the zzso domain of N and positively regulates N zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso action is zzso Here, we found that zzso was required and sufficient to activate the expression of gene targets of the zzso zzso N signaling zzso Although zzso required N and a zzso element that zzso with the zzso site, zzso activated a target zzso of N zzso the zzso compartment boundary zzso of vestigial zzso in a manner that was independent of the Delta zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso caused N to be moved from the zzso cell surface into the zzso where it accumulated zzso and zzso with zzso zzso with this, the zzso gene was required for the presence of N in the zzso zzso Finally, blocking the N transportation from the plasma membrane to the zzso by a zzso form of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of N zzso suggesting that the zzso of N in the zzso was required for the zzso zzso N zzso
