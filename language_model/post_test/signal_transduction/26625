zzso zzso cell injury is one of the major mechanisms implicated in calcium zzso zzso zzso and growth of kidney zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso free zzso play a significant role in zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso requires several regulatory zzso the primary goal of this study was to characterize the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso injury in zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso significantly increased membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso We found that zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso blocked zzso membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso exposure significantly increased hydrogen zzso formation and zzso release in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased zzso hydrogen zzso production and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure did not increase zzso protein zzso suggesting that zzso resides upstream from zzso in the zzso that regulates zzso zzso In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso of zzso zzso might be a crucial mechanism responsible for zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling plays a key role in zzso zzso injury, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent calcium zzso crystal deposition in stone zzso and reduce zzso
