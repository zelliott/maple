zzso zzso zzso plays an active and complex role in regulating cellular behaviors, including proliferation and zzso This study aimed at zzso the zzso signaling profiles in cultured human retinal zzso zzso zzso cells and investigating the zzso effect of zzso drugs in this zzso zzso zzso cells grown on various zzso zzso such as type I and IV zzso zzso and zzso were used for zzso zzso and for examining the zzso profiles of signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso zzso zzso using Western zzso The cells receiving zzso drug treatment at zzso doses were used to evaluate their zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso coating enhanced zzso and spreading of zzso cells zzso The cellular attachment onto zzso surfaces zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso but decreased zzso zzso Treatment with zzso agents, including zzso zzso C, and zzso at zzso doses suppressed the ability of zzso cells to adhere to zzso zzso zzso This suppression was in part zzso through reduction of zzso zzso and zzso expressions and interfering zzso signaling zzso zzso blockade of zzso signaling resulted in the suppressed zzso of zzso cells to zzso These findings support the hypothesis that, in addition to their zzso effect, zzso agents also exhibit zzso effect on the zzso of cultured zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso can potentially be used as therapeutic agents for zzso zzso
