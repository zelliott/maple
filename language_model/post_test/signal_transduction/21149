The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium zzso on calcium zzso zzso was found to stimulate a zzso increase in zzso calcium zzso zzso through zzso zzso but this effect was attenuated in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso sodium zzso Evidence is provided that release of zzso from zzso stores is decreased in a zzso zzso zzso with zzso that show lower levels of zzso in cells zzso with higher zzso of sodium zzso suggest that sodium zzso also decreases zzso zzso These results suggest that changes in zzso zzso are at least partially responsible for sodium zzso zzso cell zzso
