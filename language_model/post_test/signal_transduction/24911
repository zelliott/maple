We investigated whether zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso of human T zzso First, zzso proteins were zzso by zzso zzso with zzso of zzso blood T zzso before zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Then, to identify which of the three zzso was involved, zzso zzso and zzso proteins were specifically zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of their alpha zzso in zzso zzso After zzso zzso production and zzso expression were inhibited only in cells expressing inactive zzso We then studied the effects of zzso zzso a zzso with receptors coupled to zzso and produced in an zzso fashion by activated T zzso Although its effects varied among donors, zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso expression (up to, respectively, 200 and zzso of zzso T zzso in response to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso production (by up to zzso and zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation zzso and zzso zzso zzso of activated T zzso In zzso several major responses of human T zzso to zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso which for this function can be activated by zzso in an zzso zzso
