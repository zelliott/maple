zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso gene zzso patients to develop zzso tumors in the zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso a protein with unknown function that may interact with the zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso To clarify zzso function in the zzso we generated a zzso knockout mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed early embryonic zzso at zzso showing defects in the visceral zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice appeared normal at birth but developed kidney zzso and solid tumors as they aged zzso zzso survival zzso 23 months, median zzso survival zzso 25 zzso As observed in human zzso kidney tumors, three different zzso types of kidney tumors developed in zzso mice including zzso hybrid, zzso and clear cell with zzso loss of zzso zzso supporting a tumor zzso function for zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso was activated in both human zzso zzso tumors and kidney tumors in zzso zzso Interestingly, total zzso protein was elevated in kidney tumors compared to normal kidney zzso but without increased levels of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be regulated by zzso through post zzso or zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso led to both zzso and zzso zzso in kidney tumors from zzso mice and human zzso zzso These data support a role for zzso zzso zzso in kidney tumor formation caused by loss of zzso and suggest that zzso of both zzso and zzso may be effective as potential therapeutic agents for zzso kidney zzso
