Human zzso zzso zzso is the only human zzso zzso It causes a wide spectrum of human diseases, including fifth disease zzso zzso in children and pure red cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso replicates in zzso zzso cells zzso Current understanding of how zzso interacts with cellular factors to regulate disease progression is zzso due to a lack of zzso cell lines and animal zzso Here, we employed a recently developed primary human zzso zzso culture system that is highly zzso for zzso infection to identify cellular factors that lead to cell cycle arrest after zzso zzso We found that zzso exploited the zzso family of zzso factors by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso repressive zzso zzso to zzso in the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso was a key viral factor responsible for altering zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso or zzso enhanced the nuclear import of these repressive zzso and induced stable zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest was independent of zzso zzso and increased viral zzso zzso zzso targets, which are potentially involved in the progression from zzso into M phase and zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso These findings provide new insight into the molecular zzso of zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso
