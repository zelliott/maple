It has been proposed that the zzso II zzso zzso complex arrests zzso and triggers zzso zzso degradation of zzso It is unclear whether the initial trigger for zzso degradation is due to DNA damage or zzso zzso In the current study we show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso which traps zzso into a circular clamp rather than the zzso zzso complex, can also arrest zzso Arrest of transcription, which is zzso is accompanied by zzso degradation of zzso Different from zzso poisons and other zzso agents, zzso did not induce zzso degradation of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso degradation of zzso induced by the zzso zzso complex or the zzso circular clamp is due to zzso arrest but not DNA zzso By contrast, degradation of the large zzso of zzso zzso II is due to a zzso zzso
