The recognition of DNA zzso breaks or zzso DNA gaps as a precondition for cell cycle checkpoint arrest has been well zzso However, how bulky base damage such as zzso zzso zzso elicits a checkpoint response has remained zzso zzso zzso repair represents the main zzso for zzso zzso removal that results in strand zzso However, we demonstrate here that zzso zzso an early event of checkpoint signaling in zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso repair zzso even if replication as a source of secondary DNA damage is zzso Thus, our data hint at primary base damage or at zzso damage zzso or zzso that does not need to be processed by zzso as the relevant zzso of zzso checkpoint zzso
