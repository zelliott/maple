zzso toxins zzso are the most common class of bacterial protein toxins and constitute important bacterial zzso zzso The mode of action of zzso is starting to be better zzso In contrast, little is known about the cellular response to this zzso Recent studies reveal that cells do not just swell and zzso but are able to sense and react to pore formation, mount a defense, even repair the damaged membrane and thus zzso These responses involve a variety of zzso pathways and sophisticated cellular mechanisms such as the zzso regulating zzso zzso In this review we discuss the different classes of bacterial zzso and their modes of action, and provide examples of how the different bacteria use zzso Finally, we address the more recent field dealing with the zzso cell response to zzso zzso
