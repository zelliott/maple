The zzso zzso family comprises a number of surface receptors including the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso transport of zzso the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso and at least two alternative zzso zzso These are the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which have been implicated in zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso In this review we focus on the biology of zzso zzso zzso is expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso This zzso represents a zzso zzso zzso protein that binds both zzso zzso with low zzso A single gene zzso zzso has been isolated, which is located within the zzso zzso cluster on zzso zzso The zzso alpha chain lacks zzso signal zzso zzso but can associate with the zzso zzso that bears an zzso motif zzso in the zzso domain, allowing zzso zzso zzso expressed alone mediates zzso and zzso of zzso No zzso zzso has been defined in the zzso and progress in defining the in zzso role of zzso has been made using human zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated zzso expression on zzso cells and so defined a key role for the zzso in zzso zzso The zzso functions as a second line of zzso defense involving serum zzso rather than zzso zzso Studies in zzso mice, zzso defined an essential role for soluble zzso in the development of zzso zzso by formation of circulating zzso zzso Finally, recent work points out a role for human zzso in treatment of infectious and zzso zzso
