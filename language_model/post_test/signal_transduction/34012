The development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit zzso oxygen species zzso damage in blood vessels has been limited by a lack of specific targets for zzso zzso zzso events in the vessel wall is of interest, because zzso play important roles throughout zzso In early zzso zzso stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell zzso growth, whereas in late stages of zzso development, zzso induce zzso zzso causing zzso plaque zzso To identify putative protective genes against zzso stress, mouse zzso zzso were infected with a zzso human heart zzso expression library, and zzso was induced in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso A total of 17 different, complete zzso were identified from the zzso zzso clones by zzso amplification and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 1) was present in several independent zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso production, zzso activity, DNA zzso and decreased zzso zzso potential in zzso while decreasing zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso expression by short hairpin zzso significantly enhanced zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and protected zzso against zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso of zzso protein expression using small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and significantly attenuated zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso zzso promotes zzso survival by interfering with zzso and zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso
