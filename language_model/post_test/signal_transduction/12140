zzso zzso were described to exert zzso and zzso zzso Based on this observation we hypothesized that the zzso zzso zzso induced vascular zzso With this purpose, the present work investigates the mechanisms involved in the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, using standard muscle bath procedures, were performed in isolated zzso rings from male zzso zzso zzso calcium concentration zzso was measured by zzso zzso using the fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso 50 and 100 zzso inhibited zzso and zzso contraction in either zzso or zzso rat zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso contraction in zzso solution containing zzso (30 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso relaxed zzso rings with intact or zzso zzso The zzso also relaxed zzso rings with intact or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso study showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso inhibited the increase in zzso in smooth muscle and zzso cells induced by zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of intact or zzso zzso rings with zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso produced a rightward displacement of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso W (1 zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (1 zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso our results provide evidence that the effects zzso by zzso involve zzso zzso influx zzso Its effects are also partly zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso
