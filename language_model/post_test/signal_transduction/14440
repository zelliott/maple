zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso the major zzso in zzso zzso is coupled with sequential zzso in expression of zzso including the zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the relationship among the zzso in expression of the genes and the zzso of their signaling in activated zzso remains zzso We recently showed that zzso the yellow zzso in curry, inhibited cell growth and induced gene expression of zzso zzso in activated zzso in zzso The present study is to zzso the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the impacts of zzso and zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the interruption of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways by zzso might stimulate gene expression of zzso in activated zzso Our results in this report indicate that the zzso of zzso or zzso signaling by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso interrupts zzso and zzso signaling demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and by reducing the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The blockade of zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso gene expression in activated zzso leading to the reduction in cell growth, including inducing cell arrest and zzso Our results collectively demonstrate that the interruption of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways by zzso stimulates gene expression of zzso in activated zzso These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of zzso in the induction of zzso gene expression in activated zzso
