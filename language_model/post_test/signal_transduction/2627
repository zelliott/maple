We have investigated the zzso relationship of proteins involved in zzso signal zzso in isolated rat cardiac zzso These cells contain about zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors per cell, as determined by zzso zzso We have assessed the amount of zzso alpha present in zzso zzso by zzso using a zzso zzso zzso alpha fusion protein as a standard for zzso By this method, we determined that cardiac zzso contain about 35 zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso molecules per cell of the 45 and 52 zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were used to assess the formation of zzso zzso binding sites representing zzso zzso zzso complexes occurring in response to zzso alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complexes was facilitated by the zzso of cells with zzso The addition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso results in the formation of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate that, in a zzso relevant setting, zzso is present in large zzso excess relative to both zzso and zzso In addition, we show that, overall, only modest signal amplification occurs between zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso (rather than zzso is the component zzso to zzso that limits zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso Although limited data are as yet available for other zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso of zzso components and the extent of signal amplification described for the zzso response zzso will be zzso to other zzso hormone zzso zzso
