Previously, we demonstrated that zzso from zzso 1 zzso mice have a reduced inflammatory zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso In this study, we determined how zzso regulates zzso zzso We found that zzso or zzso zzso human zzso treatment zzso zzso factor zzso expression in bone zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso expression (at the zzso and protein zzso and nuclear zzso zzso activity were also zzso by zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso production was abolished in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activates zzso through a zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by using a zzso or an zzso to block the association between zzso and zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is partially zzso by the interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso
