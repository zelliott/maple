Occupational exposure to zzso zzso compounds has been shown to cause serious toxic and zzso zzso The skin is an important target for the compounds in industrially exposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates cell zzso zzso and zzso This zzso effects on cellular response depend upon the cell type and zzso The mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso in the skin are unclear at zzso The aim of this study is to examine whether zzso regulates zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso The present study showed that zzso induced zzso cell death through zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by small interference zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso cell death with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso family zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso enhanced zzso which corresponded to increasing zzso and zzso This phenomenon is associated with zzso zzso caused by increasing zzso oxygen species zzso levels because of the zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso generated by zzso is a pivotal regulator of zzso
