It is known from nutritional studies that vitamin A is an important factor for normal zzso though it has been difficult to define its precise zzso The vitamin zzso zzso quail zzso provides an effective zzso zzso model for investigating the function of zzso during zzso The zzso zzso develops with a significant reduction in zzso cells, which has not been noted zzso zzso of the primitive zzso program and early expression of the zzso marker zzso occurs, though zzso levels eventually decline, consistent with the zzso and zzso zzso However, from its early zzso the zzso gene fails to be expressed normally in zzso zzso The bone zzso protein zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso expression becomes reduced in the zzso embryonic region of zzso zzso Adding zzso to cultured zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso cells, whereas normal zzso cultured in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso are defective in primitive zzso We find that cell clusters of primitive blood islands undergo an inappropriate program of zzso in the zzso zzso which can explain the deficit in differentiated primitive blood zzso We propose that vitamin zzso zzso are required for normal zzso zzso zzso and that an embryonic zzso signaling zzso controls zzso cell survival relevant to primitive zzso
