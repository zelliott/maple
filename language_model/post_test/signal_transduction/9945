The engagement of the T cell zzso results in zzso zzso reorganization at the immune zzso zzso and the triggering of zzso signaling zzso leading to gene regulation and, ultimately, cellular zzso Recent studies have identified the WAVE family of proteins as critical zzso of zzso zzso reorganization in other cell zzso However, whether these proteins participate in zzso reorganization at the IS or signaling pathways in T cells has not been zzso 

By using a combination of zzso zzso and cell biology approaches, we provide evidence that zzso is recruited to the zzso is zzso zzso and is required for zzso reorganization and zzso zzso after zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso regulates calcium entry at a point zzso to zzso zzso and zzso store zzso 

These data reveal a role for zzso in regulating multiple pathways leading to T cell zzso In particular, this work shows that zzso is a key component of the zzso regulatory machinery in T cells and that it also zzso in linking zzso calcium store depletion to calcium zzso calcium zzso channel zzso
