zzso of zzso tuberculosis is likely to be a major cause of extended zzso regimens and wide prevalence of zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso tuberculosis dormancy are not well zzso In this study, zzso genes responsible for synthesis zzso and degradation zzso of the ubiquitous bacterial second messenger, zzso zzso zzso were deleted in the virulent zzso tuberculosis strain zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso Under zzso growth conditions, the two zzso and zzso cells showed similar zzso However, zzso and zzso exhibited increased and reduced zzso respectively, in both zzso and vitamin zzso zzso dormancy models, as determined by survival and growth recovery from zzso The zzso of zzso cultures of zzso and zzso zzso exhibited no difference, whereas those of zzso cultures showed a significant difference with 61 genes that are not a part of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso showed decreased zzso with human zzso zzso zzso also showed attenuated zzso in a zzso mouse infection zzso These findings are explained by zzso signaling zzso regulating zzso tuberculosis dormancy and zzso
