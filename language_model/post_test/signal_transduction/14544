zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso zzso by zzso is terminated by the zzso of zzso signaling zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on our recent report that zzso zzso zzso signaling by stimulating zzso zzso we investigated the effects of selective zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso signaling in human embryonic kidney zzso and breast cancer zzso cells expressing human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso of a zzso zzso reporter and zzso zzso in both cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso these actions of zzso in zzso cells but not breast cancer zzso zzso expression in both cell types was zzso by zzso but unaffected by zzso In zzso cells, zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso whereas the latter additionally inhibited zzso The zzso were unaffected by zzso In breast cancer cells, zzso activity was not altered by zzso or zzso In zzso zzso inhibited the zzso signaling of zzso and zzso zzso expression in both zzso and breast cancer zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso signaling by reducing zzso activities in zzso cells and had no effect on both in breast cancer zzso We provide the first evidence for a novel mechanism regulating zzso zzso in which zzso enhance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso manner by attenuating protein zzso zzso zzso
