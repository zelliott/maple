Maintenance of a polarized zzso zzso by appropriate zzso signaling and zzso zzso is critical both in normal zzso function as well as in acute and chronic zzso zzso We examined the hypothesis that maintenance of a differentiated zzso zzso on the basement membrane zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which were cultured on zzso zzso collagen IV, we analyzed cell zzso and zzso zzso migration zzso as well as expression of differentiation and zzso markers zzso zzso 

zzso migration of zzso cells was significantly slowed down on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with collagen IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso (1 zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso significantly zzso cohort migration on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In parallel to the increased migratory activity, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a more zzso zzso of zzso cells on zzso with increased formation of zzso and zzso distinct loss of focal contacts and stress zzso zzso of the zzso marker zzso and loss of zzso contacts with zzso of zzso from the zzso junctions to the zzso and zzso Similarly, cohort migration of zzso cells was retarded on zzso when compared with collagen IV, and addition of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in enhanced zzso and a change in cell zzso 

The study demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso is required to maintain a zzso zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells on the basement membrane zzso zzso
