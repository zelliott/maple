Our understanding of the effects of zzso and its mechanisms has increased substantially in recent years, probably because of the importance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in several major cardiovascular zzso Recent clinical studies have confirmed the benefits of MR zzso in patients with heart failure, left zzso dysfunction after zzso zzso hypertension or diabetic zzso However, it would be a gross zzso to conclude that the role of zzso is unequivocally zzso zzso is zzso in the adrenal zzso and binds to specific zzso in target zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso the cell nucleus where it zzso gene expression and activates specific zzso proteins that control sodium zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso also impacts a wide range of zzso zzso such as the heart and blood zzso zzso zzso can also be zzso in zzso zzso and it may act in a rapid zzso zzso note the existence of zzso that exhibit plasma zzso much higher than those of zzso and that are structurally very similar to zzso It is thus possible that zzso may bind to the zzso zzso in some cell zzso zzso experimental models and several strains of transgenic mice have allowed us to better understand the effects of zzso on the zzso Specifically, it seems that a slight increase in cardiac zzso zzso zzso a decreased coronary reserve in mice by decreasing the zzso zzso channels associated with coronary smooth muscle zzso Taken together, these experiments indicate that vascular cells are the primary targets of zzso in the cardiovascular zzso The hormone directly affects NO and zzso coronary zzso Both mechanisms may contribute to the deleterious cardiovascular effects of MR zzso
