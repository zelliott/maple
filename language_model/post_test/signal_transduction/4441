zzso evidence suggests that zzso signaling in zzso is closely regulated to avoid excessive responses to zzso A variety of zzso zzso induce a cascade of signaling events termed as zzso signaling that culminate in exposure of zzso binding sites on zzso zzso Once zzso zzso has occurred, zzso zzso zzso zzso formation by providing zzso zzso signals zzso in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso a member of the cortical zzso marker of the zzso zzso family, was initially identified as a zzso for a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso in resting zzso functions as an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice enhances zzso function of zzso in zzso The absence of zzso results in increase in zzso zzso ex zzso This gain of function is not because of enhanced zzso signaling because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, as well as zzso zzso zzso are normal in the absence of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso signaling such as zzso spreading and zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso normally limits zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling thus preventing premature zzso zzso
