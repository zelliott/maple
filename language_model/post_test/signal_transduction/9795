Advances in studies of rice innate immunity have led to the identification and characterization of host sensors zzso zzso zzso that perceive zzso microbial zzso zzso zzso that carry the zzso domain, are highly expanded in rice zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Researchers have also identified a diverse array of microbial zzso from bacterial and zzso pathogens that triggers immune responses upon zzso These include zzso that indirectly target host zzso binding zzso rich repeat proteins and zzso zzso zzso that directly bind promoters of host zzso Here we review the recognition and signaling events that govern rice innate zzso
