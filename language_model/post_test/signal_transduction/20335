The importance of the zzso barrier in preventing effective zzso of zzso has been zzso The controversy stems from the fact that vascular zzso cell tight junctions are disrupted in the zzso allowing some systemic drug zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso drugs from brain zzso zzso cells into the zzso We tested the hypothesis that although the tight junctions are zzso in the core of zzso active zzso limits drug delivery to zzso normal brain and consequently, treatment zzso zzso zzso were induced by zzso transfer into zzso zzso mice or mice deficient for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were orally zzso with zzso a zzso inhibitor and dual zzso zzso that is being currently tested in clinical zzso zzso mice treated with zzso survived for twice as long as zzso zzso zzso of the tumor core, invasive zzso and normal brain revealed zzso to zzso enhancement in zzso brain zzso in zzso mice relative to zzso Analysis of signaling showed that poor drug delivery correlated with the lack of zzso of a zzso target, especially in normal zzso A majority of human zzso zzso lines tested expressed zzso or zzso and were zzso to zzso by a dual zzso zzso illustrating a second barrier to drug delivery intrinsic to the tumor zzso These data show that active zzso is a relevant obstacle to treating zzso and provide a plausible zzso basis for the clinical failure of numerous drugs that are zzso zzso
