Cancer chemotherapy relies heavily on DNA damaging agents such as zzso to induce zzso cell zzso The response of cells to zzso zzso including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and cell death, is zzso by the DNA damage response zzso To address the relationship between the zzso and the outcome of exposure, this study zzso a zzso cell sorting zzso approach to isolate zzso and zzso cells from a DNA zzso zzso human cell zzso The pattern of zzso of the key DNA damage response protein zzso on zzso zzso was altered in zzso cells isolated following zzso zzso By combining zzso with zzso screening for zzso zzso zzso changes were characterized in a number of key zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso was increased in zzso zzso This approach provides novel insights into the relationship between zzso protein zzso and the cellular consequences of exposure to this zzso zzso
