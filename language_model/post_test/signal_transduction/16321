We recently reported that extracts made from the stem bark of zzso zzso promoted peak bone mass achievement in growing rats and preserved zzso bone mass and cortical bone strength in zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso a novel zzso isolated from the zzso had a zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso Here we studied the effects of zzso on zzso function and its mode of action and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival, and differentiation but had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso proliferation and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso production, which zzso zzso gene zzso zzso treatments given to zzso to zzso rats or adult rats increased the zzso levels of zzso target genes in zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso In growing female rats, zzso promoted parameters of peak bone zzso in the zzso zzso including increased zzso growth, bone mineral density, zzso rate zzso cortical deposition, and bone zzso zzso promoted the process of providing newly generated bone to fill drill holes in the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso rats, zzso increased zzso and significantly restored zzso bone compared with the zzso zzso Together our data suggest that zzso stimulates zzso growth and differentiation via the zzso and promotes zzso bone zzso zzso bone healing after injury, and exerts anabolic effects on zzso rats likely by a direct zzso effect on zzso Based on these zzso data, clinical evaluation of zzso as a potential bone anabolic agent is zzso
