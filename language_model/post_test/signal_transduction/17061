The zzso signaling plays a key role in cell zzso survival, and proliferation through diverse zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso signaling can lead to a variety of disorders including human zzso Of considerable interest, recent evidence indicates that there is a significant zzso between zzso and zzso As a key component of the zzso zzso complex, zzso can regulate expression of a number of zzso at the same time, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso are also subject to regulation by zzso Thus, a better understanding of how zzso signaling interacts with zzso in the context of cancer will help identify novel zzso and therapeutic zzso In this review, we update on recent findings on zzso interacting with zzso signaling at various levels, leading to zzso or zzso We also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting zzso signaling and related zzso
