The zzso receptors have attracted considerable attention for their ability to control cellular functions that regulate zzso development and tissue zzso zzso receptors act by controlling the expression of a specific set of target zzso If zzso signaling system can be so simple, and yet so complex in its zzso effects, then a sophisticated network of regulatory mechanisms is required to maintain the control over the zzso activity and termination of this signaling zzso A multitude of regulatory mechanisms has been discovered that controls the interaction of zzso receptors with their zzso the assembling of a zzso zzso zzso complex and the termination of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso receptors are zzso as single zzso pairing with each other during their trafficking through the zzso zzso The mechanisms operating in the phase preceding the generation of the zzso zzso zzso receptors can be as elaborate and zzso important as those operating downstream of zzso zzso zzso These regulatory mechanisms, which are essential to understand the role of zzso signaling in human physiology and pathology are reviewed zzso
