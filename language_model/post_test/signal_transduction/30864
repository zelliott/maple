zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso present at the plasma membrane and in zzso zzso A synthetic chemical, zzso zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso We previously reported that zzso signaling is specifically inhibited by zzso treatment in barley zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso also inhibited zzso programmed cell death zzso in zzso zzso We examined the zzso and specificity of the zzso effect of zzso on zzso signaling using zzso analysis and found that zzso was largely effective in zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso genes were zzso by zzso in a zzso manner, and many of these were zzso as zzso zzso Defense signaling triggered by several defense system zzso such as zzso acid and a zzso zzso could inhibit zzso events such as zzso zzso zzso and expression of some zzso genes in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene which is important for zzso gene zzso and induced known zzso of zzso zzso two zzso genes and a zzso zzso zzso These effects of zzso were also zzso by the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling is under the regulation of zzso signaling in zzso zzso It is also probable that zzso are involved in the perception of stimuli causing defense zzso
