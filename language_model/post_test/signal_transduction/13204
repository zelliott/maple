zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso produced primarily by fungus zzso zzso in corn, causes several fatal animal zzso In mice, liver is the primary site of its zzso Our previous study showed that maximum induction of zzso gamma zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso was observed at 4 and 8 zzso respectively, after an acute zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the zzso induction of other zzso and genes involved in zzso zzso male zzso mice were administered orally with either saline or 25 zzso of zzso and sampled 4 or 8 h after zzso zzso of various genes was analyzed by zzso protection zzso zzso treatment caused increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso in both liver and zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was induced only in the zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso 55 and zzso interacting zzso was increased in liver and kidney after zzso zzso zzso 8 expression was increased only in liver with no changes in kidney with zzso zzso treatment induced expression of zzso in liver and kidney with no zzso in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso death domain and zzso protein zzso Treatment of mice with zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and Max, zzso zzso factors in the zzso zzso toxicity caused induction of zzso network in liver with involvement of zzso signaling zzso Increased expression of zzso 8 involved in the zzso signaling zzso may contribute to the zzso whereas zzso induction could contribute to the zzso effects observed in zzso zzso
