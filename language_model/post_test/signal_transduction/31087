The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the signal initiated by zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the pharmacological properties of reference molecules acting on the zzso zzso using various zzso responses and a novel functional zzso based on the zzso of zzso with the alpha zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso The measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso has zzso activity, a response blocked by zzso which indicates a functional zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso display inverse zzso properties and the zzso zzso has no effect at the zzso zzso response, but converts zzso inactive forms of zzso into active zzso An zzso zzso zzso does not mediate an increase in zzso response, presumably reflecting its inability to reach the cell zzso These studies identify novel properties of molecules displaying potential interest in the treatment of various zzso and brain diseases, and demonstrate that zzso is capable of signaling through zzso
