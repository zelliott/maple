Cell surface zzso are the primary receptors for cell migration on zzso zzso and exist in several zzso states regulated in part by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which pairs only with zzso has specific roles in the immune system and may regulate cell zzso zzso cells express abundant zzso zzso and its role in cell migration was zzso zzso derived from zzso and zzso supported zzso zzso cell attachment and zzso dependent migration, but not focal zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso focal zzso and stress zzso formation, suggesting that the zzso status of zzso zzso was zzso The effect of zzso zzso in promoting focal zzso formation was reproduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to focal zzso where active zzso zzso was also detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly was commensurate with reduced cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to the zzso chemical inhibitor and an inhibitor of zzso zzso recycling, but not zzso of protein zzso C or the small zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that although zzso zzso can induce and zzso to focal zzso in a high zzso state, its intermediate activity state normally supports cell zzso consistent with zzso
