To analyze whether insulin zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso vessel development and whether zzso blockade can inhibit zzso in zzso 

The impact of zzso blockade by zzso zzso an zzso zzso against zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso proliferation was assessed by zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso blockade on zzso growth factor expression by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested by real-time zzso The mouse model of inflammatory zzso zzso was used to analyze the effect of zzso blockade in zzso after zzso zzso placement, mice were treated with zzso eye drops zzso daily afterwards for 1 week, 5 zzso per zzso 50, 100, or 200 zzso Afterward, zzso zzso were prepared and stained for blood and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited zzso proliferation dose zzso zzso led to decreased zzso expression levels in zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso showed no significant zzso In zzso zzso expression levels were also inhibited by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited when used at a concentration of 200 zzso (by zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited when used at a dose of 100 zzso (by zzso P zzso zzso and the highest used dose zzso zzso showed an even stronger zzso (by zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso not only zzso but also zzso To the zzso knowledge, this is the first evidence that zzso is involved in the molecular zzso leading to zzso
