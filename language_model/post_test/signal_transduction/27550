In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade is known to play a major role in cellular adaptation to adverse external zzso including zzso stress, zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso agents, and heat zzso Nonetheless, it is not known whether or not this particular zzso cascade is also involved in response to the most common stress, zzso In this study, we provide evidence that the zzso zzso cascade is implicated in salt stress response through regulating expression of a zzso zzso The downstream target gene thus identified is the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso The salt zzso nature of zzso expression was characterized zzso It was found that not only the zzso zzso zzso but also the zzso zzso factor is crucial for the zzso expression of zzso As far as we know, this is the first instance that the zzso zzso zzso cascade plays a role in salt stress response in zzso zzso
