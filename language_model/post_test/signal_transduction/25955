The mechanism that regulates the terminal maturation of zzso stem cells into zzso cells is poorly zzso zzso identifying genes and surface markers that are restricted to specific stages of zzso maturation will further our understanding of zzso To identify genes expressed at discrete stages of zzso development, we screened for genes that contributed to the proliferation and maturation of zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso cells with a human fetal liver zzso zzso zzso library and zzso the cells in the absence of EPO, we identified 17 candidate genes that supported zzso colony zzso In addition, the mouse zzso of these candidate genes were identified and their expression was examined in zzso zzso populations by zzso The expression of candidate zzso marker was also assessed at the protein level by zzso and zzso Our study demonstrated that expression of the zzso zzso an zzso family member, significantly increased as zzso stem cells differentiated into mature zzso cells in the mouse zzso The zzso protein was more abundant in mature zzso cells than zzso stem and zzso cells in the mouse FL by zzso Moreover, zzso gene expression was detected in mature zzso cells from human peripheral zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel marker of the terminal zzso maturation of zzso stem cells in both mice and zzso
