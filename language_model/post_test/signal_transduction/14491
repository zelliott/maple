Evidence for the participation of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso systems in zzso zzso establishment is zzso In this paper, we evaluated zzso production and the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the early contact of the zzso fungus zzso zzso with the roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso Roots were placed in contact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso production was evaluated by determining the levels of zzso and zzso zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso production were zzso the first two coinciding with zzso zzso zzso The first zzso production peak coincided with an increase in zzso activity, whereas zzso activity seemed to be implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso growth was evaluated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso crude extracts prepared during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth that matched the zzso production profile with a delay was zzso The result suggests that during the early stages of zzso establishment, zzso results from an zzso of zzso zzso and plays a role in zzso during symbiotic zzso
