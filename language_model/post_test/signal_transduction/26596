zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a precursor and zzso of zzso and is also a functional zzso of cellular zzso However, the effect of zzso on cardiac zzso is not fully zzso The present study was therefore designed to explore whether zzso could prevent cardiac zzso induced by zzso II zzso zzso and clarify its potential zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II for 2 weeks in the presence or absence of zzso zzso while zzso zzso was induced by zzso II zzso zzso for 48 zzso We found that zzso zzso attenuated the zzso cell size of zzso induced by zzso II both in zzso and in zzso The high zzso and zzso levels induced by zzso II were also reversed by zzso in zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso prevented the augment of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso calcium concentration in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso levels by zzso II in zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso In conclusion, zzso prevents zzso zzso cardiac zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as regulation of zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into the pharmacological role of zzso in cardiovascular zzso
