zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that on zzso generates signals that can zzso crucial cell functions, including cell zzso migration, and zzso In zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to promote cell proliferation by signaling through the zzso protein zzso cascade in several cell zzso We have shown previously that zzso of zzso zzso lacking alternative zzso in zzso zzso clones injected zzso into zzso mouse brains promotes tumor cell zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso biopsy samples, zzso is expressed as an zzso zzso and zzso with a faster mobility similar to that observed in embryonic zzso Compared with zzso adult brain zzso the levels of zzso protein are elevated as are its levels of zzso as assessed by zzso and overall zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso in these tumors is also zzso as well as the activity of zzso zzso associated with zzso the latter may result in enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso in the zzso zzso biopsy samples and in zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso brain biopsy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated expression of zzso D and E are also found in zzso zzso biopsy zzso These data provide evidence that the increased zzso activity in these tumors contributes to zzso of zzso and likely to the promotion of Ras activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation in zzso
