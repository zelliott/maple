zzso synthesis was studied in rat zzso isolated by zzso zzso zzso induced a one and a half to twofold increase in zzso incorporation into zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 40 zzso and zzso zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso approximately 40 zzso zzso was without appreciable effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso was without effect on zzso synthesis regardless of insulin zzso
