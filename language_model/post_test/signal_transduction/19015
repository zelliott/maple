Multiple myeloma remains incurable to date; therefore, new biologically zzso therapies are urgently zzso Our previous studies have showed that the zzso zzso possessed zzso activity in solid zzso The present study evaluated the effect of zzso on human multiple zzso zzso under zzso and zzso its mechanism of zzso An zzso chicken zzso membrane model was used to examine the effect of zzso on multiple zzso zzso Compared with zzso medium of control, zzso medium from human multiple myeloma zzso cells zzso with 3 zzso zzso in zzso was observed to reduce zzso growth on chicken zzso zzso by approximately zzso zzso The level of vascular zzso growth factor in zzso medium was determined by zzso zzso zzso The results confirmed that 3 zzso zzso could significantly decrease vascular zzso growth factor zzso by zzso cells zzso which correlated well with the reduction of multiple zzso zzso on chicken zzso zzso Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction results revealed that zzso zzso the expression of vascular zzso growth factor in zzso cells in zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and inhibited growth of zzso cells under hypoxic zzso zzso we concluded that zzso which is already used to treat malaria and is well zzso possesses potential as an zzso drug in multiple myeloma therapy and thereby may improve patient zzso
