zzso protects cells from zzso initiated by a variety of stimuli including loss of cell zzso zzso zzso mice develop zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso formation coinciding with zzso maturation in normal zzso To gain a better understanding of the role zzso mechanisms play during zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso and collecting duct cell lines from zzso day 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Very little is known about the role zzso and migratory mechanisms play during zzso zzso We observed that zzso of zzso properties, which normally occur in a zzso zzso manner during zzso zzso and cell migration were altered in cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in a scratch wound zzso was completely inhibited by incubation with zzso zzso zzso and moderately affected by incubation with zzso zzso zzso These cells expressed increased levels of zzso and had numerous central focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso but zzso poorly to zzso zzso or zzso Collecting duct cells, similar to zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso mice, demonstrated enhanced migration in a scratch wound zzso that was inhibited by incubation with zzso zzso of these cells was moderately affected by incubation with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas incubation with zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso collecting duct cells also expressed increased levels of zzso but decreased levels of zzso and demonstrated precocious binding to zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso collecting duct cells to adhere to zzso and zzso corresponded with a decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and migratory characteristics may be an early indicator of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
