The gap junction zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in skeletal zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso can enhance the signaling and zzso response to zzso growth factor 2 zzso in zzso by increasing protein zzso zzso zzso zzso to affect zzso zzso In the present study, we show by zzso reporter zzso that the zzso signaling cascade acts in parallel to zzso to zzso zzso activity downstream of the zzso amplification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was confirmed by Western zzso as was the zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso with our prior observations for zzso flow zzso analyses show that zzso zzso enhances the percentage of zzso cells in response to zzso supporting the notion that shared signals among gap zzso cells result in the enhanced response to zzso Western blots and zzso reporter zzso performed on zzso cultured under zzso and zzso conditions revealed that zzso contacts are required for zzso to amplify zzso zzso and gene zzso Similarly, zzso of gap zzso communication with the channel blocker zzso acid zzso the zzso enhancement of zzso zzso In total, these data underscore the importance of zzso communication and zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways in the coordination of the zzso response to zzso among populations of zzso
