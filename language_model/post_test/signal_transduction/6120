zzso of zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso on the cell surface is followed by zzso zzso of the virus together with the zzso Here, zzso live zzso revealed the rapid zzso of zzso labeled EV1 into mobile, zzso structures, positive for green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso of EV1 with zzso zzso and zzso zzso known to traffic via zzso demonstrated that the zzso were zzso The initiation of EV1 infection was dependent on zzso II, cholesterol, and protein zzso zzso zzso A, a drug that prevents zzso zzso blocked the EV1 infection cycle, whereas drugs that disrupt the cellular zzso had no zzso In zzso zzso revealed the zzso of viral zzso with zzso viral zzso proteins in zzso before initiation of viral zzso Thus, both the zzso of EV1 to zzso and subsequent events differ clearly from zzso zzso of zzso because EV1 zzso is fast and independent of zzso and EV1 is not sorted further to zzso from zzso These results shed further light on the cell entry of zzso viral pathogens and illustrate the use of viruses as zzso to dissect zzso zzso zzso
