Recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso proteins are involved in a variety of zzso processes in fly, worm, zzso and mouse zzso The zzso zzso protein is required for zzso cells to respond to zzso zzso and zzso signals, but the molecular mechanisms of its action are not well zzso Using the ability of a zzso form of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to block zzso and zzso zzso in a model system, this work attempts to clarify the role of the zzso zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso with an internal deletion of the zzso zzso domain was zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso strongly inhibited induction of secondary axes by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not affect the zzso ability of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso caused severe zzso zzso in the injected zzso whereas zzso zzso suppressed this zzso zzso blocked zzso extension movements in zzso zzso zzso with zzso factors and in zzso marginal zone zzso but did not affect zzso induction and zzso 

A zzso zzso of zzso is a necessary component of zzso signal zzso and functions upstream of zzso These findings also establish a requirement for the zzso domain in signal zzso by zzso and suggest that zzso zzso controls zzso movements in the zzso
