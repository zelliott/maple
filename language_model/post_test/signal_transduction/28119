zzso taste buds contain three zzso distinct cell types that are candidates for taste zzso The zzso roles of these cells are, however, not zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as an important second zzso in bitter, sweet, and zzso taste zzso Previously, we identified the type III zzso zzso zzso as the dominant zzso in taste zzso zzso In addition, a recent study showed that zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of bitter, sweet, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the same subset of zzso To identify the taste cell types that express proteins involved in zzso signal zzso we used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify cells with zzso zzso zzso was used to compare zzso or zzso zzso with that of some known cell type markers such as zzso protein zzso product zzso and neural cell zzso zzso Here we show that a large subset of type II cells and a small subset of type III cells display zzso zzso within their zzso These data suggest that type II cells are the principal zzso of bitter, sweet, and zzso taste zzso However, we did not observe zzso between type II taste cells and nerve zzso Interestingly, we observed subsurface zzso of smooth zzso zzso at the close zzso between the plasma membrane of type II taste cells and nerve zzso We speculate that some type II cells may communicate to the nervous system via subsurface zzso of smooth zzso zzso in lieu of conventional zzso
