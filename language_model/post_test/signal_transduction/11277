zzso of the retinal pathways to the superior zzso zzso and zzso lateral zzso nucleus zzso is zzso by zzso oxide zzso zzso depression zzso can also be induced in SC and zzso during the time at which these pathways are zzso and this zzso is partially dependent on NO and zzso zzso channel zzso In an effort to determine whether zzso zzso refinement is also zzso by zzso channel function, we have examined the refinement of the zzso and zzso pathways in mice which lack the gene for the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and which have significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso were made into one eye of these knockout animals and in zzso mice ages zzso day zzso 13, zzso and zzso After 48 hours, mice were zzso and sections processed by using zzso zzso zzso distribution in some animals was analyzed zzso zzso differences in the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso were observed at zzso with the zzso being more exuberant in zzso zzso This difference was statistically zzso More subtle differences were seen at zzso and zzso zzso differences were also seen in the zzso zzso zzso which in zzso mice filled most of the domain normally occupied by zzso eye zzso This difference was also statistically zzso We conclude that reduction in zzso zzso currents has an effect on zzso refinement similar to that which occurs in NO knockout mice, which supports the possibility that zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso
