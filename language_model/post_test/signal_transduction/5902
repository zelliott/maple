zzso is a member of the zzso zzso sensor protein zzso Among its many zzso functions, its established zzso function is that via zzso zzso zzso protein it protects the zzso from zzso cell zzso The precise zzso zzso through which zzso functions, is not zzso In the present study, a new mechanism by which it functions is zzso The bovine form of zzso zzso native to the zzso has been zzso zzso zzso and zzso The findings show that there is the evolutionary conservation of its zzso It is a zzso of a zzso form of the zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso zzso It senses zzso increments of zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and stimulates zzso or zzso membrane zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso system exists in the zzso zzso And zzso zzso zzso system exists in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso knock out studies demonstrate that the portion of this is about zzso of the total membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso The findings establish zzso as a new zzso sensor zzso of the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso They support the concept on zzso of the presence and operation of the zzso zzso system in the sensory and zzso zzso They validate that the zzso zzso system exists in multiple zzso And they provide an additional mechanism by which zzso zzso acts as a zzso of the zzso signals originating in the zzso
