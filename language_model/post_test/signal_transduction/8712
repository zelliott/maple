The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso signaling has been implicated as a critical contributor to zzso zzso zzso survival, migration and resistance to zzso zzso As a result, zzso signaling has become an attractive target for the development of novel zzso agents, and a large number of compounds, including blocking zzso and zzso zzso zzso targeting the key signaling zzso of the zzso system, the IGF-1 zzso zzso are in zzso and clinical zzso Although most tumors express the zzso expression alone is unlikely to be sufficient for sensitivity to zzso zzso An understanding of the zzso signaling system and its downstream zzso is important, as this information will allow appropriate molecular markers of sensitivity to be determined, thus providing the rationale for combining zzso blockade with other therapies to overcome zzso This review highlights some of the zzso and early clinical data on zzso of sensitivity to zzso targeting in human zzso and reviews the rationale for targeting other zzso zzso such as the insulin zzso and members of the zzso family, to overcome intrinsic resistance to targeted zzso zzso
