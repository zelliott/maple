The purpose of this study is to clarify the contribution of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso to the progression from zzso zzso in zzso zzso to invasive zzso zzso zzso A total of 149 surgically zzso zzso disease specimens and 12 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso The degree of zzso zzso zzso was estimated from the zzso nuclear zzso ratio zzso nuclear zzso in cancer zzso The zzso of breast cancer cells was determined using zzso zzso A serial increase of zzso nuclear zzso to zzso from zzso diseases was zzso In tumor zzso zzso nuclear zzso correlated with the zzso of each type of zzso disease and also correlated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso nuclear zzso in zzso zzso with zzso was similar to that in primary sites and higher than that in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso decreased the zzso of breast cancer zzso In IDC, zzso nuclear zzso correlated with the expression of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso nuclear zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso mediates progression from a zzso zzso to an invasive zzso and zzso nuclear zzso may be useful as a zzso marker for evaluating the ability of zzso
