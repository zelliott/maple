zzso cells zzso are cells of the zzso system specialized in capturing zzso and initiating T zzso immune zzso We show here that human DC generated in zzso by zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells in zzso zzso colony stimulating factor plus tumor necrosis zzso express the zzso zzso zzso zzso and undergo zzso upon triggering of zzso by zzso However, only a proportion of the cells die in response to zzso zzso an observation that may be related to the virtual absence of the zzso protein in about half of the zzso zzso of DC zzso by culture on zzso zzso cells zzso the expression of zzso and, zzso renders DC virtually resistant to zzso zzso Parallel experiments with mature, zzso zzso cells zzso isolated from zzso revealed that zzso express zzso but do not enter into zzso following zzso zzso a finding that may be explained by their high levels of zzso Thus, upon encountering zzso T cells, DC become resistant to zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso and possibly by mechanisms associated to the zzso of zzso protein zzso
