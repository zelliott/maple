zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso protein with a molecular mass of 114 zzso that zzso the transfer of zzso units from zzso to nuclear proteins that are located within zzso We report here the identification of a novel property of zzso as a zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso bound directly to zzso X receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso The interacting surface is located in the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso shift zzso demonstrated that zzso bound to zzso zzso on the response zzso zzso of zzso zzso selectively blocked nuclear zzso function in transient zzso experiments, while zzso zzso zzso did not show significant zzso suggesting that the essential role of zzso zzso activity is in gene regulation by nuclear zzso Furthermore, zzso fused to the zzso DNA binding domain suppressed the zzso activity of the promoter harboring the zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso has zzso zzso activity when recruited to the zzso These results indicates that zzso is a negative zzso in gene transcription, regulating a member of the nuclear zzso zzso
