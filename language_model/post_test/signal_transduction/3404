Environmental and zzso microbes that live zzso on and around us have an enormous impact on human zzso Recent progress in studies of zzso interplay as well as zzso interactions suggests that zzso microbial products, including zzso sensing signals zzso are important zzso of these zzso and zzso zzso Reports have assigned zzso diverse and sometimes seemingly contradictory effects on zzso cell physiology ranging from either zzso of the immune response or exerting zzso activities to inducing cellular stress pathways and ultimately zzso Thus, it is still unclear whether microbes zzso zzso to establish and maintain infections via zzso of host signaling pathways or if the zzso host uses the zzso microbial zzso structures as molecular danger zzso to detect and fight zzso Along the same lines exactly how and under what circumstances zzso are detected by host cells remains a mystery, especially considering the distinct chemical properties of the zzso classes with some being small enough to passively diffuse across zzso while others most likely require zzso recognition zzso
