zzso necrosis factor zzso elicits two opposing effects, the induction of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso but only in some cell zzso To understand the mechanism involved in the different zzso we examined both the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling by zzso 

zzso zzso was examined by zzso the zzso of zzso peptides and by zzso to identify the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were used to reverse the zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso was analyzed by flow zzso Nuclear factor zzso zzso was zzso by the binding of zzso to zzso containing the consensus binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso underwent zzso on treatment with zzso and zzso but zzso and zzso were zzso zzso 2, 3, and zzso but not zzso 1, 4, and 5, were activated in sensitive cells, and none were activated in resistant zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso was the same in all four of the cell zzso In the sensitive cells, zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly elevated by zzso However, in the resistant cells, the production of zzso and zzso were specifically impaired in response to zzso 

Our results indicate that both zzso and zzso pathways are impaired in zzso cells that are resistant to treatment with zzso and zzso
