Networks are useful for describing systems of interacting objects, where the zzso represent the objects and the edges represent the interactions between zzso The applications include chemical and zzso systems, food zzso as well as social zzso Lately, it was found that many of these networks display some common zzso features, such as high zzso small average path length zzso zzso and a zzso degree distribution zzso zzso The zzso features of a network are commonly related to the network's zzso However, the zzso alone does not account for the nature of the interactions in the network and their zzso Here, we present a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of zzso in the zzso These correlations depend both on the zzso and on the functionality of the zzso A network with high connectivity displays strong correlations between its interacting zzso and thus features zzso zzso We zzso the correlations between all pairs of zzso in the network, and express them as zzso elements in the correlation zzso From this information, one can plot the correlation function for the network and to extract the correlation zzso The connectivity of a network is then defined as the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the zzso Using this method, we distinguish between a zzso small world and a functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long-range correlations and high zzso Clearly, networks that share the same zzso may have different zzso based on the nature and strength of their zzso The method is demonstrated on zzso networks, but can be readily generalized to other types of zzso
