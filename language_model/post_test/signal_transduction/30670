The zzso B zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso protects against zzso induced by chronic zzso injury zzso The mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, but must involve persistent changes in pain zzso and/or inflammatory zzso We performed a gene expression study in two brain areas zzso and zzso after surgical induction of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso control zzso The patterns of gene expression differences suggest that the immune system is activated in higher brain structures following zzso in the zzso zzso The strongest differences include genes related to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice this zzso pattern was zzso In addition, we found significant zzso of the zzso zzso 4 zzso in the zzso structures of the mice with deleted zzso compared to zzso control zzso This zzso is most likely induced by the deletion of zzso We suggest that there is a functional zzso in the zzso zzso which zzso the development of zzso pain in zzso zzso zzso Indeed, real time zzso analysis detected a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression in the zzso region of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profiling indicates that elements of the immune response are not activated in zzso zzso mice following zzso Our findings suggest that there may be a role for zzso in the regulation of innate zzso
