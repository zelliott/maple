Pulmonary artery hypertension zzso a progressive, lethal condition that results in zzso changes in the pulmonary zzso tree, eventually leads to right heart zzso Work identifying zzso in the Type II Bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in families with zzso has implicated zzso in the zzso of zzso However, the zzso downstream of zzso in zzso remain unclear since zzso signals via zzso and independent zzso We investigated zzso function, a divergent zzso regulated zzso downstream of zzso using gene targeting in zzso We show that zzso loss of function in adults resulted in characteristic changes in zzso pulmonary arteries including zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso that is observed in patients with zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso had zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso A subset of zzso zzso had pulmonary zzso uncovering a function for zzso in normal growth zzso These findings zzso zzso in both pulmonary hypertension and lung zzso and support zzso as a candidate gene for zzso in zzso
