To zzso tumor cells must adopt different zzso responses to resist zzso forces encountered in circulating blood and invade through basement zzso The zzso and Ras zzso play a critical role in regulating this dynamic zzso Recently, we demonstrated zzso zzso of adherent zzso zzso cells, characterized by formation of dynamic membrane zzso Although membrane zzso has only recently been characterized as a rounded mode of cellular invasion promoted through zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso forces in modulating membrane zzso activity is zzso To further characterize membrane zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso cell zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso and signaling through ROCK and zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso zzso to the cortical ring of the zzso cell under zzso zzso However, under zzso zzso acquires a punctuate distribution and zzso zzso to the leading edge of the zzso zzso We show for the first time that dynamic zzso formation is induced by zzso alone independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso causes a significant reduction in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the leading edge of the zzso zzso measurement of Ras zzso shows that the level of zzso Ras is elevated in sheared zzso cells and that the zzso increase in Ras activity is inhibited by zzso Finally, we show that zzso stress significantly increases zzso cell invasion zzso zzso zzso an effect negated by the presence of zzso Together our findings suggest a novel zzso role for ROCK and Ras in zzso cell zzso
