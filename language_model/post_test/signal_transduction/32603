Like other cellular models, zzso cells in cultures stop growing when they reach zzso even in the presence of growth zzso In this work, we have studied the effect of cellular contact on the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by growth factors in mouse vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by fetal calf serum or zzso growth factor was restrained in zzso cells in comparison with the activity found in sparse zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso D1 was also restrained in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of Ras and zzso two upstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was not impaired when cells attained zzso zzso zzso but not zzso acid, restored zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from zzso zzso cells more effectively zzso a zzso zzso active zzso zzso than zzso from sparse zzso These results, together with the fact that zzso zzso activity was higher in zzso cells, suggest that zzso play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso long-term zzso of zzso zzso by expression of the zzso zzso which activates the zzso zzso cascade at the level of zzso enhanced the expression of zzso and zzso D1 and, more importantly, restored the zzso of zzso cells into the cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso contact is a critical step initiating cell cycle exit in vascular zzso zzso
