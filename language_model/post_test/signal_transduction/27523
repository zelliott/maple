Recent evidence has implicated zzso zzso such as zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso serum levels of zzso are increased after zzso zzso and after zzso zzso Both zzso bypass and zzso zzso injury induce a cascade of events leading to cellular damage and organ zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso a potent zzso zzso is released from both the heart and the kidney in response to zzso and zzso zzso released during zzso bypass zzso zzso zzso deposition, cellular zzso and zzso leading to a reduction in zzso zzso rate zzso The signaling cascade through which zzso zzso zzso zzso production is beginning to be zzso zzso released following zzso activate zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor, zzso leading to subsequent zzso zzso In a positive feedback, zzso fashion, binding of zzso to specific zzso membrane receptors can reactivate zzso This provides a mechanism by which zzso can zzso its own expression as well as facilitate the expression of other genes pivotal to the inflammatory zzso Following its production and release, zzso results in both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso An understanding of these mechanisms may allow the zzso use of zzso therapeutic strategies in the treatment of zzso zzso The purposes of this review are: zzso to evaluate the evidence which indicates that zzso is produced by the heart following zzso zzso zzso to examine the effect of zzso on zzso performance; zzso to outline the mechanisms by which the kidney produces significant zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso injury, zzso to describe the mechanisms of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso to suggest potential zzso strategies designed to reduce zzso zzso following cardiac zzso
