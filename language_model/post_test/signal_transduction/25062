G zzso receptors zzso and cellular signaling elements are prime targets for drug zzso Sensitive real-time methods that expand the zzso capabilities for these elements can play significant roles in basic research and drug zzso Here, we describe novel approaches for the real-time zzso analysis of zzso Using the G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system in concert with a fluorescent zzso we showed the quantitative zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso with a mixture of bovine brain zzso showing an apparent zzso of 100 zzso zzso receptors were also bound to zzso particles and were detected in a flow zzso by the binding of fluorescent zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso by the particles was in excess of zzso with an apparent affinity for the zzso in the zzso zzso The receptors had largely homogeneous zzso zzso an appropriate zzso for the zzso in the low zzso range and a high site number, with several million zzso molecules per zzso However, the G protein zzso was not detected on the zzso apparently for zzso zzso These approaches for displaying receptors could prove useful in drug discovery and in the analysis of the molecular zzso in signal zzso
