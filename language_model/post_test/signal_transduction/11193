zzso zzso zzso is a stress protein and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We sought to examine the notion that protein zzso and zzso through zzso and zzso zzso the zzso expression in zzso under hypoxic zzso 

Exposure of zzso rat zzso to zzso markedly induced the zzso zzso as assessed by Northern zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso decreased the activity of zzso zzso To examine the effect of zzso zzso on zzso expression we used the zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso and an zzso zzso zzso treatment or zzso of the zzso zzso transcript markedly induced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso using zzso promoter zzso revealed the involvement of the nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter activity was modulated by zzso under zzso conditions or zzso under zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso of protein zzso and zzso of zzso activity contribute to the zzso zzso gene expression and that the zzso zzso promoter region containing zzso and zzso binding sites is likely to play a role in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso in response to hypoxic zzso
