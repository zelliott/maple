Treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer zzso remain zzso zzso understanding of the underlying molecular drivers of zzso zzso progression and resistance development has provided the fundamental basis for rational targeted drug zzso Key findings in recent years include the identification of zzso gene zzso the dissection of zzso molecular zzso and the discovery that zzso prostate cancer zzso remains zzso driven despite the zzso zzso thus making zzso zzso zzso signaling a continued focus of zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso have also been implicated in disease zzso A multitude of new zzso targeted agents that abrogate zzso zzso inhibit the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso impair tumor zzso facilitate immune zzso and induce zzso are in clinical development and are highly likely to change the current treatment zzso It is clear that the success of these molecular targeted therapies hinges in part on optimal patient selection based on the molecular disease profile and an improved understanding of the zzso basis of acquired zzso This review outlines the current clinical development of molecular targeted treatments in zzso with particular emphasis on agents that are in the later stages of clinical development, and details the challenges and future direction of developing these zzso zzso
