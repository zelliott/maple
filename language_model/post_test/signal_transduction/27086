zzso acid zzso is a zzso zzso produced by certain activated cells and present in zzso zzso stimulates zzso C and zzso zzso zzso in its target cells, apparently by zzso a specific zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso causes transient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells accompanied by growth cone collapse and zzso of zzso The effect of zzso is concentration dependent, being zzso at zzso zzso and zzso blocked by zzso an zzso zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso is indistinguishable from that evoked by zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso yet, zzso and zzso appear to act through distinct zzso zzso shape changes, like those induced by zzso and zzso are driven by contraction of the cortical zzso zzso and not attributable to prior zzso zzso and zzso zzso nor to other classic second zzso zzso Instead, zzso and zzso shape changes are accompanied by a small but significant increase in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso selectively zzso zzso and zzso shape changes as well as zzso zzso These results indicate that, in zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso trigger zzso zzso and cell zzso through a novel, zzso signaling pathway, and they suggest that zzso may play a role in this zzso
