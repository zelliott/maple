Research on zzso growth factor zzso system have shown it to be potent zzso for zzso cells and made it an attractive therapeutic zzso But little strategy has been reported to date on targeting and zzso zzso against zzso This study is based on the capability of zzso zzso zzso to recognize zzso zzso with high efficiency, which is zzso on some zzso zzso We have been zzso that zzso to zzso would mimic the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and inhibit zzso signaling and cell zzso Gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was inserted into zzso carrier for expression in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso inhibited signal zzso zzso by the zzso interaction with zzso Furthermore, it exhibited zzso zzso rate of soft zzso colony formation and also induced zzso These results indicate an zzso potential of the zzso to an zzso of zzso zzso could block the zzso of zzso and downstream signaling zzso and suppress the biological effects zzso by zzso
