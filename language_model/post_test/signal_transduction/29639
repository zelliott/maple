The aim of this study was to determine the role of an a zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso 

In isolated rabbit hearts, PC was performed with two cycles of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was induced by 30 zzso global zzso h zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the tissue and zzso in coronary zzso were determined by zzso PC reduced zzso size from zzso of the left zzso to zzso and this protection was zzso by zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso Both the PC effect and zzso zzso protection were abolished by zzso and by 10 zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso but not by a lower zzso dose (1 zzso of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit protection afforded by zzso PC provoked release of zzso into the coronary zzso which was abolished by 10 zzso zzso but not by 1 zzso of zzso or zzso C, a zzso zzso zzso zzso by PC was not affected by zzso PC induced zzso zzso of 60 and 90 zzso zzso and this zzso was abolished by 10 zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso with zzso limited zzso size to zzso and induced zzso zzso of a 60 zzso zzso 

The results support the hypothesis that an zzso contributes to the triggering of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso responsible for this zzso zzso zzso is likely to be zzso which sheds zzso
