The classic model of zzso zzso proposed that all zzso induce the same active zzso zzso However, research over the last decade has shown that zzso exist in multiple zzso and that zzso can stabilize different active zzso The distinct zzso zzso induced by zzso result in distinct zzso complexes, which produce varying levels of zzso or zzso of subsequent zzso zzso This concept, referred to as zzso zzso or biased zzso has important biological and therapeutic zzso zzso receptors are zzso zzso and regulate a number of important zzso functions, including pain, zzso mood, stress, gastrointestinal transport and zzso A number of in zzso studies have shown biased zzso at the three zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso however, in zzso consequences of this phenomenon have only recently been zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the majority of reported zzso selective zzso effects are observed as differential adaptations to repeated drug zzso In terms of the zzso zzso zzso clear links between zzso zzso events and specific in zzso responses have been recently zzso Drugs for all three receptors are either already used or are being developed for clinical zzso There is clearly a need to better characterize the specific events that occur following zzso stimulation and how these relate to in zzso zzso This understanding could eventually lead to the development of zzso zzso where advantageous drug effects can be selectively targeted over adverse zzso
