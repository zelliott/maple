The anterior zzso contains zzso growth zzso zzso and expresses abundant zzso sites, but the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso has not been zzso zzso therefore, tested the effects of zzso human zzso on zzso function by assessing the zzso responsiveness of the primary rat zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso by zzso similar to the effect zzso by zzso doses of zzso In contrast, a low concentration of zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso while a similar zzso dose was sufficient to produce 50% zzso of zzso zzso zzso Fifty percent competition for zzso binding by zzso and zzso in zzso rat zzso cells demonstrated a zzso lesser affinity of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso compared to zzso therefore, the binding affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso with the concentration of zzso required for 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines derived from zzso cells zzso intact human zzso receptors exhibited enhanced responsiveness to zzso In contrast, cells zzso with a truncated zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso the zzso zzso indicating that functional zzso receptors are required for zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso zzso which selectively exhibits high affinity for the type II zzso but only minimal binding to the zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso However, the analog zzso which exhibits high affinity to the zzso zzso but no binding to the type II zzso appropriately suppressed zzso zzso This unique model of zzso signaling provides evidence for zzso regulation of zzso hormone zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
