zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso death in a variety of cell zzso Recently, we have shown that the survival promoting effect of zzso is zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In breast cancer zzso cells exposed either to the protein synthesis zzso zzso or zzso or to the zzso drug zzso we have found that zzso but not IGF-1, is a powerful zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of zzso and zzso to activate the zzso signaling cascade and to correlate this ability to their survival zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso or zzso up to 7 zzso and the dynamics of zzso of the zzso signaling cascade was zzso Our results show that: 1) The amount of zzso zzso zzso proteins was greater after exposure to zzso compared with zzso 2) Two zzso zzso zzso (a zzso and a zzso were induced after exposure to zzso whereas IGF-1 induced only the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso forms by zzso against the zzso and against the zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso suggests that the zzso form could be the zzso truncated at the zzso zzso above the zzso zzso zzso 3) The zzso zzso forms underwent slow zzso compared with a rapid zzso of the zzso activated zzso 4) The insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso downstream zzso of the zzso signaling by zzso were activated to a higher extent and for a longer time period by zzso compared with zzso Taken together, the sustained zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by zzso may explain its stronger zzso zzso We suggest that this enhanced activity, and the different zzso of the zzso to certain zzso and zzso may indicate a distinct zzso of the zzso zzso
