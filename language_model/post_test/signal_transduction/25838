The objective of current treatment strategies for zzso zzso is zzso Unfortunately, the deleterious migratory and invasive behavior of zzso tumors remains largely zzso The zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 is known to be involved in the development and progression of many different tumor types, including zzso zzso zzso other biological effects, zzso controls cell proliferation and tissue zzso processes common to both wound healing and tumor zzso Here, we report on zzso migratory and invasive potential of five different zzso cell lines after treatment with zzso a pharmacological inhibitor of the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated in all the cell lines tested, and treatment with zzso eliminated the biologically active, zzso form of zzso in a zzso fashion, as determined by Western zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso was paralleled by a decrease in zzso expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso and led to reduced zzso activity, as determined by zzso zzso the migratory behavior of all five zzso cell lines was zzso in zzso zzso zzso invasive capacity in zzso zzso zzso was also hampered by treatment with zzso The zzso activity of the cell lines was also significantly reduced after treatment with zzso The effects zzso by zzso zzso were observed in both zzso and zzso zzso Because pharmacological zzso of the zzso signaling zzso affects not only tumor cell proliferation but also the characteristic features of zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion pertinent to zzso tumor recurrence and high zzso our findings support the idea that zzso is a suitable target in the treatment of brain zzso
