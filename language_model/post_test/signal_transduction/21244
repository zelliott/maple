zzso belongs to a new family of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso structure similar to that of neural cell zzso zzso In order to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was used to screen an expression library according to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Three putative zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors consisting of the zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso Using different zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso and zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso and zzso was examined in zzso and in zzso Competitive zzso of zzso binding and zzso experiments with zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso site for multiple zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an zzso but lower binding affinity for the zzso proteins in zzso In addition, binding of zzso occurred through zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our in zzso data indicate that further direct or indirect binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the human zzso zzso may zzso
