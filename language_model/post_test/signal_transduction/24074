zzso zzso species are frequently encountered in zzso foods of vegetable and protein zzso The role of zzso sensing in the food zzso properties of these bacteria is currently being zzso A set of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso a putative zzso sensor was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed 79 % similarity with zzso from zzso zzso and the putative regulatory protein zzso was 86 % similar to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the presence of at least 39 zzso proteins was affected by the zzso zzso sensing zzso The zzso zzso system was identified as one target gene of the zzso sensing zzso zzso was required for the production of zzso zzso and zzso activities, thus rendering the production of zzso zzso indirectly under the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was controlled by zzso zzso This control appeared to be direct and not zzso via zzso The data presented here demonstrate that zzso zzso activities affect food zzso
