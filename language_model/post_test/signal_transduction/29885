zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso The function of zzso 5, 6, and 7 are not zzso zzso zzso signaling is regulated by protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso inhibited cell proliferation in response to stem cell factor zzso By screening the other members of zzso family, we identified zzso as a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrated that zzso bound directly to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To investigate the function of this interaction, we zzso expressed zzso in cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell line decreased cell proliferation in response to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not impair zzso and zzso zzso by other zzso These results indicate that zzso binds to zzso zzso region, which affects upstream signaling components leading to zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso signaling is regulated by several zzso proteins and suggest a putative function for zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso
