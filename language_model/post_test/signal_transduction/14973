zzso zzso is known to be involved in the progression of zzso in various cell zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel serves as the zzso for zzso zzso zzso in some zzso In the present study, we tested the zzso effects of drugs that can block the zzso zzso channel, on delayed zzso death zzso induced by transient zzso zzso The functional expression of the zzso zzso channel was first examined in zzso zzso in both primary culture and zzso slice zzso by the zzso zzso zzso We then tested the channel's sensitivity to an zzso channel blocker, zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso blocker, zzso By zzso examinations and zzso c release zzso the protective effects of these drugs on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mice subjected to transient zzso were zzso Drugs were administered via the jugular vein prior to zzso treatment and into the zzso cavity after zzso zzso zzso were found to express the zzso zzso channel, which exhibits outward zzso and is sensitive to zzso and zzso Administration of zzso or zzso reduced zzso c release and the number of damaged zzso in the zzso region after transient zzso zzso This fact suggests that the zzso induction mechanism involves the activity of the zzso zzso channel and that this channel may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
