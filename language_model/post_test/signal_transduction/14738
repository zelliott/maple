zzso zzso zzso was reported to activate the innate immunity by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso for the development of cerebral malaria zzso a lethal complication of malaria infection in humans, is zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso infection in mice as a model of zzso we report here that zzso mice are not protected from zzso To exclude the role of other members of the zzso family in zzso recognition, we infected mice deficient for single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or -9 and their adapter proteins zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso mice, which are resistant to zzso all zzso mice were as sensitive to fatal CM development as zzso control mice and developed typical zzso damage with vascular leak and zzso in the brain and zzso together with comparable zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, the present data do not exclude the possibility that zzso molecular motifs may activate the innate immune zzso However, zzso zzso of innate immunity is unlikely to contribute significantly to the zzso response to zzso infection and the development of fatal zzso
