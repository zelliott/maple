zzso transfer of cell surface proteins by zzso is common and could affect T cell zzso Yet, the role of zzso in T cell function is still zzso and it is unknown whether a zzso once captured by T cells, harbors the same biological properties as in donor zzso In this study, we showed that zzso as well as the associated zzso zzso could be detected at high levels on zzso and human T cells after their zzso transfer from zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred during zzso of T cells with zzso zzso upon zzso or zzso T cell zzso Once captured by T cells, zzso were expressed in a zzso compatible with zzso function and zzso upon T cells the ability to bind immune complexes and to provision B cells with this source of zzso However, we were unable to detect downstream signal or zzso function following the stimulation of zzso captured by T cells, and zzso studies suggested the improper integration of zzso in the recipient T cell zzso Thus, our study demonstrates that T cells capture zzso that can efficiently exert zzso activity, which, per se, could have functional consequences in T zzso cell zzso
