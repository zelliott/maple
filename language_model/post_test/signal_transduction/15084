When cells are exposed to hormones that act on cell surface zzso information is processed through the plasma membrane into the cell interior via second zzso generated in the inner leaflet of the plasma zzso Individual zzso steps along this cascade have been characterized from zzso binding to receptors through to zzso of zzso zzso binding proteins and their downstream zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the complexity of zzso and spatial integration of these molecular events requires that they are studied in intact zzso The great expansion of fluorescent techniques and improved imaging technologies such as zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso protein zzso has provided a completely new approach to signal zzso zzso zzso definition of zzso events followed with real-time zzso resolution has become a standard goal, and several new techniques are now breaking the resolution barrier of light zzso
