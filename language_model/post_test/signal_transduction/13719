zzso in the zzso that zzso zzso and zzso hormones regulate the relative production of these two key zzso hormones in response to signals from the zzso These signals are zzso in the frequency of zzso zzso In zzso experiments with a zzso cell line have identified key elements of the processes that decode the signal to regulate zzso of the zzso zzso these zzso The mathematical model described in this paper is based on the results of those experiments and advances quantitative understanding of the zzso zzso The model consists of zzso differential equations for each of six processes that lead to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso of the model exhibit key characteristics found in the experiments, including a preference for zzso hormone synthesis at low pulse zzso and a loss of this characteristic when a zzso is zzso
