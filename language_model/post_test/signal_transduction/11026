To investigate the effects of zzso on zzso function, activity and expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso responsive zzso protein zzso in experimental diabetic zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso male zzso rats were randomly divided into three groups: control zzso diabetic zzso and zzso treatment group zzso Diabetes was induced by zzso injection of zzso (65 zzso zzso (20 zzso was administered daily by zzso from the next day of the induction diabetes for 4 zzso Four weeks later, animals were sacrificed and samples were collected to determine various zzso including protein and zzso in urine zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso nitrogen zzso in zzso zzso and computer zzso analysis system were used to analyze zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in diabetic zzso in diabetic rats were higher than the controls, the same as the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso treatment, expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were markedly decreased compared with diabetic zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso may be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protective effects of zzso in zzso zzso
