The growth factor zzso protein 2 zzso is a zzso expressed and evolutionary zzso adapter protein possessing a plethora of described interaction partners for the regulation of signal zzso In B zzso the zzso scaffolding function controls the assembly and zzso targeting of zzso as well as zzso zzso in response to zzso of the zzso zzso Also, integration of simultaneous signals from zzso zzso that amplify or zzso zzso zzso signal output relies on zzso zzso zzso is an essential signal zzso The key question remains, however, of how zzso specificity can be maintained during signal zzso critically required for the balance between immune cell zzso and tolerance zzso Here, we zzso the molecular network of zzso in B cells and introduce a zzso approach to zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso
