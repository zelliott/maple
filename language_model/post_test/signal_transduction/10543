The means by which airway zzso cells sense a bacterial infection and which zzso zzso pathways are activated upon infection are poorly zzso zzso cells and human primary airway cells zzso were used to investigate the response to infection with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso a capsule zzso zzso zzso increased the surface levels of zzso and caused the release of zzso By contrast, the zzso strain did not elicit these zzso zzso with a functional role for these responses, there was a correlation between zzso levels and the number of adherent zzso on the zzso cell zzso In addition, treatment of zzso with zzso enhanced their ability to kill zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso cells more efficiently than the zzso and when infections with zzso were performed in the presence of zzso D the inflammatory response was zzso These findings suggest that cellular zzso is zzso by bacterial zzso and that zzso prevents the zzso through the zzso of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso the results indicate that bacterial zzso by airway zzso cells could be the triggering signal for the zzso of the innate immune system of the zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso was shown to trigger the nuclear zzso of zzso Evidence is presented showing that zzso activated zzso production through zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso pathways and that zzso cells could use soluble zzso as zzso zzso
