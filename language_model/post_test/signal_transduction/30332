Cell replacement therapy of severe degenerative diseases such as diabetes, zzso zzso and Parkinson's disease through transplantation of zzso cells generated from embryonic stem zzso cells is currently receiving considerable attention for the therapeutic zzso zzso cells harvested from the inner cell mass zzso of the early zzso can zzso indefinitely in zzso while retaining the ability to differentiate into all zzso cells thereby providing an unlimited renewable source of zzso zzso In this context, identifying soluble factors, in particular chemically zzso small zzso and signal zzso involved in specific differentiation processes toward a defined tissue specific cell type are crucial for zzso the generation of zzso cells in zzso for therapeutic zzso However, experimental models are required allowing rapid and zzso parallel screening of chemical libraries to achieve this zzso Recently, the forward chemical genetic screening strategy has been zzso to screen small molecules in cellular systems for a specific desired zzso zzso The current review is focused on the progress of zzso cell research in the context of the chemical zzso to identify small molecules promoting specific differentiation of zzso cells to desired cell zzso Chemical zzso in the context of the cell zzso cell replacement therapy remains a challenge for the near future for several scientific fields including chemistry, molecular biology, medicinal physics and robotic zzso
