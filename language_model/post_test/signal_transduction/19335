zzso organisms arise from the generation of different cell types and the organization of cells into zzso and zzso zzso of zzso display two main zzso the ancestral zzso state and the recent zzso zzso zzso cells are usually stationary and reside in two-dimensional zzso By contrast zzso cells are loosely packed and can move to new positions, thereby providing a vehicle for cell zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso states drive key zzso events in the early zzso zzso including zzso germ layer formation and zzso The cell behaviors and molecular mechanisms promoting transitions between these two states in the early mouse zzso are discussed in this zzso
