In response to DNA damage, the zzso zzso surveillance system activates a checkpoint zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso checkpoint protein zzso is essential for DNA zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso mediates zzso zzso is zzso Here, we show that zzso recruits zzso to zzso breaks zzso through a direct physical zzso A pair of zzso zzso motifs in zzso which are consensus zzso sites of upstream zzso zzso is required for zzso recruitment and zzso zzso both of these motifs renders zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together can rescue the zzso zzso suggesting that the main function of these zzso sites is promoting interactions between zzso and zzso A zzso zzso containing these zzso motifs is sufficient for zzso binding in zzso when one of the motifs is zzso zzso the same zzso when zzso to zzso by fusing with either zzso protein zzso or zzso scaffolding protein zzso can rescue the checkpoint zzso of zzso The zzso fusion can even bypass the need for zzso zzso complex in checkpoint zzso These results suggest that the main role of zzso and zzso in DNA damage checkpoint signaling is recruiting zzso to sites of DNA zzso
