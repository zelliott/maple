Muscle cells are surrounded by zzso zzso the components of which play an important role in zzso mechanisms involved in their zzso In mice, loss of collagen zzso a component of basement zzso expressed primarily in skeletal muscles, results in a mild skeletal zzso We have determined the complete zzso collagen zzso primary sequence and zzso its expression and function in zzso During the zzso period, expression of the zzso gene is mainly found in the zzso and its protein product is deposited exclusively in the zzso basement zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes defects in zzso differentiation and in fast and slow muscle formation as shown by persistence of zzso zzso marker gene zzso disorganization of the zzso basement membrane and zzso and a zzso zzso In addition, the number of zzso zzso muscle fibers was substantially increased, suggesting that the zzso by zzso derived zzso proteins is enhanced by loss of collagen zzso zzso with this, there is a zzso expansion of zzso expression in the zzso of zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that collagen zzso is required for zzso differentiation and muscle development in the zzso zzso and that it zzso with zzso zzso
