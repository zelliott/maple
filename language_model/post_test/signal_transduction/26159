zzso zzso now regarded as an zzso reserve of zzso oxide zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso In blood, zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction through a reaction modulated by zzso zzso potential and oxygen zzso resulting in zzso NO production around the zzso zzso Although zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso reduction mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso raise questions about how NO generated from this reaction escapes the zzso zzso to signal at distant zzso Here, we characterize the zzso properties of zzso using the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso c zzso 

Using a novel technique to measure respiratory zzso of isolated rat zzso we provide evidence that the reduction of zzso by intact red blood cells zzso and zzso generates zzso which zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso which reduce the zzso zzso potential and stabilize the R state of zzso regulate the ability of this reaction to inhibit zzso Finally, we find that the rate of NO generation increases with the rate of zzso zzso explained by an increase in the proportion of partially zzso zzso zzso which convert zzso to NO more zzso 

These data reveal zzso and zzso mechanisms that control zzso zzso reduction and regulation of zzso function, and support a role for zzso zzso reduction in hypoxic zzso
