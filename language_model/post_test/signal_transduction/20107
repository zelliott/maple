The class II zzso of zzso zzso zzso is localized in zzso the zzso network and zzso zzso however, its functional role is not well zzso Global or zzso zzso of zzso resulted in embryonic zzso caused by defects in zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in a decrease in the number of zzso zzso impaired zzso trafficking, defective delivery of zzso to zzso cell junctions and defective junction zzso zzso zzso also impaired zzso cell zzso including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together, the effects of zzso zzso led to defective zzso cell migration, zzso tube formation and barrier zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso suppressed zzso and tumor zzso and diminished vascular barrier function with a greatly zzso zzso to zzso and a higher zzso of zzso zzso aneurysm formation in response to zzso II zzso Thus, zzso has a crucial role in vascular formation and barrier integrity and represents a new therapeutic target for vascular zzso
