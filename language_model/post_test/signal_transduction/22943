zzso sense and zzso respond to environmental stress via signaling zzso zzso zzso cells respond to cell wall stress by zzso zzso the zzso zzso We report that cell wall stress also zzso a transient zzso distribution of the cell wall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its regulatory zzso zzso possibly as a mechanism to repair general cell wall zzso The zzso of zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso is zzso by the plasma membrane protein zzso the zzso zzso switch, zzso and a zzso defined zzso zzso zzso zzso behaves like a signal zzso or a zzso zzso landmark that both controls and responds to the zzso zzso similar to the zzso signaling between zzso receptors and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso cascade is not required for zzso but rather for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso Thus, activated zzso can mediate both polarized and zzso cell growth via the same zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may function as a zzso rather than as a simple zzso zzso
