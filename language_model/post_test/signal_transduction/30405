A literature has been emerging showing that zzso exhibits functions that transcends its role in zzso zzso stimulates zzso oxide zzso release from human internal zzso artery fragments and from cultured zzso zzso cells by acting on an zzso cell surface zzso zzso down regulates zzso functions, zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso as well as an zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso exerts non zzso roles in zzso These reports also demonstrate that zzso zzso receptors are coupled to zzso NO release and are located on the cell surface, suggesting they first appear very early in zzso All in all, zzso ability to stimulate zzso zzso oxide zzso derived NO is significant since NO is also considered an important zzso agent that diminishes zzso zzso and the vascular zzso capability to adhere zzso as well as down regulating various zzso both before and after zzso zzso These findings promise to open up new areas of investigation concerning zzso associated biomedical phenomena, including cellular protection zzso
