The faithful alignment of zzso zzso during zzso zzso requires the coordination of DNA zzso break zzso repair with large-scale zzso zzso Here we identify the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of this process in zzso zzso In zzso zzso early stages of crossover repair and zzso pairing of zzso are zzso zzso We traced the loss of zzso pairing to the persistent zzso of the zzso protein zzso on zzso zzso zzso is a consensus site for the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso pairing is restored in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not alter zzso zzso or zzso repair, indicating that zzso separates zzso pairing from the other functions of zzso The zzso zzso and persistent activity of zzso during zzso zzso suggest a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pairing in response to zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso dynamics to zzso zzso
