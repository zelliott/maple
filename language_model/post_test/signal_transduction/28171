zzso with zzso zzso is chronic despite a vigorous zzso immune response characterized by gastric zzso type 1 cell expansion and gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso signals by zzso and nuclear zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso however, the effect of zzso zzso infection on zzso signaling is zzso We infected human gastric zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines with type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso strains and then zzso them with zzso Western zzso of zzso protein extracts revealed that infection with live, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso of nuclear protein extracts demonstrated that zzso zzso infection reduced zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso was unable to zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in zzso zzso zzso cells examined by zzso and reverse zzso showed that zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 expression was zzso These effects were independent of the zzso zzso and zzso status of the infecting zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, neither zzso zzso culture zzso nor zzso medium from zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is independent of a soluble zzso or bacterial factor but is dependent on bacterial contact with zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso signaling in zzso cells may represent a mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso immune responses to promote its survival in the human zzso
