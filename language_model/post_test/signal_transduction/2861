zzso animal technology, and the use of zzso manipulation for the creation of targeted gene zzso has resulted in a plethora of zzso models for cancer zzso Our understanding of some of the important issues regarding the mechanisms controlling cell division, differentiation and death has dramatically advanced in recent years through exploitation of these techniques to generate transgenic zzso In particular, the generation of mice with targeted zzso in genes zzso proteins of zzso interest has proved to be a useful way of zzso the function of these gene products in zzso zzso mouse models have provided some insight into the complex zzso events contributing to cellular zzso and the loss of growth control that can lead to zzso These animal studies have highlighted the fact that there are many different stages at which the loss of cell cycle control can occur, as a result of zzso affecting proteins anywhere from the cell surface to the zzso Although zzso affecting growth factors, growth factor zzso signal zzso zzso zzso proteins or nuclear proteins might appear to be very zzso the end result of these changes may be accelerated and unchecked cell growth ultimately leading to zzso It is beyond the scope of this review to mention every animal model that has been developed for cancer research, especially since many of the early studies have been covered extensively in previous zzso This article will instead focus on a small selection of transgenic and knockout animal models which exemplify how proteins from distinct zzso along multiple pathways can contribute to loss of cell cycle control and the zzso of zzso
