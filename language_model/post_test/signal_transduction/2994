zzso zzso known also as zzso zzso zzso inducing activity zzso zzso growth factor zzso or sensory and motor zzso derived factor zzso plays essential roles in several zzso zzso and is required also later in zzso Many zzso of zzso are produced via alternative zzso and usage of distinct zzso All contain an zzso growth factor zzso domain, which alone is sufficient to bind and activate the zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is crucial for zzso and the development of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso an orphan zzso for zzso is the target of the drug zzso zzso used for treatment of zzso breast zzso In the nervous system, zzso controls the early development of zzso of neural crest zzso In particular, zzso acts as an essential zzso signaling zzso expressed on the zzso surface, where it signals to zzso cells throughout development and regulates the thickness of the zzso zzso zzso is required also by other cell types in the nervous system, for instance as an zzso signal released by zzso zzso to induce development of the muscle zzso and it controls aspects of cortical zzso development as well as the formation of zzso zzso Work from several laboratories implicates zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso zzso studies have shown that the precursor proteins of zzso can be released from the membrane through limited zzso In addition, most zzso zzso contain a zzso domain, which is processed by zzso after zzso Thereby the zzso domain is released into the zzso Despite this, the importance of zzso zzso for its functions in zzso remained unclear until zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso 1, zzso was first identified through its function as the rate limiting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major component of zzso plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso More recently it was shown that zzso is a major zzso zzso of zzso during early zzso zzso zzso mice lacking zzso display severe zzso of peripheral nerves similar to that seen in mice lacking zzso signaling in zzso cells, and a zzso zzso of zzso in the process of peripheral zzso was zzso Here we zzso the current knowledge about the role of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso signaling during development and in Alzheimer's zzso
