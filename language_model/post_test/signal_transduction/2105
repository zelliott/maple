zzso zzso factor zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso which zzso a wide range of responses in a variety of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals through the zzso zzso just another zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in primary cultured zzso rat zzso zzso increased protein content and zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso also induced zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso shift zzso for zzso gamma zzso zzso responsive element and zzso element zzso revealed that zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso and formation of zzso factor complexes, which subsequently zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso cardiac zzso and directly stimulates the zzso zzso in zzso
