This study was undertaken to improve understanding of the defective lens zzso changes induced by the transgenic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The study was focused on a single zzso expressed gene zzso zzso a cell zzso interacting signaling zzso zzso 

Total zzso extracted from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso transgenic mice was subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution in the mouse zzso was determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways were explored in lens zzso zzso 

The zzso transgenic mouse zzso revealed a marked zzso of expression of multiple zzso zzso of zzso zzso of one of the zzso zzso was found to be abundant in normal mouse zzso Although zzso was localized predominantly to the focal zzso in lens zzso cells, it was distributed to both the zzso and zzso with some zzso being enriched primarily in the zzso zzso fraction in lens zzso Further, whereas zzso active zzso induced zzso zzso at the leading edges, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso treatment were noted to lead to decreases in zzso protein levels in lens zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso a focal zzso protein in the lens tissue indicates a potential role for this protein in lens fiber cell migration and zzso zzso expression appears to be closely dependent on zzso zzso integrity of zzso zzso zzso
