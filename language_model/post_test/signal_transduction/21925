We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso using chick upper zzso zzso zzso competent avian zzso zzso viral zzso of zzso and zzso zzso type X collagen zzso and zzso zzso expression thereby inducing zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly inhibited zzso levels of zzso and type II collagen zzso zzso further enhanced zzso bone zzso proteins zzso expression of zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso inhibited zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso mimics the effect of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso (AP) zzso levels while it zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis shows that zzso and zzso also zzso zzso protein levels in zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We further investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso in chicken upper zzso zzso together with deletion zzso of the zzso promoter shows that the zzso region spanning the first 128 base pairs of this promoter is responsible for the zzso induction of zzso zzso of the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter resulted in loss of its responsiveness to zzso Additionally, zzso zzso analyses determined the zzso interaction of the zzso binding sites on the zzso zzso Finally, our zzso zzso data demonstrated that the zzso site on type X collagen promoter is required for zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso signaling is regulated by zzso and zzso in chick upper zzso zzso and mediates zzso zzso at least partly through zzso of zzso which in turn may induce zzso zzso
