Plants undergo two different zzso programs depending on whether they are growing in darkness zzso or in the presence of light zzso It has been proposed that the latter is the default zzso followed by many plants after zzso and before the zzso emerges from zzso The transition between the two pathways is tightly zzso The zzso zzso complex is central in the zzso repression of zzso in zzso Besides this control, hormones such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso also have been shown to zzso to different zzso this zzso zzso In the present work, we show that the hormone zzso zzso widely zzso in this zzso Studies from zzso show that both chemical and genetic reductions of zzso zzso levels partially zzso zzso in zzso This is based both on zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and hook and zzso zzso and on molecular zzso such as zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso signaling elements zzso and zzso participate in these zzso Our results also suggest that zzso regulation of this response partially depends on zzso This regulation seems to be zzso across species because lowering zzso zzso levels in pea zzso zzso zzso full zzso in darkness, which is not reverted by zzso zzso Our results, therefore, attribute an important role for zzso in the establishment of zzso growth and in repression of zzso
