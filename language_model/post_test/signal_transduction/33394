zzso of Ras stimulates cell surface membrane zzso and zzso Although seen as coupled events, our study demonstrates that membrane zzso and zzso are regulated by distinct Ras signal zzso zzso Ras controls membrane zzso via the small zzso zzso In zzso cells, expression of the zzso active zzso zzso via a zzso virus zzso resulted in a dramatic stimulation of membrane zzso without affecting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso an activated Ras zzso zzso both membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso but not membrane zzso was abolished by either zzso or zzso with a dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the activated zzso zzso mimics the zzso effect of zzso on zzso but not membrane zzso Our data indicate that zzso separately activates zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso
