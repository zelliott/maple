The activity of zzso that zzso the degradation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso increases after diseases caused by different infectious zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso has an important zzso function in zzso zzso However, the zzso role of zzso following acute viral infection is not fully zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso zzso during acute viral zzso mice were infected with zzso virus, which zzso acute zzso We used zzso zzso mice and mice treated with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso to study the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso virus infection, the serum levels of zzso increased, whereas those of zzso zzso and zzso activity increased in the zzso and zzso The survival rate of zzso or zzso mice was significantly greater than that of zzso zzso Indeed, the viral load was suppressed in the zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, the levels of type I zzso in zzso mice and zzso bone zzso zzso mice were significantly higher than those in zzso mice, and treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso eliminated the effects of zzso on the improved survival zzso These results suggest that zzso has an important role in acute viral zzso Specifically, zzso increases the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which suppress type I zzso production and enhance viral zzso We concluded that zzso of the zzso zzso ameliorates acute viral zzso
