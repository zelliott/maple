zzso cells zzso represent the zzso contingent of zzso cells zzso Their development critically depends on transforming growth factor zzso zzso as demonstrated by analysis of zzso mice, which lack zzso Here we used a zzso culture system and zzso profiling by DNA zzso to search for zzso target genes in zzso The study identified zzso regulatory factor 8 zzso as a novel target gene of zzso signaling in zzso zzso effectively induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso expression of zzso zzso and by zzso inhibitor abolished zzso induced zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso induction of zzso occurred in the absence of protein zzso suggesting a direct action of zzso signaling on zzso gene zzso zzso also induced expression of the zzso zzso zzso and enhanced DC migration towards zzso zzso zzso DC of zzso mice show reduced zzso expression and migratory activity, thereby implicating the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso Thus, this study identified a novel zzso signaling zzso with an impact on DC zzso and zzso
