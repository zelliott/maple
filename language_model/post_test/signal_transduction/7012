zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that, in various zzso zzso spread from their site of synthesis to form a zzso and activate zzso expression at a zzso However, the requirement for zzso to spread has never been directly zzso Here we used zzso engineering to replace the zzso wingless zzso which encodes the main zzso zzso with one that expresses a zzso form of the zzso Surprisingly, the resulting flies were viable and produced normally patterned zzso of nearly the right size, albeit with a zzso We show that, in the prospective wing, prolonged wingless zzso followed by memory of earlier zzso allows persistent expression of relevant target zzso We suggest therefore that the spread of zzso is zzso for patterning and growth even though it probably contributes to increasing cell zzso
