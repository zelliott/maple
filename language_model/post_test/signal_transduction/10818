zzso and zzso constitute a novel family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recently described by zzso Whereas zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells and in zzso in zzso zzso is absent from the zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso distribution of zzso in primary human zzso Using flow zzso expression of zzso was demonstrated on the surface of zzso zzso zzso By zzso and zzso zzso we established that zzso is zzso localized in early zzso zzso zzso zzso and in recycling zzso identified by zzso zzso Association of zzso was infrequently seen with zzso zzso zzso late zzso and with zzso zzso but not in zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso was also found in the zzso network zzso but not in zzso stack zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso revealed that the zzso tail of zzso but not zzso binds to recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso long, zzso traffic between zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not bind to zzso short, which lacks a part of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acid motifs resulted in decreased binding of zzso with zzso A small portion of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso A resulted in zzso of zzso in the zzso Our results suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso sorting processes at the interface of the zzso and zzso zzso similarly to other zzso zzso zzso may thus function in zzso and zzso processes of human zzso
