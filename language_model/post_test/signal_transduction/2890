A detailed analysis of structural and functional aspects of zzso zzso as well as discovery of novel zzso that exert their effects on members of this class of zzso will be facilitated by development of a zzso zzso To that end, zzso strains that functionally express the rat zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso were zzso zzso binding sites for zzso zzso comparable to those in native zzso were detected in zzso membrane extracts at levels equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of strains modified by deletion of genes zzso components of the zzso response zzso was detected through induction of a zzso zzso reporter zzso enabling cells to grow on medium lacking zzso zzso growth responses to zzso and related zzso zzso zzso that were zzso to the affinity of the zzso for zzso were zzso The growth response required zzso G alpha zzso and an intact signal zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso was affected by zzso levels of the G alpha zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso which zzso zzso to zzso was found to significantly enhance the growth response to zzso In zzso delta cells, zzso functionally zzso with both a zzso zzso G alpha protein and the zzso G alpha zzso zzso to promote zzso These zzso strains should serve as a useful in zzso zzso system for examination of molecular interactions of the zzso receptors and G zzso
