The zzso zzso zzso joins the menagerie of behavioral model systems next to the fruit fly zzso zzso the marine snail zzso zzso and the zzso In contrast to zzso which contains 20,000 zzso having cell bodies of hundreds of zzso in diameter, zzso zzso harbors only zzso tiny zzso from which the cell lineage is completely zzso as is the case for all the other zzso zzso As such, this nervous system appears at first sight zzso with those of higher organisms, although zzso comparison of predicted zzso zzso genes with their counterparts in zzso revealed many zzso Together with its short lifespan and ease of zzso suitability for zzso genetic screenings and zzso zzso interference approaches, access to an advanced genetic zzso and zzso techniques, it seems that this tiny transparent zzso of only zzso in length has nothing to zzso Recently, highly exciting developments have occurred within the field of zzso signaling in zzso zzso not only because of the availability of a zzso zzso since 1998, but especially because of state of the art post zzso technologies, that allow for molecular characterization of the signaling zzso Here, we will focus on zzso zzso zzso and mainly discuss zzso zzso sequence information, zzso and zzso coupled receptors of the three major zzso families in zzso zzso
