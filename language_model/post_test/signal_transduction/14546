We previously reported that zzso delivery of the human tissue zzso zzso gene reduced blood pressure and plasma insulin levels in zzso zzso rats with insulin zzso In the current study, we evaluated the potential of a zzso zzso viral zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso long-term therapy to correct insulin resistance and prevent zzso damage in zzso zzso diabetic zzso Administration of zzso in conjunction with a high-fat diet induced systemic hypertension, diabetes, and zzso damage in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a long-term reduction in blood pressure, and zzso plasma insulin was significantly lower in the zzso group than in the control zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the levels of zzso at zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso B, and zzso protein zzso were significantly decreased in zzso from diabetic zzso These changes were significantly attenuated after zzso zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased urinary zzso zzso improved zzso zzso and increased urinary zzso zzso gene therapy also attenuated diabetic zzso damage as assessed by zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that zzso delivery can efficiently zzso hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetic zzso in zzso diabetic zzso
