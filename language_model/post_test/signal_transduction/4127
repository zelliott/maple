The zzso zzso cells and the zzso basement membrane are important constituents of the zzso barrier in the zzso These are affected in diabetic zzso one of the long-term complications in diabetic zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of advanced zzso end products zzso with the development of long-term complications in zzso The interaction of cells with zzso zzso proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological zzso Recent studies show that zzso interactions zzso by zzso can zzso zzso signals to the cell interior and regulate cell zzso In this paper we demonstrate that interactions of human zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso are altered with defective cell zzso reduced zzso of focal zzso zzso and reduced activity of zzso protein zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso interferes with normal zzso interactions and zzso signaling that can potentially result in differential gene expression contributing to the changes seen in diabetic zzso
