Experimental allergic zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso disease model of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso production or zzso signaling was effective in preventing zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso promoting inflammation in zzso arthritis and tumor induced zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso prevent zzso however, their mechanism of action is not fully zzso In this study, we show that in zzso treatment zzso with 100 mug zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on every other day from day 0 to 30, significantly reduced the zzso and severity of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Further analyses showed that the zzso zzso reduced neural zzso zzso production, T cell proliferation and zzso differentiation ex zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso also decreased zzso T cell responses through blocking zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in T zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with the zzso of zzso signaling through zzso zzso leading to zzso differentiation and suggest their use in the treatment of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso
