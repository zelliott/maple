The zzso zzso system is a network of zzso tubes that arises from the zzso zzso lateral clusters of zzso cells in ten embryonic zzso The cells of each cluster zzso and subsequent formation of the zzso tree occurs by cell migration and fusion of zzso zzso without cell zzso The combined action of the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso pathways are thought to be responsible for the pattern of zzso zzso We ask how these zzso pathways regulate cell migration and we zzso the consequences on cell zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso zzso display defects not only in zzso cell migration but also in zzso cell zzso unveiling a new role for zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso pathways that control zzso cell migration are active in different steps of zzso formation, beginning at zzso We discuss how the consecutive steps of zzso zzso might affect the final branching zzso
