The biological activities of zzso are zzso through a specific, zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that exist primarily on T and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso on zzso T cells in mouse and humans appears to be zzso regulated by zzso and zzso zzso Using an zzso specific for the human zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the regulation of zzso expression and zzso responsiveness of human T and zzso cells was zzso The presence of zzso or zzso in cultures enhanced zzso expression of zzso and zzso T zzso The enhancing effect of zzso and zzso was independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, the clearest effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression on T cells were seen by zzso the zzso induced by the presence of zzso in zzso In contrast to T cells, zzso and zzso had little effect on regulating zzso expression on human zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that there is differential regulation of zzso expression by zzso and zzso on human T and zzso zzso
