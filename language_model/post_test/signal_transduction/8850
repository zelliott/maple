zzso dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key component in compromised neuroendocrine stress response and, among other zzso causes, it may also involve action of zzso zzso In the current study we followed zzso zzso and identified its zzso zzso in zzso and prefrontal brain zzso of zzso male rats subjected to zzso chronic and combined neuroendocrine zzso In both brain structures chronic social isolation caused marked increase in zzso zzso zzso that was zzso zzso at zzso 232 compared to zzso 246 or zzso zzso This increase corresponded with the decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 3 in zzso and with their increased expression in prefrontal brain zzso zzso brain zzso appeared to be more sensitive to chronic stress, since it zzso higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso stress also altered the response of both brain structures to subsequent acute stress according to the studied zzso zzso prolonged social isolation may cause zzso to zzso triggered zzso zzso which at least in part may be zzso by the zzso zzso dependent zzso
