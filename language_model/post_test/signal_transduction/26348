The zzso zzso zzso zzso has served as a standard zzso for aquatic toxicity testing for zzso The model zzso status of zzso zzso rests largely on its remarkable ability to rapidly adapt zzso zzso and zzso to a wide range of environmental challenges, as well as on its zzso reproduction and ease of laboratory zzso As in all zzso organisms, zzso control systems are undoubtedly major contributors to the functional flexibility of zzso Surprisingly, little work has focused on understanding its zzso at any zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been the subject of extensive zzso and zzso sequencing, and it is currently the only zzso with a fully zzso publicly accessible zzso Although the molecular work was initiated for zzso investigations of zzso and zzso the data generated have allowed for investigations into numerous aspects of zzso biology, including its zzso zzso This zzso summarizes our knowledge of zzso zzso zzso obtained from recent zzso and zzso studies, and places these data in context with other zzso zzso and zzso experiments using zzso zzso and its sister species zzso zzso Suggestions as to how the zzso molecular data may be useful for future investigations of zzso zzso signaling are also zzso
