zzso zzso is a zzso involved in a variety of zzso zzso processes including zzso zzso movement and zzso opening in zzso The work presented here tests whether zzso is involved in expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso When zzso zzso was transferred from the dark to very zzso rate white light, there was a substantial increase in the level of transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased levels of these transcripts were also zzso by zzso blue light, and this zzso stimulation was suppressed in three different zzso strains that zzso low levels of zzso The levels of zzso and zzso transcripts also increased following exposure of zzso cells to zzso red light zzso The zzso increase in transcript abundance was not affected by the electron transport inhibitor zzso zzso that the influence of zzso on transcript zzso was not controlled by zzso zzso conditions, and that a zzso zzso may be involved in regulating the levels of transcripts from specific zzso genes in zzso zzso Interestingly, elevated zzso and zzso transcript levels in zzso were significantly reduced in the zzso zzso zzso which raises the possibility of zzso between blue and zzso signaling zzso zzso experiments indicated that the levels of several transcripts for zzso zzso I and II zzso were also modulated by zzso These data suggest that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso changes in transcript zzso zzso synchronization of the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and other components of the zzso apparatus is zzso at least in part, through zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso can also influence levels of certain transcripts associated with zzso function, although its action requires normal levels of zzso
