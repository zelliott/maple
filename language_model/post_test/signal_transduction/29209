zzso of serum zzso zzso are associated with an increased risk for breast zzso zzso signaling through its zzso zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso have been widely used to evaluate the activity of this zzso However, the existing reporters are often not sensitive enough to monitor the effect of zzso in this zzso 

In this study, a new biologically relevant reporter, zzso was generated to study the zzso signaling zzso The sensitivity of zzso to detect zzso was superior to that of several other commonly zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the enhanced function zzso was restricted to the zzso zzso positive zzso human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso further enhanced the effect of zzso on zzso 

These studies demonstrate that zzso is a novel and sensitive reporter for assessing the activity of the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso human breast cancer zzso
