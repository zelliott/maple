Development, zzso and zzso stress each affect the physical architecture and chemical composition of the plant cell wall, making maintenance of zzso integrity an important component of many plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to impair the functional integrity of the cell wall, and the plant's response to this specific stress was characterized in an zzso zzso model zzso zzso caused changes in the expression of genes involved in zzso the response to microbial challenge, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso of a zzso zzso gene correlated with increases in zzso and zzso acid content in zzso cell zzso zzso of pathogen response zzso zzso deposition and zzso formation were dependent on zzso supplied zzso and were suppressed by zzso zzso zzso deposition in the root zzso zone caused by zzso was reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but increased in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso increases in zzso zzso and salicylic acids were dependent on sugar availability and prevented by zzso zzso We show that zzso activates responses commonly attributed to both zzso and microbial zzso zzso and zzso pressure are critical components in maintenance of zzso integrity and the regulation of induced responses, including zzso zzso zzso deposition induced by zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results identify components of the mechanism that mediates the response to impairment of zzso integrity in zzso zzso
