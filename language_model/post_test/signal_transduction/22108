Recently, we demonstrated that the central zzso zzso system, involving the zzso zzso zzso is important for alcohol zzso zzso targets a key zzso circuit involved in natural as well as drug-induced zzso that includes a zzso projection from the zzso zzso area zzso to the nucleus zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether it is possible to suppress zzso effects on this zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by interrupting zzso zzso to the zzso zzso cells, as shown previously for zzso zzso Thus, the effects of pharmacological suppression of zzso zzso A and zzso neurotransmitter systems on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso system were zzso We found in the present study that zzso locomotor stimulation was attenuated by zzso administration of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso administration of an zzso A zzso zzso zzso or by peripheral administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso release in the nucleus zzso Finally the effects of peripheral zzso on locomotor stimulation and zzso zzso release were blocked by zzso administration of a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso within the zzso is required for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Given the clinical knowledge that zzso is associated with addictive zzso (such as compulsive zzso and alcohol use zzso our finding highlights a potential therapeutic strategy involving zzso control of zzso action at the level of the zzso zzso zzso
