We have shown that zzso zzso cell survival depends on the sustained zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and lack of this zzso was associated with death during zzso zzso zzso is activated via the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso pathway, which could be attenuated by zzso We now show that the failure to activate zzso in a sustained manner during severe zzso stress is zzso to the zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso rather than the failure to activate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso was studied in hydrogen zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso cells or in mouse kidney after zzso zzso injury by Western zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by either zzso zzso through its upstream zzso zzso zzso or by a zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso Survival was determined by zzso cell zzso analysis and zzso blue zzso We found that the zzso was zzso on its major zzso site zzso regardless of the zzso zzso On the other hand, both zzso and severe zzso stress - but not moderate stress - increased zzso zzso of zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso lead to increased zzso zzso and survival of zzso cells during severe zzso zzso Our data suggest a role of zzso zzso in the suppression of zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso might represent a new target for improved survival of zzso zzso cells exposed to severe zzso zzso
