It has been suggested that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is implicated in the zzso of zzso such as zzso bipolar zzso and zzso mental zzso The mechanism by which zzso would be involved in the causes and/or consequences of these zzso is still far from zzso Independent evidence has pointed zzso as a key regulator of synaptic efficacy by altering the expression and activity of zzso channels, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and altering zzso zzso In this study, we examined the possible participation of zzso protein in signal transmission dependent on zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso was able to evoke zzso release more efficiently from zzso zzso of zzso than wild type cells zzso zzso of zzso This increase of zzso release induced by zzso was independent on zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a larger increase of zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was observed after zzso stimulus of zzso compared with zzso Clearly distinction between zzso zzso dynamics was also observed in zzso and zzso A larger increase followed by fast zzso of zzso was observed in zzso A plateau with a delayed zzso of zzso was characteristic of zzso zzso zzso Both enhancement of zzso production and zzso release observed in zzso were blocked by zzso (10 zzso Together, our data show that zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso an enhancement of zzso second zzso and zzso release dependent on zzso response, suggesting that zzso signaling is zzso in this cell zzso
