zzso proteins in the zzso family regulate gene expression in target cells by causing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso a protein complex assembled around the scaffold protein zzso targets zzso for destruction, thereby preventing it from zzso inappropriate zzso Loss of zzso or its binding partners zzso and zzso results in zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso We have analyzed the effects of zzso forms of zzso zzso with large internal deletions when expressed at zzso levels in zzso either in the presence or absence of wild type zzso Surprisingly, even deletions that completely remove the binding sites for fly zzso zzso or zzso though they fail to rescue to zzso these zzso forms of zzso cause only mild zzso zzso indicating largely retained zzso zzso Furthermore, two lethal zzso deletion zzso zzso and zzso zzso can complement each other and restore zzso Our findings support a model in which the zzso complex is assembled through cooperative zzso interactions among the binding partners, making the assembly of functional complexes surprisingly zzso
