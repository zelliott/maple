The zzso family of zzso receptors have been implicated in a variety of cellular decisions in different cell zzso Here we investigate the mechanism underlying zzso zzso function in T cells using model cell lines as the experimental zzso zzso expression of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso increases expression of zzso proteins of the zzso of zzso zzso family, the zzso family, and the zzso inhibitor protein zzso and zzso death triggered by multiple stimuli that activate intrinsic or zzso pathways of zzso in human and zzso T cell zzso zzso inhibited the zzso induction of zzso proteins and zzso zzso Using pharmacological zzso and zzso approaches, we describe a functional role for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso function and the expression of zzso and zzso family zzso Using a cell line deficient for the T zzso zzso family zzso the zzso zzso zzso and by zzso approaches we demonstrate that zzso is required for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso function and zzso of zzso We present evidence that zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso but that zzso does not zzso with the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso complex is present in primary T cells that have been activated in zzso and sustained in culture with the zzso zzso
