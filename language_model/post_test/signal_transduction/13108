zzso proteins regulate the cell cycle and prevent zzso by controlling the nuclear and zzso distribution of signaling molecules with which they zzso Although the majority of zzso molecules are present in the zzso we show here that in the absence of bound zzso zzso homes to the zzso We demonstrate that zzso of one important zzso binding zzso the zzso factor zzso at the zzso binding site occurs within the nucleus immediately before zzso zzso to the zzso We show that the zzso region within the zzso zzso of zzso which had been proposed to function as a nuclear export signal zzso instead functions globally in zzso binding and does not directly mediate nuclear zzso zzso nuclear export of zzso requires both intrinsic zzso sequences within zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we present evidence that zzso binding may also prevent zzso nuclear zzso These results indicate that zzso can mediate the zzso of nuclear zzso by several mechanisms that ensure complete zzso of the bound zzso complex in the zzso
