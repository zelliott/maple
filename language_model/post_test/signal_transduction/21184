The infection of cultured zzso cells with human zzso zzso is generally limited to less than zzso of the cells in contrast to zzso infection of zzso where essentially all cells can be zzso It is known that zzso infection influences a number of signal zzso pathways of infected zzso We therefore questioned whether, conversely, the zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells could be influenced by the deliberate zzso of these zzso When zzso cells were treated prior to infection with zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, the number of zzso cells increased two to three zzso On the other hand, zzso of the cells with zzso zzso a specific protein zzso C zzso or with zzso a general protein zzso zzso resulted in a decreased infection level and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso acid, caused a slight increase in zzso whereas zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was without zzso Furthermore, neither zzso and zzso compounds known to activate the zzso zzso zzso nor the calcium zzso zzso were able to influence zzso zzso It is concluded that: zzso the zzso infection level of zzso zzso cells is influenced by the zzso level of protein zzso zzso and zzso stimulation of protein zzso C prior to infection results in an increase of infection by zzso
