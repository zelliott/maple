The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso have opposing effects in zzso despite structural zzso Using zzso expression zzso we analyzed the correlations of zzso expression with signaling networks in human zzso zzso zzso and the associations of zzso expression with tumor zzso and patient zzso Data from two zzso zzso analyses of 139 and 36 zzso and adjacent zzso were used as training and validation zzso zzso and zzso software were used to identify zzso correlated genes and their associated signaling zzso zzso between zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and survival were zzso Both zzso and 2 had strong positive correlations with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inverse correlations with zzso and zzso Genes correlated with both zzso were highly associated with the cell zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso transition signaling zzso Genes uniquely correlated with zzso were more associated with zzso processes than genes uniquely correlated with zzso High zzso expression was associated with the zzso zzso of zzso There was a zzso effect of zzso expression on zzso with patients in the lowest or highest zzso having a worse prognosis than those in the middle zzso zzso have complex effects on zzso signaling and patient zzso There are functionally similar associations with cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also unique associations of zzso and zzso The roles and targeting of the zzso in cancer require further zzso
