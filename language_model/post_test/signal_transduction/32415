A zzso short-term dietary supplementation with highly zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso was studied in mice to determine the effect on zzso cell membrane zzso mass and zzso Mice were fed diets containing either zzso zzso oil zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso plus zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Following a 10-day feeding period, zzso mice were sacrificed and zzso cells isolated and zzso with zzso A zzso zzso at 10 zzso After 0 zzso zzso 5 zzso and 180 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and zzso by zzso zzso zzso was found to be the major zzso zzso component in zzso zzso zzso mice had significantly zzso zzso zzso higher levels of zzso at all stimulation time points relative to zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects zzso zzso zzso of diet, time, and a diet zzso time interaction zzso zzso zzso were noted for various zzso molecular zzso In general, a significantly higher zzso zzso fatty acid zzso content in the zzso and zzso groups, and a significantly higher zzso zzso content in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso and zzso species were present only in zzso and zzso confirming the incorporation of zzso fatty acids into zzso zzso The data indicate that the molecular species composition of zzso zzso zzso is significantly modulated by zzso short-term zzso and zzso zzso In addition, substitution of zzso with zzso results in an increase in zzso zzso These zzso could potentially influence signal zzso pathways regulating zzso zzso
