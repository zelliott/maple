zzso zzso zzso signals that initiate innate immune responses to pathogens must be tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammatory damage to the zzso The zzso protein Mal is specifically involved in signaling via zzso and zzso We demonstrate here that after zzso and zzso stimulation Mal becomes zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and then interacts with zzso which results in Mal zzso and subsequent zzso zzso of zzso regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso leading to amplified inflammatory zzso These data identify a target of zzso that regulates zzso signaling via a mechanism distinct from an zzso zzso zzso The transient zzso of Mal and subsequent zzso degradation is a rapid and selective means of limiting primary innate immune zzso
