In zzso the biological clock zzso zzso is situated in the zzso nucleus zzso a small zzso paired structure just above the zzso zzso zzso rhythms of zzso and hormone release disappear when the zzso is zzso and transplantation of fetal or zzso zzso into an zzso host restores zzso There are several kinds of zzso zzso in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso being most zzso Those peptides and their zzso show zzso zzso and may or may not be affected by light zzso Major zzso zzso from retinal zzso cells as well as other zzso such as those from the lateral zzso nucleus and zzso nucleus are very important for zzso and shift of zzso zzso In this review, we describe zzso and functional interactions between zzso and zzso elements and their zzso We also consider the expression of zzso genes in the zzso after light stimulation during zzso night and their role in the mechanism of signal zzso The zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso which is zzso in the zzso body under the influence of zzso zzso from the zzso is also zzso Finally, zzso and functional characteristics of clock zzso particularly zzso which are considered to promote zzso rhythm, are zzso
