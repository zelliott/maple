zzso zzso zzso mediates effects of the hormone zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso and adult female zzso In the zzso egg chamber formation requires interactions between the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and the germ line nurse zzso zzso Previous work has shown zzso is required in the germ line for egg chamber zzso and here we examine zzso requirements in the zzso at late stages of zzso zzso protein is ubiquitous in the zzso but its activity is zzso zzso by activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain fusion and zzso reporter gene zzso zzso is activated in the zzso by an zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Ras zzso zzso To determine the significance of restricted sites of zzso activity in the zzso we used targeted zzso of the dominant negative zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso expression at stage 10 reduced zzso expression in the nurse cell zzso and resulted in abnormal zzso zzso including zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso tube formation, leading to the formation of zzso eggs with zzso zzso zzso zzso at stage zzso zzso of zzso expressing zzso displayed zzso increases in zzso expression and abnormal zzso junction zzso zzso expression caused thin eggshell zzso that correlated with both reduced levels of zzso gene expression and reduction in zzso gene zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso activity by the Ras signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso signals that regulate zzso differentiation and zzso zzso cell shape zzso
