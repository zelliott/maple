The great majority of zzso zzso have defects in the zzso signaling zzso indicating that this zzso has an important role in zzso zzso in the zzso gene are observed in zzso of the patients with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene frequently occur in a region coding the protein zzso domain harboring the zzso and zzso sites and the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso regulation plays a critical role in tumor zzso In this study, we analyzed expression and zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the tumors and matched normal tissue samples of patients with zzso zzso We did not observe significant differences in the zzso rates between the patients and the control zzso zzso displaying different levels of zzso in the tumor and normal tissue were analyzed for zzso 3 zzso of the zzso zzso In three of 57 patients, a novel G to A substitution was found at zzso zzso This zzso change has not been reported previously in the zzso zzso protein levels and the degree of zzso or zzso zzso in tumor and normal tissue were not associated with the clinical zzso Our results indicate that differences in the expression and zzso of zzso are not very frequent in colon cancer, but zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene may be responsible for a significant proportion of the zzso
