zzso constitute only a small fraction of cellular zzso yet their importance in the regulation of cellular functions can hardly be zzso The rapid zzso response of zzso after stimulation of certain cell surface receptors was the first indication that these lipids could serve as regulatory zzso These early observations opened research areas that ultimately clarified the plasma membrane role of zzso in zzso zzso However, research of the last 10 years has revealed a much broader range of processes dependent on zzso These lipids control zzso biology by regulating zzso trafficking, and they zzso zzso distribution and metabolism more generally via their close relationship with zzso transfer zzso zzso also regulate zzso channels, pumps, and zzso as well as both zzso and zzso zzso The significance of zzso found within the nucleus is still poorly zzso and a whole new research concerns the highly zzso zzso that also appear to control multiple nuclear zzso The expansion of research and interest in zzso naturally created a demand for new approaches to determine where, within the cell, these lipids exert their zzso Imaging of zzso dynamics within live cells has become a standard cell biological zzso These new tools not only helped us zzso zzso within the cell but also taught us how tightly zzso control can be linked with distinct zzso protein zzso The recent progress allows us to understand the underlying causes of certain human diseases and design new strategies for therapeutic zzso
