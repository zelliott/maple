zzso the molecular pathways activated in dying retinal zzso cells may lead to the development of therapies aimed at blocking the cell death zzso As we learn more about zzso cell death, it is becoming clear that several new hurdles must be overcome before preventing this process can be a realistic zzso This review details three zzso about retinal zzso cell death that should be zzso The first zzso centers on a critical step in the cell death zzso involving zzso zzso zzso events after zzso dysfunction, such as the zzso zzso may provide only a transient effect on survival, since the cell has already sustained lethal zzso The second zzso is that blocking one cell death zzso may be ineffective because alternate pathways can become zzso This zzso seems to be particularly relevant in zzso exposed to zzso zzso The third zzso is that although it is possible to block cell death, this does not guarantee that the cell will be able to function zzso zzso it may be important to provide additional treatment to restore normal cell function in conjunction with therapies aimed at preventing their zzso
