zzso cells are crucial regulators of zzso formation, zzso and plasticity zzso zzso In zzso studies have begun to identify zzso zzso factors zzso but zzso signaling events during zzso formation in zzso remain poorly zzso The coordinated development of zzso and zzso compartments at the zzso zzso junction zzso depends on a zzso retrograde zzso the zzso Glass bottom boat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso receptors zzso thinking zzso and either zzso zzso or zzso veins zzso in motor zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso of Mad zzso in motor zzso its zzso into the nucleus with a zzso and zzso of zzso programs controlling zzso zzso growth zzso Here we show that zzso zzso release the zzso zzso Maverick zzso which likely activates the muscle zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso retrograde signaling and synaptic zzso Loss of zzso zzso results in zzso reduced zzso at zzso decreased zzso zzso in muscle, and in turn reduced zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso We propose that by controlling zzso release from muscle, zzso cells fine tune the ability of motor zzso to extend new synaptic zzso in correlation to muscle zzso Our work identifies a novel zzso zzso factor by which zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso
