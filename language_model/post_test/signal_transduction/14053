Renal zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in the progressive stage zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is characterized by zzso proliferation and zzso zzso The identification of the mechanism responsible for this critical stage of zzso and the development of a therapeutic strategy remain a zzso zzso is a pure compound isolated from zzso zzso zzso seeds, which are used as a traditional Chinese medicine, and is zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso Recently, we showed that zzso acts as an zzso agent by reducing nuclear zzso B zzso zzso in and zzso release by activated zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso could prevent the progression of zzso using a progressive zzso zzso model in zzso Our results showed that zzso administration resulted in prevention of zzso improved zzso function, and blocking of zzso progressive zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings were associated with zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso levels and increased zzso nuclear zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso production and zzso zzso zzso in zzso activated zzso and zzso inhibited zzso production and zzso protein levels in zzso activated zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso exerts its zzso effects on the progression of zzso by zzso zzso production and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso Our data also confirm that zzso generation and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso are crucial zzso events involved in the progression of the zzso zzso
