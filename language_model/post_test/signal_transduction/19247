zzso is an important zzso zzso for mature B zzso However, previous studies have shown that zzso is already expressed at the immature B cell stage, and that the zzso protein zzso does not completely complement the B cell defects resulting from the absence of zzso or zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso also functions to aid the differentiation of zzso immature B cells into transitional B cells and to promote their positive zzso We found that zzso is expressed at higher levels on zzso than on zzso immature B cells and that its expression zzso with that of surface zzso and with zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso signaling enhances the generation of transitional zzso B cells in zzso by increasing cell zzso In zzso however, zzso signaling is zzso for the generation of zzso transitional B cells in the bone zzso but it is important for the development of transitional zzso zzso B cells in the zzso Additionally, we show that zzso is essential for the differentiation of zzso into zzso transitional B cells both in zzso and in zzso through a mechanism distinct from that zzso cell survival, but requiring zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso signals cooperate to enable zzso immature B cells to differentiate into transitional B cells and to be positively selected into the zzso B cell zzso
