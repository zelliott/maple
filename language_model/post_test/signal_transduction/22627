Two sorts of proteins bind to, and mediate the zzso and zzso effects of, zzso acid zzso the zzso and zzso nuclear zzso which act as zzso zzso regulators, and the cellular zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso are generally known to be implicated in the zzso degradation, and control of zzso levels of zzso yet previous and recent data have indicated that they could play a role in the control of gene zzso Here we show for the first time that, both in zzso and in zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso in a zzso manner in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso In the nucleus, this protein complex binds the zzso response element of an zzso target gene zzso Moreover, in the presence of zzso that bind both the nuclear receptors and zzso enhancement of zzso by zzso zzso is observed in the presence of zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a novel zzso regulator involved in zzso zzso
