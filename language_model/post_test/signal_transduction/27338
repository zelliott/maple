We have developed a model that simulates possible mechanisms by which zzso zzso signals coding forces could zzso in the spinal zzso and provide an ongoing integrated signal to the zzso pools whose zzso results in the exertion of zzso The model consists of a zzso neural network connected to a zzso model of the zzso The network layers represent zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose an approach to train the network so that, after the synaptic connections between the layers are zzso the performance of the model is consistent with experimental data obtained on different organisms using different experimental zzso the zzso characteristics of human zzso the structure of force fields generated by the stimulation of the zzso spinal zzso and a correlation between motor cortical activity and force exerted by monkey against an zzso zzso The model predicts a specific pattern of connections between zzso populations coding forces and spinal zzso zzso the weight of connection should be correlated with directional preference of interconnected zzso Finally, our simulations demonstrate that the force generated by the sum of neural signals can be nearly equal to the zzso sum of forces generated by each signal zzso in spite of the complex zzso intervening between zzso commands and forces exerted by the arm in response to these zzso
