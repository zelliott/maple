zzso is the main zzso zzso in zzso zzso regulating polarity maintenance via controlling zzso zzso Both deletion and dominant zzso of zzso zzso provoke an zzso zzso zzso and thereby loss of polarized tip extension, resulting in frequent zzso branching in the zzso strain and an zzso growing zzso for zzso In the current study the zzso and zzso consequences of these zzso changes were investigated and compared with the data of the zzso network model for the zzso branching zzso zzso This integrated approach revealed that polar tip growth is most likely orchestrated by the concerted activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium signaling and zzso signaling zzso The zzso signatures and the reconstructed network model for all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imply that these pathways become integrated to bring about different zzso adaptations including changes in zzso zinc and zzso acid metabolism and changes in zzso transport and protein zzso Finally, the fate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso markers in the zzso branching zzso zzso was followed, demonstrating that zzso does not per zzso result in increased protein zzso
