The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are known as key players in the zzso clock system of insects and zzso zzso In this study, we report the discovery and characterization of a widely zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso in zzso Using a zzso approach of zzso and zzso we have zzso isolated, identified and characterized three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso which were designated zzso and zzso display a very strong conservation within the zzso of zzso Many of the zzso expressing cells in zzso zzso play a role in the control of locomotion and the integration of environmental zzso among which zzso Our real-time zzso analysis indicates that both zzso genes are consistently expressed during the day and do not affect each other's zzso The zzso of both zzso genes seems to be regulated by zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso factors zzso to zzso zzso and par domain protein 1 zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that the zzso zzso pathway, which seems to be zzso throughout the zzso evolutionary zzso might be more complex than previously zzso
