zzso of the central nervous system zzso are endowed with zzso receptors belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas a number of zzso receptors mediate fast synaptic responses to the zzso zzso zzso receptors mediate either slow changes of the membrane potential in response to zzso released zzso or the interaction with receptors for other zzso To date seven zzso and seven zzso receptors of human origin have been zzso identified and functionally zzso zzso zzso may occur as zzso or as zzso zzso of more than one zzso zzso zzso do not form zzso zzso and are unique in zzso zzso and necrosis of zzso cells and possibly also of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors appear to be the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these receptors may be at the zzso region zzso or at the nerve terminals zzso zzso zzso receptors appear to be mostly zzso while zzso zzso receptors may be either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since in the zzso the stimulation of a single zzso may activate multiple networks, a zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso circuits as a result of zzso release is also zzso Finally, the zzso degradation of zzso may lead to the local generation of zzso which can zzso via zzso or zzso zzso the zzso zzso
