zzso zzso protein 2, also known as zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso in zzso cells, where it regulates zzso mast cell zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 3 zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and 145 that together are critical for its zzso 

We sought to explore the relative importance of zzso zzso zzso and 145 of zzso during zzso and zzso zzso 

We examined in zzso zzso and zzso functions using cells isolated from zzso mice harboring zzso substitution zzso at zzso 112 and 128 zzso or 145 zzso We also examined the effects of these zzso on in zzso zzso and zzso zzso using models of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso and zzso both zzso with zzso zzso however, zzso had a greater effect than zzso on most in zzso zzso zzso In zzso functional defects were zzso in zzso where mice expressing zzso exhibited greater zzso of zzso passive systemic zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso zzso the zzso zzso completely protected mice against development of zzso inflammation in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso N model of zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso is the most critical zzso supporting zzso function in zzso zzso Future efforts to dissect how zzso mediates zzso signaling in zzso and zzso will increase our understanding of these lineages and provide insights into the treatment of zzso and zzso
