zzso evidence suggests that zzso effects of some dietary zzso may in part be zzso by their ability to influence zzso mechanisms in cancer zzso zzso zzso derived from the plant zzso zzso have long been used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases due to their potent zzso zzso Recent zzso studies have also suggested that this compound has zzso potential against various zzso However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying their zzso effects remain zzso zzso we report that zzso acids zzso DNA zzso status of several tumor zzso genes in zzso cancer zzso zzso We treated zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines with the active principle present in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Using zzso DNA zzso and gene expression zzso zzso we discovered that zzso induced a modest zzso zzso that permitted simultaneous zzso of the corresponding tumor zzso zzso The quantitative zzso zzso and zzso validated the gene zzso and zzso in several putative tumor zzso genes including zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso activity in zzso zzso Taken together, these results lend further support to the growing notion that zzso effect of zzso acids may in part be due to its ability to zzso and reactivate zzso tumor zzso zzso These results suggest that not only zzso acid might be a promising zzso zzso in the zzso and treatment of zzso but also provide a rationale for future investigations on the usefulness of such zzso for zzso therapy in other human zzso
