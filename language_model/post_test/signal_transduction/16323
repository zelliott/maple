Interpreting the molecular interactions in Chinese herbal medicine will help to understand the molecular mechanisms of Traditional Chinese medicines zzso and predict the new pharmacological effects of zzso Yet, we still lack a method which could integrate the concerned pieces of parsed knowledge about zzso 

To solve the problem, a new method named zzso grammar systems was proposed in the present zzso The possibility to study the interactions of zzso at the molecular level using zzso grammar systems was explored using zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso 

A platform was established based on the zzso of zzso grammar zzso The related molecular network of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be extracted zzso The molecular network indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the relatively important targets for the zzso asthma function of zzso Moreover, the zzso asthma function of zzso is also related with suppressing inflammation zzso The results show the feasibility using zzso grammar systems to interpret the molecular mechanism of zzso Although the results obtained depend on the database zzso zzso of existing knowledge in this method provides new insight for interpreting the molecular mechanism of zzso 

zzso grammar systems could aid the interpretation of the molecular interactions in zzso to some zzso Moreover, it might be useful to predict the new pharmacological effects of zzso The method is an in zzso zzso In association with the experimental techniques, this method will play an important role in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso
