During zzso bone zzso protein zzso signaling needs to be finely tuned in a locally restricted zzso Here, we report a zzso mode of zzso response control executed by the membrane protein zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed exclusively in the zzso is essential and sufficient for limiting zzso neural development, which is dependent on zzso zzso In animal cap zzso zzso selectively and zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso enhances the zzso In the cell, zzso selectively forms a complex with type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso the cell surface zzso of functional zzso This functional interaction with zzso depends on the unique tail domain of zzso and, in particular, the zzso zzso zzso the function of which has been zzso Thus, zzso represents a zzso zzso mechanism for dynamic responsiveness to zzso signals via zzso zzso zzso
