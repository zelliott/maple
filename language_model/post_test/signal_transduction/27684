zzso protein complexes zzso function as zzso coat components in different membrane traffic zzso however, there are a number of pathways for which there is still no candidate zzso To find novel coat components related to zzso complexes, we have searched the expressed sequence tag database and have identified, zzso and zzso a new member of each of the four zzso zzso zzso We have shown by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso analysis that these four proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso are components of a novel zzso zzso complex, which we are calling zzso zzso reveals that zzso is localized to approximately zzso discrete dots in the zzso region of the zzso This pattern is disrupted by treating the cells with zzso A, indicating that, like other coat zzso the association of zzso with zzso is regulated by the small zzso zzso zzso electron zzso indicates that zzso is associated with zzso zzso in the region of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the complex specifically interacts with a zzso sorting zzso indicating that, like the other three zzso complexes, zzso is involved in the recognition and sorting of cargo proteins with zzso zzso zzso is of relatively low zzso but it is expressed zzso suggesting that it zzso in a specialized trafficking zzso but one that is required in all cell zzso
