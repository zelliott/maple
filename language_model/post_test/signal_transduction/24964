It is well documented that the release of insulin from isolated zzso zzso zzso over time, despite a continued zzso zzso In the current study we have shown that zzso of insulin release by the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso is also attenuated after its continuous zzso In less than 20 h of maintained stimulus with either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso under zzso conditions, insulin release returned to zzso zzso This was not due to loss of zzso viability or reduction in the zzso pool of insulin zzso as 1 zzso zzso was able to stimulate equivalent insulin release under both zzso Further examination of chronic zzso zzso was examined in cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was not greatly affected by the prevailing zzso conditions, suggesting that the zzso dependence of zzso insulin release occurs zzso to the increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso response curve after zzso was of similar magnitude at all zzso zzso but zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response in zzso cells was shown not to involve induction of zzso zzso IV or zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C or protein zzso A, or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso was found to affect both zzso and zzso insulin release, indicating zzso of zzso steps in the zzso zzso
