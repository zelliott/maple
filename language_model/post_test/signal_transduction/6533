The mechanisms underlying growth factor zzso of zzso are only partially zzso and no studies have been conducted in this area using a gene profiling zzso We used zzso zzso to compare the zzso profiles of cells zzso either with zzso growth factor I zzso or basic zzso growth factor zzso to identify zzso regulated genes that may function in growth factor zzso response to zzso deprivation zzso and most importantly, cell zzso zzso rat cortical cultures were treated with zzso or IGF-1 for 2, 24, or 24 h followed by zzso for 90 zzso and compared with cells that were subject to zzso without growth factor zzso Although the majority of surveyed genes were unchanged in all experimental treatments, 175 genes zzso of the zzso on the zzso were found to be zzso regulated in at least one of the treatment zzso zzso zzso of these 175 genes was used to identify four expression zzso IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso Further analysis using zzso zzso confirmed that we had identified genes that are regulated by single growth factors, as well as several more that are zzso by both IGF-1 and zzso These genes can influence zzso survival by affecting diverse pathways such as growth factor signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA repair and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stability zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso zzso
