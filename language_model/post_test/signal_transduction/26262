zzso acids regulate the reverse cholesterol transport by inducing the zzso binding cassette zzso A1 zzso dependent cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In the present study, we aim to test the effect of all trans zzso acid zzso on zzso expression in human zzso T cells and the involvement of cholesterol in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso dramatically zzso zzso expression in zzso T cells in a time and dose dependent zzso The expression of zzso paralleled with increased zzso cholesterol zzso This induction was dependent on T cell zzso zzso signaling and zzso failed to induce zzso expression in resting T zzso Moreover, zzso and liver X zzso zzso zzso together had synergistic effect on zzso expression as well as cholesterol zzso Increased zzso expression was associated with lower cellular cholesterol zzso zzso treated with either zzso or zzso were less vulnerable to zzso zzso Combination of zzso acid and zzso further inhibited zzso entry and their zzso effects could be reversed by cholesterol zzso 

zzso zzso and protein were determined by real-time zzso and zzso zzso methods in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso rate was measured in cells treated with zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression and cholesterol zzso in zzso T cells and combination of zzso and liver X zzso zzso zzso further enhanced these zzso Increased cholesterol zzso contributed to reduced zzso entry, suggesting that zzso effect of zzso is zzso through zzso
