zzso both the expression levels of zzso and the regulation of its translation is important in understanding specialized cell zzso In this study, we describe both the expression profiles of cells within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso flower and the zzso regulation of these zzso at zzso zzso We express a zzso zzso protein under the promoters of three master regulators of flower zzso By zzso zzso zzso we isolated cell zzso zzso that are probably zzso and zzso those zzso through deep zzso Cell type comparisons identified known zzso transcripts and uncovered many new ones, from which we zzso cell zzso hormone responses, promoter motifs and zzso zzso binding factor candidates, and zzso zzso By comparing translating zzso with zzso overall zzso we found evidence for widespread zzso regulation at both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses identified structural features associated with each zzso Finally, we identified a new class of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso from our profiling lead to new hypotheses in the understanding of flower zzso
