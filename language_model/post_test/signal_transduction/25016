zzso may have a role in zzso presentation in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system zzso such as zzso and zzso In this study, we have assessed whether zzso zzso cultures could stimulate zzso zzso or zzso zzso from zzso transgenic zzso As previously zzso zzso sustained zzso zzso zzso proliferation only in the presence of zzso which promotes expression of both zzso class II and B7 molecules on zzso In addition, we show that zzso also have the capacity to present zzso to zzso zzso zzso and promote their zzso In one system, this zzso zzso proliferation was dependent on zzso zzso of B7 molecules on zzso However, in a second zzso transgenic system, zzso could induce zzso zzso zzso proliferation even in the absence of zzso The possible implications of these findings for the zzso of zzso inflammatory diseases are zzso
