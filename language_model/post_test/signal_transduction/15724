zzso transition of zzso zzso cells, which is characterized by a loss of zzso cell characteristics and a gain of zzso zzso zzso is an essential mechanism that is involved in zzso fibrosis, an important component of the zzso injury that is associated with diabetic zzso Under diabetic conditions, zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso and zzso zzso however, studies on zzso zzso in zzso are zzso In this study, the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in the zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso under high zzso concentration conditions is zzso 

A zzso for small interfering zzso that targets zzso zzso was zzso the cells were then either zzso with zzso zzso or zzso with a chemical inhibitor of zzso and incubated with low zzso plus zzso or high zzso for 48 zzso zzso that were not zzso or zzso and were exposed to low zzso with or without zzso or high zzso for 48 h were considered to be the zzso We found that high zzso induced an increase in zzso And high zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso A significant decline in zzso and zzso expression and a notable increase in zzso and zzso were detected when exposed to low zzso with zzso or high zzso and a significant raise of zzso zzso were detected when exposed to high zzso whereas these changes were reversed when the cells were treated with zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso activity levels and Snail expression were zzso under high zzso conditions but were markedly zzso through zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso may play an important role in the high zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
