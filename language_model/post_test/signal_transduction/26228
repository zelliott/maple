zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene depends on the combination of zzso and zzso zzso factors such as zzso and zzso These factors act on the zzso zzso promoter together with zzso factors that integrate zzso from signaling zzso We now report the identification of an upstream zzso in the zzso locus that is targeted by the same subset of zzso factors, except zzso This zzso located at zzso zzso in the mouse zzso gene is highly dependent on zzso for zzso Whereas zzso requires zzso for action on the promoter, it acts on the zzso zzso as zzso binding to a zzso zzso response element zzso Both zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for zzso In zzso the zzso exhibits preferential activity in zzso cells of the anterior lobe whereas the promoter exhibits preference for intermediate lobe zzso The zzso is zzso among different species with the zzso zzso localized at the center of zzso zzso However, the mouse and human zzso enhancers do not exhibit conservation of hormone responsiveness and may differ in their relative importance for zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene relies on an upstream zzso that zzso the activity of the zzso promoter with zzso as the major regulator of both regulatory zzso
