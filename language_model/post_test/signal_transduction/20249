In zzso protein zzso catalyze the transfer of a zzso from zzso (or zzso to specific zzso acids in protein zzso In plants, protein zzso have been shown to participate in signaling zzso driving responses to environmental stimuli and zzso zzso Plant zzso are zzso zzso that provide the major source of cells that will form zzso throughout zzso However, zzso specialized cells can also zzso and zzso cell division if exposed to appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso that plays a critical role in monitoring the accuracy of zzso segregation in the zzso checkpoint zzso Although zzso functions have been clearly demonstrated in animals and zzso its role in plants is so far zzso Here, using structural and zzso analyses here we show that zzso has highly similar zzso in many plant zzso across distinct lineages zzso zzso in zzso zzso Several structural features zzso zzso site, zzso motif and zzso zzso are clearly zzso in plant zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis also suggest that zzso interact with other cell cycle zzso such as zzso and zzso By using a very specific zzso inhibitor zzso we show that compromised zzso activity zzso the development of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, especially in secondary zzso Moreover, zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso allowing secondary root zzso These observations let us to zzso that zzso might be a downstream regulator of zzso signaling in the formation of secondary zzso Our results indicate that zzso might be a universal component of the zzso Assembly zzso machinery across very distant lineages of zzso
