The activity of zzso receptors at the plasma membrane level was investigated in viable, zzso zzso zzso zzso Electric field zzso were applied directly to the zzso cells without any previous zzso zzso The affinity for zzso and the density of the zzso zzso as judged from the number of zzso binding sites, were not affected by the zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso This decrease in activity is due to an zzso zzso zzso zzso activity could be obtained either by treating the cells by the electric field in a zzso zzso or by spontaneous recovery of the cells after the zzso of the plasma zzso with a delay depending on the zzso The activity of the receptors was not affected by the structural organization of the membrane associated to its zzso
