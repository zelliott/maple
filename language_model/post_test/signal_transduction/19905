zzso zzso inject several zzso proteins zzso into host cells, which zzso immune functions and enables the bacteria to survive within the host zzso zzso whose deletion in zzso zzso results in a dramatic loss of zzso has previously been shown to form a complex with and activate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

In a near zzso approach with zzso zzso being zzso into the zzso cell line zzso via the natural type three zzso system of zzso we verified the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso and detected association with additional zzso and zzso zzso In zzso and infected cells zzso induced sustained zzso of zzso at its zzso sites zzso and zzso even in the absence of zzso from its upstream zzso zzso suggesting zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso using zzso components directly confirmed that zzso shields zzso zzso from zzso activity towards zzso 380 and zzso 

Our study suggests that during zzso infection zzso zzso sustained zzso of zzso by blocking zzso of its zzso zzso zzso This may represent a novel mode of action of a bacterial zzso zzso
