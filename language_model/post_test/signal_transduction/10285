zzso zzso zzso have been found to induce zzso in human colon cancer cells at zzso zzso through consumption of zzso zzso In the present studies the zzso for this zzso action of zzso was evaluated by measuring changes in signal zzso pathways associated with zzso Specifically, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and enhanced activity of zzso have previously been implicated in controlling induction of zzso in zzso cancer zzso Here we show that these pathways are also involved in zzso zzso zzso as changes in zzso activities preceded significant increases in zzso zzso The zzso capacity of zzso cells was significantly increased by 6 h zzso exposure, which led us to measure zzso in signaling events that preceded this time zzso We determined that exposure to zzso zzso suppressed zzso activity zzso by zzso which was associated with a reduction in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity was significantly increased by zzso and was determined to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been identified as a potential point of zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Following zzso zzso treatment activity of zzso was significantly increased by a zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso in part zzso the enhanced zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the signaling events that control induction of zzso by zzso zzso in human colon cancer cells and suggest that zzso warrant further study as potential colon cancer zzso zzso
