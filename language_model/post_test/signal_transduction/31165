This study investigated the effects of various zzso on chronic zzso zzso zzso by affecting transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso 

zzso smooth muscle cells zzso from rat zzso were incubated for 6 or 12 hours with various zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso rat accelerated kidney sclerosis zzso Before zzso the kidney was preserved 1 hour in 0 degrees C to 4 degrees C zzso sodium zzso solution to reinforce the cold zzso zzso The rats were divided into eight groups (each group zzso zzso zzso group A, zzso group B, zzso group C, zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso group D, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group G, zzso 3 zzso zzso d + zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso levels and pathological changes, according to the zzso zzso were observed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso chain reactions were used to end zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso 2, 3, 7 in zzso and in the transplanted zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso gene expression and protein production of zzso zzso and zzso but inhibited expression of zzso both in zzso and in the transplanted zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso gene expression and protein production of zzso zzso 3 while zzso expression of zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso group and the zzso group, as well as the zzso group and the zzso zzso The group treated with zzso + zzso was similar to the zzso and the zzso zzso 

Our study suggested that various zzso affected zzso zzso and zzso signal pathways in rat zzso and kidney zzso zzso and zzso can cause zzso zzso to zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso can prevent the CAN zzso because of zzso of the expression of zzso and zzso with increased zzso zzso
