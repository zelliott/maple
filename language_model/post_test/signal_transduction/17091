The importance of the zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso development makes it a prominent target for zzso Current treatments, however, have limited effectiveness, and hence the definition of new therapeutic targets is zzso The zzso is a member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso of zzso factors that requires zzso proteins for complete zzso Emerging evidence has implicated a small number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as regulators of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso Two recent independent reports have demonstrated that zzso is required for zzso zzso and depletion of the zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso and in zzso Here we show that zzso has an overarching regulatory role in the zzso zzso cascade by controlling expression of the zzso and zzso zzso two critical components for maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso factor zzso in zzso cell lines and directly zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, we reveal that zzso recruitment and zzso of repressive zzso marks within upstream regulatory regions of the zzso gene permits binding of zzso to drive zzso zzso Ultimately, our findings confirm the importance of zzso within the zzso zzso cascade and as a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
