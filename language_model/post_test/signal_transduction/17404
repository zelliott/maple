The zzso drug high-dose intravenous zzso widely used to suppress zzso depends on a specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso to induce zzso 4 zzso and Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 6 zzso signaling for its zzso Here we show that zzso activities of zzso can be attributed to the direct action of this zzso on zzso zzso cells, depending on their expression of the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso However, in their zzso state, these cells express low levels of zzso and would not be expected to result in significant signaling compared with other cell zzso This apparent paradox can be explained by the observation that during zzso triggered by a variety of stimuli (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso specifically on these cells, zzso them for zzso zzso The regulation is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso factor, released to the circulation by bone zzso zzso cells found in several zzso including the zzso and zzso We propose that this regulation is part of a zzso mechanism to limit excessive inflammation and tissue zzso zzso intravenous zzso thus exploits an zzso feedback loop, general to zzso that could be further targeted for therapeutic zzso
