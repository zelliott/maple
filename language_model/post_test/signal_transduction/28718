zzso sensing zzso regulation appears to be a consequence of zzso communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that zzso zzso is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and zzso to the exterior zzso In the second step, the molecules accumulate zzso with growing population zzso In the last step, a zzso concentration of the molecules is zzso or zzso sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory zzso While zzso bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling zzso zzso zzso predominantly use special zzso for specific zzso 

Examples of zzso effects on zzso factor expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso In these bacteria, zzso appears to be crucial for displaying tissue zzso and/or zzso zzso 

The high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special zzso traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel zzso The options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in zzso zzso zzso
