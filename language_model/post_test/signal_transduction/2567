Certain zzso activate pathways involving protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso are most common, whereas zzso zzso is a rare zzso event, accounting for a very small percentage of zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, protein zzso zzso activity is associated with several cell surface receptors and is involved in zzso zzso Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor zzso treatment of cells resistant to zzso zzso resulted in an increase in protein zzso zzso zzso zzso certain zzso cell lines became sensitive to zzso zzso when treated with the zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on the zzso a zzso cell zzso The increase in zzso zzso affected by zzso occurred only when it was present during zzso treatment, and the effect was zzso when the inhibitor was added 30 zzso after the zzso These findings suggest that, in zzso cells, zzso activates a protein zzso zzso that contributes to the cell's resistance to zzso and this resistance mechanism does not function in the zzso cell zzso
