The zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso regulates its own expression and the expression of human genes via its two functional zzso the zzso zzso of zzso are required to regulate its expression via the unfolded protein response zzso and zzso in B cells, and the zzso domain of zzso activates cellular signaling pathways that affect cellular proliferation and zzso An apparent anomaly in the complex regulation of the zzso and zzso by zzso is that the induction of either zzso can lead to cellular death, yet neither zzso B cells nor B cells expressing only zzso zzso Thus, we sought to understand how B cells that express zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso in B cells, the zzso required the zzso and the zzso domain of zzso blocked this zzso The expression of the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso correlated directly with the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and its expression inhibited the zzso induced by the zzso zzso of zzso These findings illustrate how the zzso domain of zzso supports survival of B cells in the presence of the deleterious effects of the complex regulation of this viral zzso
