zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate many fundamental processes in zzso In animals, zzso binding to seven zzso zzso cell surface receptors designated zzso coupled receptors zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso Because the plant zzso complex is zzso active, the exact role of plant zzso proteins in this process is zzso Members of the zzso resistance locus O zzso family represent the zzso zzso plant zzso Although genetic zzso of either zzso or zzso alters zzso to pathogens in zzso zzso it is unknown whether zzso directly couple signaling through zzso Here, we exploited two well-documented zzso of zzso zzso zzso powdery zzso resistance and spontaneous zzso deposition in leaf zzso cells, to assess the relationship of zzso proteins to the zzso zzso Although our data reveal zzso of zzso defense responses by zzso and zzso zzso and a role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso deposition, our findings overall are inconsistent with a role of zzso as a zzso zzso We discovered that zzso lacking the zzso zzso show delayed zzso of a subset of zzso genes following exposure to the zzso molecular pattern zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were found to be zzso to spray zzso with the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso
