zzso zzso zzso is zzso to many zzso agents including zzso The aim of this study was to examine the survival strategy of the zzso cell line zzso after zzso zzso Here we analyzed and compared spontaneous and zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso zzso and Chang Liver zzso cell zzso Compared to Chang Liver cells, zzso cells exhibited a significantly higher degree of zzso and a higher nuclear division index, as determined by the zzso zzso zzso following exposure to zzso zzso cells were also more resistant to zzso zzso compared to Chang Liver zzso We also establish that increased zzso zzso in zzso cells is dependent on the zzso activity of zzso as zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso reversed this zzso Moreover, zzso expression of wild type zzso reduced the frequency of zzso zzso zzso cells, and restored zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results zzso the zzso cellular axis as a major zzso of the zzso resistance of zzso zzso
