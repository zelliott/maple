Survival of plants at low temperature depends on mechanisms for limiting zzso damage and maintaining zzso We mapped the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Columbia to the zzso gene zzso In zzso a single zzso acid exchange at the zzso close to the zzso zzso domain creates a stable zzso protein that fails to protect leaves against chilling zzso The sequence of another zzso gene zzso named zzso zzso 1) is related to that of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso chilling damage and enhances plant growth at moderate zzso and chilling zzso temperatures, suggesting a role for both proteins in growth zzso zzso zzso show induced salicylic acid production and defense gene expression at zzso indicative of zzso zzso analysis of zzso in combination with defense zzso zzso shows that zzso chilling sensitivity requires the zzso and zzso resistance regulators zzso by zzso and zzso but not salicylic zzso By following the timing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes in zzso leaves during chilling, we have established that zzso in zzso complexes and zzso membrane integrity zzso leaf cell death measured by zzso zzso At zzso the zzso zzso appears normal but produces a massive zzso response to virulent zzso zzso zzso tomato infection, although this does not affect bacterial zzso Our results suggest that zzso acts at an intersection between temperature sensing and zzso stress zzso zzso to maintain plant performance over a range of zzso
