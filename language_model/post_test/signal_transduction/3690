zzso zzso factor zzso stimulates proliferation and differentiation of the zzso cells of zzso zzso The binding of zzso to its zzso specifically activates zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso a signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso signal zzso two different forms of the dominant negative zzso were introduced into a mouse zzso cell line that zzso expresses the mouse zzso zzso In response to zzso the parental zzso cells grew for about 4 days, and then they stopped dividing and differentiated into cells with zzso zzso During this period, the expression of the zzso zzso gene was zzso while zzso gene expression was zzso In contrast, in the cells expressing the dominant negative zzso zzso could induce neither growth arrest nor zzso zzso However, the induction of the zzso gene by zzso was not affected by the dominant negative zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is responsible for part of the zzso differentiation of zzso but that another pathway, involving the expression of the zzso zzso that does not zzso the activated zzso is also required to fully differentiate the zzso
