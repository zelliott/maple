Because of the central role of zzso mechanisms in the expression of crucial genes during brown zzso zzso we examined the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mouse brown zzso in primary zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso effect in zzso or zzso zzso with slow zzso and efficiently zzso 6 zzso The increase in zzso zzso coincided with increased expression of an artificial zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso was partly zzso both by the zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (by zzso could stimulate zzso zzso to the same extent as zzso The zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso had, however, no effect, but protein zzso C zzso by zzso was a potent zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by a desensitizing zzso with zzso demonstrating that the zzso was zzso via protein zzso C zzso neither zzso nor zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso was involved in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in brown zzso is zzso not only through the classical zzso zzso but also through a novel zzso zzso zzso pathway, which has not been described previously in any zzso
