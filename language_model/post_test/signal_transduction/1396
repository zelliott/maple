Recent advances in molecular pharmacology of the zzso have lead to a much better understanding of the zzso and especially the zzso of the zzso structures of the organ of zzso zzso of the intimate molecular mechanisms of cellular dysfunction is of considerable use in the development of new therapeutic zzso zzso we zzso the mechanisms of sensory hair cell death after various zzso Based on these molecular mechanisms, we propose novel therapeutic strategies to restore zzso In addition to permanent hearing loss, exposure to noise or zzso drugs also zzso zzso We thus review recent findings obtained from a behavioral model of zzso in zzso In addition to providing evidence for the site and mechanism of generation of zzso induced by zzso these results support the idea that targeting cochlear zzso receptors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating zzso
