zzso systems are widespread in nature and constitute the most common mechanism of zzso signal zzso in zzso Recently, a functionally active zzso system consisting of zzso and zzso genes possibly involved in the expression of a zzso zzso system zzso zzso was identified in the marine Antarctic zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we performed a functional analysis of the zzso system and demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of the expression of zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso genes was induced by zzso with the promoter element located upstream of the zzso gene being active only in the presence of the zzso A zzso promoter responsible for the zzso dependent zzso regulation was identified and functionally zzso The molecular mechanism involves an zzso repeat sequence located upstream the zzso promoter that was shown to bind regulatory proteins only in the presence of zzso The protein factor responsible for the induction of the zzso zzso expression was eventually identified as the zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso is the first zzso factor identified in zzso zzso zzso and one of the few zzso zzso reported so far in cold adapted zzso
