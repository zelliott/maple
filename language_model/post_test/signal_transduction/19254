zzso zzso is a membrane zzso involved in several signaling zzso However, the role of this zzso in the regulation of zzso growth is zzso Here we identify zzso as a gatekeeper of zzso junction zzso zzso We show that zzso levels in zzso are critical in restricting synaptic growth by zzso and zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso This function of zzso is independent of bone zzso protein zzso signaling but is dependent on zzso a zzso expressed zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso results in increased formation of zzso extension spike protein zzso patches that concentrate at sites of zzso zzso Based on pharmacological and genetic studies, zzso patches mark zzso zzso zzso and correlate well with zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso and zzso signaling at zzso zzso controls zzso zzso growth in a zzso at least in part in parallel to synaptic zzso zzso
