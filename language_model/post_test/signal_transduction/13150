zzso zzso receptors zzso act as zzso in the zzso of zzso but their role in motor pattern generation in particular is primarily zzso The zzso signaling mechanisms of the group I zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso role in regulating locomotor pattern generation have been investigated in the spinal zzso of the zzso Application of the group I zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso of the zzso zzso concentration zzso in zzso The zzso were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were abolished by a zzso C blocker and after depletion of internal zzso stores by zzso but did not involve protein zzso C zzso Furthermore, they were dependent on zzso influx, because no zzso zzso were produced by zzso in a zzso solution or after blockade of zzso zzso zzso The zzso is activated by an zzso release of zzso during zzso and a zzso blockade by zzso caused an increase in the burst zzso Thus, our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulates the activity of locomotor networks through zzso zzso
