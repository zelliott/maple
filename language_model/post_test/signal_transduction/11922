To define protein molecular characteristics of tumor cells prior to, and immediately following, zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso therapy that correlate with zzso complete response zzso or non response (no zzso to zzso zzso therapy and zzso 

This zzso phase II study zzso patients with zzso stage II or III invasive breast cancer to zzso zzso or both, 2 weeks prior to and during chemotherapy with zzso for 4 zzso then zzso 80 zzso weekly for 12 courses, then zzso Core needle zzso were collected at baseline and after 2 weeks of zzso therapy prior to zzso Data were correlated with zzso defined as absence of invasive tumor in breast and zzso zzso 

Of 100 enrolled patients, the analysis population included those who had surgery and received zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso by arm are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy specimens were available for 49 patients zzso zzso cells of patients with zzso in the zzso or zzso treatment arms showed zzso zzso zzso zzso and sparse zzso protein network zzso representing different patterns of connections with zzso and zzso proteins compared with no zzso 

In this exploratory study, zzso with zzso zzso therapy and chemotherapy correlated with the levels and zzso status of specific baseline signal zzso proteins in tumor zzso These data may provide candidate zzso to zzso initial treatment and potential combination therapies for future zzso zzso preservation technology introduced here makes this procedure widely zzso
