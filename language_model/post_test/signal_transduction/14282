zzso and zzso zzso proteins regulate a vast variety of cellular zzso Some zzso proteins are present in all cell types, while others are expressed only in certain cells or under certain environmental zzso This highlights the central role of zzso systems in regulation of ubiquitous as well as specific cellular zzso zzso proteins share little zzso acid sequence identity to each other, yet they share similar zzso shapes, which is exemplified by the zzso zzso Central to zzso protein signaling pathways are zzso zzso E1 zzso that activate the zzso of zzso proteins for subsequent zzso to the protein zzso Due to their critical roles in biology, E1 zzso have been recognized as emerging drug targets to treat human zzso In spite of their biological significance, however, methods to discover zzso proteins and to monitor the zzso activity of E1 zzso are zzso Thus, there is a critical need for methods to evaluate the zzso mechanisms of action of E1 zzso zzso Here we describe the development of a zzso zzso probe, zzso that can be used to discover and to detect active zzso zzso and to monitor the zzso activity of E1 zzso inside intact zzso The developed probe can also be used to profile the selectivity of E1 zzso drugs in zzso and inside intact zzso
