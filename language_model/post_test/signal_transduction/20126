zzso zzso of zzso cells has been implicated in various types of zzso zzso of zzso zzso would have therapeutic benefits, leading to the zzso of the progression of zzso In this study, the zzso effects of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso component isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso on the production of zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso markedly reduced the production of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso ), zzso zzso protein zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were also depressed by zzso in a zzso zzso Further studies revealed that zzso blocked zzso zzso and degradation, inhibited the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso these data suggest that zzso suppresses inflammatory responses of zzso and may act as a potential therapeutic agent for various neurodegenerative diseases involving zzso
