Modeling is a means for zzso the results from zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments and for gaining insights into the interaction of the constituents of biological zzso However, sharing such large amounts of frequently zzso and distributed experimental data needs both standard data formats and public zzso zzso and a public storage system are also important for modeling due to the possibility of sharing models irrespective of the used software zzso Furthermore, rapid model development strongly benefits from available software packages that relieve the zzso of recurring tasks like zzso integration of rate equations or zzso zzso In this chapter, the most common standard formats used for model zzso and some of the major public databases in this scientific field are zzso The main features of currently available modeling software are discussed and proposals for the application of such tools are zzso
