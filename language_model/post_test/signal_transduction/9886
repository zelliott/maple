Several zzso receptors such as zzso zzso and zzso attract chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells to specific zzso Here we have investigated whether the zzso axis is involved in the interaction of zzso with their zzso zzso cells from 52 patients expressed surface zzso and zzso and released zzso soluble zzso One third of these were attracted in zzso by soluble zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was involved in induction of zzso zzso zzso B cells zzso zzso upon incubation with zzso and this was paralleled by increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso was involved in zzso zzso of zzso on zzso In proliferation centers from zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso was expressed by zzso cells whereas zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso generated from zzso patient blood zzso surface zzso and zzso but did not zzso soluble zzso Only half of zzso cell zzso were attracted in zzso by zzso In conclusion, the zzso system may contribute to interactions between zzso cells and tumor zzso by increasing zzso attraction of zzso cells to zzso and promoting directly zzso of zzso cells to zzso
