The zzso cascade is involved in various cellular functions, including migration, zzso and smooth muscle zzso We examined the potential role of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso rat zzso contraction on d 21 of pregnancy in a zzso manner, whereas the extent of this zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso increased the level of zzso light chain zzso and this increase was attenuated by zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso one of the major zzso of zzso and this increase was reduced by zzso The expression of zzso protein was shown to increase in the zzso during pregnancy compared with the zzso zzso whereas the expression of zzso protein remained at the same level during zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso was zzso at the zzso level during zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may have an important role in zzso zzso contraction, and that zzso of zzso is involved in the mechanism underlying the increased zzso of the pregnant zzso
