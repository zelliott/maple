zzso from zzso donors are attractive for use in cell zzso zzso the nature of molecular zzso following zzso will be highly significant for zzso donor zzso We studied zzso donor rats for global gene expression with zzso zzso zzso tissue integrity, viability of isolated zzso and zzso and proliferation of transplanted cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso donors, liver tissue was zzso intact for zzso hours with differential expression of 1, 95, or zzso zzso 4, 16, or 34 hours after death, respectively, compared with zzso zzso These zzso expressed genes constituted prominent groupings in zzso pathways of zzso zzso adherence zzso zzso and other discrete zzso We successfully isolated viable zzso from zzso donors, especially up to 4 hours after death, although the zzso yield and viability were inferior to those of zzso from zzso donors zzso zzso zzso Similarly, although zzso from zzso donors zzso and proliferated after transplantation in recipient animals, this was inferior to zzso from zzso donors zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profiling in zzso isolated from zzso donors showed far greater zzso compared with corresponding liver zzso including representation of pathways in focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso and signaling in insulin, zzso zzso zzso or other zzso 

Liver tissue remained intact over prolonged periods after death in zzso donors, but extensive molecular zzso following zzso impaired the viability of isolated zzso from these zzso zzso into molecular changes in zzso from zzso donors offer opportunities for improving donor cell zzso which will advance the utility of zzso donor zzso for cell therapy or other zzso
