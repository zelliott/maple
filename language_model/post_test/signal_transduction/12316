We showed that the zzso zzso growth factor and zzso zzso acid zzso controls key zzso responses of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso ligament zzso zzso and positively zzso their responses to zzso growth factor zzso This study determined which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals through to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 signaling and zzso and to elicit zzso zzso increases in zzso and zzso because many healing responses are zzso 

zzso of zzso protein zzso was determined using Western zzso with an zzso to zzso zzso zzso responses were measured using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to multiple zzso species and zzso zzso zzso were measured by using a zzso fluorescent zzso indicator zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso as confirmed using zzso zzso zzso of zzso calcium seems to be zzso through zzso and zzso with little, if any, contribution from zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that zzso signals through specific zzso zzso to stimulate human oral zzso zzso zzso These data, in conjunction with our previous findings showing that zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso suggest that zzso is a factor of emerging importance to oral wound zzso
