zzso zzso T zzso play a role in pulmonary fibrosis, but the possible mechanism of zzso on lung zzso remains zzso 

To explore the role and possible mechanism of zzso on lung zzso 

A mouse model of pulmonary zzso was established by zzso administration of 5 zzso zzso At 14 days following zzso administration the pulmonary zzso were isolated, cultured and zzso zzso for zzso 1 zzso were zzso into lung zzso which were zzso with zzso The zzso zzso was detected for zzso on the lung zzso 

zzso was increased significantly at 14 days in the zzso pulmonary zzso model, zzso zzso significantly promoted the proliferation of the pulmonary zzso in primary culture and obviously increased the expression of zzso muscle zzso and type I and type III collagen in the zzso We found that zzso rapidly activated the zzso signaling zzso through activated zzso zzso and zzso and all roles of zzso on lung zzso were inhibited under the interference for the expression of zzso in lung zzso 

zzso may directly promote the zzso transformation and collagen synthesis of lung zzso via the zzso signaling pathway, which can be inhibited by the interference for the expression of zzso
