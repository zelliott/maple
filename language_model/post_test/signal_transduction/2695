zzso of zzso zzso is thought to be an essential step in signal zzso mechanisms that mediate cellular zzso In pancreatic zzso cells we demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and zzso a membrane protein zzso zzso zzso activity at zzso at which they bind to the zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in the signal zzso zzso activated by zzso receptors we first studied the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso at the zzso We zzso zzso receptors by zzso from pancreatic zzso that strongly expressed the type 2 zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso as an 87 zzso zzso We demonstrated that a zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso The zzso was identified as a 66 zzso protein zzso to zzso against zzso These zzso zzso zzso receptors either occupied or unoccupied by zzso indicating that zzso is associated with zzso zzso We then expressed zzso in monkey kidney zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which exhibited high affinity for zzso zzso a zzso activity and inhibited cell proliferation in proportion to their affinities for zzso Under the same conditions these zzso have no effect on the growth of cells expressing zzso All these results suggest that a zzso related to zzso is associated with zzso receptors and may be involved in the negative growth signal promoted by zzso
