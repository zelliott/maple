zzso tissue is a major zzso and zzso active organ producing a variety of zzso proteins that may regulate energy metabolism and insulin zzso In several studies, we have already shown that zzso products induce skeletal muscle insulin zzso However, the precise nature of these factors has remained zzso Human zzso were found to zzso various zzso including zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these candidates, zzso alone impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells at doses similar to its zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso were effective at very high zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso receptors in skeletal muscle cells revealed the presence of zzso zzso motif zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso motif zzso zzso The action of zzso on insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells occurs via zzso zzso but does not involve zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso zzso various zzso that may be involved in the negative zzso between zzso tissue and skeletal zzso Human skeletal muscle cells are highly sensitive toward zzso which zzso insulin signaling and zzso zzso at zzso even below that found in the zzso However, other zzso that are released by zzso impair insulin action only at zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a molecular link in the negative zzso between zzso tissue and skeletal muscle assigning a completely novel important role to zzso besides zzso
