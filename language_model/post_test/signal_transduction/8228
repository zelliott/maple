zzso is a zzso zzso sensor zzso which responds to low zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso is initiated by the zzso of zzso from the sensor domain of zzso resulting in protein zzso changes that are transmitted to a zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the zzso sensing zzso we monitored changes in the zzso structure in the zzso to zzso time frame, following the zzso of the zzso using zzso resonance zzso zzso This study presents the zzso resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso as well as upon CO zzso The zzso zzso show that there are three steps in the dynamic structural changes that result from zzso zzso zzso structural dynamics are observed in the earliest zzso On the basis of comparisons of these structural changes, a scheme for the signal zzso of zzso is proposed which supports the zzso loop switch zzso Similar spectral changes were observed both for the sensor domain and for the full-length zzso although structural changes occurred faster with the former than with the zzso This difference in rate suggests that the structural changes occurring in the zzso pocket are coupled to those of the zzso zzso The implications of these results for zzso sensing mechanism are zzso
