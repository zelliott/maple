zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso bind zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso protein zzso 5 and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso families inhibit zzso zzso Our aim was to study expression of zzso family of genes in isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were isolated from normal zzso and small zzso zzso samples and those affected by zzso colitis zzso and Crohn's zzso zzso of the zzso family of genes was studied by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso proliferation was studied using zzso zzso 

Most of the zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Compared to zzso isolated from normal zzso zzso samples, real-time reverse zzso studies zzso additional zzso showed significantly reduced expression of zzso in UC zzso zzso reduction, P zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, expression of zzso zzso and their zzso was generally either absent or very zzso By contrast, all the zzso zzso preparations expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Human zzso zzso expressed a number of zzso zzso their zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cells predominantly expressed zzso zzso Compared to zzso isolated from normal zzso zzso those affected by UC showed significantly reduced expression of zzso Since reduced zzso expression has been associated with zzso low zzso expression of this zzso inhibitor may be implicated in increased risk of cancer in zzso
