The collagen X gene is expressed exclusively by zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms controlling collagen X expression remain largely zzso Here we show that collagen X promoter activity can be induced by serum stimulation of zzso zzso zzso The serum response is zzso by a zzso zzso promoter zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways are required for this effect, whereas zzso and protein zzso A repress promoter zzso These data are the first to demonstrate serum zzso of the collagen X promoter and to identify signal zzso pathways zzso
