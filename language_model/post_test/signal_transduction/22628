The type 1 zzso growth factor zzso zzso activated by its zzso protects several cell types from a variety of zzso zzso The main signaling zzso for zzso protection from zzso has been previously zzso and rests on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and the zzso and zzso of zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso In zzso cells (a zzso zzso cell line devoid of insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso the zzso activates alternative pathways for protection from zzso induced by withdrawal of zzso One of these pathways leads to the zzso of zzso protein zzso while a third zzso results in the zzso zzso of zzso and depends on the integrity of a group of zzso in the C zzso of the zzso that are known to interact with zzso zzso All three zzso however, result in BAD zzso The presence of multiple zzso pathways may explain the remarkable efficacy of the zzso in protecting cells from zzso
