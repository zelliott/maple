Spinal muscular zzso zzso is characterized by zzso lower motor zzso and an increased zzso of zzso bone zzso Survival motor zzso zzso levels are significantly reduced due to zzso in the zzso zzso gene in these zzso We zzso the zzso zzso mouse model of zzso to determine the functional role for zzso in bone zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bones from zzso mice revealed an zzso bone zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a thin porous zzso of cortical bone and thin zzso at the zzso end of the growth plate in the zzso of zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed the presence of abundant activated zzso on the sparse zzso and on the zzso surface of the thin zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso from zzso mice showed an increased number of zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso levels were zzso consistent with increased bone zzso in these zzso zzso mice showed a significant decrease in the levels of zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, there were no change in the levels of alkaline zzso expression compared to zzso zzso zzso mouse bone zzso cultures revealed an increased rate of zzso formation zzso and bone zzso capacity zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso mice showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso molecules critical for zzso zzso Our results zzso zzso function in bone zzso and skeletal zzso in zzso zzso basic mechanisms of zzso action in bone zzso may uncover new therapeutic targets for preventing bone zzso risk in zzso
