A chicken gene zzso to human zzso zzso zzso has been characterized and found to be active in zzso signaling in zzso in response to a variety of zzso zzso and zzso blood zzso However, the zzso zzso of chicken zzso zzso - the putative chicken zzso - has been reported by us and others to be zzso at the DNA, zzso protein and activity zzso These reports have raised questions as to zzso zzso Here we analyzed the effects of a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso in zzso We showed that the zzso zzso efficiently and specifically blocks zzso signaling through the zzso in zzso The effect of the zzso zzso was then studied in zzso by daily administration of 10 zzso zzso for 10 consecutive days to white zzso female chickens zzso zzso at the age of 2 zzso zzso the efficient zzso of the zzso in zzso no effect was observed on body mass, feed zzso feed efficiency or fat zzso in the treated zzso Because similar treatment in zzso leads to a highly pronounced increase in appetite and body mass that are observed from the first day of treatment, it is concluded that the zzso is not implicated in the control of appetite or zzso zzso in zzso
