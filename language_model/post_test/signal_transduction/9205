Despite wide margins and high dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is less responsive to radiation and is zzso zzso We previously found that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a molecular target for zzso cancer through the vascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso receptors are downstream from zzso and highly expressed in zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we studied zzso and zzso receptors as potential molecular targets for the zzso of tumor zzso in zzso Treatment of Human zzso zzso cells zzso and mouse brain zzso cells zzso with 5 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso showed decreased zzso survival, zzso formation, and zzso zzso addition of zzso showed zzso that was zzso in the presence of zzso In zzso experiments using zzso and mouse zzso zzso cells, treatment with zzso reduced zzso zzso in both zzso cell lines and decreased survival and migration of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso to knock down zzso receptors zzso zzso or zzso in zzso we demonstrated that zzso of zzso but neither zzso nor zzso led to increased viability and zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso resulted in complete zzso of zzso formation zzso that zzso and zzso on zzso cells are likely targets of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso tumor models of zzso mice treated with zzso and zzso showed a tumor growth delay of zzso days compared to mice treated with zzso alone indicating that zzso of zzso and zzso receptors may significantly improve zzso zzso response to radiation zzso These findings identify zzso and zzso receptors as molecular targets for the development of zzso for zzso
