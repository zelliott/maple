How cell types of zzso organisms came to be differentiated is still an open zzso Here I offer a model that zzso that the origins of some cell differentiation patterns were originally passive outcomes of environmental zzso As zzso contact with the external environment was diminished, their patterns of gene expression were altered, due to changes in zzso of zzso supplied zzso Later, as zzso growth continued, the relationships of cell layers to each other zzso producing concentration zzso of signaling zzso These zzso zzso both from the external cell layer toward the inside and from internal cell layers to adjacent zzso In this scenario then, differentiation arose initially as a zzso of the changing patterns of gene expression and of the complex zzso and changing zzso of substances passing among zzso zzso selection would operate to stabilize the expression patterns in those cell layers whose zzso provide a fitness advantage to the zzso
