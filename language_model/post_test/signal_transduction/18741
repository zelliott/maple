zzso balance analysis zzso has emerged as an effective means to zzso biological networks in a quantitative zzso Much progress has been made on the extension of zzso to incorporate a zzso biological knowledge, provide more practical descriptions of observed cell zzso and predict the outcome of network zzso zzso is independently advancing as a set of zzso data acquisition tools providing dynamic profiles of zzso in an unbiased zzso These data sets are neither yet sufficiently comprehensive nor accurate enough for generating large-scale kinetic zzso Thus, there is a pressing need to develop quantitative techniques that can make use of the emerging data and embrace the associated zzso This article reviews recent advances in zzso to meet this need and discusses the utility of zzso as a complement to zzso and the expected zzso as a result of combining these two zzso
