zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso form characteristic zzso on infected zzso cells called zzso zzso Each of these two pathogens zzso its own zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the plasma zzso of host zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the bacterial outer membrane protein zzso is required to trigger the assembly of zzso into focused zzso beneath bound zzso Despite similarities between the zzso molecules and the host components that associate with zzso recent work indicates that zzso and zzso zzso are not functionally zzso For zzso zzso binding of zzso a host zzso protein implicated in zzso zzso is both necessary and sufficient to initiate zzso zzso In contrast, for zzso zzso are formed independently of zzso and require zzso of bacterial factors in addition to zzso to trigger zzso zzso
