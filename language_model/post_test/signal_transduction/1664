zzso hormones are associated with risk for zzso zzso zzso To determine the effect of such hormones on the zzso of zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which may be involved in zzso cancer, we investigated the status of zzso zzso and its zzso in immortalized human zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso cell zzso 

Two immortalized zzso cell lines and two zzso cell lines were cultured with zzso sex steroid hormones, and/or zzso alone or with specific zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and proteins in all cells was zzso Cell proliferation and zzso colony formation were zzso zzso activity was investigated in zzso cells zzso with a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso or an empty control zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and protein increased in all cells treated with zzso hormone zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso or zzso but increased only in zzso cells treated with testosterone and zzso For all lines, zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso cell proliferation but completely inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated in zzso zzso Higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso factors were observed in zzso cells than in zzso zzso After zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and inhibited all forms of zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso 432 cells, zzso whereas zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso or both zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso may mediate zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Increased zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso may be associated with zzso zzso
