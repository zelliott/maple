Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by zzso and deposition of zzso peptides in the zzso zzso deposition in cerebral vessels occurs in many zzso patients and results in cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso deposits evoke zzso and zzso inflammation contributing to zzso In this study, we found that exposure of cultured human brain zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso expression of inflammatory genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these genes was confirmed in zzso and zzso brains by zzso zzso of 54 zzso factors indicated that zzso was strongly activated not only in zzso zzso but also in zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso sequence and activated the reporter gene of a zzso zzso carrying zzso site from human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein complex and zzso zzso identified zzso as a component of the activated zzso zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso was activated via zzso zzso suggesting that as a result of zzso zzso zzso was activated and thus zzso zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene activity and zzso expression in cells zzso with zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso signaling zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in zzso and Alzheimer's brain and that this signaling zzso may serve as a therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso
