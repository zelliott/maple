zzso or Ral binding protein zzso was initially cloned as a zzso that was proposed as a link between Ral and Ras zzso This protein is zzso in humans on zzso zzso by a gene with 11 zzso and 9 zzso and is found zzso from zzso to zzso zzso displays zzso zzso activity toward zzso class zzso zzso which is involved in regulation of zzso organization, zzso cell migration and zzso via zzso We have recently shown that zzso is also a zzso zzso of zzso agents and zzso zzso zzso In human cells zzso accounts for more than two third of the transport activity for zzso and drugs as opposed to the zzso including zzso which account for less than one third of this zzso Evidence is mounting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which represents an entirely novel link between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stress defense zzso and transport zzso zzso The expression of zzso is significantly greater in human cancer cells of diverse origin as compared to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso towards a cell surface zzso or depletion of zzso using either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso in zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso to mice bearing zzso zzso mouse melanoma tumors causes rapid and complete zzso of zzso Studies summarized in this review strongly suggest that zzso is a logical target for clinical intervention of not only zzso resistance but also for diseases resulting from zzso zzso
