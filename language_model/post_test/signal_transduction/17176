zzso injury that results in proliferation and zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso is an important contributor to zzso following zzso coronary interventions or plaque zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play a role in vascular repair zzso however, little is known regarding its function or the relative roles of the upstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in triggering zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso signaling through zzso would contribute to zzso vascular repair processes in models of zzso zzso A mouse carotid zzso wire injury model was used for studies of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mice were treated zzso for 21 days with a small zzso inhibitor of zzso or a direct zzso inhibitor and compared with vehicle zzso zzso and zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso after daily treatment with the small zzso zzso zzso an effect that was lost in zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso of zzso showed no benefit in suppressing the development of zzso zzso zzso signaling resulted in a zzso differentiated zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling resulted in the opposite effect and led to a zzso zzso via a different G protein zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso and migration of zzso and resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso These studies provide a new mechanism for the development of vascular zzso zzso and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress zzso by targeting zzso zzso signaling in vascular zzso
