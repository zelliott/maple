zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and growth zzso biological functions in zzso zzso Here, we examined zzso role in zzso zzso wound healing and the influence of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso signaling on zzso 

zzso wounds were created on the zzso of live rabbits by complete zzso and in rabbit zzso zzso primary cultures through scratch zzso zzso expression in cultures was suppressed using zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by pull-down zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression was analyzed by zzso and zzso Association of zzso with zzso proteins was identified by zzso 

In rabbit zzso significant increase in zzso expression that occurred 2 to 4 days after the injury coincided with wound closure, and by 8 days the expression reached near zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in cultures caused zzso of wound closure as a result of zzso to zzso decrease in zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and its zzso on zzso zzso of growth zzso zzso signaling resulted in the zzso of zzso expression and its zzso Increased association of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with plasma membrane leading edges was also observed in the presence of growth zzso 

zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso wound zzso To promote healing, zzso may interact with zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso that participate in cell migration and zzso zzso
