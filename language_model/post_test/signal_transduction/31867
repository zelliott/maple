zzso have been shown to zzso zzso injury zzso in a number of zzso We evaluated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso in both normal and zzso rat zzso 

zzso was administered either zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso before initiating 1 h of zzso followed by 6 h zzso in normal rat zzso zzso injury was assessed zzso using zzso zzso These zzso were repeated using the optimal dose of zzso after administration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso were measured, and expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso Similar procedures were repeated on rats with carbon zzso liver zzso and the levels of zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were also zzso as these proteins have beneficial effects during zzso 

zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and serum zzso levels, and increased zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso expression in normal zzso These changes were reversed by prior administration of zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso was also protective in zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso status was zzso There was, however, increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso and a reduction in zzso 

zzso zzso protects against zzso in both normal and zzso rat zzso This involves zzso zzso zzso and zzso The downstream pathways involved are different for zzso liver, with preliminary evidence suggesting involvement of zzso
