The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces and responds to three zzso zzso zzso and zzso to regulate cell density dependent gene expression by a process referred to as zzso zzso The concentration of the zzso is sensed by three zzso hybrid sensor zzso and information is channeled via the zzso protein zzso to the response regulator zzso Here, a detailed zzso study on the zzso activities of the zzso hybrid sensor zzso zzso the sensor for zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso was zzso zzso as the full-length protein in zzso zzso zzso activities were characterized in zzso and are an zzso activity with an unusually high zzso turnover rate, stable zzso zzso and a slow zzso activity with zzso approximately P as zzso The presence of zzso affected the zzso but not the zzso activity of zzso The influence of zzso on the zzso zzso signaling step was zzso and in the presence of zzso the zzso activity of zzso and hence the amount of zzso approximately P produced, were significantly zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso occurred at 20 zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso directly interacts with zzso to zzso its zzso activity and suggest that the key regulatory step of the zzso zzso sensing system of zzso zzso is zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso
