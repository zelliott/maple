The structures of membrane receptors zzso zzso zzso actions of steroids have not been zzso We describe the cloning of a zzso from spotted zzso zzso zzso a protein that zzso the following seven criteria for its designation as a steroid membrane zzso plausible structure, tissue zzso cellular distribution, steroid zzso signal zzso hormonal regulation, and biological zzso For plausible structure, computer modeling predicts that the protein has seven zzso zzso typical of G zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is only detected in the brain and zzso zzso on Northern zzso zzso only detect the protein (40 zzso in plasma zzso of zzso zzso The zzso protein produced in an zzso coli expression system has a high affinity zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso single binding site specific for zzso zzso alter signal zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso toxin sensitive, suggesting the zzso may be coupled to an zzso G zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso Changes in zzso abundance in response to hormones and at various stages of zzso development, its probable zzso to an zzso G protein and zzso of zzso induction of zzso maturation upon zzso of zzso zzso are consistent with the identity of the zzso as an zzso in zzso zzso These characteristics suggest the fish protein is a membrane zzso zzso zzso a zzso action of zzso to induce zzso maturation in zzso
