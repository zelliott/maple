zzso and their receptors have been involved in both proper brain development and zzso zzso The role that zzso receptors play in immature cortical zzso was initially investigated by gene profiling using zzso DNA zzso Both short (15 zzso and prolonged (18 zzso treatments with nicotine did not induce modification in gene zzso whereas a significant zzso of zzso protein levels was observed after 18 h zzso zzso a brief treatment with the zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso of immediate early genes and zzso factors, which remained unaffected by zzso for 18 h with zzso zzso imaging studies revealed that zzso activated a sustained increase in zzso calcium concentration in the majority of zzso whereas nicotine evoked only a transient calcium increase in a smaller percentage of zzso suggesting that the calcium zzso response was correlated with zzso of gene zzso zzso effects on immature cortical zzso perhaps do not require gene regulation but may be still acting on zzso zzso
