Using zzso zzso technique in zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso zzso zzso regulation was demonstrated by changes in zzso zzso under conditions of altered zzso status that were strictly parallel to that of zzso zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso was further established using zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso which abolished zzso changes in zzso zzso To determine the functional significance of this regulation, zzso was zzso in zzso cells, which induced a specific increase in the synthesis of cholesterol from zzso We also observed that zzso zzso increased the activity and the protein content of zzso zzso the rate limiting zzso in this zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso stability or zzso levels, suggesting a zzso effect of the zzso In the zzso family, zzso uniquely exhibited zzso zzso and also responded to heat zzso Through its responsiveness to zzso and its zzso effect on cholesterol zzso the zzso zzso can be viewed as a new player in cholesterol zzso These data suggest a link between molecular zzso heat stress and cholesterol zzso
