zzso zzso zzso infection is associated with the decreased expression of the gastric zzso zzso protein zzso Because zzso of the gene zzso may be regulated zzso through zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso coupled delta zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso promoter zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso promoter, were measured using zzso zzso The expression of zzso was evaluated by Western zzso and zzso zzso Growth zzso were constructed, and cell proliferation was assessed after zzso zzso Low zzso expression in acutely zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso cells and in chronically zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was associated with approximate zzso and zzso decreases in zzso zzso zzso respectively, when compared to zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso parental zzso The low zzso zzso levels following zzso zzso infection were associated with a zzso reduction in zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso The recruitment of zzso to the zzso promoter was also markedly decreased by zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso infection in cell lines in zzso and in zzso zzso human gastric zzso in zzso The level of cellular zzso zzso correlated with cell proliferation in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso decreases zzso expression by modulating the zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These findings link low gastric zzso expression levels with increased instances of gastric zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso
