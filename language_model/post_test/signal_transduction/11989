zzso an abundant form of zzso are known to promote and zzso synaptic signaling between zzso They also express zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso but the functional relevance of these receptors is zzso We show here that stimulation of zzso on zzso releases components that induce zzso zzso to acquire more zzso acid zzso receptors zzso at zzso zzso The increase is specific in that no change is seen in synaptic zzso zzso clusters or other markers for zzso zzso or in markers for zzso zzso Moreover, the increases in zzso receptors on the zzso surface are accompanied by increases in the frequency of spontaneous miniature synaptic currents zzso by the receptors and increases in the ratio of evoked synaptic currents zzso by zzso versus zzso zzso This suggests that stimulating zzso on zzso can convert zzso zzso zzso to functional zzso zzso zzso is necessary but not sufficient for the effect, while tumor necrosis zzso is sufficient but not zzso The results identify zzso zzso as a novel zzso through which zzso zzso signaling can promote the development of zzso networks, recruiting zzso receptors to zzso sites and rendering the zzso more zzso We find that zzso of zzso receptors on zzso releases a component that specifically recruits zzso receptors to zzso zzso The recruitment appears to occur zzso at what may be zzso zzso that is, zzso that have all the components required for zzso transmission (including zzso zzso but lack sufficient zzso receptors to generate a zzso The results are unexpected and open up new possibilities for mechanisms underlying network formation and synaptic zzso
