zzso zzso zzso is one of the most potent zzso agents against zzso zzso however, the mechanisms remain largely zzso In this study, we assessed the ability of zzso to target zzso zzso zzso in the zzso rat model and the human zzso cancer cell line, zzso zzso rats were zzso to zzso diet alone or supplemented with zzso zzso After 30 weeks, animals were zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were subjected to zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed both early and late markers of zzso colon zzso zzso dimension by zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and tumors by zzso In both zzso rats and zzso cells treated with zzso zzso for 24 hours, zzso decreased proliferation zzso and zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso is the major regulator of zzso D1 in zzso cancer, we used the zzso factor zzso reporter zzso to show that zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter total zzso expression but rather its nuclear zzso leading us to assess zzso expression (a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was increased by zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso cells, zzso We therefore investigated the effect of zzso treatment on levels of the negative regulator of zzso zzso and observed a 50% and zzso decrease, zzso In conclusion, we show, for the first time, a molecular mechanism through which zzso zzso its zzso and hence profound zzso zzso
