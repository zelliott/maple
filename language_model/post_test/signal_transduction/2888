We describe here a novel class of zzso response elements for zzso vitamin D, and zzso receptors which are widely spaced (10 to 200 zzso direct repeats zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recognition motif zzso to zzso In contrast to the specificity previously observed with shortly spaced zzso zzso to zzso the different receptors bind zzso to these novel elements to activate zzso in the presence of zzso acid zzso vitamin D, or zzso The greatest zzso zzso seen with zzso was similar to that observed with the zzso zzso Both zzso receptors and zzso X receptors contribute to zzso through widely spaced DR zzso With the zzso zzso zzso was one-third as efficient as the classical zzso response zzso A further increase of zzso lengths progressively decreased the efficiency of zzso No zzso was seen with widely spaced zzso when the zzso and zzso X receptors were zzso in the presence of their zzso The zzso zzso was also unable to zzso through a zzso element composed of its zzso binding zzso These results considerably extend the response element repertoire of nuclear receptors and suggest the existence of zzso zzso regulation through common response zzso as well as the possibility of zzso zzso
