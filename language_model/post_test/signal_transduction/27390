zzso anterior zzso tissue expresses zzso for zzso and zzso as well as a low level of zzso The zzso appears to be highly expressed in zzso cells, while zzso cells apparently express the zzso We have recently demonstrated the expression of zzso for both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso If normal zzso express the same zzso as zzso cells, this may partly explain the low levels of zzso seen in normal zzso zzso zzso levels of at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso alpha zzso cells and normal rat anterior zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso are reported to have almost identical pharmacological characteristics in terms of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso Further experiments are necessary to determine the functional consequences of differential zzso zzso expression in such zzso Interestingly, all three zzso lines studied expressed zzso for the zzso zzso whereas earlier binding studies demonstrate a predominance of zzso binding sites on normal anterior zzso zzso In addition, it is clear that the different zzso zzso can couple to different zzso zzso zzso Thus it will be important to determine the expression of the different zzso zzso in normal anterior zzso types if we are to begin to understand the regulation of zzso regulation by zzso Such questions form the basis of some of the ongoing studies in our zzso
