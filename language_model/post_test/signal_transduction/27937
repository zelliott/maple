Although the major action of zzso zzso zzso on the airways is relaxation of airway smooth muscle, these drugs have several other effects zzso through zzso zzso receptors expressed on other cell zzso These additional actions of zzso zzso may contribute to the efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso asthma zzso zzso zzso inhibit plasma zzso in the airways by acting on zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso They inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso from airway mast cells and inhibit effects on release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso may have an zzso effect on the release of zzso from sensory zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso release from structural cells in the airways such as zzso cells is zzso Despite all of these zzso effects on inflammatory cells in zzso zzso zzso do not appear to reduce the chronic inflammation of zzso zzso is more readily seen in inflammatory cells than in airway smooth muscle cells and may account for this zzso zzso may increase expression of zzso zzso in inflammatory cells to overcome the zzso in response to chronic zzso zzso zzso
