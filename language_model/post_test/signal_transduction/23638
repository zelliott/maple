Acute stress evokes the zzso zzso which via release of the zzso hormones affects the function of every major zzso Although the zzso is zzso it has lasting consequences that produce an exaggerated response when stress is zzso How this change is zzso is not zzso We investigated whether the zzso affects the adrenal component of the sympathetic nervous system, a major branch of the stress zzso Mice were briefly exposed to the zzso forced swim test zzso which evoked an increase in circulating zzso Although this hormonal response was zzso the zzso led to a long-lasting increase in the zzso zzso capacity measured zzso from zzso cells and in the expression of zzso zzso A variety of approaches indicate that these changes are regulated zzso by zzso Y zzso an adrenal zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, we find that zzso is zzso by all zzso zzso Stress failed to increase zzso capacity in zzso zzso zzso zzso or pharmacological interference with zzso and zzso (but not zzso or zzso zzso signaling attenuated the zzso change in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that, under zzso conditions, adrenal signaling is zzso inhibited by zzso but stress zzso this zzso negative feedback zzso Because acute stress leads to a lasting increase in zzso capacity in zzso but does not alter sympathetic tone, these zzso changes appear to be an zzso zzso We conclude that the sympathetic limb of the stress response exhibits an zzso form of long-lasting zzso
