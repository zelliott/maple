In the past few years, inflammation has emerged as a major driving force of zzso zzso zzso It is now well-established that from early zzso to vulnerable plaque formation, numerous cellular and molecular inflammatory components participate in the disease zzso The most prominent cells that invade in evolving zzso are zzso zzso and zzso Both cell types produce a wide array of soluble inflammatory zzso zzso zzso which are critically important in the initiation and perpetuation of the zzso This review summarizes the currently available information from mouse studies on the contribution of a specified group of zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso zzso zzso colony stimulating factors zzso to zzso zzso is put on the consistency of the effects of these zzso zzso zzso an effect depends on the experimental approach applied zzso strain, zzso dietary conditions, and disease zzso An important outcome of this survey is zzso that only for a few zzso there is sufficient consistent data allowing zzso them as typically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso that some zzso zzso zzso and zzso can exert zzso or zzso effects depending on the experimental zzso This knowledge can be used for improved early zzso prevention and treatment of zzso
