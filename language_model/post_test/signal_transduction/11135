An zzso zzso zzso determines the rate of aging of the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso this zzso can result in a doubling of zzso While such zzso may appear to have little effect on development or zzso evolutionary theory predicts that large increases in lifespan will not be optimal for zzso We demonstrate by laboratory natural selection that partial loss of function of the insulin zzso protein zzso results in dramatically reduced fitness even under laboratory zzso Despite zzso zzso appearing healthy, they exhibit a heavy fitness cost consistent with an evolutionary theory of zzso
