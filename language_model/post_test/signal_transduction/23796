The zzso process of lateral root formation consists of zzso zzso zzso development and the emergence of lateral roots from the primary zzso zzso genetic studies with zzso have revealed several key zzso regulators involved in lateral root zzso However, their functional interaction has not been fully characterized zzso Here we zzso a genetic approach to understand some of these zzso revealing that zzso functioning in zzso of early lateral root zzso is regulated downstream of zzso and acts with zzso to regulate lateral root zzso We showed that zzso expression of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso or zzso single zzso and completely abolished in zzso zzso double zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso expression under the zzso promoter in zzso zzso was greatly reduced in the lateral root zzso compared with that in the wild type and did not respond to zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression analyses under the zzso zzso or zzso promoter in zzso zzso single and double zzso or zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso or zzso do not regulate each other's zzso zzso root zzso of double and triple zzso of zzso zzso and zzso showed that the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the number of emerged lateral zzso These analyses also showed that zzso affected lateral root zzso development of zzso or zzso zzso but zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso to control lateral root zzso development and lateral root zzso
