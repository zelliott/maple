We investigated the zzso therapeutic potential of targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells that zzso zzso genetic zzso was zzso inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells that zzso no genetic zzso had no or only modest zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was seen in these zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso in cells selectively zzso Similarly, potent zzso of cell proliferation by the zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso occurred in virtually all the cells harboring genetic zzso whereas modest zzso was seen in some of the cells not harboring genetic zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso by zzso approach inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of zzso and zzso cells that zzso genetic zzso in the zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso and zzso cells that did zzso zzso with zzso zzso greatly zzso zzso cells to zzso and zzso Growth of zzso tumors derived from zzso cells but not zzso cells in nude mice was dramatically inhibited by zzso Thus, this work for the first time shows that genetic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells addiction to this zzso and their sensitivity to zzso by targeting zzso and zzso This zzso targeting of the zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for zzso cancer and warrants further zzso
