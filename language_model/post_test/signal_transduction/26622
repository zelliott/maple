Rapid signaling of zzso involves membrane zzso receptors zzso including membrane zzso of zzso and zzso In the mid-1990s, several laboratories independently reported the cloning of an orphan G zzso zzso from vascular and cancer cells that was named zzso Research published between 2000 and 2005 provided evidence that zzso binds and signals via zzso indicating that this zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has since been designated as the G zzso zzso zzso zzso by the International Union of zzso The availability of genetic tools such as different lines of zzso zzso mice, as well as zzso zzso and zzso has advanced our understanding, but also added some confusion about the new function of this zzso zzso not only binds zzso but also other zzso including zzso zzso and environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also interacts with other zzso This article represents a summary of a lecture given at the zzso International Meeting on Rapid zzso to zzso zzso in September 2011 in zzso zzso and reviews the current knowledge and questions about zzso signaling and zzso zzso that have complicated our understanding of zzso including interactions with human zzso and zzso as a potential zzso will also be zzso
