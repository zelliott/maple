The embryonic zzso that give rise to the zzso zzso acquire their cell fate identity through a series of transitions that ultimately determine their final, differentiated retinal cell zzso In zzso these transitions have been broadly defined as zzso zzso and zzso The expression of several zzso factors within the anterior neural plate at the time when the zzso eye field separates from other neural derivatives suggests that these genes function to specify competent embryonic zzso toward a retinal zzso In support of this, we demonstrate that some zzso factors expressed in the anterior neural zzso and/or zzso eye field zzso zzso and zzso change the fate of competent, zzso zzso which normally do not contribute to the zzso from an zzso to a retinal zzso Furthermore, the expression of these factors changes the zzso movements of zzso during zzso causing zzso cells to populate the native anterior neural zzso In addition, we zzso demonstrate that the efficacy of zzso to specify retinal cells depends on the position of the affected cell relative to the field of neural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate early steps of retinal zzso including the regulation of zzso cell movements, that are dependent on the level of zzso zzso
