zzso local translation of zzso zzso is one process that zzso synaptic zzso Here, we demonstrate that several of the factors known to control zzso translation in early zzso development zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specificity factor zzso and zzso also reside at synaptic sites of rat zzso zzso The induction of zzso at zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso which zzso a signal that results in the zzso of Aurora zzso This zzso in turn zzso zzso an essential zzso zzso on a critical zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso These data demonstrate a remarkable conservation of the regulatory machinery that controls zzso zzso translation, and zzso an axis connecting the zzso zzso to localized protein synthesis at zzso
