The binding of zzso to its zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso cells of the budding zzso zzso zzso We conducted a genetic screen to identify zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso This approach identified 12 unique zzso zzso zzso the strongest of which affected polar zzso at the zzso ends of zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso in the zzso receptors of divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with molecular modeling studies, suggested that zzso is oriented toward the core of the zzso zzso bundle where it may be involved in zzso an interaction with zzso These zzso appear to play specific roles in maintaining the inactive zzso of the protein since a variety of zzso at either position cause zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the activity of many zzso zzso receptors is also regulated by zzso polar zzso (the zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso domain zzso Altogether, the results of this study suggest a zzso role for the zzso end of zzso domain 3 in regulating the activity of divergent zzso zzso
