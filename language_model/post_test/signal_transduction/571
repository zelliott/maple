Some cellular events are crucial in zzso zzso including zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso cell migration and zzso zzso zzso These processes are controlled by zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso Using the mole species zzso zzso as an alternative animal model, we report the expression patterns of nine genes during zzso differentiation and zzso their implications in the zzso cellular zzso We show that: 1) zzso cell differentiation occurs very early and precedes zzso cell migration, indicating that the latter is not needed for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2) the time of zzso cell differentiation is consistent with the participation of zzso in promoting the migration and/or proliferation of zzso cell zzso and with that of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell differentiation and 3) the formation of the zzso zzso involves zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso in the mole differs from that in the mouse in some particular aspects, thus providing evidence that the zzso pattern of zzso development is not highly zzso during zzso zzso
