zzso of zzso with the zzso neurotransmitter zzso leads to the formation of zzso zzso and the subsequent increase of zzso calcium zzso zzso express both zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso of which zzso receptors are probably involved in zzso calcium zzso The zzso zzso occurs as two zzso zzso zzso and zzso but it was zzso unknown which zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso effects in zzso We report here that both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed by cultured zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso is much stronger than that of zzso zzso zzso in these zzso In zzso zzso experiments reveal zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in adult rat zzso but a strong zzso expression of zzso zzso only in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in the rest of the brain were diffuse and weak but consistently above zzso zzso of zzso receptors in zzso yields increases in zzso zzso production and transient calcium zzso It is surprising that the rank order of zzso potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso differs from that reported for zzso expressed zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and the occurrence of zzso calcium signaling were found also in cultured zzso indicating for the first time expression of zzso receptors in these zzso zzso
