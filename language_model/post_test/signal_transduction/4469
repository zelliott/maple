zzso studies have implicated zzso signaling in the maintenance of pancreatic zzso However, how zzso signaling regulates the zzso zzso or differentiation behaviors of pancreatic zzso at the zzso level remains zzso Here, using zzso genetic analyses and a new transgenic system that allows dynamic assessment of zzso zzso we address how discrete levels of zzso signaling regulate the behavior of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We find that these zzso experience different levels of zzso zzso which in turn regulate distinct cellular zzso High levels of zzso signaling induce zzso whereas lower levels promote zzso zzso The sustained zzso of zzso signaling triggers a zzso process that includes cell cycle entry and zzso amplification prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification and differentiation can be zzso by modulating the duration and/or extent of zzso signaling zzso indicating that these processes are triggered by distinct levels of zzso zzso These data show that different levels of zzso signaling drive distinct behaviors in a zzso zzso
