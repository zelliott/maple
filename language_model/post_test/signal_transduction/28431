Development of zzso zzso T cells contributing to type 1 diabetes zzso in both humans and zzso diabetic zzso mice is either promoted or zzso inhibited by particular zzso class II zzso In addition, it is now clear that when zzso with other zzso zzso some common zzso class I zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso T cell responses also essential to zzso zzso However, it was unknown whether the development of zzso zzso T cells could also be zzso inhibited by particular zzso zzso We addressed this issue by crossing zzso mice zzso expressing the zzso from the zzso zzso T cell clone zzso with zzso stocks zzso for zzso zzso that zzso inhibit zzso High numbers of functional zzso T cells only developed in controls zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression of some zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso T cells through decreased zzso zzso or zzso expression zzso Most interestingly, while zzso T cells exert a class zzso zzso function, zzso zzso class II molecules can contribute to their negative zzso These findings provide insights to how particular zzso class I and class II zzso zzso regulate the development of zzso T cells and the zzso zzso of such zzso zzso
