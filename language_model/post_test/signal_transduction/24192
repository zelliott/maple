To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in response to zzso zzso in zzso under various culture zzso designed for the study of cartilage biology and repair, and also in response to dynamic load for zzso in zzso 

zzso bovine zzso zzso were maintained in zzso medium under 4 culture zzso zzso zzso attached to a cut surface of cartilage, within zzso zzso or within intact cartilage zzso zzso were subjected to a change of medium with or without zzso zzso zzso were also subjected to dynamic zzso 

In zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso activities were similarly elevated at zzso hours after medium change, diminishing by zzso after 16 zzso In contrast, zzso in other culture zzso exhibited lower zzso levels of zzso activity and a moderate zzso of zzso in response to zzso that was sustained over the zzso treatment zzso The dynamic component of loading of cartilage zzso led to a zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso controls, that was indistinguishable from the effects of zzso 

zzso signaling in response to zzso in zzso zzso exhibited a pattern that was distinct from that in other culture systems, suggesting that the zzso zzso plays an important regulatory role in modulating the response to zzso zzso Since zzso and dynamic loading have distinct effects on zzso zzso signaling pathways other than zzso participate in the zzso responses to these zzso
