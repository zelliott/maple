zzso zzso response is the first line of host defense against virus zzso The recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in understanding of fish zzso zzso zzso zzso number of zzso genes has been identified in different fish species but obviously, they do not show a zzso zzso relationship with zzso zzso zzso These genes are divided into two groups with different abilities to induce downstream gene expression through binding to different zzso zzso zzso some fish zzso genes such as zzso and zzso have been confirmed for their zzso zzso In this review, we focus on how fish cells respond to zzso and how fish zzso are triggered through zzso zzso and zzso zzso We highlight the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso of fish zzso zzso In addition, the unique mechanisms underlying zzso fish zzso response and zzso of fish zzso gene expression are zzso
