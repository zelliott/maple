zzso play important roles in immunity and other zzso zzso They are also target cells of various toxic agents, including zzso and zzso However, little is known regarding the molecular regulation and chemical zzso of a spectrum of zzso antioxidants and phase 2 zzso in normal zzso zzso the molecular zzso controlling the coordinated expression of various zzso antioxidants and phase 2 defenses is of importance for developing strategies to protect against zzso injury induced by zzso and zzso zzso this study was undertaken to determine the role of the nuclear factor zzso factor 2 zzso in regulating both zzso and zzso expression of various antioxidants and phase 2 zzso in mouse zzso The zzso expression of a series of antioxidants and phase 2 zzso was significantly lower in zzso derived from zzso zzso mice than those from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso led to significant induction of various antioxidants and phase 2 zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the above cellular defenses except for zzso by zzso was completely abolished in zzso zzso As compared with zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso were much more susceptible to cell injury induced by zzso zzso species, as well as two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the antioxidants and phase 2 zzso by zzso in zzso zzso resulted in increased resistance to the above zzso zzso cell injury, whereas zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso provided only marginal or no zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is an indispensable factor in controlling both zzso and zzso expression of a wide spectrum of antioxidants and phase 2 zzso in zzso as well as the zzso of these cells to zzso and zzso zzso
