During zzso zzso the early zzso grows in a relatively hypoxic environment due to a restricted supply of zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso of zzso and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells zzso under such hypoxic conditions remain to be zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso early differentiation in zzso even in the presence of leukemia zzso factor zzso These effects are zzso by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Under conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso of zzso zzso zzso by directly binding to the reverse zzso element located in the zzso zzso zzso expression and small interference zzso zzso of zzso verified the zzso effect on zzso zzso Our findings collectively suggest that zzso in zzso differentiation of zzso is zzso at least in part, by the zzso suppression of zzso zzso
