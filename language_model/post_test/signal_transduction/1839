Vitamin A zzso diminishes zzso zzso responses, and high-level dietary vitamin A or treatment with the vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso enhances such zzso To identify a potential zzso underlying this in zzso activity of vitamin A, we examined the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on development of zzso and zzso cell populations using in zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells from the zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso but not with zzso zzso at primary stimulation strongly enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked this activity, but zzso and zzso zzso did zzso Because zzso zzso regulates gene zzso via either zzso receptors or zzso X receptors zzso we tested the zzso activities of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso strongly enhanced zzso development, whereas zzso did zzso This zzso zzso also enhanced zzso development when zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso During primary zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells from zzso mice, zzso increased zzso and zzso production, decreased zzso production, increased zzso in responding T cells for genes involved in zzso development zzso zzso and zzso and decreased zzso for genes involved in zzso development zzso zzso and zzso These data show that stimulation of the zzso zzso enhances zzso development, perhaps by affecting the relative expression of pertinent zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso
