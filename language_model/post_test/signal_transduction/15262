The molecular biology of zzso cell zzso zzso is complex and not fully zzso We have recently found that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tumors independently zzso with survival of the zzso 

Here, we have investigated the role of zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso dependent protein product of the growth zzso gene 6, in clear cell zzso zzso derived zzso The zzso protein was highly expressed in zzso cells deficient in functional von zzso zzso zzso a tumor zzso gene often zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells expressed decreased levels of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suggesting zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso and migratory zzso No effects of the zzso system could be detected on zzso Moreover, in zzso tumor zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso suggesting these molecules to be active in zzso 

These results provide novel information regarding the complex function of the zzso system in zzso
