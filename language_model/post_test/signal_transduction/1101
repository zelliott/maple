Many species of receptors form zzso but how can we use this information to make predictions about signal zzso This problem is particularly difficult when receptors zzso with many different species, leading to a zzso increase in the possible number of zzso zzso As an example system, we focus on receptors in the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso form zzso but this zzso does not directly affect signal zzso Here we present a new theoretical framework called a zzso zzso This algebra provides a systematic and rational way to zzso zzso and in some cases simplify large and often complicated networks of zzso zzso To compliment this algebra, zzso Carlo simulations are used to predict zzso effect on zzso organization on the zzso signal zzso and zzso These simulation results are directly comparable to various experimental measures such as zzso resonance energy transfer zzso and as such provide a link between the zzso algebra and experimental zzso As an example, we show how the algebra and zzso results can be used to predict the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When these predictions were compared to experimental findings from the literature, good agreement was found, demonstrating the utility of our zzso zzso of this work to the development of a novel class of zzso drugs are also zzso
