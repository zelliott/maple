zzso modeling of biological processes provides deep insights into complex cellular zzso While quantitative and continuous models such as differential equations have been widely used, their use is zzso in systems wherein the knowledge of zzso details and kinetic parameters is zzso On the other hand, a wealth of molecular level qualitative data on individual components and interactions can be obtained from the experimental literature and zzso technologies, making qualitative approaches such as zzso network modeling extremely zzso In this paper, we build on our research to provide a methodology overview of zzso modeling in systems biology, including zzso dynamic modeling of cellular networks, zzso analysis of zzso dynamic models, as well as zzso biological regulatory mechanisms from zzso data using zzso zzso We finally demonstrate how zzso models can be applied to perform the structural analysis of cellular zzso This overview aims to acquaint life science researchers with the basic steps of zzso modeling and its applications in several areas of systems zzso
