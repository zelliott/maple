zzso zzso of the zzso group are important regulators of cell growth and zzso To examine the candidate zzso profile for two members of this group, zzso E and zzso we performed in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso peptides for both zzso exhibited a predominance of basic zzso surrounding the zzso target zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso of zzso E and zzso indicated that presence of two negative pockets in the zzso binding groove provides an explanation for the zzso zzso These findings will aid future research toward signaling functions of zzso and zzso E within zzso
