The shoot zzso zzso is responsible for zzso organ initiation in higher plants, accomplishing continuous zzso by maintaining a pool of zzso cells and directing descendant cells toward organ zzso Normally, proliferation and differentiation are zzso so that the structure and size of the shoot zzso is zzso However, zzso plants zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso locus accumulate excess zzso zzso We describe the molecular cloning and expression pattern of the zzso zzso It encodes a putative zzso zzso suggesting a role in signal zzso The zzso domain is composed of 21 tandem zzso repeats that resemble zzso repeats found in animal hormone zzso We provide evidence that zzso expression in the zzso is specifically associated with zzso zzso
