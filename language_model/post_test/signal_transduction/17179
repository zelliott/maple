Nuclear bodies are discrete zzso structures that perform specialized functions in zzso zzso In plant cells, light can induce de zzso formation of nuclear bodies called zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The mechanisms of formation, the exact compositions, and the functions of plant zzso are not zzso Here, we have expressed zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and analyzed its fate after blue light exposure to understand the requirements for zzso formation, the functions of zzso and their potential use in cell zzso We found that light efficiently zzso zzso formation in zzso cells, indicating that, other than zzso no zzso proteins or zzso acids are required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to its degradation; however, degradation was not dependent upon zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso formation is associated with zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that by fusing zzso to the zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to activate DNA damage signaling zzso in the absence of DNA zzso
