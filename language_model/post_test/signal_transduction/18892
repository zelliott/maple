zzso are well established zzso of signal zzso downstream of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso In a previous study, we showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso couples zzso zzso to induction of the zzso 2 gene and zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso Morrow, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso In this study, the requirement for acid zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso compound zzso a frequently employed inhibitor of acid zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso However, the action of zzso was independent of its action on zzso since neither genetic loss of zzso zzso zzso nor zzso of zzso using zzso interference affected zzso zzso zzso Further investigations revealed that zzso zzso acid zzso zzso but not zzso zzso at the protein zzso This resulted in a zzso drop in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso administration of either zzso or zzso rescued zzso zzso after zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference attenuated zzso 2 induction by zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Taken together, these results define a novel role for zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, the results of this study warrant careful reconsideration of zzso as a specific inhibitor for zzso
