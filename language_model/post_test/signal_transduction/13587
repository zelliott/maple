Plant response to zzso stresses depends upon the fast zzso of molecular zzso involving stress perception, signal zzso changes in gene and protein expression and zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso are extremely sensitive to zzso drought, zzso and heavy metal zzso and soybean is not an exception of zzso zzso of immobilized pH zzso strips followed by advancement in mass zzso has made zzso a fast, sensitive and reliable technique for zzso identification and characterization of zzso zzso As the functional translated portion of the zzso plays an essential role in plant stress response, zzso studies provide us a finer picture of protein networks and zzso pathways primarily involved in stress tolerance zzso zzso master regulator proteins that play key roles in the zzso stress response zzso is fundamental in providing opportunities for developing genetically engineered zzso crop zzso This review highlights recent contributions in the field of soybean biology to comprehend the complex mechanism of zzso stress zzso Furthermore, strengths and weaknesses of different zzso zzso of zzso complete zzso and challenges and future prospects of soybean zzso study both at organ and whole plant levels are discussed in detail to get new insights into the plant zzso stress response zzso
