zzso is the common zzso for zzso signals, which play important functions in many biological zzso To study the role of zzso in skin development and zzso zzso we disrupted this gene in skin using the zzso zzso We showed that absence of zzso blocked hair zzso differentiation and zzso leading to a progressive hair loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso hair zzso exhibited diminished expression of zzso and increased zzso cells in the outer root zzso Additionally, the skin of zzso mice exhibited increased proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that the absence of zzso resulted in a block of both zzso and bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso including zzso a well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso mice developed spontaneous zzso skin tumors from 3 months to 13 months of zzso The majority of tumors are zzso zzso cell zzso A most notable finding is that zzso is accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso zzso of zzso fast proliferation and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso These observations revealed the essential functions of zzso signals in zzso skin tumor formation through the zzso pathway, which interacts with the zzso signaling zzso
