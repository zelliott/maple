zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to have significant therapeutic activity against chronic zzso zzso However, little is known about the underlying molecular zzso In this study, we found that zzso could inhibit zzso human zzso cells zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso notably suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and this zzso effect was zzso zzso by zzso zzso could prevent the zzso promoter activity induced by zzso and return expression of zzso zzso and zzso to normal levels while cells were under zzso and zzso zzso conditions and zzso with zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrated that zzso reduces zzso cell proliferation through the zzso and zzso zzso and it may have zzso regulatory effects on the zzso cellular signaling zzso
