zzso zzso is a leading cause of death among all cardiovascular zzso The analysis of molecular mechanisms by which the zzso zzso zzso repair and zzso indicates that zzso soluble factors are key players in communication to local and distant zzso such as bone zzso Recently, actively zzso membrane zzso including zzso are being recognized as new candidates with important roles in zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we critically examine the emerging role of zzso in local and distant zzso mechanisms after zzso zzso A comprehensive understanding of the role of zzso in cardiac repair after zzso zzso could bridge a major gap in knowledge of the repair mechanism after zzso zzso
