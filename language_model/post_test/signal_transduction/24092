zzso organisms have evolved in adaptation to the Earth's zzso and oxygen zzso This zzso process is dependent on the capacity of zzso cells to act as zzso that can zzso zzso and reform in adaptation to the zzso physical zzso Mechanical forces, such as zzso pressure and gravity, play important roles in the embryonic development, zzso and repair of lung and zzso We discuss the role of zzso zzso protein zzso as a zzso for stretch in these zzso during normal development, particularly as it lends itself to zzso we further demonstrate that zzso of such mechanisms may play a central role in injury repair, particularly as it relates to chronic diseases of lung and zzso zzso zzso signaling through its zzso coupled zzso promotes normal zzso signaling that maintains the zzso zzso of lung and zzso zzso disruption of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso because of such factors as zzso zzso zzso and zzso alters zzso zzso causing zzso cellular changes, resulting in zzso proliferation and zzso Examples of such zzso changes specifically related to this zzso mechanism of zzso are chronic lung disease and zzso We suggest a new paradigm that may help in the future creation of diagnostic and therapeutic zzso for a wide range of zzso and chronic diseases ranging from zzso zzso in newborns to idiopathic pulmonary zzso and osteoporosis as a result of aging or zzso
