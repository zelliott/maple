We previously reported that a zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso had been zzso with zzso showed a significant zzso of zzso zzso when expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso Because Chinese zzso zzso cells showed little zzso zzso in the present study we investigated further the effects of these zzso on zzso and zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors were zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was approximately 300 zzso zzso and the zzso efficiency was approximately zzso for all zzso Also, zzso and zzso receptors induced similar zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso and showed similar zzso responses after zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso determined as the difference between the extent of binding of zzso and zzso zzso occurred in a zzso and zzso manner to a maximum of approximately zzso of total zzso In contrast, zzso was almost totally blocked in cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso To determine the functional significance of zzso and investigate its relationship to zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and then washed free of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was manifest as a zzso and zzso decrease in the ability of the second stimulation to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso with 1 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso by zzso for zzso receptors but had no effect on the ability of the zzso receptors to respond to a second zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by treatment with zzso A also blocked zzso to a zzso treatment with zzso These results suggest that zzso may be directly involved in zzso zzso zzso at early zzso More prolonged zzso treatment zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso response of the zzso and the zzso zzso indicating that the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso at later times involves multiple zzso
