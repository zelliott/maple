We report here the quantitative expression of a set of zzso zzso including zzso family members, zzso zzso and zzso factors, in a zzso zzso accessory zzso By zzso gene expression between zzso populations of defined zzso we show that the genetic fingerprint of these zzso zzso cells is distinct from zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, T cells, B cells, and zzso zzso In contrast, it is highly similar to zzso zzso cells isolated from embryonic and zzso zzso with the exception that only adult populations express zzso and zzso We have previously reported that zzso signals regulate zzso zzso In the present study, we show that both zzso and adult zzso zzso cells express the zzso family member, death zzso 3 zzso and that addition of zzso zzso the zzso for death zzso 3, zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that this differentiation occurs in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso both zzso and zzso after adoptive transfer into an adult zzso
