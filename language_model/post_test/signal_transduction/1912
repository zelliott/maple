The zzso zzso active zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso factor that zzso in controlling the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in response to pharmaceutical agents zzso and zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso The occurrence and zzso function of this protein are as yet unknown in marine animals, where there has been a paradoxical lack of induction by zzso zzso One approach to understanding zzso function is to study the evolutionary history of processes such as zzso zzso In this study, zzso function was evaluated in a representative zzso fish zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso which is one of the most potent zzso zzso in zzso caused no increase in zzso zzso zzso activity nor in zzso zzso protein zzso Western zzso analyses of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso revealed the occurrence of a putative zzso zzso in nuclear and zzso zzso but no nuclear zzso of zzso following zzso treatment, which is a first step regulating the zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso study also showed no zzso of zzso into nucleus in the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that there may be zzso differences in zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling zzso in fish from those in zzso
