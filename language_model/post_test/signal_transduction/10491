Vitamin A zzso is essential for normal regulation of cell growth and zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation of normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso However, early biological effects of zzso in the differentiation of zzso zzso are largely zzso Here, we showed that zzso rapidly activated zzso response zzso protein zzso However, zzso did not use the conventional zzso acid zzso zzso X zzso zzso to activate zzso zzso activated zzso in zzso and zzso cells in which zzso were silenced with small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso expression or zzso by zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso or zzso regulated zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso completely abolished the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso are required for the zzso Altogether, this study provides the first evidence that zzso rapidly activates zzso zzso factor via zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso manner in normal zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso signaling zzso may play an important role in zzso early biological effects in the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
