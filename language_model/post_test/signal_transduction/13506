In wild type zzso zzso daily application of the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso evokes zzso of periodically spaced zzso heads along the body column and leads to loss of the ability to zzso zzso structures including the zzso The present transplantation studies show that the appearance of zzso heads is preceded by an early increase in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the gastric zzso Long before zzso head structures emerge, pieces of zzso tissue transplanted into the corresponding zzso level of zzso hosts induce head formation instead of being zzso whereas pieces implanted from zzso donors into zzso hosts form zzso Foot formation implies a decrease in the zzso This zzso is promoted through long-range assistance by the zzso Thus, after termination of the zzso treatment zzso feet are zzso midway between the periodically spaced zzso moreover, zzso zzso onto which additional zzso heads have been grafted zzso feet faster than do zzso zzso and may form zzso zzso zzso animals can also be produced using two substances zzso and zzso zzso that interfere with signal zzso but the mode by which secondary heads arise is different from zzso zzso head zzso Presumably because the assistance by the parental head is impaired, buds fail to form a foot and zzso and instead give rise to stable secondary body zzso It is assumed that the zzso along the body varies according to the number of cellular receptors for factors serving as zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
