In the zzso zzso bulb, signal processing is zzso by synaptic interactions between zzso zzso released from zzso cell zzso excites zzso spines of zzso cells, which in turn release zzso back onto the zzso cell zzso forming a zzso synaptic zzso This feedback synaptic circuit was shown to be zzso predominantly by zzso zzso We further zzso zzso zzso compounds to obtain insight into the mechanism that couples zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Feedback zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cell secondary zzso persisted when zzso zzso channels were blocked by cadmium zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso influx through zzso receptors can directly trigger zzso zzso release for local zzso feedback zzso
