zzso found on pancreatic zzso can move to draining zzso zzso where they are able to cause the zzso and zzso deletion of zzso T cells by a mechanism termed zzso This deletion depends on zzso through zzso (also known as zzso a member of the zzso of zzso zzso Here we describe a new mechanism that protects against zzso this mechanism involves another member of this zzso zzso whose function was largely zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells are roughly zzso more zzso than zzso cells, with the transfer of as few as 160 zzso T cells leading to the complete destruction of pancreatic zzso and the rapid onset of zzso We show that, in the absence of zzso zzso cells activated but not yet deleted by the zzso zzso mechanism gain the ability to zzso extensively upon secondary encounter with zzso on zzso zzso such as the pancreatic zzso Thus, zzso zzso limits the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso T cells and protects the body against zzso
