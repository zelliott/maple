In zzso junction proteins are zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and cell zzso In response to growth factors, the zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso from the cell surface with degradation or recycling as potential zzso However, the cellular machinery involved in zzso zzso and recycling remains zzso Here we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso of the zzso complex into zzso compartments that zzso with zzso and the sorting zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso levels by zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso and turnover of zzso zzso from the cell surface in response to zzso Moreover, zzso was also required for efficient recycling of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Together, these findings demonstrate a role for zzso in retrieval of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso and in membrane trafficking pathways that regulate zzso zzso
