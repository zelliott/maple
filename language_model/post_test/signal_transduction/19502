Cotton zzso zzso often encounters zzso stress such as drought and high zzso during its development, and its productivity is significantly limited by those adverse zzso To investigate the molecular adaptation mechanisms of this plant species to zzso stress, we identified two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was significantly promoted by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene driven by the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, was zzso induced in zzso under zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso resulted in the zzso displaying hypersensitivity to high zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth of the transgenic zzso were dramatically inhibited by zzso and zzso compared with wild zzso In addition, expression levels of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also remarkably altered in the transgenic plants under zzso zzso zzso our results suggested that both zzso and zzso may be involved in response to zzso stress and zzso signaling during early stages of plant zzso
