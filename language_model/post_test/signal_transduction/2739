Previous investigations from our laboratory and others have shown the existence of an autonomous zzso zzso cycle endowed with conventional zzso zzso and zzso which in zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso cells, rat liver and Swiss zzso cells is the zzso beta 1, which in the latter cells is activated upon zzso zzso The behavior of the nuclear zzso zzso cycle has been investigated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso possess both zzso zzso and zzso The cycle upon treatment with zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso is characterized by an zzso of zzso and a decrease of zzso due to zzso of a specific zzso Indeed, even if both beta 1 and gamma 1 zzso are present in these zzso when zzso cells undergo terminal zzso differentiation only the zzso beta 1 zzso is zzso as shown by zzso and zzso analysis, by direct determination of zzso activity and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso as well as by Northern zzso for zzso beta 1 message, whilst the amount of zzso gamma 1 and its activity are unaffected by zzso zzso In conclusion, the presence of a specific nuclear zzso whose activity and expression are zzso during differentiation of zzso cells points out a role for nuclear zzso zzso in the processes of cell differentiation and hints at the nuclear zzso beta 1 as an important step of the cycle in relation to the zzso zzso commitment of zzso zzso zzso
