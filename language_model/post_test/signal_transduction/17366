The zzso zzso zzso is known for its role in DNA zzso zzso zzso However, loss of function causes zzso only in higher zzso organisms such as mice and flies, but not in zzso organisms such as zzso suggesting that zzso has other important functions than zzso deposition during animal zzso Emerging evidence indicates that zzso also has a role in higher order zzso organization and zzso gene zzso it remains unclear whether zzso has a role in specific signaling zzso to promote gene expression during zzso Here, we report that zzso of one of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso that resemble those of, and are zzso zzso by, zzso of zzso positive regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of cut expression and to zzso of other zzso target genes in wing zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso of zzso zzso and regulates its binding to the zzso region of zzso The association of zzso with zzso on zzso establishes an active local zzso status for zzso by maintaining a high level of zzso zzso zzso In response to induced zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso domain to activate the expression of zzso target genes in cultured zzso cells, zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso Together, our results reveal a novel zzso function of zzso in promoting zzso zzso activity that regulates normal zzso zzso
