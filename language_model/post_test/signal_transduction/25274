We have determined the membrane topography of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its associated zzso zzso Lyn and zzso by zzso labeling and transmission electron microscopic zzso analysis of membrane sheets prepared from zzso mast zzso The method of zzso and Anderson zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified to generate membrane sheets from the zzso surface of zzso zzso Signaling molecules were localized on the zzso face of these native zzso by zzso labeling and high-resolution zzso zzso In zzso cells, the majority of gold particles marking both zzso and Lyn are distributed as small clusters zzso gold zzso that do not associate with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso clusters contain zzso In contrast, there is essentially no zzso zzso in resting zzso 2 zzso after zzso zzso approximately zzso of Lyn zzso with small and zzso zzso clusters (up to 20 gold zzso whereas approximately zzso of Lyn is found in distinctive strings and clusters at the periphery of large zzso clusters zzso gold zzso that form on characteristically zzso membrane zzso While Lyn is zzso zzso is dramatically recruited into these larger zzso The zzso pits that zzso zzso receptors bud from membrane adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso The sequential association of zzso with zzso zzso and coated pits in zzso distinct membrane zzso implicates membrane segregation in the regulation of zzso zzso
