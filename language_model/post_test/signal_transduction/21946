The properties of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied for their zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A structurally novel, zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and four compounds currently in clinical development zzso BAY zzso zzso and zzso were tested for zzso of zzso signaling in both the zzso and cellular zzso zzso showed potent zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso In contrast to a previous report, we have found that zzso has activity against human zzso in both zzso at zzso zzso In zzso zzso we have found that the zzso of zzso by both zzso and zzso are competitive with zzso with Ki values of 3 and 120 zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the cellular zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso zzso was also a potent inhibitor of zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso whereas BAY zzso is less potent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 107 zzso than in the cellular system zzso zzso 20 zzso In contrast, we found that zzso had less activity in the cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to its zzso potency zzso zzso 26 zzso These results show the use of a zzso zzso to confirm the zzso activity of lead compounds and drug candidates, such as zzso against the zzso protein in zzso
