Evidence from in zzso studies indicates that complement zzso regulates the expression of zzso on zzso zzso This suggests that in disorders such as zzso injury, in which both complement and zzso have been shown to play a role, complement zzso is a primary event and the effects of zzso are zzso To test this hypothesis in zzso we examined a mouse kidney model of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the time course and extent of expression of zzso was zzso in zzso mice compared with zzso mice, in which there was rapid but transient zzso of zzso on zzso walls and slower zzso of complement split product on the zzso zzso In addition, treatment with zzso zzso to reduce the zzso zzso damage was equally effective in the absence of zzso These data imply that complement and zzso pathways of zzso zzso injury are mutually independent, a conclusion that is possibly explained by the differences in the location and time zzso of complement zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso interaction between complement and zzso is limited because of time and spatial zzso zzso complement and zzso pose distinct targets for zzso
