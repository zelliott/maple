zzso the 2002 Nobel Prize in zzso or Medicine to Sydney zzso H Robert zzso and John E zzso for zzso discoveries concerning the genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death zzso highlights the significant contribution that the study of experimental organisms, such as the zzso zzso zzso has made to our understanding of human physiology and zzso Their studies of lineage determination in worms established the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso protein zzso is induced in cells destined to die, interacts with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso zzso which then promotes zzso of the zzso zzso The vast majority of cells undergoing zzso during development in zzso zzso as in zzso are zzso zzso the genetic regulation of zzso is zzso similar in zzso and zzso zzso This review summarizes these similarities - and the important differences - in the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso and examines the implications that our understanding of zzso zzso zzso may have for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic human neurodegenerative zzso
