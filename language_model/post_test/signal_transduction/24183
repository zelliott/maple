The lateral zzso nucleus zzso is the zzso relay of retinal zzso to the visual zzso It contains a rich array of brain zzso which zzso the visual signals to the zzso Several data have documented that beside zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals, the zzso contains also fibers and zzso expressing the zzso that produces zzso oxide zzso Here, we review the documented zzso roles of NO in the transmission of visual zzso to the zzso and in the processes of zzso refinement of zzso zzso zzso we focus on the recently suggested role of NO in processes of zzso in the zzso zzso relevance is given to studies documenting that, through an zzso zzso NO triggers zzso in the zzso of zzso rats deprived of vision in one zzso Data are also discussed on a possible role of NO in the mechanisms of zzso zzso loss induced by zzso We believe that a better understanding of the role of NO in the zzso may contribute to discover new experimental strategies for the treatment of degenerative zzso zzso
