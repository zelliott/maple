The zzso and relaxation characteristics of zzso zzso zzso are presumed to influence zzso humor zzso drainage and zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying regulation of TM cell zzso properties, however, are not well zzso This study investigates the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso zzso in regulation of TM cell contraction and zzso zzso using zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed intense zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso and zzso canal of human zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression induced dramatic changes in TM cell zzso and decreased zzso stress zzso focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso facility increased progressively and significantly in zzso zzso eyes zzso with zzso This response was associated with a significant decrease in TM tissue zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not affect either of these zzso Additionally, zzso cellular relaxation of the TM was associated with a significant decrease in the levels of active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these observations demonstrate that zzso plays a significant and zzso role in regulation of zzso zzso facility by altering the zzso characteristics of the zzso The effects of zzso on TM zzso status appear to involve zzso acid and zzso zzso signaling zzso
