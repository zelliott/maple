zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been found to be necessary and sufficient for inducing zzso head zzso Interestingly, the mechanism by which zzso does this is the ability of zzso to antagonize the zzso signaling zzso zzso itself a zzso can promote cell proliferation and transformation when zzso or zzso leading to tumor zzso zzso is a tumor zzso and loss of zzso function zzso zzso zzso by zzso In this study, we found that zzso is induced by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In addition, DNA damage zzso zzso in cell lines that harbor an zzso zzso zzso gene but not in cell lines that are zzso or harbor an zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found a potential zzso responsive element located approximately zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site and we show that zzso binds specifically to this element both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, we have established several cell lines derived from zzso lung zzso and zzso zzso cells that zzso express zzso under a zzso zzso We found that zzso has no effect on proliferation of cells that are not transformed by zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may mediate zzso tumor suppression by zzso the zzso signaling zzso
