The transforming growth factor zzso zzso regulates cell zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso signals are zzso to the nucleus via zzso in both major signaling zzso bone zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these pathways by targeting zzso and other signaling components for degradation by the zzso zzso Here, we identify tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso as a new target of zzso which zzso zzso to trigger its zzso zzso Unlike other zzso family members, which mediate signal zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is stored zzso in the egg animal pole, and in the zzso it is expressed in the zzso marginal zone, neural plate, and zzso and trunk neural zzso zzso of embryonic zzso zzso zzso neural crest development and neural zzso whereas zzso zzso boosts signaling and expands the neural zzso In human embryonic kidney zzso cells, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels, indicating zzso regulation of zzso by zzso Our results uncover new functions for zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling that are essential for neural crest development and neural plate zzso
