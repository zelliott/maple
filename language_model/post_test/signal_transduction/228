zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of tumor cells and is a known inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso beta zzso which is zzso active in zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso growth both in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was confirmed in nuclear extracts treated with zzso at 50, 40 and 20 zzso zzso decreases the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the growth of a number of zzso cells but not normal zzso Cell cycle decrease was seen by a decrease in zzso protein expression and the number of zzso cells treated with zzso at 20 zzso compared to zzso zzso of growth and increased cell cycle arrest of zzso cells by zzso were coupled with increased zzso zzso expression was increased, whereas zzso was decreased in cells treated with zzso compared to zzso In zzso studies were performed in zzso nude zzso mice implanted zzso with zzso cells and treated with daily zzso injections of zzso or zzso (10 zzso body weight in zzso for 77 zzso zzso growth was decreased and tumor zzso was increased zzso in zzso compared to zzso nude zzso In tumor samples, decreased zzso growth by zzso was coupled with increased zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso decreases the growth of zzso cells by increasing zzso These results demonstrate that zzso might be an important therapeutic tool in the treatment of zzso
