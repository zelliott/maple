The various members of the zzso zzso zzso family and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified as signaling receptors for the structurally related members of the zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso treatment of zzso and human zzso melanoma cells affects their invasive capacities and increases the production of zzso zzso zzso These cells express zzso levels of functional zzso and zzso the putative zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that, by using sensitive zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso melanoma cells, zzso receptors associate with a zzso activity exhibiting a zzso zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso The activity of this zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso zzso zzso basic protein zzso but not zzso zzso It is similar to the one reported to relate with zzso and zzso receptors and zzso by the zzso zzso nerve growth zzso Thus, zzso may represent unique signaling components common to zzso receptors that could engage joint downstream signaling zzso in zzso zzso
