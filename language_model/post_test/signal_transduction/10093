The mechanisms responsible for the stabilization and persistence of synaptic plasticity remain largely zzso In this study, we investigated the time course of the dependence of zzso long term zzso of field zzso zzso potential on zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso In agreement with our previous results obtained on an zzso long-term zzso paradigm we observed that application of a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso 1 h after zzso long term zzso induction reversed zzso zzso However, application of zzso 4 h after zzso long term zzso induction resulted in a more limited reduction of field zzso zzso potential suggesting that the dependence of zzso long term zzso expression on zzso zzso decreases over zzso Application of a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso during the zzso paradigm prevented the induction of zzso long term zzso consistent with our earlier zzso Application of zzso 1 h after zzso long term zzso induction resulted in a less pronounced though significant decline of field zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the concentration of zzso used was effective in zzso the zzso of zzso at zzso the main zzso of its zzso activity, and that zzso zzso recovered after zzso Lastly, a transient application of zzso inhibitor I (10 zzso one hour after zzso long term zzso induction also induced a partial although significant reduction of zzso field zzso zzso potential that stabilized at a level of approximately zzso of baseline three hours after application, suggesting that zzso also contributes to the stabilization of zzso long term zzso zzso These results confirm and extend previous observations that the expression of long term zzso in the zzso of rat zzso involves several elements of the zzso zzso signaling zzso
