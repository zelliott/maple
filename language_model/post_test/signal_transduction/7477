zzso analyses such as DNA zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso screening are prevalent to decipher a biological process of interest, and provide a large quantity of data to be zzso An ultimate goal for researchers must be zzso of their data to human zzso We have conducted functional zzso screenings to zzso molecular mechanisms of the inflammation amplifier, a zzso machinery that zzso drives recruitment of immune cells to promote zzso Using a public database of zzso association studies zzso we recently reported the zzso method by which our mass screening data were successfully linked to many human zzso As an example, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso was identified as a regulator of the inflammation amplifier, and associated with human diseases by zzso In fact, serum zzso levels were higher in patients with chronic inflammatory zzso The zzso method can be a useful tool to narrow mass data down to focus on human zzso zzso
