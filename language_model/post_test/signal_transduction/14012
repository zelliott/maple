Global cerebral zzso followed by zzso which leads to extensive zzso damage, particularly the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major mechanisms that lead to zzso death after cerebral zzso and zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso against cerebral zzso injury have been recently zzso Here we investigated whether zzso zzso exerts zzso effects against global cerebral zzso injury in rats and its potential zzso Global cerebral zzso was performed via 10 zzso of zzso zzso Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling positive cells and expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso region were assessed after zzso Morris water maze task was used to zzso spatial learning and memory deficits after zzso We found zzso zzso markedly improved the spatial learning and memory as well as attenuated zzso zzso in zzso caused by cerebral zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso gene zzso while suppressed the expression of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso effects of zzso zzso were abolished by zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso exhibits zzso effects against global cerebral zzso injury in rats, and its mechanisms might involve zzso of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
