The zzso zzso functions in multiple cell fate determination processes in zzso zzso including the decision between the zzso and zzso lineages in zzso In the zzso targeted zzso of the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso has demonstrated a role for these genes in zzso zzso but a function in zzso and in cell fate decisions has not been zzso Here we show that these zzso lead to altered expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in enhanced zzso zzso zzso differentiation is indicated by the expanded expression zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso has stronger effects on expression of these genes than does the zzso zzso consistent with functional zzso of zzso genes in zzso Our results demonstrate conservation of the zzso zzso and its regulatory mechanisms from fly to zzso and support a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of neural stem cell zzso
