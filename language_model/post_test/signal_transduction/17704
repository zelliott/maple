The proliferation marker zzso zzso zzso is commonly used in clinical and research pathology to detect zzso cells, as it is only expressed during zzso zzso Despite the fact that this zzso has been known for nearly two decades, there is still no adequate understanding of its zzso This study has therefore identified proteins that interact with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso system and zzso studies were used to verify these zzso Among other zzso regulatory zzso two binding partners associated with the small zzso Ran were zzso In addition, zzso and zzso proteins binding to zzso were zzso Moreover, it was demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso is capable of zzso to its own repeat region zzso by zzso zzso Since zzso a protein involved in the transport of zzso over the nuclear zzso was found to be a binding partner, a possible effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso regulatory proteins was zzso To test this hypothesis, a zzso gene expression system was used to induce the zzso fragments previously used for the zzso screens in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso of zzso B1 from zzso to zzso in response to this zzso It is suggested that zzso is a zzso protein with a role in the disintegration and zzso of the zzso and thereby in entry into and exit from the zzso
