zzso zzso factor zzso by zzso its zzso zzso zzso plays multiple roles in cell migration, proliferation and survival in the development of the central nervous zzso Recently, we have shown that functional zzso signaling mediates zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the developing spinal zzso Here, we report that zzso signaling activates zzso zzso activity in embryonic rat spinal zzso neural zzso zzso of neural zzso with zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso in 30 zzso and lasted for approximately 240 zzso while zzso a positive control, stabilized zzso zzso in 120 zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso stabilization effect could be detected in cells exposed to fM zzso of zzso This zzso zzso stabilization effect was inhibited by zzso of the cells with either zzso toxin zzso an zzso of G zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso enhanced nuclear zzso of zzso and its binding to nuclear zzso factor T zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Furthermore, zzso increased expression of genes such as zzso 2, 3, and zzso known as targets of the zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso and zzso by zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso signaling may interact with the zzso zzso to regulate the development of the central nervous zzso
