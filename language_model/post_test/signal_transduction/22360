zzso zzso 2A zzso a central zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso or zzso a scaffold zzso zzso and one of two regulatory zzso zzso or zzso has been repeatedly shown to play important roles in zzso localized signal zzso zzso In contrast, its involvement in zzso control of zzso production has zzso not been zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that binding of the nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter and zzso expression require zzso in zzso zzso zzso This conclusion is supported by the following zzso zzso zzso zzso expression along with zzso and zzso binding to the zzso promoter fails to occur in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso requirement persists even when zzso and zzso are rendered zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso requirement of zzso from its partial requirement for zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the C zzso with 13 copies of the zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso promoter in a zzso manner, whereas a similar zzso association requires both zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that a zzso zzso double zzso is zzso to zzso for nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas for zzso just the opposite zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso This final observation adds additional support to our previous conclusion that the zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso are predominantly controlled by different regulatory zzso
