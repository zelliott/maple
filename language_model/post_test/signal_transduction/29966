In both dividing and zzso cells, zzso are remodeled in response to signal zzso pathways triggered by a variety of zzso Members of the zzso family of small zzso have emerged as key zzso in zzso signals to cortical factors that mediate capture of dynamic zzso at specific zzso The specificity of cortical capture appears to be controlled by zzso tip proteins and cortical receptors that bind these zzso Recent studies suggest that some of the proteins interacting with zzso tips behave as bridging proteins between the zzso tip proteins and their cortical zzso Such bridging proteins may enhance cortical capture of zzso directly or indirectly through interactions with the zzso zzso
