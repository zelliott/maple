zzso gene zzso have recently been reported to be present in a high proportion of human prostate zzso In the current study, we show that great diversity exists in the precise structure of zzso hybrid transcripts found in human zzso Fourteen distinct hybrid transcripts are zzso each containing different combinations of sequences from the zzso and zzso zzso The transcripts include two that are predicted to zzso a normal full-length zzso zzso six that zzso zzso truncated zzso proteins and one that encodes a zzso fusion zzso Interestingly, distinct patterns of hybrid transcripts were found in samples taken from separate regions of individual zzso zzso suggesting that zzso gene zzso may be arising independently in different regions of a single zzso
