The zzso protein zzso the activity of zzso complexes and suppresses cell cycle zzso Wild type zzso can induce zzso but zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso is absent in zzso zzso These reports prompted us to examine whether zzso induced zzso in zzso We examined the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in eight zzso two Ewing's zzso zzso and two primitive zzso tumor zzso cell lines by Northern zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso Although zzso zzso was detected in all analyzed cell lines by Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso was detected in six zzso but not in two zzso two zzso and two zzso cell zzso We detected the point zzso of zzso at zzso 273 zzso to zzso in one zzso and two zzso cell zzso The zzso substitution at zzso 72 zzso to zzso was detected in all analyzed cell zzso One zzso cell line had a large deletion of zzso zzso These results showed that zzso zzso was usually expressed in zzso but not in zzso and zzso This may suggest that the down stream of the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso is different from that of the closely related tumors of zzso and zzso
