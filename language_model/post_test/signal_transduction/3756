The zzso chains of zzso zzso hormones such as human zzso hormone zzso have been shown to be important in zzso zzso association, zzso and zzso However, the exact biological significance of these zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso in signal zzso Human zzso standard zzso zzso International zzso zzso zzso zzso was treated with zzso zzso by zzso focusing zzso and affinity zzso using the zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso To determine the in zzso zzso of these zzso zzso simultaneous measurement of zzso formation and zzso zzso release was applied in two different cell systems zzso cells zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly increased ratio of zzso to zzso for zzso production in zzso cells zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Testing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso we found basic zzso to be significantly more active than zzso ones in stimulating the zzso formation in zzso cells zzso ratio basic zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were no differences in stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to Con zzso showed greater potency to stimulate zzso formation and zzso in both zzso and zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to Con zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be strong zzso of zzso release in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso over control zzso In contrast to our findings of zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso release of zzso was zzso only by, zzso zzso zzso zzso and not by zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso This was true for both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso therefore showed an identical differential zzso of signal zzso pathways in two different cell zzso strong stimulation of the zzso without zzso of zzso release zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we showed for the first time for zzso that the two dominant zzso signal zzso systems zzso formation and zzso zzso are activated to different degrees by zzso zzso zzso
