zzso zzso 2 zzso is an zzso hormone zzso for zzso zzso it has been shown to increase enteric zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We hypothesized that zzso would regulate zzso expression in enteric zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of action of zzso was investigated using primary cultures derived from the zzso zzso zzso of the rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation for 24 h increased the proportion of enteric zzso expressing zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was identified by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso but not on smooth muscle or zzso in zzso Over zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso increased zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso pathways blocked the increase in zzso expression by zzso zzso increased the expression of growth factors and their receptors in zzso cells in culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2-4 zzso zzso (by zzso We conclude that zzso acts on enteric zzso and zzso cells in culture via a zzso pathway, stimulating zzso differentiation via zzso and zzso zzso and expression of receptors and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso
