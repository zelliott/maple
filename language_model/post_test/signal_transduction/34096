The normal zzso zzso and invasive breast tumors are both complex zzso composed of multiple cell types as well as zzso zzso in three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso both normal and zzso breast cells are studied in zzso as two-dimensional zzso of zzso cells, which results in the loss of structure and tissue zzso Many laboratories are now investigating regulation of signaling function in the normal zzso zzso using zzso zzso However, it is also important to zzso zzso breast cells ex zzso in a zzso relevant environment to more closely mimic tumor architecture, signal zzso regulation and tumor behavior in zzso Here we present the potential of these zzso models for drug testing, target validation and guidance of patient selection for clinical zzso We also argue that in order to get full insight into the biology of the normal and zzso breast, and to create in zzso models for therapeutic approaches in humans, we need to continue to create more complex zzso models to approach the full context the cells encounter in the human zzso
