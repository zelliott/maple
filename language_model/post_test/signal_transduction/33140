The expression of the zzso zzso membrane protein zzso a marker of specific functional regions of the cerebral cortex, has been used to determine the environmental signals that regulate cortical zzso zzso and cell culture studies have shown previously that the fate of precursor cells, based on zzso zzso is amenable to regulation by exposure to novel environmental zzso This has been demonstrated in zzso to be dependent upon exposure to transforming zzso and collagen type zzso zzso following exposure to the zzso signals for a specific duration indicate a cell cycle dependence on the decision to become a zzso or zzso cortical zzso It appears, therefore, that zzso and zzso fates are both influenced by mechanisms that specify commitment early in cortical zzso
