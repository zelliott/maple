zzso of zzso zzso in response to viral zzso zzso zzso produced during viral replication is a first line of defense against viral zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso of the zzso bovine viral zzso virus can act as an inhibitor of zzso responses of zzso This effect is seen whether zzso is zzso expressed in cells or zzso added to the culture zzso The zzso effect is specific to zzso since zzso of zzso in cells infected with zzso Forest virus or treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha was not zzso We also show that zzso contains a zzso activity, and its zzso is active against zzso at a low zzso Both the zzso binding and zzso activities are required for the zzso of zzso zzso and we discuss here a model to account for these zzso
