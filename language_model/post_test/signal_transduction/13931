zzso is a zzso zzso zzso expressed in human zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a variable number of tandem repeats zzso region that is extensively zzso in normal zzso and zzso in tumor zzso This change in zzso modification of zzso leads to changes in its normal functions including, we hypothesized, its interaction with other zzso We identified zzso an zzso protein involved in multiple cellular processes including signal zzso zzso zzso and cancer cell invasion, as one of several proteins that associate with zzso in tumor zzso zzso associates with both the zzso tail and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso and zzso zzso primarily at the plasma membrane but the complex can be found also in the zzso and on the zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso in early as well as advanced clinical stages of breast cancer and zzso on zzso structures implicated in cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso revealed that zzso enhances zzso breast cancer cell migration and invasion in zzso However, zzso expression of zzso enhances the zzso induced by zzso When tested in zzso in a tumor zzso model of zzso melanoma, mice injected with zzso melanoma cells exhibited few or no lung zzso and, similarly to the in zzso results, zzso of zzso recovered the zzso zzso zzso Our findings zzso this newly identified zzso complex associated with zzso molecules in promoting the invasive and zzso potential of breast zzso
