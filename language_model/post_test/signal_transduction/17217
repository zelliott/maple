Recent studies suggest a zzso model in which zzso factors act in a collaborative manner to select and prime zzso zzso thereby enabling zzso zzso factors to bind and function in a zzso zzso zzso with this model, zzso signaling primarily regulates zzso gene expression through a pre-existing zzso zzso However, zzso signaling also zzso zzso of zzso zzso regions de zzso enabling zzso of zzso in zzso selection and zzso we find that zzso zzso precedes local zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso at zzso enhancers is primarily dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is significantly reduced by zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso these findings suggest an essential role of zzso zzso zzso deposition at de zzso enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting zzso zzso
