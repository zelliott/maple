The zzso of zzso cardiovascular disease zzso after chronic exposure to low doses of zzso radiation is only marginally zzso We have previously shown that a chronic zzso rate exposure zzso zzso causes human zzso vein zzso cells zzso to prematurely zzso We now show that a dose rate of zzso zzso is also able to trigger premature zzso in zzso primarily indicated by a loss of growth potential and the appearance of the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, a lower dose rate of zzso zzso was not sufficient to inhibit cellular growth or increase zzso despite an increased expression of zzso We used reverse phase protein zzso and triplex zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to study the zzso changes associated with chronic zzso zzso Both technologies identified zzso of the zzso zzso accompanying premature zzso In addition, expression of proteins involved in zzso structure and zzso signaling was zzso zzso diseases such as zzso have been previously associated with increased zzso cell zzso We zzso that a similar zzso aging may contribute to the increased rate of zzso seen in populations chronically exposed to zzso zzso
