zzso of the zzso damage checkpoint zzso influences zzso DNA zzso content and point zzso in zzso zzso The effects of this zzso checkpoint zzso on zzso zzso in human cells remain largely zzso Here, we report that zzso of the human DNA zzso zzso enhances zzso of the cell cycle arrest zzso zzso indicating zzso of the checkpoint via the zzso pathway, and increases zzso content independently of zzso a regulator of zzso copy zzso zzso arrest did not have a consistent effect on zzso zzso zzso of cell cycle regulators zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso gave rise, respectively, to zzso increased, or almost unchanged zzso zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso content increase upon zzso zzso is not a response to delay of cell cycle zzso Also, we observed that zzso zzso increased the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and vitamin C, suppressed the zzso content zzso On the other hand, in zzso zzso cells, we detected an increase in the frequency of the common zzso zzso zzso a major zzso deletion that can be induced by abnormal zzso generation, and is associated with a decline in zzso zzso integrity, aging, and various zzso disorders in zzso These results suggest that increase of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso replication is connected, via zzso stress, with the zzso checkpoint zzso in response to DNA damage, and is accompanied by generation of the common zzso zzso
