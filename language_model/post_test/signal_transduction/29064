zzso is an important zzso hormone regulator of calcium zzso and zzso zzso However, its mechanism of action in zzso is poorly zzso Our previous study demonstrated that zzso activates mouse zzso zzso gene 2 promoter through the zzso element 1 site, a recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined effects of zzso on zzso expression and activity as well as the requirement for zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso show that zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso and protein in a zzso and zzso zzso This zzso regulation requires zzso activity but not de zzso protein zzso zzso also increased binding of nuclear extracts to zzso element 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity mainly through protein zzso A with a lesser requirement for protein zzso C and zzso zzso Lastly, zzso stimulation of zzso expression was lost by small interfering zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso these studies for the first time demonstrate that zzso increases zzso expression and activity and that zzso is required for zzso induction of zzso expression in zzso
