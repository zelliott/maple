The transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso is one important player in the regulation of zzso zzso turnover and cell proliferation in zzso zzso We used zzso zzso in rats as a model to investigate the regulation of zzso zzso type I and type II expression on protein and zzso zzso level during zzso In the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso I and II were significantly increased with a maximum after 2 zzso On protein level, expression of zzso zzso II was significantly increased after three to 3-5 zzso This elevated expression could be inhibited by zzso the zzso biological activity of zzso with a specific zzso In cultured pancreatic zzso cells, zzso reduced cell proliferation as measured by zzso zzso zzso the transcript levels of zzso as well as zzso and protein zzso of type I and type II zzso increased during zzso stimulation in zzso These results indicate that zzso pancreatic cells contribute to the enhanced zzso synthesis during pancreatic zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of its own receptors during the zzso process, thereby contributing to the increase of the zzso cellular zzso
