zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in some zzso correlate with zzso resistance and contribute to zzso by regulating invasion, zzso cell survival and zzso zzso zzso in the gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso cause development of multiple zzso of the nervous system such as zzso zzso and zzso occurring spontaneously or as part of a zzso disease zzso type zzso The benign character of zzso zzso makes them less responsive to zzso We previously showed that, amongst other growth factor zzso zzso family receptors zzso zzso and zzso are significantly zzso in zzso zzso As zzso is zzso regulated by zzso and positively regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso previously shown to be a key regulator in zzso growth we hypothesized that zzso is a good target to study in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso positively regulates the zzso zzso zzso which is known to be under zzso regulation in zzso and is involved in increased proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrated strong zzso and zzso of zzso zzso as well as its zzso zzso in human zzso primary cells compared to normal zzso zzso We show that zzso is zzso and increases zzso zzso zzso and survival acting via zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recruits zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso We showed that zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso zzso D1 and zzso leading to enhanced survival, zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is relevant in zzso zzso and is a potential therapeutic target for zzso and other zzso zzso
