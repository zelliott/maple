Cell zzso control of zzso progression zzso the spatial differentials of growth that drive tissue zzso yet little is known about how cell distortion impacts the zzso signaling machinery that is responsible for growth zzso Here we show that the zzso family zzso zzso conveys the zzso shape zzso to the zzso machinery in human zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulating zzso and arrested in mid zzso phase when spreading were inhibited by restricted zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso active zzso increased expression of the zzso protein zzso required for zzso degradation of zzso and restored zzso progression in these zzso Studies with zzso and zzso active forms of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso and with a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso another zzso target, revealed that zzso promoted zzso progression by altering the balance of activities between these two downstream zzso These data indicate that signaling proteins such as zzso and zzso which are thought to be involved primarily in zzso zzso also mediate cell growth regulation by zzso cell shape to the zzso machinery at the level of signal zzso
