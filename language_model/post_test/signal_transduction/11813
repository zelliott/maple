Besides zzso effects, the zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso protects the liver from zzso zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism has not been fully zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways have been reported to be involved in the mechanism of liver zzso Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine whether the zzso axis is part of the mechanism of the positive effect of zzso zzso by zzso in liver zzso in zzso Various zzso were made in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats with liver zzso Acute zzso zzso markedly reversed the zzso levels of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and decreased zzso blood flow and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso congestion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso scores, zzso index and levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, acute zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso scores and zzso and restored the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso protein 2; a zzso zzso zzso eliminated the zzso beneficial effects in zzso rats with liver zzso which was accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was associated with the recovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, and the suppression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 8 levels in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways are part of the mechanism of the positive effects of zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats with liver zzso Our study highlights the potential of the zzso protective agent zzso in NASH patients with zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso
