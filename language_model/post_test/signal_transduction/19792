zzso T cells of the zzso zzso are zzso in the aged immune zzso zzso cells zzso play a critical role in zzso zzso T cell zzso However, expression of zzso by aged DC that promote differentiation or survival of zzso cells has not been extensively zzso Using bone zzso DC from zzso mice of different ages we compared zzso production after DC zzso by zzso zzso zzso for zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso production and expression of DC zzso molecules did not vary significantly by age indicating that zzso zzso function and signal zzso were intact in aged zzso There were relatively minor age-related changes in zzso and zzso which promote zzso zzso but zzso a zzso zzso increased more than zzso across the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased with age and the zzso of zzso expression by aged DC was blocked by zzso that prevents zzso production, and by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso added to DC cultures further enhanced zzso production from aged but not young zzso These data indicate that age-related changes in DC zzso production are necessary, but not sufficient to induce DC zzso zzso Such changes may play a role in the expansion of zzso cells in the aged immune zzso
