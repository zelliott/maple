zzso provide control over cortical zzso We investigated the zzso expression of key genes in the zzso system across human zzso life and determined whether they zzso to the development of markers for zzso zzso which shape cortical zzso We used zzso with zzso validation and in zzso zzso to zzso zzso for the central zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso in human zzso prefrontal zzso zzso days - 49 zzso 

zzso zzso decreases until adulthood, particularly in layer II, after zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is lowest in early life and adulthood, zzso between school age and young zzso zzso expression declines after zzso in zzso while zzso increases from zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression increase steadily after zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cortical layers as zzso through higher zzso zzso may occur within the first few years of human zzso After adolescence, higher zzso levels of the zzso synthetic and zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that a late zzso switch may occur where zzso is more strongly regulated after adolescence than earlier in zzso Thus, expression of key genes in the zzso system changes with maturation of cortical zzso
