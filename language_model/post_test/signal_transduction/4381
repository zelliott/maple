zzso zzso the zzso which zzso the final step of zzso zzso constitutes a marker of the functional differentiation of zzso zzso In addition, a zzso rhythm of zzso zzso zzso previously described in the chicken zzso zzso zzso would suggest that zzso gene zzso is one output of the zzso system that controls zzso zzso The study sought to monitor the zzso expression of zzso zzso in the chick zzso zzso and to investigate a possible role of zzso signals in this differentiation zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso is expressed at embryonic day 8 zzso At zzso zzso zzso became zzso on northern blots and traces of zzso activity could be zzso zzso zzso concentration increased zzso between zzso and day 10 zzso then zzso zzso A zzso rhythm of zzso zzso concentration was readily observed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated on minimum culture medium at E11 stopped developing zzso gene zzso However, the addition of serum to the culture medium restored zzso zzso concentration to the levels observed in zzso The data suggest that the functional differentiation of zzso cells observed during the second week of embryonic life may be controlled zzso of zzso by serum zzso
