The induction of zzso cell death is a significant mechanism of tumor cells under the influence of zzso and resistance to these treatments has been linked to some cancer cell lines with a low propensity for zzso The present study aimed to investigate the enhanced effects and mechanisms in zzso and the cycle distribution of zzso cells, a human leukemia cell line lacking a functional zzso zzso after combination treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicated that combined treatment led to increased zzso and zzso cell death in zzso cells, which was correlated with the zzso of zzso and increased expression of zzso B, the induction of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation, the loss of zzso membrane potential, and the zzso of zzso The combined treatment of zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in a significant reduction in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in combined zzso zzso The data suggest that a combination of zzso and zzso could be a potential therapeutic strategy against zzso leukemia zzso
