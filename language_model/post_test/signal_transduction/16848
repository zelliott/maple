Since the early 1980s, various strains of the zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso have been used as models for understanding zzso zzso In 1991, a zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso strain, zzso was reported to zzso not only its natural host tomato but also zzso in the laboratory, a finding that spurred intensive efforts in the subsequent two decades to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this strain causes disease in zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso carries a large repertoire of potential zzso factors, including zzso zzso that are zzso through the type III zzso system and a zzso zzso called zzso which structurally mimics the plant hormone zzso zzso Study of zzso zzso zzso has not only provided several conceptual advances in understanding how a bacterial pathogen employs type III zzso to suppress plant immune responses and promote disease zzso but has also facilitated the discovery of the immune function of zzso and key components of zzso signaling in zzso The concepts derived from the study of zzso zzso zzso may prove useful in understanding zzso mechanisms of other plant zzso
