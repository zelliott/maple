Recent studies have reported high zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene in various human zzso Three zzso zzso in the zzso 9 and 20 have been proven to activate the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso signal zzso is an important zzso of a number of cellular fates including growth, zzso and zzso The zzso gene is activated by zzso zzso leading to cooperative effects in cells responding to growth factor zzso Here we evaluate the zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 18, and 20 of zzso zzso 1 of zzso and zzso 5, 11, and 15 of zzso were analyzed in 36 zzso and two zzso zzso specimens by direct zzso DNA zzso 

We identified four zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the 36 zzso specimens zzso One of the four zzso zzso has been previously reported to be a zzso zzso Furthermore, we found 17 zzso zzso zzso in zzso 1 and one zzso zzso zzso in zzso 15 of zzso 

This data is the first report of zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer and it appears to be the first zzso to be zzso in zzso but not in conventional zzso zzso of the zzso Our data provide evidence that zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso but at a lower frequency than zzso
