To investigate the zzso zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso before and after AM zzso with zzso zzso and effects of zzso zzso zzso on the production of inflammatory zzso produced by cultured zzso T cells, and to explore the zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso T cells were isolated from zzso zzso fluid zzso and from peripheral blood derived from 10 asthma patients allergic to house zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and activated by house zzso zzso and zzso with zzso T zzso The zzso cells were divided into zzso zzso zzso intervention group and zzso expression group with which the control groups were set zzso The zzso zzso was added to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the experiment group and no zzso was added in the control zzso The zzso were harvested after 72 hour zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso expression group was divided into experiment and control groups, and house zzso zzso was added to the experiment group but no zzso was added in the control zzso The cells of the two groups were harvested after 24 hour zzso The zzso zzso expression on the zzso was detected by flow zzso 

After activated by house zzso zzso the average zzso density of zzso on AM in the experiment group zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The production of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and (104 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso (90 zzso 17) zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high-dose zzso zzso zzso 24) zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso the differences among groups were significant zzso zzso zzso The production of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high-dose group respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two groups zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may effectively present zzso to T cells in allergic asthma zzso zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the production of zzso and zzso by blocking the zzso signal of zzso T zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso may hold therapeutic zzso in asthma by zzso airway zzso
