The production of zzso oxide by zzso has been implicated as a host defense mechanism against microbial pathogens and tumor zzso Recent reports have implicated zzso zzso as an zzso signal critical for the induction of zzso zzso In this report we have systematically investigated the role of zzso in the induction of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso First, we demonstrate that zzso expression is highly zzso and is zzso in response to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso results in a zzso zzso of zzso on both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that is consistent with the timing of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso regulatory zzso expression with similar zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso by zzso The acceleration of zzso induction is observed at the levels of transcription, protein zzso and NO zzso zzso we propose that the zzso environment of zzso may determine the rate and magnitude of zzso oxide production, thereby regulating the zzso response to pathogen zzso
