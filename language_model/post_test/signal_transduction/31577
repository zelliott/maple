The zzso mouse model is a clinically relevant model of early zzso zzso We used zzso an zzso highly potent and selective vascular zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso development and growth in zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso body zzso was administered once daily for 28 days to 6-week-old zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso study, zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso in the small zzso and zzso zzso diameter was lower in the small zzso but remained unchanged in the zzso In animals receiving zzso microscopic evaluation of the small zzso showed a significant reduction in the number of larger zzso In the zzso study, zzso treatment reduced zzso diameter (but not zzso in the small zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso significantly reduced the number of larger zzso in the small zzso with no large zzso present in the zzso zzso treatment had no effect on zzso density or zzso of zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso but significantly reduced the number of cells expressing zzso zzso In conclusion, the effects of zzso in the small zzso of zzso mice are consistent with an zzso mechanism of action, limiting growth of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso These data also suggest that an early step in zzso development may depend on zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso signaling may play key roles in the development and progression of zzso zzso
