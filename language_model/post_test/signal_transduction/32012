zzso stem cells zzso can home to the zzso area and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 4 zzso axis is pivotal in inducing zzso zzso However, the mechanisms remain zzso This study set out to detect if zzso promotes migration and zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the in zzso experiment, zzso cells were isolated from zzso mouse heart zzso culture by magnetic cell zzso zzso cell sorting results demonstrated that a few zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso stem cell zzso zzso culture could induce zzso cells zzso zzso which was confirmed by cardiac zzso I zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and von zzso factor zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso were performed using zzso cell chambers to detect zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso infected with zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso more in zzso than that in the control group, and subsequently attracted more zzso zzso This effect was diminished by administration of zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso or zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso of zzso in the zzso area by zzso infection resulted in more zzso retention to the zzso zzso a higher percentage of zzso and reduced zzso area which was attenuated by zzso or zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso of zzso enhanced zzso migration in zzso and zzso of transplanted zzso and reduced zzso size via zzso zzso
