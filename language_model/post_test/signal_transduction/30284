zzso regulatory T cells develop in the zzso and are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance to self zzso We report the critical requirement for zzso zzso specifically on, and during the zzso development of, zzso regulatory T cells for the induction of their zzso expansion within the zzso In the absence of this zzso there was a severe reduction in their zzso generation and zzso leading to decreased peripheral zzso zzso zzso expression on either zzso zzso or zzso cells was sufficient to promote the development of normal numbers of zzso regulatory T zzso This work suggests that zzso signals promote zzso regulatory T cell development and highlights the plasticity of the zzso zzso for supporting their zzso zzso this study demonstrates that zzso regulatory T cells can zzso accept a single critical signal necessary for their zzso development from different cellular sources, redefining our understanding of their zzso
