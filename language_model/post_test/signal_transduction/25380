Plants adapt to a changing environment by zzso their growth and development to prevailing zzso Such zzso development requires a highly dynamic integration of growth phenomena with signal perception and zzso systems, such as occurs during zzso zzso The plant hormone zzso has been shown to play a key role in regulating these directional growth responses of plant zzso to environmental zzso However, we are still lacking a cellular and molecular understanding of how zzso signaling zzso link stimulus perception to the rapid zzso of growth zzso Here, we report that in root zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulates root zzso and associated zzso zzso pH changes through a zzso signaling zzso Using an approach that zzso zzso zzso and automated computer zzso image analysis, we demonstrate highly dynamic root surface pH patterns during vertical growth and after zzso These pH dynamics are shown to be dependent on zzso and specifically on zzso transport zzso by the zzso influx carrier zzso in cells of the lateral root cap and root zzso Our results further indicate that these pH responses require zzso changes in zzso zzso levels that operate independently of the zzso zzso perception zzso These results demonstrate a methodology that can be used to zzso zzso zzso responses in a manner that can be integrated with the rapid plant growth responses to environmental zzso
