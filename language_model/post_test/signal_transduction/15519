zzso of adjacent zzso zzso to separate single columns for specific zzso connections is commonly observed in zzso and zzso and is necessary for proper processing of sensory zzso zzso restriction is zzso similar to zzso a phenomenon referring to the avoidance of zzso from adjacent zzso zzso The molecular mechanism underlying the establishment of zzso restriction or zzso zzso remains largely zzso Here, we identify Turtle zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as a key player in regulating the zzso pattern of zzso zzso terminals in zzso zzso functions to prevent fusion between two adjacent zzso zzso and acts in parallel to the zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso recognition zzso by zzso acts in concert with intrinsic zzso control of terminal growth, to restrict the connection made by each zzso zzso to a single zzso
