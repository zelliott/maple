zzso positive zzso 4 zzso is a zzso nuclear protein that has important roles in DNA transcription, zzso repair and zzso However, the role of zzso in cancer remains to be zzso Several studies propose that zzso may act as a putative tumor zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso may represent a potential therapeutic target in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso protein expression is significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with their adjacent zzso counterparts as shown by zzso zzso and western zzso in 104 pairs of zzso human zzso specimens and 6 fresh zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso small interfering zzso zzso in human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso the growth of cancer cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest and the increase of cell zzso in zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso by injection of the zzso zzso zzso complex produced an effective zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso in mice through growth zzso and increased zzso These results indicated that zzso could be an attractive new therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
