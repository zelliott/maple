zzso is a small zzso protein prominently localized in the zzso Previous findings obtained in cell culture systems demonstrated an involvement of zzso in zzso zzso pathway, at a level zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, its role in the zzso has been, so far, only zzso Here we studied the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso by employing mice with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We demonstrated that the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso projection zzso by increasing Golf protein levels and, in turn, influencing motor responses challenged by zzso zzso Interestingly, we also show that zzso is required for a correct zzso zzso zzso a function mainly associated to stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our results indicate that zzso is an important zzso of zzso transmission in the zzso
