zzso zzso is of major importance for embryonic development and adult zzso While zzso is often viewed as a way to zzso biological signals, zzso and zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso The development of zzso zzso zzso is a powerful model to study zzso zzso Following the zzso division of bristle precursor cells, Delta zzso and zzso receptors traffic differently in the two daughter cells, leading to directional signal zzso Recent evidence suggests that in addition to differential zzso zzso after division, a zzso of zzso zzso ensures the directional transport of zzso already during zzso cell zzso zzso analysis suggests that different zzso of zzso Delta trafficking exert complementary but distinct actions required for zzso recycling, zzso interaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, novel data suggest that different zzso compartments may act as zzso zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the implications of these novel findings for our cell biological understanding of zzso zzso
