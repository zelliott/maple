Aside from bone zzso zzso a definitive cure for Philadelphia zzso zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso has yet to be zzso Although zzso the first zzso targeted drug developed for zzso has achieved a remarkable success, the emergence of resistance to this agent zzso the prospect of a cure for this zzso Though a variety of resistance mechanisms can zzso in the majority of patients resistance zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso activity of the zzso fusion zzso This can result from gene amplification and, more importantly, point zzso that disrupt the bind of zzso to zzso zzso In this review, we aim to define and illuminate mechanisms of resistance and describe how drug resistance is shedding new light on zzso domain zzso 

In light of recent studies and publications, it is now clear that zzso exerts its zzso action by stabilizing the inactive non zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso even outside the zzso domain can lead to enhanced zzso of the zzso thereby stabilizing the active zzso that resists zzso zzso So far, 25 different zzso of 21 zzso acid zzso of zzso have been detected in zzso zzso In addition, it has been recently illustrated that zzso zzso the onset of treatment and that some zzso a more aggressive disease zzso Finally it has been shown that molecular zzso is almost never reached through zzso zzso 

The most common mechanism of zzso for zzso patients treated with zzso is the appearance of point zzso in the zzso zzso that zzso resistance to this zzso zzso into the emerging problem of resistance should promote the rational development of alternative, zzso and potentially zzso treatment zzso
