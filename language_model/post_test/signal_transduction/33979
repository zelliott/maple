zzso studies in the mouse have shown that zzso Transport zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso signal zzso In this study, we take advantage of wild type and zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso to characterize additional aspects of the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Exposure to Sonic zzso zzso zzso or expression of an activated zzso of zzso zzso activates an zzso reporter in zzso zzso but not in zzso derived from zzso that lack zzso or the zzso zzso of the retrograde zzso zzso Similarly, decreased activity of either zzso or zzso two negative regulators of zzso signal zzso activates the zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso is zzso present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso trafficking of zzso zzso components through the zzso is essential for their zzso
