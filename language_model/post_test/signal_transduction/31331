To investigate the functional and molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates calcium zzso in gastric zzso smooth muscle cells zzso of zzso 

zzso contraction of zzso strips was recorded using a zzso zzso was used to determine the regulatory effect of protein zzso C zzso on regulating the zzso of the type III zzso zzso zzso zzso in gastric zzso zzso in the zzso calcium zzso concentration were zzso using zzso zzso and the zzso calcium current zzso was recorded by zzso zzso 

zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the mean zzso zzso of circular muscle by zzso zzso zzso and the frequency of zzso muscle by zzso zzso zzso in gastric zzso zzso which were suppressed by zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso concentration zzso were reduced in a zzso manner when the zzso were zzso with increasing zzso of zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso On removal of zzso calcium or blocking zzso by zzso a smaller but significant rise in the zzso concentration was still zzso by zzso When zzso was depleted by the administration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso BA or blocked by the zzso zzso current zzso by giving 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, the zzso zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was apparently inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso concentration increase in gastric zzso zzso depends on the release of zzso stores which are zzso regulated by zzso zzso of zzso Released calcium in turn activates zzso through the zzso of zzso ultimately resulting in the contraction of the gastric smooth zzso
