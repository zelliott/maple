Plants respond to mechanical wounding or zzso attack with a complex scenario of zzso zzso or synergistic action of different signals leading to defense gene zzso Tomato plants were used as a model system since the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso were recognized as essential signals in zzso gene zzso In this review recent data are discussed with emphasis on zzso in zzso The following aspects are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and action, zzso orchestration of various signals such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso local and systemic response, and zzso amplification in wound zzso The common occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso generation in the vascular zzso suggest zzso as the systemic zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly support this zzso
