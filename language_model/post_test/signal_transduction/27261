The zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in the process of T zzso target cell killing and has recently been shown to be expressed on myeloma cell lines and native zzso plasma zzso Several zzso have been reported to interfere with spontaneous and even zzso zzso but no attempt has been made yet to investigate these interactions and the possible underlying mechanisms in myeloma zzso Since in myeloma patients zzso zzso displays a profound therapeutic effect in zzso which is usually attributed to its growth zzso and/or zzso capacity, we set out to study the potential interference of zzso with zzso zzso zzso to expectations, zzso reduced the degree of zzso caused by the treatment of five zzso myeloma cell lines with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso and zzso zzso was superior to the prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso as far as zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This effect of zzso was neither explained by a zzso of the zzso zzso nor caused by zzso of the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso activity of zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso converting zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso of protein zzso C zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso inhibited the effect of zzso as well as that of zzso on zzso zzso These results point to a zzso mechanism of transient interaction between the zzso signaling along the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling as well as of ICE zzso which becomes exhausted by prolonged stimulation with the zzso According to our data zzso applied continuously and in high doses resembling the therapeutic situation in zzso zzso myeloma zzso However, based on the observed zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso a partial zzso of the natural immune surveillance on myeloma cells by zzso zzso present in the bone zzso zzso of this zzso should be zzso
