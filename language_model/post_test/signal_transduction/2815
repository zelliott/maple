Loss of T zzso signal zzso molecules has recently been implicated in immune suppression in zzso zzso In the present study, we have examined this and related phenomenon extensively in a large number of zzso mice, analyzed zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice were isolated and characterized with respect to the zzso zzso levels of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to recent reports, T cells from zzso mice were observed to express normal levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, T cells showed healthy zzso and zzso responses until approximately 3 zzso after post tumor challenge, when the tumors constituted approximately zzso of the body zzso zzso with respect to some parameters were observed only in mice that had been bearing larger tumors for a considerably longer zzso As human tumors are unlikely to grow to such large sizes zzso zzso zzso of the total body zzso the significance of the zzso in T cell expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the immune status of cancer patients is zzso Altogether, these results indicate that zzso in T cell signal zzso molecules do not account for the profound zzso suppression observed during tumor zzso
