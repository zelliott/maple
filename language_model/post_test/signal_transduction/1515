The zzso zzso zzso initiation network zzso signals the onset of cell division from the zzso pole body zzso and is regulated by the small zzso zzso The zzso of zzso components including zzso to the zzso is required for zzso and is dependent on zzso a zzso resident of zzso However, a direct interaction between zzso and other members of the zzso has not been zzso To understand how zzso is linked to other zzso zzso we have begun to characterize an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We have determined that this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a previously zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso is present zzso at zzso and that its function appears to be required for the zzso of all other zzso components to zzso with the exception of zzso The zzso C zzso zzso the protein to zzso in a zzso manner, and we demonstrate a direct zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is required for zzso binding to zzso Our studies indicate that zzso provides a physical link between zzso and the zzso signaling zzso
