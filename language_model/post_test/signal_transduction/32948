An international seminar was held June zzso 1997, on the biological effects and related health hazards of ambient or environmental zzso and extremely low frequency zzso electric and magnetic fields zzso zzso It was zzso by the World Health Organization zzso the International Commission on zzso zzso Protection zzso the German, Japanese, and Swiss zzso zzso provided zzso of the scientific literature that were discussed by participants of the zzso zzso expert working groups formulated this report, which evaluates possible health effects from exposure to zzso and zzso electric and magnetic fields and identifies gaps in knowledge requiring more research to improve health risk zzso The working groups concluded that, although health hazards exist from exposure to zzso fields at high field strengths, the literature does not establish that health hazards are associated with exposure to low-level fields, including environmental zzso Similarly, exposure to zzso electric fields at levels currently found in the living and working environment or acute exposure to zzso magnetic fields at flux zzso below 2 zzso were not found to have demonstrated adverse health zzso However, reports of biological effects from low-level zzso exposure and chronic exposure to zzso magnetic fields were identified that need replication and further study for WHO to assess any possible health zzso Ambient zzso electric fields have not been reported to cause any direct adverse health effects, and so no further research in this area was deemed zzso
