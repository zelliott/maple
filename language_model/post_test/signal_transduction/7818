Genes involved in zzso and zzso metabolism are nutritionally regulated at the zzso level in a coordinated zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that controls zzso and is induced during zzso to facilitate the conversion of zzso to fatty acids and zzso for the storage of the excess zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso in the liver can cause zzso zzso and zzso insulin resistance due to direct suppression of insulin signaling zzso zzso development of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso factor that strongly activates various insulin signaling zzso protecting against the development of insulin resistance and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is the primary site where zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso expression and insulin sensitivity in the zzso This scenario provides a zzso explanation for the zzso link between zzso and zzso metabolism such as zzso switching of zzso synthesis to zzso In addition, these two zzso factors may ultimately contribute to zzso effects of zzso leading to the development of the zzso syndrome and zzso In this review, I will discuss roles of zzso and zzso in zzso of energy metabolism and in zzso zzso focusing on zzso insulin zzso
