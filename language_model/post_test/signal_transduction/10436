Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso has been reported to be activated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso which may have important implications for responsiveness to zzso targeted at zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been implicated recently in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso could affect alternative zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and associated zzso We investigated whether zzso modification of zzso affects zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso was predominantly activated by zzso via zzso in zzso lines zzso and zzso in association with zzso zzso of zzso by zzso In zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso was regulated by both zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and expression of zzso following zzso or transient zzso inhibited zzso zzso and cell proliferation and induced cell zzso in corresponding cell zzso zzso of zzso was found in about one-third of human zzso zzso making it a potentially relevant marker for zzso therapy in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso status can zzso affect zzso zzso by zzso and zzso through zzso or zzso in different zzso and response to zzso zzso zzso the potential factors and the regulatory pathways in zzso zzso has important implications for the development and selection of zzso targeted therapy in zzso
