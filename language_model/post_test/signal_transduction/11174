zzso zzso zzso and expressed sequence tag sequencing identified 29 plant genes which are zzso during the zzso stage of zzso establishment between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Eleven genes coding plant proteins with predicted functions in signal zzso transcription, and translation were investigated in more detail for their relation to early events of symbiotic zzso zzso profiling showed that the genes are activated not only from the zzso stage up to the fully established zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso but also when the zzso are not in direct cell zzso suggesting that zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso play zzso role in the induction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in roots of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not modified by zzso formation or zzso zzso zzso indicating that the signal zzso zzso is required for a successful zzso zzso zzso interaction leading to zzso zzso The symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso does not activate the 11 zzso which supposes early discrimination by plant roots between the microbial zzso
