The complement component 1, zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso expressed and zzso cellular protein involved in various biological zzso In order to further understand its biological functions, we conducted zzso analysis of its zzso in this zzso An improved sample preparation and mass zzso identification strategy was developed combining high-speed zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso liquid zzso Using this approach, we identified zzso interacting proteins and constructed a highly connected interacting network for zzso Moreover, we explored the interaction between zzso and protein zzso C zzso a key regulator of cell polarity and zzso The results indicated that zzso regulated the activity of protein zzso C zzso and modulated zzso cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso was required for breast cancer zzso in a severe combined zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso was observed to be zzso in breast cancer zzso and its expression level was closely linked with distant zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso was identified as a novel regulator of cancer zzso that may serve as a therapeutic target for breast cancer zzso
