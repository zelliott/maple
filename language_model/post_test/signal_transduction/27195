zzso zzso are sites of tight zzso to the underlying zzso zzso developed by cells in zzso They provided a structural link between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and are regions of signal zzso that relate to growth zzso The assembly of focal zzso is regulated by the zzso protein zzso zzso stimulates zzso which, in cells that are tightly adherent to the zzso generates zzso zzso In turn, this leads to the bundling of zzso filaments and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plane of the zzso The zzso of zzso activates the focal zzso zzso and leads to the assembly of a zzso signaling zzso
