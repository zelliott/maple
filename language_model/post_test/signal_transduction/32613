Acute zzso leukemia zzso is still associated with a mortality of 60 to zzso zzso is characterized by a block in zzso zzso The zzso factors zzso and zzso are responsible for normal zzso differentiation from stem cells to zzso or zzso In particular, zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and the development of zzso whereas zzso increases the expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and leads to mature zzso In zzso zzso aberrations result in zzso such as zzso zzso or activated zzso which can zzso genes important for normal zzso Thus, zzso can bind to the zzso factor zzso inhibit zzso transcription, and block zzso zzso However, zzso can also zzso with the zzso factor zzso to enhance the activity of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso fusion protein causes zzso repression by recruiting the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso complex to the DNA, which results in decreased zzso zzso and a repressive zzso zzso Here we describe methods to investigate whether and how signaling zzso induce zzso differentiation and how zzso might cause zzso by modulating the activity of zzso factors that are pivotal for normal zzso zzso
