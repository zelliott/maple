This study is to explore whether the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the process of zzso zzso protecting against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured cortical zzso were used for the experiments on day 6 or zzso The zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso was applied to induce zzso zzso Prior to treatment with zzso for 24 zzso the cultured zzso were zzso with T4 zzso 10, and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso for indicated zzso Then the cell zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso The result demonstrated that zzso zzso induced zzso zzso cell death in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso with T4 significantly increased the zzso cell survival and attenuated zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso Additionally, T4 stabilized zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso protects against the zzso of zzso by regulating zzso signaling zzso This may provide insight into the clinical application of zzso to Alzheimer's zzso
