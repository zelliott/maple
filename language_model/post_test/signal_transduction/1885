The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso major zzso complex zzso recognition by normal mature T cells was zzso zzso of the target zzso molecules by T cells induced zzso of the zzso without obvious enhancement of the background zzso zzso There was no sign of enhancement of zzso through putative zzso zzso zzso class II zzso interactions zzso As has been reported, zzso of zzso molecules by zzso induced a marked enhancement of zzso zzso However, it did not have an immediate relevance to zzso signal zzso as judged from the lack of zzso de zzso zzso of zzso and the absence of functional responses of T zzso These results strongly zzso the model in which zzso signal zzso does not involve zzso enhancement of zzso suggesting that the signal can be triggered simply by the recruitment of already active zzso with zzso zzso activity through the formation of a zzso zzso zzso
