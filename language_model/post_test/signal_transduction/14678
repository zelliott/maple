The dramatic increase in the zzso and poor overall survival rates of zzso junction zzso underscore the necessity to discover molecular markers that can be used for risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapeutic zzso Barrett's esophagus zzso is proposed to represent a precursor of zzso junction zzso BE progression to invasive cancer is defined by a zzso progression characterized by an increasing zzso of genetic changes associated with zzso in molecular zzso of cell zzso and tissue zzso Using a combination of in zzso zzso and zzso zzso we investigated zzso of zzso regulators and zzso molecular zzso Our data suggest a potential synergistic effect of these zzso for the BE progression to cancer, and underscore the potential use of these zzso zzso in molecular panels assessing cancer risk in BE zzso and zzso as potential therapeutic targets for zzso interventions and to enhance response to zzso zzso
