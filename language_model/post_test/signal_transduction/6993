Broad zzso zzso signaling is required for patterned induction of hair zzso zzso and subsequent zzso signaling in zzso stem cells is essential for induction of zzso zzso cell clusters of precursors for the hair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of hair zzso formation then requires coordinated signal exchange between zzso zzso and zzso stem zzso However, it remains unknown whether continued zzso signaling in zzso precursor cells plays a role in this process, largely due to the long-standing inability to specifically target zzso zzso for gene zzso Here we use the zzso zzso mouse line to zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso specifically in these cells at zzso during the first wave of guard hair zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso signaling is effectively abolished in these zzso zzso zzso zzso initiate zzso however by zzso guard hair zzso numbers are strongly reduced and by zzso most whiskers and guard hair zzso are zzso suggesting that active zzso signaling in zzso zzso is important for hair zzso formation to proceed after zzso To explore the molecular mechanisms by which zzso signaling in zzso zzso regulates hair zzso formation, we analyze zzso the gene expression changes in embryonic zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso We find altered expression of several signaling zzso zzso including zzso and zzso both previously implicated in hair zzso zzso In zzso these data reveal a functional role of zzso signaling in zzso precursors for embryonic hair zzso formation and identify zzso and zzso signaling as potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso
