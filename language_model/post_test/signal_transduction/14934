The effects of zzso zzso zzso channel zzso on cardiac zzso zzso currents were zzso zzso currents in rat zzso zzso were recorded using the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso induced an outward current at 0 zzso Both zzso and zzso failed to induce any current when used zzso or after zzso in the bath and zzso solutions was replaced by zzso zzso zzso pulse protocols revealed that zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso zzso current but inhibited the transient outward zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso outward zzso Another zzso zzso zzso A, produced a comparable zzso In contrast, the inactive analogue of zzso zzso was zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso markedly slowed the zzso of the outward current induced by zzso and zzso The protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso outward current at 0 zzso In contrast, the protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso was without significant effect on the action of zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso or zzso prevented the enhancing effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso from 22 to 132 zzso slightly reduced zzso outward current at 0 zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso enhance cardiac zzso zzso zzso and suggest that the enhancing effect of the zzso channel zzso is zzso by stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
