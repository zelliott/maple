zzso receptors of the zzso family promote zzso zzso The signal zzso of zzso receptors is regulated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an established signal for sorting of zzso receptors to late zzso The zzso zzso zzso is sorted to late zzso and zzso zzso indicating a so far undefined regulatory role of zzso activity in the trafficking of zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso zzso alters the trafficking of zzso from the late zzso sorting zzso to the recycling zzso Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with impaired zzso zzso Thus, our study suggests that zzso of zzso receptors might contribute to zzso death in those neurodegenerative diseases that are known to be associated with impaired zzso zzso
