We determined whether blockade of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso by oral administration of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso human prostate cancer cells in the bone of nude zzso 

Male nude mice implanted with zzso cells in the zzso were treated with oral administrations of zzso 166 or zzso 166 plus zzso zzso beginning 3 days after zzso The zzso and size of bone tumors and destruction of bone were determined by zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and activated zzso in tumor cells and zzso zzso cells was determined by zzso 

zzso administration of zzso 166 or zzso 166 plus zzso zzso reduced the zzso and size of bone tumors and destruction of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso cells growing adjacent to the bone expressed high levels of zzso and activated zzso whereas tumor cells in the adjacent zzso did zzso Moreover, zzso cells within the bone tumor zzso but not in zzso bone or tumors in the muscle, expressed high levels of activated zzso Treatment with zzso 166 and more so with zzso 166 plus zzso significantly inhibited zzso of zzso on tumor and zzso cells and induced significant zzso and zzso cells within tumor zzso 

These data indicate that zzso cells exposed to zzso produced by tumor cells express activated zzso and that targeting zzso can produce significant therapeutic effects against prostate cancer bone zzso
