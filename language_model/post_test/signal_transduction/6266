Recently, we showed that zzso transforming growth factor alpha zzso controls the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso in highly progressed zzso colon cancer zzso We also reported that the expression of zzso zzso zzso and its biological effects are critically controlled by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sharma, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present report, we further examine the downstream signaling mechanisms underlying zzso signaling and zzso zzso function in zzso zzso Selective zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso specifically at zzso indicating that this zzso site is downstream of zzso zzso zzso were treated with the selective protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso sites of zzso were specifically inhibited by zzso which also blocked zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso These data establish a novel cell zzso function of zzso via zzso zzso in a cancer zzso In addition, we examined whether zzso target of zzso signaling controls zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso specifically at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The assignment of these zzso sites on zzso to biological functions was unequivocally confirmed by zzso of cells with specific single zzso site dominant negative zzso These experiments show for the first time that zzso zzso regulates cell zzso function by multiple signaling pathways via specific zzso sites of zzso in cancer zzso
