zzso of zzso zzso is an essential step in triggering the zzso zzso pathway, which fulfills a diverse set of roles during development and tissue zzso We describe a mechanism of zzso processing which is unique to insects, and possibly to other zzso This mechanism relies on zzso precursor trafficking from the zzso by a zzso Star zzso and precursor zzso by zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to cleave S as well, zzso the zzso with additional zzso zzso zzso which also reside in the zzso zzso the zzso before any zzso was zzso thus significantly reducing the level of zzso that will eventually be processed and zzso zzso zzso also serves as a critical feature in trafficking the entire zzso machinery to zzso zzso as the zzso extends throughout the zzso Finally, examination of diverse species of insects demonstrates the evolution of zzso zzso indicating that the primordial processing machinery could support long-range signaling by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of critical components of a zzso signaling cassette therefore provides an evolutionary mechanism for zzso of signaling levels, and diversification of the biological settings where the zzso zzso
