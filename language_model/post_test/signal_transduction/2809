Although the zzso of zzso compounds is generally attributed to zzso of zzso recent reports have indicated that direct interactions with zzso receptors and signal zzso may be an additional mechanism of zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso We have further pursued those results in this study by investigating the effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso for human zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding in all cell zzso Likewise, zzso binding was inhibited in zzso and zzso zzso When the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso was zzso the zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso at zzso zzso Though this effect on zzso required greater zzso of zzso than the comparable effect in zzso cells, it displayed the common characteristic of being zzso suggesting that the effect on zzso was not zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso was not eliminated in zzso toxin treated cells, lending further support to the idea that it is not a zzso event, and suggesting a potential direct interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
