zzso binding to zzso is a necessary prerequisite for zzso zzso through zzso This is zzso by the binding of zzso on zzso cells to zzso surface zzso zzso We show in this paper that the zzso second zzso pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso cells are protein zzso C and calcium zzso zzso binding to zzso cells is enhanced by both zzso zzso factor and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso factor added to zzso cultures increases zzso binding within 10 zzso and operates via protein zzso C but not via zzso On the other hand zzso 1 alpha increases binding within 4 zzso and operates via zzso but not via protein zzso zzso These results imply that different zzso of inflammation can activate different signal zzso pathways but lead to similar increases in zzso zzso
