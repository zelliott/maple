zzso signaling is a key regulator of development zzso often associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be a survival factor in wing zzso zzso However, we found that prospective wing cells survive in the absence of zzso as long as they are not surrounded by zzso zzso Moreover, local autonomous zzso of zzso signaling (as a result of a zzso in zzso or zzso leads to the elimination of surrounding normal zzso zzso relative differences in zzso signaling lead to competitive cell zzso This process does not involve zzso a well-established cell competition zzso It does, however, require zzso a zzso zzso feedback inhibitor of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso could amplify local differences in zzso zzso thus serving as an early trigger of zzso zzso zzso
