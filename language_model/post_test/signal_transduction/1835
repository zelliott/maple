The balance between positive and negative signals plays a key role in determining T cell zzso zzso zzso is a surface zzso that can inhibit T cell responses induced upon stimulation of the zzso and its zzso zzso Little is known regarding the signaling mechanisms zzso by zzso In this study we analyzed zzso zzso of zzso signaling in primary resting human zzso T cells displaying low, but zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso with the zzso resulted in reduced downstream protein zzso zzso of signaling zzso and a striking zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso Analysis of zzso zzso signaling revealed that zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso protein of 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment were not significantly affected by zzso zzso However, the association of zzso with zzso was inhibited following zzso zzso zzso with reduced actions of zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso caused the selective zzso of zzso zzso of the positive regulatory zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate protein zzso zzso activity associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso activity was attributed to zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso 1, a protein zzso zzso that has been shown to be a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso can act early during the immune response to regulate the threshold of T cell zzso
