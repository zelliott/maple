zzso zzso play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and may be involved in cerebral zzso after zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso for zzso and their mechanisms of zzso zzso in cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso smooth muscle cells were isolated by an zzso zzso zzso response, a large transient peak followed by a slowly zzso zzso The potency of zzso to raise zzso was zzso gamma S zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso indicating that zzso receptors were expressed in the rat zzso smooth muscle zzso The effect of zzso to release zzso from internal stores was reduced by zzso zzso by the zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso and by the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso entry induced by zzso was partially attenuated by the zzso zzso channel blocker zzso and by the zzso zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, at higher zzso zzso acid reduced the effect of zzso 

The results are the first demonstration that zzso activate G zzso zzso receptors to mobilize zzso in rat zzso smooth muscle zzso
