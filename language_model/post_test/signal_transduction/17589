zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein belonging to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso models based on zzso criteria assign portions of the zzso chains to the zzso zzso zzso From an experimental point of view, however, the relationship between the two zzso remains largely zzso Current studies from our laboratory are aimed at defining the zzso zzso and functional relationship between membrane lipids and zzso We are particularly interested in establishing the characteristics of and differences between the lipids in each leaflet of the zzso and the belt or zzso lipids immediately surrounding zzso and the bulk zzso zzso We are also interested in determining the possible implications of zzso modifications on zzso channel zzso Toward these ends, zzso and other zzso techniques, together with zzso analyses and zzso studies, are currently being zzso zzso can be established between structural aspects of zzso packing in the immediate perimeter of zzso and other properties of these zzso lipids revealed by dynamic zzso and molecular modeling zzso zzso compositional analyses of the zzso muscle cell line zzso and chemical modification studies have been carried out by incubation of intact cells in culture and of membrane patches excised zzso with zzso of different zzso zzso These studies have been combined with zzso zzso using the zzso technique, with the aim of determining the possible effects of lipids on the channel properties of zzso zzso A variety of experimental conditions, involving polar head and fatty zzso chain substitution of zzso and cholesterol zzso are being zzso in the zzso zzso
