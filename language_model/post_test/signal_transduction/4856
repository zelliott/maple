To zzso the recent progress in related research on transforming growth factor zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and post-traumatic zzso zzso 

Recent related literature at home and abroad on zzso signal zzso zzso and post-traumatic zzso formation was reviewed and zzso 

zzso is an important influence factor of zzso diseases, and it plays biological effects by zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso is regulated by many factors and has zzso with other signal pathways at cellular and molecular zzso The zzso is involved in the early post-traumatic inflammatory response, wound healing, and late pathological zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso at the molecular level can influence the process of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signal zzso zzso is an important way to affect post-traumatic zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso The further study on the zzso will provide a theoretical basis for promotion of wound healing, as well as prevention and treatment of pathological zzso zzso
