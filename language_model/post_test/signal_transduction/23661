The zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso receptors zzso an zzso signal zzso cascade that influences various aspects of plant growth and zzso Even though the major components of zzso signaling have been revealed and the PM was identified as the main site of zzso signaling activity, the very first steps of signal transmission are still zzso Recently, it was shown that the initiation of zzso signal zzso requires the interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the resolved structure of the zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso may constitute a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the spatial correlation between zzso and zzso in the natural habitat of both zzso repeat zzso zzso using comparative zzso analysis and zzso lifetime imaging zzso We show that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso application resulted in both elevated zzso between zzso and zzso and an about 50% increase of zzso zzso in the PM of live zzso root zzso zzso However, large populations of zzso and zzso zzso independently of zzso Moreover, we could zzso that approximately zzso of the zzso PM pool zzso zzso with zzso in live root zzso We propose that only small populations of zzso zzso and zzso receptors participate in active zzso signaling and that the initiation of downstream signal zzso involves zzso zzso zzso
