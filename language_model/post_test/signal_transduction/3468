T helper zzso 17 cells produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso along with zzso which stimulates zzso zzso cells to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso which functions as a zzso and a zzso barrier between zzso contents and zzso zzso The gene zzso has been associated with zzso to inflammatory zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in development of colitis in zzso 

zzso and zzso were disrupted in mice zzso double knockout zzso zzso colitis was induced by intravenous injection of zzso T zzso We also studied zzso colitis using mice with disruptions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain zzso double knockout zzso 

zzso zzso led to the development of more severe forms of zzso and zzso colitis than zzso Loss of zzso increased zzso zzso and the zzso but not zzso or zzso cell, response in the inflamed zzso Loss of zzso also promoted expansion of an innate zzso cell population zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces zzso The expansion of zzso zzso immune cells and innate zzso cells required the zzso zzso 

zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso functions in a negative feedback zzso that prevents an excessive zzso cell response in inflamed zzso of zzso zzso of this negative feedback pathway, perhaps by zzso in zzso might contribute to inflammatory zzso disease in zzso
