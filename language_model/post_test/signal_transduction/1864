The zzso activity of zzso zzso as compared to zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso It was found that in this model system zzso is much more active in the stimulation of zzso than zzso zzso zzso of growth and external pH indicated that administration of either zzso or zzso resulted in medium zzso The zzso of the pH changes, however, were faster after the addition of zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso segments treated with zzso zzso were not able to increase medium pH after its initial zzso The zzso of zzso after 5 h further enhanced growth over the next 2 h by zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso at the same time protocol as zzso did not cause an additional zzso The administration of 10 zzso zzso induced in zzso zzso cells a transient zzso followed by a slow zzso of their membrane zzso In contrast to zzso zzso at 1 zzso caused an immediate zzso of the membrane potential which, on average, was zzso greater than for zzso The results reported here provide further evidence that zzso is much more active, as compared to zzso in stimulating the growth of zzso zzso zzso Although it has not been directly demonstrated here, a plausible interpretation for the high zzso activity is that, at least in part, it might be caused via a reduced metabolism of zzso Furthermore, for the first time, the data show that membrane potential responds to zzso in a zzso different fashion than to zzso These findings may, in turn, suggest a specific signal zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso
