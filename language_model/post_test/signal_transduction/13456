The zzso lipids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid play an important role in zzso as a result of their effects on both the migration of zzso cells zzso and the integrity of zzso zzso Here we show that extremely low zzso of serum and zzso zzso of these biologically active lipids stimulate migration of human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso However, at zzso most effective in promoting zzso migration and in enhancing zzso zzso integrity, serum and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso also blocked the migration induced by protein growth zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso induced transient zzso of a zzso to zzso protein corresponding to the zzso zzso indicating zzso of this zzso zzso and related lipids may play a key role in zzso by zzso the migration of both zzso cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in response to the changing zzso of these zzso zzso zzso
