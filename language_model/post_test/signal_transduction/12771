The zzso on the calf zzso zzso of the binding domain for zzso (an zzso zzso which prevents and reverses the effects of zzso zzso has been studied by means of controlled zzso of the zzso complex using zzso zzso and zzso We successively determined for intact and zzso zzso complex zzso the abilities of zzso species to zzso in low salt zzso to bind to zzso DNA absorbed onto zzso and to interact with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso species, by gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in high salt media and zzso the molecular weights of zzso species, by zzso zzso Three zzso zzso fragments of Mr zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso fragments of Mr 36,000 and zzso included both the zzso and zzso zzso but did not interact with DNA, whereas at least two zzso fragments resulting from the action of zzso and zzso bound zzso with high affinity but zzso neither with DNA nor with zzso Taking into account these results and assuming that structure of the calf zzso zzso is similar to those of zzso zzso receptors (which show a highly zzso organization with considerable zzso in the functional zzso we propose that the zzso domain is located either between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso I) or at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The regions that include the main zzso zzso sites of the zzso are also zzso and the abilities of the two models of the calf zzso zzso to account for the effect of zzso on zzso zzso are zzso
