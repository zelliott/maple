zzso are zzso cells which sense inflammatory stimuli and subsequently migrate to sites of zzso Key players in host defense, zzso have nevertheless been implicated as requisite zzso of several chronic inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso is therefore an attractive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are native regulators of zzso yet their direct effect on zzso zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the direct effect of natural and synthetic zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso various zzso using in zzso zzso zzso we found that the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso can decrease zzso zzso by zzso while other tested zzso had no zzso We generated a library of synthetic zzso designated zzso which was screened for zzso zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso exhibited up to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the effect of zzso was not restricted to a specific zzso zzso or zzso and resulted from zzso of signaling pathways required for zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso or zzso and had no effect on zzso of zzso zzso or zzso In zzso oral treatment with zzso reduced zzso migration in a zzso model and inhibited zzso development in zzso mice, without affecting cholesterol or zzso zzso Our findings highlight a novel role played by native and synthetic zzso in regulation of zzso zzso The data strengthen the involvement of zzso as key signaling molecules in inflammatory settings and demonstrate their potential therapeutic zzso
