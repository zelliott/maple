zzso zzso relationships zzso of the plasma membrane of human zzso were studied at the zzso temperature of 37 degrees C by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a characteristic zzso shape with a negative resistance region zzso in a zzso range of zzso to zzso zzso The majority of cells zzso revealed zzso patterns crossing the zzso at three points (in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso V2 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso also displayed zzso but crossed the zzso at one point only zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso It implies the possibility of two stable levels of membrane potential zzso and zzso for the resting zzso but only one zzso for activated zzso These data thus account for the triggering property of zzso membrane potential previously zzso The zzso can be explained on the basis of the zzso type zzso model of zzso channel zzso According to the model the possibility for a membrane to have one or two stable levels of membrane potential depends on the ratio of selective zzso zzso to zzso leaky zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso in resting zzso proved to be sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso from either external or internal solution resulted in an appreciable increase in zzso zzso The possibility for membrane potential to have two stable levels of membrane potential in connection with the zzso dependence of zzso zzso was supposed to be important for zzso during zzso zzso
