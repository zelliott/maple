zzso is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing zzso zzso and insufficient zzso have been associated with many diseases including cancer, age-related zzso zzso zzso heart, brain, and skeletal muscle zzso A comprehensive understanding of zzso regulatory processes is needed to improve treatment of these zzso To identify proteins related to zzso we developed a novel zzso framework for diverse sources of zzso zzso The system, called zzso was used to expand on known zzso pathways to construct the zzso a zzso interaction network for zzso The network consists of zzso proteins and zzso zzso The network was validated through cross validation and analysis of five gene expression zzso from in zzso zzso zzso We calculated the zzso properties of the zzso We analyzed the functional enrichment of zzso and associated zzso We also constructed an extended zzso with zzso proteins and zzso interactions to derive a more complete map of zzso interactions in zzso Finally, the extended zzso was used to identify growth factor signaling networks that drive zzso and zzso signaling zzso The results of this analysis can be used to identify genes and proteins in different disease conditions and putative targets for therapeutic interventions as zzso candidates for experimental zzso
