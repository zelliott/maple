The effect of the alpha zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso release in rat zzso slices was studied in the presence or absence zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso overflow zzso mainly of zzso zzso was evoked by addition of 100 zzso zzso for 10 zzso to the zzso which always contained 1 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso channels zzso did not affect the evoked zzso release, whereas the preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso both in the presence and even more zzso in the absence of zzso suggesting an involvement of zzso zzso in the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the initial zzso influx, which has been previously proposed to liberate zzso from zzso stores for the zzso process, most probably occurs via zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso release in a zzso manner, both in the presence and even more zzso in the absence of zzso its effects were antagonized by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the zzso effect was not changed by addition of zzso Similar effects of zzso were found in slices from the rabbit zzso Since the availability of zzso from zzso stores seems to predominate in the present model, our results lend some support to the suggestion that alpha zzso zzso might affect zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
