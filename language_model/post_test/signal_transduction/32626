A point zzso was made at position zzso in the zzso segment 7 of the human zzso zzso zzso to yield a zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso both bound zzso A zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with high and even zzso zzso B zzso and substance P zzso also displayed zzso binding zzso albeit with lower affinity as compared to zzso In a functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso and zzso receptors with similar zzso On the other hand, zzso and SP exhibited a dramatic reduction in their zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso acting as a partial zzso zzso effect zzso 50% of the response to zzso and SP being totally zzso The results obtained with zzso zzso experiments indicated that a large and similar zzso reserve existed for both the zzso and the zzso zzso SP, which displayed zzso binding affinity for the zzso zzso but did not stimulate zzso zzso antagonized the zzso effect of zzso The zzso action of SP at the zzso zzso zzso cannot be ascribed to zzso zzso The zzso replacement at position zzso markedly reduced the binding affinity and zzso potency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting the binding affinity and zzso potency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso radical function of zzso in zzso segment 7 of the human zzso zzso is, directly or zzso involved in stimulus zzso when the zzso zzso is occupied by zzso or SP, but not when using zzso or zzso zzso zzso
