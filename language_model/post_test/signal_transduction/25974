The present study was conducted to evaluate the mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso finger 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso After treatment with zzso 300 or 600 zzso acid zzso or zzso for 24 h in zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso zzso and total zzso were measured by Western zzso Compared with the bovine serum zzso zzso control, 150 and 300 zzso and zzso respectively, did not affect the total zzso protein level zzso However, 600 zzso but not 600 zzso prevented zzso zzso and increased the total zzso levels zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, total nuclear protein was isolated and zzso by the zzso mobility shift zzso for zzso zzso activity after treatment with 600 zzso or zzso for 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso activity when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso It was further observed that 600 zzso caused a zzso reduction in the levels of zzso zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 600 zzso resulted in a zzso induction of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso interference significantly decreased zzso zzso and protein expression to approximately 50 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso with zzso zzso 600 zzso and zzso did not affect the levels of zzso and total zzso zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso expression when compared with zzso zzso These results revealed that zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
