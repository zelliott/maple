zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso development, and life zzso This signaling zzso zzso regulates the activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso encodes multiple zzso that are expressed in distinct tissue types and are probable zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso We show that human zzso can partially replace zzso proving the zzso In zzso cells, insulin and zzso growth factor signaling activate zzso zzso to zzso regulate the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso We show that the absence of zzso consensus sites on zzso is sufficient to cause zzso arrest in zzso animals, proving that zzso is the major output of insulin signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may similarly be the major zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso insulin zzso via zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso by controlling its nuclear zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso zzso signaling also regulates zzso nuclear zzso specifically at the time when the animal makes the commitment between zzso and zzso zzso zzso function is supported by the combined action of two distinct zzso zzso whereas the coding sequences of two major zzso zzso are zzso Together, these observations suggest that the combined effects of zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso and perhaps more zzso
