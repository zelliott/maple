Treatment of patients with zzso melanoma with zzso achieves a response in a small but significant subset of zzso Currently, although much is known about zzso biology, little is known about either the particular mechanisms of zzso activity that are crucial for response or why only some patients respond to zzso zzso Two melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso that are known to differ in their response to the zzso activity of zzso have been used as a model system to investigate zzso zzso Using a zzso approach based on two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and mass zzso several proteins induced in response to zzso have been zzso These include a number of gene products previously known to be type I zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein 2 and zzso as well as a number of proteins not previously reported to be induced by type I zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although the proteins zzso by zzso were common between the cell lines when examined at the level of Western zzso the disparity in the zzso level of zzso B was striking, raising the possibility that the higher level in zzso may contribute to the sensitivity of this cell line to zzso zzso
