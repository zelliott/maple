Maintaining a zzso body plan requires the adjustment or zzso of organ pattern with organ zzso Scaling is a general property of zzso systems, yet little is known about its underlying molecular zzso Using theoretical zzso we examine how the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso wing zzso disc scales with disc zzso We predict that zzso is achieved through an zzso mechanism zzso whose zzso is the widely zzso protein zzso zzso Central to this mechanism is the repression of zzso expression by zzso zzso which provides an effective size zzso and the zzso expansion of the zzso zzso which adjusts the zzso with tissue zzso We validate this mechanism zzso by demonstrating that zzso requires zzso and further, that zzso is abolished when zzso is zzso zzso The zzso circuit can be readily implemented by a variety of molecular zzso suggesting its general zzso for zzso zzso zzso during zzso
