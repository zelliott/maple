The majority of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and grow in response to zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we report that known zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso activities in zzso cancer cells via their ability to activate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso both cell proliferation and induction of zzso zzso and protein in a manner comparable to zzso The effects were completely attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealing that observed activities of these agents were zzso In cell proliferation zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso targeting zzso and restored upon addition of zzso zzso Furthermore, an inhibitor to the zzso zzso zzso completely attenuated zzso effects of zzso and zzso These studies highlight a potential role of zzso possessing zzso activities in the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest that the zzso signaling axis may represent a promising target for development of zzso for zzso zzso zzso
