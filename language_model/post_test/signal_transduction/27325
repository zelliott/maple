zzso zzso of zzso from zzso 25 to 34 were zzso in human zzso zzso with a pre-existing zzso zzso zzso zzso and built into zzso expression zzso The influence of the introduced zzso was initially screened by zzso of zzso cells to score zzso of transformed zzso zzso zzso of zzso 25 zzso for zzso 27 zzso for zzso and 34 zzso for zzso did not abrogate the transforming potential of zzso The conservative zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was also still zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso transforming while, in contrast, zzso was unable to transform zzso cells and retarded cell zzso Analysis of the binding and zzso of zzso and zzso to normal and zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli showed that zzso and zzso do not bind zzso The zzso rate of both zzso and zzso bound to zzso is increased, suggesting a mechanism for its transforming potential in zzso zzso These studies illustrate the importance of zzso in zzso zzso binding by zzso The zzso described could be valuable tools in investigations of cellular signal zzso involving small zzso zzso
