zzso growth factor and its zzso (the product of the zzso zzso are believed to be necessary for the normal growth and development of many zzso and zzso This zzso system controls essential cellular responses such as cell proliferation and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed primarily in zzso but not in zzso cells while its zzso is predominately expressed in zzso zzso This pattern of zzso and zzso gene expression in combination with the unique biological effects of zzso on its target cells has led to the zzso that zzso is one of the zzso zzso conveying zzso between the zzso and zzso compartments of a given zzso The expression of zzso and zzso genes are zzso in several types of human zzso therefore, understanding the control mechanisms governing zzso and zzso gene expression is of great clinical zzso Toward this goal, we have analyzed the effects of various zzso agents such as zzso and hormones on the expression of zzso and the zzso in a multitude of cell types in zzso Moreover, we have cloned and analyzed the zzso promoter and its zzso region to uncover the basis for its zzso and zzso specific expression at the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso gene expression is zzso and their expression is orchestrated in zzso and zzso cells, respectively, by zzso signals derived from steroid hormones as well as zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
