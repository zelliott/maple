Traditionally, methods designed to impair translation through direct interactions with target zzso zzso zzso have been designated as zzso strategies because of their reliance on the formation of reverse complementary zzso zzso base pairs between the targeting zzso zzso and the zzso whose function is to be zzso Proof of putative zzso zzso and other zzso studies, would be greatly facilitated by the ability to directly demonstrate zzso between an zzso zzso zzso and its zzso target in zzso In addition, evidence of AS activity by demonstrating reduced levels of zzso or protein or by showing zzso target molecules would lend proof of the zzso In this article we discuss how AS zzso may be used to zzso target gene expression with an emphasis on those targets chosen for our zzso and we zzso the methods employed for this type of zzso
