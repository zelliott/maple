Despite advances in the treatment of acute tissue zzso significant challenges remain in effective zzso from zzso cell zzso It has been documented that injected stem cells, such as zzso stem cells zzso can zzso protection to zzso tissue through the release of zzso zzso The study of these factors is essential for understanding tissue repair and the development of new therapeutic approaches for zzso zzso We have recently shown that a novel factor zzso by zzso which we called zzso zzso and zzso induced Stem cell zzso promotes zzso zzso In this study we show that zzso has a zzso effect on zzso induced zzso zzso We assessed whether zzso could potentially be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the damage associated with zzso zzso In zzso treatment of zzso with zzso protein resulted in decreased zzso zzso positive zzso were fewer in number, and zzso zzso and zzso pore opening were zzso zzso zzso protein was injected into the heart immediately following zzso zzso Heart function was found to be comparable to sham operated animals one month following injury and zzso was significantly zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso activated protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked the zzso effect on zzso Furthermore, the beneficial effects of zzso were lost in mice lacking zzso zzso these results identify zzso as a protein of significant therapeutic potential, acting in part through zzso
