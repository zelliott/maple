zzso has been shown to regulate the zzso zzso acting primarily through the zzso zzso triggered through the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that although zzso rats presented zzso effects on zzso zzso those effects were abolished in zzso zzso We addressed the hypothesis that changes in the zzso zzso might explain the lack of zzso response to zzso in zzso by evaluating the protein content of components of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the drinking zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5 zzso g body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein in the zzso and in the zzso zzso they exhibited decreased zzso total zzso zzso and zzso zzso Except for a modest decrease in zzso zzso no other zzso were observed in zzso zzso Moreover, unlike zzso rats, the zzso rats did not exhibit a reduction in food zzso after a single injection of zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso which likely contributes to the loss of zzso action on food intake and zzso zzso as previously observed in zzso zzso
