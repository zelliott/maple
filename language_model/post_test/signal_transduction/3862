To examine zzso zzso for its ability to zzso zzso calcium in bovine zzso zzso zzso to establish and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated and cultured until zzso The cells were zzso on sterile zzso and grown to obtain zzso then loaded with zzso Fluorescence was measured by a computer-controlled zzso and values calculated for zzso calcium zzso zzso its zzso and other drugs were tested for their ability to zzso zzso calcium by adding them to the bathing zzso 

zzso zzso calcium in bovine zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso induced a transient zzso increase in zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso which declined zzso The zzso potency order was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective in zzso zzso zzso as were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The response to zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso calcium or the presence of zzso zzso of the calcium response by repeated exposure to zzso was zzso by zzso and abolished by zzso The zzso response was abolished by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso on single cells established that both pigmented and zzso zzso responded to zzso or zzso zzso 

In the bovine zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso receptors coupled to a zzso zzso G zzso The results also suggest that this zzso activates zzso C, leading to zzso of calcium from zzso zzso
