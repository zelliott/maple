zzso zzso is a zzso that plays a crucial role in the zzso of asthma and allergic zzso zzso gene expression is largely zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso that is activated independently of zzso zzso zzso carries two zzso acid changes in the zzso domain that affect the overall structure and stability of the zzso and zzso zzso When zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso binds DNA, and activates zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso line zzso we demonstrate that zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso that is not able to activate the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that small changes in zzso could result in zzso of the protein and zzso expression of zzso zzso Such a zzso if found in zzso could cause genetic predisposition for zzso zzso
