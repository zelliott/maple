The mechanism for zzso zzso response zzso in zzso cells is presented in this zzso The start point of the zzso in the frame of this mechanism is the receptors for growth factors zzso due to the increase in the zzso of plasma membrane subjected to zzso zzso There are components of the zzso signal zzso zzso which take part in the subsequent zzso The main of them are protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso They make zzso modification of the DNA metabolism zzso and of the zzso factors zzso and zzso There are genes taking part in the zzso repair and zzso among the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be direct participants at the stage of zzso repair when DNA damage is zzso Thus, the proposed scheme of events removes the contradiction between two hypotheses which explain the zzso zzso DNA repair zzso either of cell selection in culture of zzso zzso
