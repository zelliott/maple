zzso of zzso by zzso zzso is primarily zzso by the zzso zzso through the zzso of a specific G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also released in response to zzso a zzso produced in the stomach, zzso and zzso that activates zzso via a distinct G zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the expression of both zzso and zzso (by multiplex zzso in zzso zzso cell cultures, after acute (4 zzso treatment with zzso or zzso as well as with other regulators of zzso zzso zzso Exposure of cultures to zzso decreased zzso zzso content and also diminished zzso transcript zzso Likewise, zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, administration of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels but had no effect on zzso thus suggesting a distinct contribution of the various zzso signals operating in zzso to the regulation of the expression of these zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the pig zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso which also suppressed zzso zzso levels without altering zzso zzso Finally, zzso did not modify zzso or zzso zzso In zzso our data show for the first time that zzso as well as zzso mediates zzso and zzso zzso of their own zzso zzso However, our results also indicate that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso is regulated by distinct signals that may differ from those reported in other zzso zzso
