The genes of the zzso family are defined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and play important roles in stem-cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation in various zzso Both, mouse and human zzso zzso members of the zzso gene family, are specifically expressed in zzso We report here enhanced expression of the human zzso gene in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was also found in different tumors zzso including zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso cancer of human and in breast tumors, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be zzso as a novel member of zzso zzso To identify genes activated by zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells expressing zzso zzso were compared with zzso samples from control zzso cells using a cancer gene zzso zzso of high-level expression of the zzso gene zzso was observed in cells expressing zzso Furthermore, increased zzso expression correlated with increase of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso Gene zzso of zzso with its small interference zzso suppressed zzso and zzso expression and induced zzso A zzso link between zzso expression and zzso of zzso and enhanced proliferation was demonstrated in cells expressing zzso Furthermore, results of soft zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso induced transformation of zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that zzso is widely expressed in tumors and acts as an zzso by zzso of zzso and promotion of proliferation via zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso in a wide variety of tumors could be a useful zzso factor that could have also diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
