The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a large family of zzso zzso proteins predominantly expressed in the nervous zzso These proteins contain six zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso by the zzso complex releases their zzso zzso into the zzso where they may function locally and/or enter the nucleus and affect gene zzso Thus, zzso of zzso may function to link zzso contacts and zzso zzso Here we report that shedding of the zzso zzso domain and subsequent processing by zzso require zzso and that zzso interact with the regulator of zzso sorting zzso in zzso zzso We also find that the zzso of zzso zzso products is regulated during zzso zzso leads to an increase in the interactions between zzso proteins and a decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso processing requires zzso and that the level of zzso products is regulated during zzso zzso
