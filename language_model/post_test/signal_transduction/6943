The relevance of tumor zzso for the development and progression of tumor cells in zzso zzso has been extensively zzso Identification of factors involved in the information exchange between the zzso cells and the bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso and the knowledge on their functioning may provide important information to eliminate zzso cells from protective zzso zzso We evaluated changes in zzso obtained from children with acute zzso leukemia zzso at different times in the course of zzso Whereas zzso did not exhibit zzso changes compared to zzso zzso isolated from healthy donors, they exhibited increased zzso zzso In addition, the viability of healthy zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced when zzso with zzso zzso grow less zzso although gradually recover normal growth with zzso zzso proliferation is particularly low in zzso obtained at diagnosis and in the first days of treatment zzso zzso recovering to control levels after 35 days of zzso zzso these results with bone zzso protein 4 zzso production, a zzso demonstrated to affect zzso biology, we found higher production of zzso in zzso derived from patients over the course of disease but not in those free of zzso However, no significant differences in the expression of different members of the zzso signaling zzso were zzso Furthermore, an inverse correlation between high levels of zzso production in the cultures and zzso proliferation was found, as observed in zzso derived from patients at diagnosis that produce high zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso with the zzso leukemia cell line, but not zzso zzso zzso powerfully enhanced zzso production, suggesting an intimate zzso among zzso isolated from zzso zzso by ALL cells that presumably also occurs in zzso zzso Our data may support the participation of zzso in zzso zzso but the mechanism remains to be zzso
