Previous studies have demonstrated that some components of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are able to bind to zzso zzso Thus, it is of interest to know which zzso functions of these cells can be triggered by these receptors when they interact with particles or surfaces covered with zzso zzso In the present study we analyzed their possible role as zzso of zzso of red cells covered with zzso bovine serum zzso zzso by mouse zzso zzso We observed that a) zzso are able to recognize zzso to) these red cells, b) this interaction can be inhibited by zzso zzso in the fluid phase, c) there is no zzso of these particles by normal zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso can be, however, effectively triggered in inflammatory zzso induced by zzso or in zzso activated in zzso with zzso and zzso this zzso capacity is strongly dependent on the activity of zzso protein zzso in its signal zzso pathway, as demonstrated by using three kinds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
