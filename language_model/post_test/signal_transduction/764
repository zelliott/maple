zzso is the most common dye to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso To facilitate simultaneous imaging of many cells while preserving their zzso environment, zzso is often loaded into the zzso in its zzso zzso zzso It has been reported that small amounts of zzso accumulate in zzso zzso an effect that is usually zzso We show that either focal or zzso stimulation methods induce large zzso zzso in zzso during both, zzso release and zzso influx across the plasma zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and by labeling zzso with zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso with zzso and are attributable to zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be avoided by different loading zzso compromising zzso of zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso They were observed in human blood and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mast cells, but not to the same extent in zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso can be efficiently loaded with the zzso zzso salt by zzso and by zzso zzso of zzso zzso which result in the loss of zzso zzso These methods are therefore suitable to study localized zzso signals in large populations of zzso while preserving their zzso zzso
