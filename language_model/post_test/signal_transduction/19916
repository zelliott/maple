In the past, molecular mechanisms that drive the initiation of an inflammatory response have been studied zzso However, corresponding mechanisms that sustain the expression of inflammatory response genes and hence contribute to the establishment of chronic disorders remain poorly zzso Recently, we provided genetic evidence that signaling via the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso drives the strength and maintenance of an inflammatory zzso In order to decipher the mode of zzso function on gene zzso levels during zzso we applied global gene expression profiling on zzso samples of mouse back skin, which had been treated with the zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of skin zzso 

zzso of zzso genes according to their time average mean and peak expression and zzso of data sets from zzso zzso and zzso mice revealed that zzso signaling is not essential for initial changes in zzso transcription, but absolutely required for sustained zzso in transcript zzso Next, we used a data set of zzso expressed genes between zzso zzso and zzso skin and performed zzso analysis of their zzso promoter zzso We found a highly significant enrichment for several zzso factor binding sites zzso leading to the prediction that corresponding zzso factors, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso zzso zzso we could confirm zzso expression and regulation of members of the zzso protein family in zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

In zzso our data support the model that engagement of zzso converts a transient cellular stimulation into sustained cellular dysfunction and highlight a novel role of the zzso zzso in zzso inflammation during pathological zzso
