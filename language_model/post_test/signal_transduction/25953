zzso zzso damage resulting from zzso zzso is vital in ensuring patient recovery and zzso It relies upon the zzso of the so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various treatments, both mechanical and chemical, have been shown to protect the zzso against zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso preservation include zzso factors such as insulin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso products of white zzso zzso are important zzso hormones with respect to zzso control and zzso and were formerly considered in the context of obesity and zzso zzso More recently, however, evidence has been presented indicating that the zzso play significant roles in cardiac function and, as we have suggested, in zzso zzso To date zzso zzso zzso and zzso have all been shown to protect against zzso zzso zzso the protection afforded by these peptides involves the zzso of zzso which are key elements of the mechanisms underlying tissue preservation, including the RISK zzso components zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso transition pore zzso In this article we examine the roles played by the zzso in cardiovascular function and zzso In particular, we focus on the evidence that these peptides promote zzso survival, much of it having been obtained in this zzso To zzso we discuss some future directions in the field, including the prospects for some of the zzso finding application as therapeutic agents in zzso zzso
