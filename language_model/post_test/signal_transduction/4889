Although the zzso immune response to influenza virus has been studied zzso little information is available on the direct interaction between influenza virus and zzso that zzso to severe diseases in humans and zzso To address these issues, we zzso the zzso mouse model combined with primary zzso infected with zzso influenza virus to investigate whether influenza virus has an affinity for zzso in zzso We observed that small proportions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso expressed viral proteins in infected zzso A significant proportion of mouse primary zzso displayed expression of zzso zzso zzso influenza virus zzso and were infected directly by influenza A zzso These experiments reveal that there exists a population of zzso that is susceptible to influenza A virus zzso Furthermore, we employed human zzso zzso to investigate the zzso interaction, with particular emphasis on understanding whether zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso family zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso is involved in virus infection of zzso Interestingly, influenza virus infection resulted in an increased recruitment of zzso to the plasma membrane and an increased level of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is activated by the virus zzso We demonstrated that depletion of zzso inhibited the replication of influenza A virus, whereas zzso of zzso increased virus zzso These results indicate that zzso is required for efficient replication of influenza virus in infected zzso
