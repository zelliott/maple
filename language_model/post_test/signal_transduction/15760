zzso is an orally active zzso zzso inhibitor whose targets include vascular zzso growth factor receptors zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso derived growth factor receptors zzso It has been shown to inhibit tumor zzso by targeting zzso zzso A number of the targets of zzso are also expressed on tumor cells and here we have looked at the direct effects of zzso on tumor cell zzso 

Using a panel of human tumor cell lines we determined the effect of zzso on cell zzso migration and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in the cells was zzso 

zzso had little effect on tumor cell zzso However, it blocked migration and invasion at zzso that inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells also inhibited cell migration which, could not be further inhibited in the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso could not inhibit the migration of a zzso negative cell zzso 

zzso does not significantly affect tumor cell proliferation but can inhibit their migration and invasion at zzso that both inhibit its known targets and are achievable zzso
