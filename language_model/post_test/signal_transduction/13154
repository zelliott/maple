We examined the effect of insulin on the expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso an zzso immediate early gene with a proposed role in memory zzso In human zzso zzso cells, application of insulin leads to dramatic increase in ARC zzso and protein zzso zzso experiments zzso that zzso zzso protein zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity are required for the zzso ARC expression in zzso cells, whereas protein zzso C is not involved in the signal zzso zzso Our data indicated for the first time a correlation of the zzso signal cascade and the induction of synaptic zzso immediate early zzso
