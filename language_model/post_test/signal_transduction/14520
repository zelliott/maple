zzso growth factor zzso was initially cloned as a zzso for zzso and has been identified as a zzso factor for a variety of zzso However, few attempts have assessed the role of zzso in cells of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the role of zzso in such cells during zzso Double zzso for either zzso zzso or zzso with either zzso or zzso in rat zzso at zzso day 3 zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso was zzso on zzso zzso and thereby activated in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso at zzso and in zzso zzso at zzso zzso injections of zzso human zzso at both zzso and zzso revealed that the relative ratio of zzso cells per total number of zzso cells increased, while zzso zzso numbers zzso Western zzso analysis showed a zzso of zzso basic protein zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the numbers of zzso nerve fibers decreased after zzso zzso Furthermore, administration of zzso zzso into the zzso increased the number of zzso zzso These findings demonstrated that zzso increases proliferation of zzso and zzso their differentiation into zzso zzso presumably by favoring zzso outgrowth that may be inhibited by the zzso zzso molecules on zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso from zzso to zzso as revealed by quantitative real-time zzso may be favorable for zzso differentiation into zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso together with zzso regulation, plays an important role in zzso zzso
