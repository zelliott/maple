Despite reports of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso therapeutic benefits of zzso inhibitor therapy are zzso zzso in signal zzso or cellular zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors may be responsible for these inconsistent zzso In either case, a better understanding of growth regulatory signaling pathways is necessary to assess the theoretical potential of inhibitor zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and activated zzso of downstream signal zzso proteins was performed on a tissue zzso containing 27 cases of zzso zzso and 14 samples of zzso 6 whole sections of normal zzso tissue were studied for zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso type, and focal zzso zzso 1 were expressed in all zzso tumors and healing scars but only zzso and 50% of zzso zzso tissue samples, zzso zzso growth factor zzso was detected in zzso of zzso and all scars tested, but not in any of the zzso tissue zzso zzso growth factor zzso was detected in only zzso of zzso and not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso were negative in all study zzso zzso levels of zzso downstream signal zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso signaling is active in both zzso and healing scar, but not in most zzso zzso zzso Although zzso growth factor zzso zzso type, is expressed zzso in zzso the zzso driving cell proliferation in zzso remain zzso
