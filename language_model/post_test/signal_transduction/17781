zzso cells zzso expressing the rat zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to explore further the capacity of structurally distinct zzso to elicit differential signaling through the zzso C zzso or zzso A 2 zzso 2) signal zzso zzso zzso experiments were designed to verify that zzso 2A zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso cells is independent from, and not a subsequent result of, zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso In addition, we also explored the extent of zzso reserve for the zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso 2 zzso Finally, we employed structurally diverse zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso families of zzso 2A zzso zzso to test the hypothesis of zzso trafficking of zzso 2A zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso To measure zzso zzso zzso we determined the potency and intrinsic activity of each compound to activate either the zzso 2 zzso or the zzso zzso The results showed that a larger zzso reserve exists for zzso zzso 2 zzso than for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the data support the hypothesis of zzso trafficking in zzso 2A cells because structurally distinct zzso were able to induce preferential zzso of the zzso or zzso 2 signaling zzso From these data we conclude that structurally distinct zzso can zzso regulate zzso 2A zzso signal zzso
