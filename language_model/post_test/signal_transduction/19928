The zzso signaling zzso has been shown to be involved in the development of the nervous zzso Recent studies showed that zzso receptors and zzso are also expressed in the nervous system of adult zzso However, whether the zzso signaling zzso has a function in adults is not fully zzso The present study is designed to investigate the function of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso transmission, especially during zzso pain in adult zzso 

We found that the zzso zzso domain zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso Root zzso zzso nerve and spinal zzso in normal rats, and is zzso in the zzso nerve and spinal zzso after spared nerve injury zzso Moreover, we used the zzso (a key zzso of the zzso signaling zzso inhibitor zzso to observe the effect of the zzso signaling zzso after zzso We found that zzso zzso significantly increased paw withdrawal zzso zzso and mechanical zzso Mechanical zzso occurring after zzso could be significantly reversed by zzso in a zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso zzso in the induction and maintenance of zzso pain, which indicates that the zzso zzso maybe a potential drug target for zzso pain zzso
