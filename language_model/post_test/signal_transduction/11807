The regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has been analyzed during the naturally zzso cell cycle of zzso zzso zzso The universal binding property of the zzso zzso zzso gene product was used to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity zzso at the beginning of zzso and its decline, which requires protein zzso appears to be an early event during the zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature shifts and DNA synthesis zzso were used to zzso cell cycle regulatory pathways and characterize their effects on zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the full zzso of the zzso zzso requires at least two successive triggering signals involving zzso components and DNA zzso
