Nearly all clinical zzso of zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso produce zzso as well as an additional zzso zzso protein called zzso or zzso the main factor for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso of zzso to zzso in addition, their resistance to zzso zzso is zzso The action of zzso is based on the zzso of the induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in our study was performed with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso production in zzso strains is under the control of the same regulatory system which is responsible for the induction of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with a zzso sensor and a signal zzso domain represents the starting point of this induction zzso Based on its zzso properties, it is likely that the action of zzso is located in the bacterial zzso Therefore we investigated the possibility that zzso might be the main target for zzso zzso We were able to detect the zzso sensor domain in resistant zzso cells even in the zzso state by zzso In a competition zzso zzso was bound specifically, with a high affinity to the zzso zzso Moreover, the binding of zzso was very zzso As concerns zzso no significant interaction with the zzso binding site of zzso was zzso This is why the zzso zzso domain is thought to be the actual target area of zzso In this case, zzso would interfere with the transmission of the zzso generated by the zzso binding of zzso through the membrane via zzso into the zzso zzso This assumption could be confirmed by the analysis of the zzso relationship, zzso zzso does not work as a competitive, but as a zzso zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso could be an attractive new target for the development of new drugs to overcome zzso zzso
