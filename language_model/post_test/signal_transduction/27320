In B cells, processing of zzso in the context of zzso class II molecules is initiated by the binding of zzso to the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso processing is highly efficient, as a consequence of the zzso linked roles of delivering zzso to the class II zzso compartment and of signaling for increased zzso zzso Evidence is emerging that zzso signaling regulates zzso transport through the activities of zzso These in turn have been implicated in the regulation of small zzso zzso zzso which govern membrane zzso zzso we investigated the changes in the zzso and zzso profiles associated with the class II zzso compartment following zzso zzso We first show that protein zzso zzso known to block zzso signal zzso inhibit zzso zzso processing, demonstrating the critical dependence of enhanced processing on the signaling activity of the zzso zzso with this zzso the zzso profile of the class II zzso compartment underwent rapid and transient changes following zzso zzso We also observed a marked increase in the low zzso zzso zzso associated with the class II zzso compartment within 5 zzso of zzso zzso The observed changes in both the zzso and zzso profiles associated with the zzso compartment were blocked by zzso zzso and were not accompanied by overall gross changes in the protein composition of the zzso zzso Thus, signal zzso initiated by zzso zzso at the plasma membrane are translated into changes in specific zzso of regulatory proteins associated with the zzso zzso
