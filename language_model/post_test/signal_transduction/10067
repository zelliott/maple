zzso pancreatic zzso cells zzso play major roles in promoting pancreatic zzso We previously reported that zzso II zzso zzso enhances activated zzso proliferation through zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso a novel zzso mechanism by which zzso II stimulates cellular zzso zzso zzso activated zzso proliferation via a zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso II inhibited zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso II rapidly induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the induction of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso a zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso II enhances activated zzso proliferation by blocking zzso zzso growth zzso by inducing zzso expression via a zzso zzso
