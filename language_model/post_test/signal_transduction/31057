During zzso zzso descending signals from zzso structures act through spinal zzso pathways to effect modifications of muscle activity that are appropriate to the task zzso Recent studies using decomposition methods suggest that this control might be facilitated by zzso synergies organized at the level of the spinal zzso However, it is difficult to directly relate these zzso defined synergies to the patterns of zzso activity observed in the original zzso To address this issue, we have used a novel cluster analysis to make a detailed study of the organization of the synergistic patterns of muscle activity observed in the zzso and zzso during treadmill zzso The results show that the activity of a large number of zzso muscles zzso bursts of activity from 18 zzso can be grouped into 11 clusters on the basis of zzso zzso Nine zzso of these clusters defined muscle activity during the swing phase of zzso these clusters were distributed in a sequential manner and were related to discrete behavioral zzso A comparison with the synergies identified by linear decomposition methods showed some striking similarities between the synergies identified by the different zzso In the zzso a simpler organization was observed, and a sequential zzso of muscles similar to that observed in the zzso during swing was less zzso We suggest that this organization of synergistic muscles provides a means by which descending signals could provide the detailed control of different muscle groups that is necessary for the flexible control of zzso zzso
