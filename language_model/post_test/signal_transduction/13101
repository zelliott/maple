The sense of smell is zzso by the initiation of action potential in zzso sensory zzso during odor zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso In the present work, we identified the structural motifs of zzso molecules required to activate mouse zzso by detection of the zzso response using calcium measurement in cells zzso with OR and zzso and zzso zzso The use of sets of zzso led to the identification of zzso with an zzso carbon chain length zzso four carbon atoms and a zzso group zzso located in position C2 or zzso The threshold of detection of these zzso is as low as zzso No other zzso zzso out of 70 representatives of the zzso world, was zzso The human zzso of zzso is not functional, suggesting that apart from a zzso located at the zzso that was corrected in the zzso it incurred other deleterious zzso during zzso
