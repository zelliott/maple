The nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso is essential for many human zzso zzso such as zzso zzso that interfere with zzso signaling are of great clinical zzso zzso zzso however, is multifaceted and variable among zzso zzso and disease zzso zzso targeted zzso of zzso pathways are of prime importance for clinical zzso We developed a novel real-time zzso zzso zzso Only mechanistically validated zzso targets were zzso We then used zzso zzso to define individual genes and gene combinations within the zzso pathways that define viral zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Few zzso targets emerged that were universally present in all tumor types tested, zzso the need for additional zzso specific zzso zzso zzso We uncovered tissue of zzso tumor zzso specifically zzso zzso and complement factor B zzso for primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 were associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso We defined the zzso signature of zzso virus zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso This signature identified zzso as the key zzso zzso This signature differed from zzso negative zzso consistent with the idea that zzso not only activates zzso activity but that this virus also zzso zzso signaling toward different zzso
