Current zzso therapy is limited by its zzso nature and systemic side zzso To address these limitations, we have unveiled the role of zzso an zzso zzso zzso during tumor zzso zzso blockade provides a double assault on tumor vessels by both zzso tumor zzso and zzso the zzso tumor vessels through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in tumor zzso cells, consequently resulting in a functional failure of tumor zzso Moreover, enhanced zzso effects were observed when zzso blockade was employed in concert with a zzso zzso agent, zzso agent, or zzso zzso These results identify zzso blockade as a selective and effective therapeutic strategy for targeting tumor zzso with minimal side zzso
