zzso zzso are essential for cell division, shape, zzso zzso and zzso zzso stability is regulated by many factors, including zzso proteins and proteins controlling the amount of free zzso zzso available for zzso zzso zzso are potential key regulators of free zzso zzso since they are required for zzso zzso in zzso In this paper, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso affects the levels of both zzso and zzso and dramatically zzso the zzso network in different fly zzso However, we find that zzso is zzso for the early zzso steps of zzso including cell division, and that zzso is not required for zzso in several zzso In striking contrast, the absence of zzso during later stages of zzso causes major defects in cell zzso We show that zzso is required for the polarized zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso and for the zzso polarity of the surrounding zzso zzso These results establish a zzso function for the zzso gene that is essential for viability and zzso cell zzso but not cell zzso
