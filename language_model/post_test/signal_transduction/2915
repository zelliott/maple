zzso interactions are crucial for a wide variety of biological zzso These interactions range from high affinity (K zzso to very low affinity (K zzso While much is known about the nature of high affinity protein complexes, our knowledge about structural characteristics of weak zzso interactions zzso remains zzso in addition to the technical difficulties associated with their investigation, historically zzso used to be considered zzso zzso However, emerging evidence suggests that zzso either in the form of intact protein complexes or as part of large molecular zzso are fundamentally important for promoting rapid zzso switches of signal zzso zzso zzso zzso transient zzso of signaling complexes, and zzso zzso Therefore an zzso zzso of zzso is vital to understanding a cornucopia of diverse cellular zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso is famous for its unique abilities to study zzso and, by zzso of the new technical developments combined with sparse data based zzso analysis, it now allows rapid identification and structural characterization of zzso Here we present our perspective on the zzso methods zzso
