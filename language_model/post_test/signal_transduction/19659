zzso zzso B zzso is a zzso protein zzso that created serious interest when it was revealed as a zzso of the zzso zzso It comprises three zzso that play both unique and redundant zzso Upon binding to zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso is zzso by zzso at zzso To achieve full zzso activity, zzso needs to be zzso at a second key zzso zzso by members of the zzso zzso family zzso or zzso depending on the stimulus and the zzso Besides, a number of zzso and interacting partners have been shown to further zzso its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review aims at illustrating the remarkable complexity in the regulation of zzso signaling downstream of zzso Such regulation could be attributed to the specific roles of the zzso zzso their expression pattern, zzso zzso targets, zzso by upstream zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and by zzso and interaction with binding zzso This allows this key zzso to fulfill zzso functions in numerous zzso including embryonic development, zzso development, zzso zzso zzso zzso and to avoid pathological loss of control such as tumor zzso
