There is increasing emphasis on the use of systems biology approaches to define zzso responses in cells and zzso Such approaches frequently rely on global screening using various high zzso zzso zzso Although these methods are ideal for obtaining an unbiased overview of cellular responses, they often cannot reflect the inherent zzso of the system or provide detailed spatial zzso Additionally, performing such studies with multiple sampling time points can be zzso zzso Imaging provides a complementary method with high spatial and zzso resolution capable of following the dynamics of signaling zzso In this review, we zzso specific examples to illustrate how imaging approaches have furthered our understanding of zzso cellular zzso zzso emphasis is placed on protein zzso and zzso and transient signaling zzso
