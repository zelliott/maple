zzso zzso signaling has been shown to be involved in zzso zzso patterning in zzso zzso but how it regulates different zzso gene expression in the lateral zzso zzso is not zzso Here, we use transient exposure of zzso or zzso to lithium, which mimics zzso zzso as a tool to regulate the zzso of this zzso at different times and places during early zzso We show that zzso of zzso signaling at the early zzso stage rapidly zzso zzso expression of zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis reveals that the induction of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso occurs within 45 zzso and is not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso By contrast, the induction of zzso is observed after 2 h of zzso treatment and the normal expression pattern of zzso is blocked by zzso Analysis by zzso of zzso zzso isolated soon after zzso transition indicates that zzso also specifically zzso zzso zzso which takes place 30 zzso following zzso treatment and is not blocked by zzso arguing strongly for an zzso zzso In the early zzso zzso of zzso signaling blocks the expression of zzso and zzso but not of zzso We further show that zzso zzso signaling interacts specifically with zzso and zzso to promote zzso expression in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is required for regulating zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso In particular, it may directly activate the expression of the zzso gene in the muscle precursor zzso
