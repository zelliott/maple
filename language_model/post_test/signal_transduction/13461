Mice deficient in the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso zzso exhibit a bleeding disorder and lack T zzso zzso for zzso of T cells zzso mice exhibit a similar T cell zzso but show no signs of zzso Both zzso and zzso are important for optimal zzso zzso downstream of the collagen zzso zzso In addition, zzso is involved in signaling zzso by zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso function zzso in T cell signal zzso yet their roles appear to differ in zzso we investigated in detail the functional consequences of zzso and zzso deficiencies in zzso Previously we have shown that zzso zzso exhibit defective responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, we find that surface expression of zzso in response to high zzso of zzso zzso is reduced in both zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso from zzso mice, but not zzso mice, zzso normally in response to high zzso of collagen and zzso Additionally, unlike zzso zzso is not zzso zzso after zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso deficient in zzso spread normally on zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that while zzso and zzso are equally required for signaling via the T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso and zzso shows a much greater dependency on zzso than zzso
