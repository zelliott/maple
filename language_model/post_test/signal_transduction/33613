The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with a variety of cell functions like cell zzso migration, zzso and zzso Since its discovery, 9 zzso zzso have been identified, but the most widely spread and the most important for the cellular functions is zzso This zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso plays a central zzso role in all cells regulating cell volume and internal pH zzso At zzso zzso zzso is essentially inactive but it is extremely sensitive to zzso changes, being rapidly activated by small zzso hydrogen concentration zzso zzso activity can be zzso via a series of cell surface zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These signals zzso regulating the affinity of the internal zzso zzso zzso also is a plasma zzso protein for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is important for cell zzso to zzso zzso proteins and cell zzso Moreover, zzso plays the role of a zzso for the building of various zzso signaling zzso zzso
