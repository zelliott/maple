Chemical zzso are zzso zzso junctions that mediate synaptic zzso zzso junctions are organized by zzso cell zzso molecules bridging the synaptic zzso zzso cell zzso molecules not only connect zzso and zzso zzso but also mediate zzso recognition and signaling processes that are essential for the establishment, zzso and plasticity of zzso A growing number of synaptic cell zzso molecules that include zzso and zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and several zzso repeat proteins have been zzso These synaptic cell zzso molecules use characteristic zzso zzso to perform complementary roles in organizing synaptic junctions that are only now being zzso The importance of synaptic cell zzso molecules for brain function is highlighted by recent findings implicating several such zzso notably zzso and zzso in schizophrenia and zzso
