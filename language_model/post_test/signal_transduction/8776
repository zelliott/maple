zzso a systemic inflammatory response to zzso zzso has a high mortality rate that is linked both to excess zzso activity and zzso of critical immune zzso zzso has recently been shown to improve outcome in a septic cohort of patients when compared to patients zzso to a zzso sedative zzso We sought to compare the effects of zzso and zzso at zzso doses, on inflammation and zzso in an animal model of severe zzso 

After central zzso access, Sprague zzso rats underwent zzso zzso and zzso puncture zzso with an 18 G needle without zzso cover and received either zzso or an infusion of comparable volume of saline containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso (5 zzso for 8 zzso Following baseline zzso and zzso blood was sampled for zzso measurement zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4-6 per zzso at 2, 4 and 5 hours, and animal mortality rate zzso was monitored zzso zzso 10 per zzso every 2 hours until 2 hours had zzso In addition, zzso were harvested and zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso 4 per zzso 

The 24 hour MR in zzso animals zzso was significantly reduced by sedative doses of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso While both zzso reduced systemic levels of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso reduced the zzso response to zzso though this narrowly missed achieving significance zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso when compared to either zzso or zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso both improve outcome in zzso severely septic zzso zzso benefits conveyed by one sedative regimen over another may become evident over a more prolonged zzso as both zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso but not zzso Further studies are required to evaluate this zzso
