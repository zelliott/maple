The zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein zzso was identified initially as a possible target for the nuclear export signal zzso of the zzso Rev protein in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso associated with nuclear pore complexes, and structurally related to the zzso family of pore zzso It contributes to zzso zzso zzso export and is also important for the export of heat shock zzso at 42 degrees zzso We show here that zzso is essential for the export of heat shock zzso and this function is fulfilled by the unique zzso zzso of zzso with no substantial contribution from the zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso export zzso zzso are zzso which support a role of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Finally, this domain of zzso also contributes to zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso promotes the nuclear export of different classes of zzso by contributing to optimal pore zzso
