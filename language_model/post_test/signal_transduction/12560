Recent experiments have explored effects of activities of zzso other than the well-studied zzso in zzso zzso zzso particularly at the level of zzso It has also been found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the effects of these zzso on the level and degradation of zzso and the resulting downstream zzso activity remain to be zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso level has not been examined zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso of zzso and of zzso and degradation of zzso on the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso were examined zzso 

The well-known zzso zzso kinetic model of the zzso zzso was modified to include these zzso The rate laws of reactions in the modified model were solved zzso to examine these effects on zzso zzso 

The zzso showed that the zzso level is almost zzso zzso to the zzso activity of zzso The dependence of zzso level on the zzso and degradation of free zzso and downstream zzso activity can be analyzed with an zzso simple function of kinetic parameters for added reaction steps associated with effects zzso zzso the experimental zzso 

The zzso of zzso by zzso other than zzso involve free zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso In order to account for the observed enhancement of zzso activity, the zzso zzso step is essential, and the kinetic parameters of zzso zzso and degradation need to meet a condition described in the main zzso These findings should be useful for future zzso
