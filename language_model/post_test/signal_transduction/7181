zzso zzso are important for liver zzso after partial zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso 14 zzso the zzso for zzso weak zzso of zzso zzso is induced rapidly after zzso and remains elevated throughout the period of peak zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso liver zzso is uncertain because zzso is expressed by liver zzso and zzso interactions stimulate zzso growth, but replication of mature zzso is thought to drive liver zzso after zzso 

To clarify the role of zzso after zzso we compared zzso zzso responses in wild type zzso mice, zzso knockout zzso mice, zzso zzso mice, and zzso mice treated with zzso zzso 

In zzso mice, rare zzso cells localized with other zzso markers in zzso areas before zzso zzso rapidly increased proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells that expressed zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso progressively accumulated from zzso h zzso and then declined to baseline by 96 zzso When zzso signaling was zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso survival were zzso while zzso liver damage and zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso proliferation and increased zzso expression in cultured liver zzso but had no effect on either zzso in cultured primary zzso 

zzso signaling is necessary for the healthy adult liver to zzso normally after acute partial zzso
