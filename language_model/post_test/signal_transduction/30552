zzso K was originally identified as an zzso zzso zzso the inhibitor of which has been considered might have therapeutic zzso We show that zzso of zzso K could zzso suppress zzso inflammation of the zzso as well as zzso bone zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice were resistant to experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso or targeted disruption of zzso K resulted in defective zzso zzso 9 signaling in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso DNA, which in turn led to attenuated induction of T helper 17 cells, without affecting the zzso ability of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso K plays an important role in the immune system and may serve as a valid therapeutic target in zzso zzso
