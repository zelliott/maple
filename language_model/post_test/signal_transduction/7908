Nuclear export of the large zzso zzso zzso depends on the adapter protein zzso to provide a nuclear export signal zzso The zzso zzso is recognized by the export zzso zzso to mediate export via interaction with the nuclear pore complex zzso Here, we show that certain zzso zzso proteins that are impaired for binding to the zzso zzso accumulate at the nuclear zzso These zzso proteins also show enhanced binding to zzso both in zzso and in zzso Although their interaction with the zzso is dependent on recognition of the zzso by zzso their interaction with zzso is not strictly dependent on zzso Using a collection of zzso zzso zzso we identified several zzso including components of the zzso complex that zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso complex is on the zzso face of the zzso and has previously been shown to be important as a terminal binding site for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso complex led to zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso suggesting that the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso complex reflects a zzso in the bona fide export zzso for the zzso zzso These results suggest that in the absence of the zzso zzso is not efficiently released from zzso at the zzso
