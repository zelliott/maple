zzso is an important zzso suppressing the zzso zzso zzso Here, we generated zzso zzso zzso mice, using newly generated zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso mice showed lower body and zzso tissue weights despite zzso and enhanced insulin sensitivity with induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice also showed marked zzso and increased energy expenditure with induced zzso in zzso zzso associated with marked reduction of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso and increased expression of zzso the gene that encodes zzso zzso activated zzso gamma zzso 1 zzso Physiologically, zzso zzso zzso decreased with exposure to cold and increased with zzso which were linked to the zzso zzso of zzso Our results suggest that altered expression of zzso zzso could regulate insulin sensitivity and energy zzso zzso of zzso zzso may become a beneficial strategy to treat type 2 diabetes and zzso
