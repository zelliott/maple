To investigate the zzso signaling zzso as possible underlying mechanism of the effects of zzso on insulin and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice of both zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso ) mice received zzso zzso zzso zzso ) or a similar volume of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso injection (each group zzso zzso zzso The mice were zzso 45 minutes later with sodium zzso zzso and blood was sampled via cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso and by the oxygen rate method, zzso Data were analyzed with zzso and zzso post hoc zzso zzso and are shown as mean zzso zzso 

Plasma insulin and zzso zzso were similar between zzso and zzso mice under control zzso As compared to controls, zzso administration produced a statistically significant decrease in plasma insulin zzso in the zzso mice whereas the decrease in the zzso mice was not statistically zzso zzso zzso caused a significantly greater increase in plasma zzso zzso in the zzso than in the zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso may be one underlying mechanism of the zzso and insulin effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and likely other drugs of its zzso
