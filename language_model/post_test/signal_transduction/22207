zzso hormone zzso is the major hormone regulating bone zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso a zzso G protein coupled zzso zzso can potentially trigger multiple signal zzso pathways zzso through several different G zzso In this study, we employed G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to selectively dissect out which of these G proteins were responsible for effects of zzso in targeted signaling and osteogenesis zzso consisting of 159 zzso Among the 32 genes significantly regulated by zzso zzso treatment in zzso zzso cells, 9 genes were exclusively regulated through zzso 6 genes were solely zzso through zzso and 3 genes were only controlled through zzso Such findings support the concept that there is some absolute specificity in downstream responses initiated at the G protein level following binding of zzso to the zzso On the other hand, 6 zzso genes were regulated by both zzso and zzso 3 genes were regulated by both zzso and zzso and 3 genes were controlled by zzso zzso and zzso These findings indicate potential overlapping or sequential interactions among different G zzso zzso In addition, two zzso genes were not regulated through any of the G proteins zzso suggesting that additional signaling mechanisms may be zzso zzso was largely maintained over a zzso time zzso The zzso effects were zzso by downstream zzso The dissection of the differential effects of multiple G protein pathways on gene regulation provides a more complete understanding of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
