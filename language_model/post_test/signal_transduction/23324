To assess the effects of three methods of inducing zzso cells zzso zzso blood zzso stem cells zzso from nearly zzso pregnancy zzso dogs were zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to detect surface zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cells were induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso Positive expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) were detected after 3 zzso The zzso results were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso group, zzso zzso group and zzso induced fluid zzso zzso analysis showed zzso expression significantly higher in zzso zzso group than in the zzso group or zzso fluid group zzso but there was no significant difference between the zzso and zzso fluid groups for zzso expression zzso zzso did not express zzso structural proteins before zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present after zzso The positive expression of four proteins differed with the differentiation zzso The zzso can be differentiated into zzso cells by three methods, but the degrees of differentiation are zzso Our results show that the effects of zzso and zzso zzso are better than that of zzso induced zzso
