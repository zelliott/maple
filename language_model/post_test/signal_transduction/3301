Combination chemotherapy represents the zzso for zzso zzso However, the development of new therapeutic regimens is empirical and this approach cannot be used zzso to identify novel or optimal drug zzso zzso system zzso models could promote the discovery and development of combination regimens based upon first zzso In this study, we developed a mathematical model that zzso zzso patterns of drug exposure, zzso occupancy, and signal zzso to predict the effects of the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso inducing zzso or zzso a zzso zzso upon growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso The model zzso major regulatory mechanisms, including zzso disposition of zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling induced by zzso occupancy, and the relative efficacy of death zzso zzso The zzso model coupled tumor responses to individual zzso agents with their mechanisms of action in zzso and the changes in zzso and zzso induced by zzso occupancy were linked to explain the zzso of these zzso zzso growth profiles predicted by the model agreed with cell and zzso data, capturing the apparent zzso zzso of these agents with zzso Together, our findings provide a zzso platform for exploring new regimens with zzso zzso
