The cell body of a zzso zzso must receive accurate and timely information on the site and extent of zzso damage, in order to mount an appropriate zzso zzso mechanisms must therefore exist to transmit such information along the length of the zzso from the zzso site to the cell zzso Three distinct types of signals have been zzso to zzso this process, starting with zzso discharge of zzso zzso and continuing with two distinct types of zzso transported zzso zzso The latter include, on the one hand, an interruption of the normal supply of zzso transported zzso factors from the zzso and on the other hand activated proteins emanating from the injury zzso These activated proteins are termed zzso injury zzso and are thought to be zzso zzso proteins that undergo zzso modifications at the zzso site upon zzso which then target them to the retrograde transport system for trafficking to the cell zzso Here, we zzso the work to date supporting the positive retrograde injury signal hypothesis, and provide some new and emerging zzso data on the zzso We propose that the retrograde positive injury signals form part of a complex that is assembled by a combination of different zzso including zzso modifications such as zzso regulated and transient zzso and local zzso protein zzso
