zzso migration zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso This study was undertaken to identify the zzso promoter elements responsible for regulating gene zzso 

zzso reporter gene zzso were used to identify the zzso promoter sequence responsible for zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to predict zzso factor binding sites, and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was used to demonstrate zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to demonstrate zzso factor loading on the zzso zzso 

We identified the minimal promoter sequence required for zzso zzso promoter activity that was also capable of zzso zzso zzso in a T zzso model cell zzso zzso studies and zzso revealed 2 elements in the zzso promoter that were responsible for zzso promoter zzso The zzso element binds zzso zzso factor 1, and the 3' element is a functional zzso element binding zzso factor zzso Further studies demonstrated that the zzso elements are both required for zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso recruitment of zzso zzso alpha to the zzso promoter in zzso within 1 hour of treatment and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso and zzso signaling zzso on a single element regulating zzso this regulatory unit is a potential interacting zzso for zzso sensing of oxygen tension and zzso action in zzso of zzso
