zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that contains zzso zzso IV activity and binds zzso zzso Recent work showed that specialized membrane zzso also known as zzso zzso play a key role in zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the role of zzso in zzso blood zzso zzso and signal zzso We demonstrated that different expression levels of zzso were observed between zzso blood T cells zzso and peripheral blood T cells zzso and that zzso zzso were different compared with zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of zzso was not as pronounced in zzso as in zzso We also showed that zzso zzso induced less zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of T cells zzso in zzso than in zzso Furthermore, zzso molecules associated with zzso molecules outside zzso zzso in zzso Our results suggest that strong physical linkage of zzso with zzso outside zzso zzso may be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso signaling through zzso which may be responsible for immature immune response and the low zzso of severe zzso disease in zzso blood zzso
