The zzso growth factor zzso zzso mediates the actions of a family of zzso peptides that include zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso Here we have studied zzso and zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso that zzso express either wild type zzso zzso or a truncated zzso that lacks the three major sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso significantly zzso the ability of zzso to zzso stimulate DNA zzso zzso elicit zzso zzso and zzso generate sustained zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on zzso binding to zzso but did result in defective zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not impair zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cells zzso was able to stimulate the association of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was monitored when either zzso or a truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of full-length zzso resulted in a strong zzso zzso of zzso in zzso but only slightly zzso zzso in zzso or parental zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso tail of the zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso signaling but is zzso for zzso since zzso truncated zzso can signal through zzso
