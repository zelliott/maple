Although zzso cancer represents a serious health problem worldwide, relevant mouse models for investigating disease progression or therapeutic targets have been zzso We show that combined deletion of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso leads to invasive cancer in a novel mouse zzso zzso of zzso and zzso promotes zzso in human zzso cells and is correlated with poor survival in human zzso Furthermore, the synergistic effects of zzso and zzso deletion are zzso by deregulation of zzso target of zzso zzso zzso consistent with the ability of zzso to block zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our integrated analyses of mouse and human zzso cancer provide a rationale for investigating zzso zzso for treatment of patients with invasive zzso
