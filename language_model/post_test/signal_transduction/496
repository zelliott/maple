zzso zzso via delivery of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and other zzso factors is both a potential therapy for cardiovascular diseases and a critical aspect for tissue zzso The recent demonstration that zzso signaling is modulated by the zzso signaling pathway, however, suggests that zzso zzso signaling may enhance regional zzso by altering the responsiveness of local zzso cells to zzso zzso We tested this possibility with in zzso zzso using human zzso cells, as well as in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cultured human zzso cells with zzso a gamma zzso zzso increased cell migration and zzso formation in response to zzso stimulation with a zzso dependence on zzso zzso Further, delivery of an appropriate combination of zzso and zzso from an zzso zzso zzso system into zzso zzso led to a faster recovery of blood flow than zzso or zzso alone; zzso levels reached zzso of the normal level by week 4 with combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso intramuscular or zzso injection of zzso did not result in the same level of improvement, suggesting that appropriate presentation of zzso zzso zzso is important for its zzso zzso delivery from the zzso also did not lead to any adverse side effects, in contrast to systemic introduction of zzso Altogether, these results suggest a new approach to promote zzso by controlling zzso zzso and may provide new options to treat patients with diseases that diminish zzso zzso
