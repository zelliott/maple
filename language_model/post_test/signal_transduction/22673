An understanding of the role of zzso cells in synaptic signaling is still zzso but the zzso relationship may have important ramifications for brain plasticity and zzso This review summarizes current knowledge and theories concerning zzso zzso both in terms of zzso signals that cause zzso and zzso signals that affect zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in the brain involves a stereotypical pattern of changes including proliferation and migration to sites of zzso activity or injury, increased or de zzso expression of zzso including zzso and growth factors, and the full transformation into zzso zzso capable of clearing damaged cells and zzso The factors released from zzso that elicit such zzso and functional zzso are not well known but may include zzso oxidized zzso and/or zzso Once zzso zzso can promote zzso injury through the release of zzso zzso and support zzso recovery through the release of growth factors and the zzso of damaged zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso respond quickly to zzso damage and have robust effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells could play potentially key roles in orchestrating the zzso cascade that follows synaptic plasticity and zzso
