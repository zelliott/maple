zzso zzso and its zzso receptors are zzso by candidate zzso genes for zzso yet the essential functions of zzso signaling in the zzso are still zzso Using zzso technology, we have zzso zzso zzso signaling specifically in the zzso In contrast to expectations, cell layers in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso develop normally in the zzso zzso Instead, loss of zzso zzso zzso spine maturation and zzso interactions of zzso scaffold proteins with zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels promote spine zzso zzso mice show increased aggression and reduced zzso zzso Treatment with the antipsychotic drug zzso reverses the behavioral and spine zzso We conclude that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso spine zzso and that defects at zzso zzso likely contribute to the behavioral abnormalities in zzso zzso
