The signaling pathways by which zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac sodium currents are unknown, although it is likely that zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso sodium currents were measured in cardiac zzso and the signal zzso G protein zzso was found to couple zzso receptors to sodium channels by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can act on at least three zzso in the zzso sodium channels, calcium channels, and zzso zzso The effect on sodium currents was zzso and was enhanced by membrane zzso During zzso zzso the sodium currents of zzso cells may be further inhibited by the accompanying increase in zzso zzso
