Mouse zzso cells differentiate into primitive zzso when treated with zzso acid zzso and into zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso G protein signaling either blocks or mimics zzso zzso the latter signaling through the zzso zzso In our study, we found that a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to differentiate into zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso expression and subsequent differentiation are accompanied by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and changes in cell zzso are supported by zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to link zzso to zzso zzso are also redistributed during zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso approaches show that zzso expression is essential since its zzso leads to altered zzso distribution and subsequent zzso zzso cells, however, remain attached to the zzso when zzso is zzso zzso but they do not differentiate into zzso zzso Our study demonstrates a link between zzso signaling that regulates differentiation of zzso cells through primitive to zzso zzso and a zzso requirement for cell zzso
