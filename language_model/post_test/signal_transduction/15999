zzso is an zzso G zzso zzso that plays a key role in cortical zzso zzso to zzso in humans cause zzso of the cerebral cortex, but little is known about the normal function of the zzso We found that the large N zzso zzso of zzso is zzso from the rest of the zzso during processing but remains zzso associated with the zzso region of the zzso as indicated by zzso of the two zzso fragments from both zzso cells and native zzso We also found that zzso of the zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of zzso zzso as revealed by increased zzso signaling upon zzso of zzso cells with truncated zzso greatly enhanced binding of zzso by truncated zzso relative to the full-length zzso extensive zzso of truncated zzso and zzso induced by truncated zzso that could be rescued by zzso of cells with zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso interactions that enhance zzso signaling zzso On the basis of these findings, we suggest a model of zzso zzso in which the large N zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity but zzso interactions zzso zzso with an zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can remove this zzso influence of the N zzso to activate zzso zzso
