Mice that are deficient in zzso zzso develop zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso regulatory T zzso cells suppress zzso implicating zzso in maintaining zzso zzso We assessed the relative importance of zzso zzso derived from T cells or from zzso presenting cells zzso in development of zzso zzso 

zzso cells from zzso zzso or specific zzso zzso zzso or zzso mice were injected into zzso zzso mice or zzso mice that express zzso After zzso weeks, we evaluated zzso spontaneous zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso levels of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso T cells were zzso with bacterial zzso zzso and zzso for zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells from zzso or SPF zzso or zzso mice induced more severe colitis and higher levels of inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso T cells plus bacterial zzso zzso from zzso mice contained more zzso zzso zzso and zzso than zzso of the same T cells plus zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were required for these zzso zzso zzso receptors increased production of zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso suppressed these zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells, whereas blocking the zzso acid zzso in zzso and in zzso reduced proportions of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso produced by zzso regulates zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso
