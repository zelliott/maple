Species of the zzso zzso are major bacteria responsible for producing most natural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in 2002 and 2003, zzso zzso signal zzso systems zzso consisting of a zzso sensor zzso zzso and a zzso response regulator zzso form the most common mechanism of zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed in zzso Here, we identify and zzso the SK and zzso of zzso zzso and compare the zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso pairs of the two species indicated that the zzso zzso pairs fall into four classes according to the distribution of their zzso in other zzso In addition to the zzso zzso pairs, some potential partners of zzso zzso were found, including those of zzso SK and orphan zzso and the zzso between different components in either zzso Our study provides new clues for further exploration of the molecular regulation mechanism of zzso with industrial zzso
