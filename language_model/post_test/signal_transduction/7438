zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or damaged zzso is a major pathological process underlying Parkinson disease and a potential genetic mechanism of zzso Despite zzso associations between Parkinson disease and heart failure, the role of zzso and zzso quality control in maintaining normal cardiac zzso is poorly zzso 

We used zzso zzso and zzso zzso interference to interrogate zzso regulation of zzso zzso and examine functional zzso between zzso and zzso dynamics in zzso heart zzso 

zzso profiling of zzso knockout mouse hearts revealed zzso zzso of multiple related zzso zzso zzso Because zzso lack most of these redundant zzso we examined heart tubes of zzso knockout flies and observed zzso of enlarged hollow zzso zzso with zzso zzso which could be rescued by zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were induced by zzso zzso suppression using 2 different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species generation without calcium cycling zzso pointing to a primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion in zzso fly heart tubes completely prevented the zzso and corrected zzso dysfunction without zzso zzso zzso demonstrating a central role for zzso fusion in the zzso provoked by impaired zzso 

zzso zzso and resulting zzso disruption produces zzso in part by contamination of the zzso zzso pool through fusion between improperly retained zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso contagion by zzso zzso fusion shows promise for minimizing organ dysfunction produced by defective zzso zzso
