Juvenile hormone zzso plays crucial roles in many aspects of insect zzso The zzso zzso gene product, a member of the zzso family of zzso regulators, has been demonstrated to be a key component of the zzso signaling zzso However, the molecular function of Met in zzso signal zzso and gene regulation remains to be fully zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex, zzso acts as a functional partner of Met in zzso zzso gene zzso Met and zzso appear to use their zzso zzso to form a zzso only in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso In newly emerged adult female zzso expression of some zzso responsive genes is considerably dampened when Met or zzso is depleted by zzso Met and zzso are found to be associated with the promoter of the early zzso gene zzso when zzso of this gene is activated by zzso A juvenile hormone response element zzso has been identified in the zzso upstream regulatory region and is bound in zzso by the zzso complex present in the nuclear protein extracts of zzso adult female zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of Met and zzso can also use this zzso zzso to activate gene zzso in response to zzso in a cell zzso zzso Together, the evidence indicates that Met and zzso form a functional complex on the zzso in the presence of zzso and directly activate zzso of zzso target zzso
