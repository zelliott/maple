zzso contributes to zzso tissue destruction in part by zzso zzso zzso which in zzso is a focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is enriched in and regulates the formation of focal zzso but the role of zzso in zzso tissue destruction is not zzso We first examined destruction of zzso zzso zzso in adult zzso and zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso which increases the levels of multiple zzso including zzso Three weeks after zzso zzso were processed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Compared with zzso controls, there was zzso times greater bone loss as well as zzso reduction of the thickness of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction of the amount of collagen fibers in zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue showed elevated expression of zzso at zzso zzso Second, to examine mechanisms by which zzso may regulate zzso degradation, human zzso zzso were used to screen zzso media from human zzso zzso treated with vehicle, zzso or zzso Although zzso was zzso by both zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of cells depleted of zzso activity with the use of various zzso zzso or with zzso or zzso and matched wild type zzso were zzso on zzso to enable focal zzso formation and zzso with zzso These data showed that the zzso and zzso functions of zzso were required for zzso focal zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso tissue degradation involving zzso requires functionally active zzso and in part is zzso by zzso signaling through focal zzso
