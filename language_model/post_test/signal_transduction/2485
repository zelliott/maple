We compared the effect on zzso zzso formation of calcium release from zzso stores with that of calcium influx from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso free calcium zzso concentration and zzso zzso were performed on zzso single rat adrenal zzso zzso The effects of zzso stimuli in terms of the evoked zzso response were zzso zzso II zzso 1 zzso induced a higher zzso zzso response than zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso also induced a greater initial zzso formation than zzso although the zzso signal evoked by the two zzso had similar zzso To examine the effect of zzso release from internal stores we applied zzso in zzso zzso We compared the effect on zzso formation of zzso release with zzso influx induced by zzso and with zzso zzso influx induced by zzso zzso formation in response to zzso release was greater than that induced by zzso influx, irrespective of whether induced by zzso or zzso Our results indicate that zzso presumably released in the vicinity of zzso activates zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso entering through the plasma zzso These data confirm the biological significance of previous observations showing that zzso released from zzso zzso zzso internal stores increases zzso zzso zzso to a greater extent than zzso zzso
