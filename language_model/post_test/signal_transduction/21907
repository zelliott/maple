This study investigates the separate and combined effects of IGF-1 and mechanical loads on zzso in elderly human zzso head zzso zzso Full depth zzso of zzso cartilage were subjected to either no load, zzso or zzso (2 s zzso s zzso loading in zzso zzso at a stress of 1 zzso for 48 h with or without IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using zzso and zzso during the last 24 h of zzso IGF-1 alone increased the rates of isotope zzso by zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso whereas loading alone reduced zzso zzso zzso load zzso or zzso in the presence of IGF-1 returned the incorporation rates to their zzso zzso This study suggests elderly human zzso cartilage is responsive to stimulation by IGF-1 but mechanical factors seem to act sufficiently strongly in the opposite direction to cancel this zzso
