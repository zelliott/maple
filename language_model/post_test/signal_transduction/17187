zzso zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso including zzso and zzso responsible for zzso the innate and zzso immune zzso Our results show that zzso induced the production of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso proteins in primary human zzso isolated by positive selection through zzso zzso These results were confirmed by zzso stimulation of zzso zzso resulting in zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the signaling pathways governing the regulation of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso We observed a differential regulation of zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was positively regulated by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest for the first time a differential positive regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso independent of the zzso pathways and negative regulation by the zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso primary human zzso zzso with zzso
