The major challenge in biology today is zzso the need to explain how cell and tissue behaviors emerge from collective interactions within complex molecular zzso Part I of this zzso article, described a mechanical model of cell structure based on zzso architecture that explains how the mechanical behavior of the cell emerges from physical interactions among the different molecular filament systems that form the zzso Recent work shows that the zzso also zzso much of the cell's zzso and signal zzso machinery and that mechanical distortion of cells and the zzso through cell surface zzso receptors can profoundly affect cell zzso In particular, gradual variations in this single physical control zzso zzso shape zzso can switch cells between distinct gene programs zzso growth, differentiation and zzso and this process can be viewed as a biological phase zzso Part II of this article covers how combined use of zzso and solid-state zzso by cells may mediate zzso and facilitate integration of chemical and physical signals that are responsible for control of cell zzso In addition, it examines how cell structural networks affect gene and protein signaling networks to produce characteristic zzso and cell fate transitions during tissue zzso
