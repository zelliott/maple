zzso of the zzso and zzso families are functionally zzso zzso proteins that participate in many important cellular processes such as signal zzso cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso stress response, and zzso However, the exact zzso of these proteins in these processes is not entirely zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to demonstrate a functional connection between zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Our experiments suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso is also involved in these three essential processes and exerts an additional function during mating and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggest that both zzso and zzso could be constituents of the same regulatory zzso controlling cell growth and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso ameliorated the defects of cells depleted for zzso Furthermore, we found that another small G zzso zzso was a zzso of zzso for both zzso and zzso In addition, deletion of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso could also rescue cells with zzso zzso zzso from these data, we propose a model for zzso and zzso functions in zzso zzso
