zzso zzso zzso is involved in liver zzso The liver is also the zzso site for zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the principal cellular source of zzso We hypothesized that zzso produced by zzso zzso cells played a role in the zzso zzso principally via zzso zzso zzso of zzso IGF-1 synthesis and zzso Using isolated rat zzso we evaluated zzso zzso expression zzso zzso sequencing and western zzso zzso cell zzso and western blots delineated zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso and zzso IGF-1 zzso was evaluated using zzso and zzso IGF-1 was tested on small zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso while IGF-1 production and zzso expression were examined in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated evidence for a functional zzso zzso zzso activated zzso activity, zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso Signaling was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 significantly zzso proliferation of two small zzso neuroendocrine zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and could be reversed by the small zzso inhibitor zzso IGF-1 and zzso were elevated zzso in zzso zzso tissue in nude mice, while zzso was increased fourfold compared to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso express a zzso zzso zzso which, at elevated zzso zzso that occur in liver zzso signals via zzso and is linked to IGF-1 synthesis and zzso Because IGF-1 regulates zzso zzso identification of a role for zzso in the zzso zzso tumor zzso suggests the potential for novel therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso zzso
