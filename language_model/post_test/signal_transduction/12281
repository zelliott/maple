Recently, we zzso the zzso zzso region for copy number and gene expression changes in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and primary zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso related protein 1) is frequently under expressed even in breast zzso with copy number increases in this zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso and plays a role in the development of multiple solid zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in breast cancer cells with the zzso zzso and investigated the zzso zzso properties of zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso expression was markedly reduced in both the breast cancer cell lines and primary zzso specimens relative to normal primary human zzso zzso cells even when zzso is zzso zzso of zzso expression in breast cancer cells with an zzso gene amplification is associated with zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, restoration of zzso expression suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells in zzso and inhibited zzso independent zzso We also examined the relationship between the zzso of zzso gene and zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso zzso expression in breast cancer cells suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was zzso associated with the expression of a subset of zzso responsive genes including zzso and zzso Thus, zzso of zzso can be triggered by zzso and/or genetic events and may contribute to the zzso of human breast cancer through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
