zzso plant promoters contain multiple zzso zzso only some of which may contribute to pathogen zzso zzso we made defined synthetic promoters containing zzso of only a single type of element and present evidence that a range of zzso elements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can mediate local gene expression in zzso after pathogen zzso The expression patterns of the promoters were monitored during interactions with a number of zzso including zzso incompatible, and zzso zzso Interestingly, there were major differences in the zzso of the various promoters with the pathogens tested as well as differences in the speed of induction and in the zzso expression zzso We also show that defense signaling is largely zzso across species boundaries at the zzso element zzso Many of these promoters also direct local zzso zzso and this provides evidence for the convergence of resistance zzso zzso and wound responses at the level of the promoter zzso We have used these zzso elements to construct improved synthetic promoters and show the effects of varying the number, order, and spacing of such zzso These promoters are valuable additions to the study of signaling and zzso zzso during zzso zzso
