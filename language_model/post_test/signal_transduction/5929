Human zzso were found to release zzso at exposure for the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso The following characteristics for the zzso zzso zzso release were zzso zzso In the order of zzso of the cellular zzso content was zzso at 206 zzso and zzso at zzso zzso of the compound, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso (10 zzso or zzso (10 zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso The time course of the release triggered by zzso was intermediate to those characterizing the release triggered by 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso stimulation were zzso to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso treated with a low concentration of zzso were not zzso to zzso These data show that zzso a zzso protein zzso C zzso acts as a zzso zzso for human zzso with a mode of action which in some, but not all respects, mimics that of zzso In particular, zzso release resembles that reported by other authors for zzso triggering of release by zzso
