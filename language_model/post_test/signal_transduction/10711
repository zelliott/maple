Abstract In zzso zzso the decision to develop into a zzso adult or arrest as a zzso zzso is influenced by multiple pathways including zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso hormones act downstream of these pathways to regulate zzso zzso One likely target for such a hormone is zzso an orphan nuclear hormone zzso that mediates these zzso decisions and also influences adult zzso In order to find zzso hormones we have generated zzso extracts from mass cultures of zzso zzso and shown that they rescue the zzso zzso zzso of class 1 zzso insulin zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso These extracts are also able to rescue the lethal zzso zzso of zzso zzso which lack a zzso steroid zzso thought to be involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso however, have no effect on a zzso zzso binding domain zzso that is predicted to be zzso zzso The production of this hormone appears to be zzso dependent as extracts from a zzso double zzso do not exhibit this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extracts shows that the activity is zzso with some polar properties, consistent with a small zzso zzso We propose that the zzso rescuing activity is a hormone zzso by zzso that acts through zzso
