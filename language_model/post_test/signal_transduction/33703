The present study was designed to investigate the effects of rat zzso zzso an zzso for zzso zzso receptors zzso on the isolated rat pulmonary zzso rings zzso When PA were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso induced zzso zzso The pulmonary zzso response zzso to zzso in PA were completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso to zzso were also significantly attenuated by a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium salt zzso zzso zzso toxin and abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso effect was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In parallel with zzso and zzso results zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso The zzso to zzso was zzso either in the presence of zzso or zzso Since the zzso to zzso was also significantly reduced by zzso and zzso and zzso the present data suggest that zzso produces zzso by acting in an zzso manner on functional, and possibly different, zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso zzso are coupled to release of zzso oxide, zzso of zzso zzso and promotion of zzso through large zzso zzso zzso channels in rat main zzso
