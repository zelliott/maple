The most common application of zzso technology in disease research is to identify genes zzso expressed in disease versus normal zzso However, it is known that, in complex diseases, zzso are determined not only by zzso but also by the underlying structure of genetic zzso Often, it is the interaction of many genes that causes zzso zzso 

In this work, using cancer as an example, we develop zzso methods to integrate multiple zzso zzso to discover zzso zzso network zzso We propose an zzso method that take into account both zzso dynamics and network zzso information to simultaneously zzso network zzso and zzso conditions in which they are activated or zzso Using our method, we have discovered network zzso specific to cancer or zzso of zzso Many of these zzso are consistent with or supported by their functional zzso or their previously known involvement in zzso In particular, we identified a module that is predominately activated in breast cancer and is involved in tumor zzso While individual components of this module have been suggested to be associated with tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been zzso Here by adopting a network perspective, we have identified their zzso and, particularly, a hub gene zzso that may play an important role in this tumor zzso zzso 

Using a network-based approach, our method provides new insights into the complex cellular mechanisms that characterize cancer and cancer zzso By incorporating zzso dynamics information, our approach can not only extract more functionally homogeneous zzso than those based solely on network zzso but also reveal zzso coordination beyond zzso
