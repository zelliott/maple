zzso zzso have been demonstrated to act through both zzso and zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso rapidly suppressed the activity of zzso zzso receptors in cultured zzso zzso The effect was maintained with zzso zzso to bovine serum zzso and blocked by zzso of G protein activity with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso production, activated zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the downstream zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso prevented the actions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso caused a decrease in zzso zzso Application of zzso partly reversed the zzso of zzso currents caused by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly suppressed long-term zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso within 30 zzso in zzso implicating the possibly zzso significance of rapid effects of zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso act on a putative G zzso zzso to activate multiple signaling pathways in zzso zzso and the rapid suppression of zzso activity by zzso is dependent on zzso and downstream zzso
