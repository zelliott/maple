zzso has been shown to be involved in cancer progression in a variety of tumor types, and regulates multiple zzso signaling zzso it is a representative zzso that activates a zzso zzso signaling zzso The mechanism governing how zzso determines the specificity of these pathways and the relationship with zzso is still zzso In this study, we aimed to clarify the tumor zzso role of zzso in zzso In particular, we focused on zzso functioning as a zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso expression increased zzso expression in zzso cells and zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso Also, zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso experiments were performed to determine whether zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso binding with zzso and zzso in zzso treated zzso zzso zzso had no effect on total zzso expression levels, but regulated zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso was associated with suppression of zzso zzso activity and zzso the expression of zzso zzso a downstream target gene of the zzso zzso signaling zzso We zzso that zzso plays the role of a tumor zzso in zzso through the zzso zzso signaling zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso
