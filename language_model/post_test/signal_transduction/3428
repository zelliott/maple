Since zzso of inflammation are associated with insulin resistance, and the risk of developing diabetes zzso and zzso diabetes, we hypothesized that genetic variation in members of the inflammatory gene zzso impact zzso levels and related zzso in zzso We evaluated this hypothesis by testing for association between genetic zzso in 31 inflammatory zzso genes in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a large multiethnic zzso study designed to address the impact of zzso less than overt diabetes on pregnancy zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured in blood samples obtained from zzso participants during an oral zzso tolerance test at zzso weeks zzso We tested for association between zzso zzso mapping to 31 genes in the inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso in zzso European ancestry and zzso Thai pregnant zzso The strongest evidence for association was observed with zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso increase per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease per zzso G, zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the genes surveyed in this study the inflammatory zzso is unlikely to have a strong impact on maternal zzso zzso in pregnancy although variation in individual members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso in pregnant zzso
