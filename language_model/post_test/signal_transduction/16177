The adult stem cell marker zzso and its relative zzso are often zzso in zzso zzso zzso We find that conditional deletion of both genes in the mouse gut zzso zzso target gene expression and results in the rapid demise of zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso demonstrates that zzso and zzso associate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Each of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso -5 and zzso In zzso cells, zzso enhances zzso zzso signals initiated by zzso zzso of zzso does not affect zzso zzso but abrogates the zzso signal enhancement, a phenomenon rescued by zzso of zzso -5 or zzso zzso deletion of zzso in mouse zzso zzso cultures zzso withdrawal of zzso and can be rescued by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso components that mediate zzso signal enhancement by soluble zzso zzso These results will guide future studies towards the application of zzso for zzso purposes of zzso expressing zzso zzso
