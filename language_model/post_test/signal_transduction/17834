zzso signals are known to contribute to zzso memory T cell zzso but an exact understanding of the zzso has remained zzso We have now investigated the role of zzso proteins in this zzso Whereas zzso and zzso zzso mice have decreased numbers of zzso T cells, zzso mice have an increased number of these zzso zzso mice exhibit increased zzso cell death of zzso T cells and zzso proliferation and zzso expression in zzso T cells, providing a basis for this zzso Moreover, zzso memory T cells are substantially affected by zzso zzso These findings identify zzso proteins as critical signaling zzso used by zzso to regulate zzso T cell zzso
