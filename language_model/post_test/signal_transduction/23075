zzso of the zzso virus zzso zzso genes activates cell cycle progression and drives zzso of the infected zzso In contrast, progression of the zzso replication program occurs most efficiently in zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso can induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the tumor zzso zzso and cell growth zzso Moreover, zzso induction of growth arrest occurs independently of its zzso zzso zzso Here we show that substitution of zzso basic DNA binding domain with the analogous region of the zzso zzso zzso abrogates zzso ability to induce growth arrest and to induce zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interactions between this region of zzso and key cell cycle control proteins are involved in signaling cell cycle zzso We also show that despite the crucial role for zzso basic domain in zzso cell growth arrest, its zzso zzso is required for efficient induction of zzso and it zzso the level of zzso zzso zzso we provide evidence that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso occur, at least in part, through distinct zzso zzso zzso interacts with multiple growth arrest zzso a property which may have evolved partly as a means to ensure that zzso replication occurs in a zzso setting in multiple different zzso in various states of zzso
