The zzso of the plague agent zzso zzso is largely due to the injection of zzso proteins that zzso block immune responses into host cells through a type III zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso has been reported to act by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso fusion proteins to directly zzso cells expressing zzso we found instead that zzso triggered rapid cell death that can be blocked by zzso zzso and zzso but was not dependent on zzso The zzso zzso promoted by zzso was only seen in cells with other features of zzso and was blocked by zzso zzso indicating that zzso filament disruption is likely to be a result, rather than a cause of zzso zzso A region including zzso zzso in zzso was sufficient for inducing zzso independent of zzso to the plasma zzso These data suggest that zzso can act as a direct zzso of cell zzso
