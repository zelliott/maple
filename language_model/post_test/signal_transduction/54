To investigate the mechanism of zzso resistance in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Although zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso has only a limited zzso effect on zzso 

The effects of zzso on the zzso status of zzso and zzso downstream in its signaling cascade were examined in three zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso The changes in signaling zzso and cell survival that were induced by zzso in combination with either the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso of zzso expression by transient zzso with zzso small interfering zzso were examined in zzso zzso 

zzso alone did not significantly reduce cell viability in any of the examined cell zzso Although in each line, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso and was not inhibited by even 10 zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso used in combination with either zzso or the zzso of zzso zzso and the viability of zzso cells was suppressed significantly by zzso used in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso activated zzso might prevent the zzso efficacy of zzso in zzso cell zzso and the therapeutic effectiveness of zzso might be improved by zzso zzso zzso
