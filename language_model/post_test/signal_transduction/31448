Many studies have shown a role of zzso zzso in zzso outgrowth in zzso and that the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is critical for this zzso We show here that zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso 200 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that these zzso extend zzso in response to zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso has a role in zzso outgrowth in zzso by showing that in a peripheral nerve crush model there is less zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso We identify sonic zzso zzso as a downstream target of the zzso zzso zzso as it is expressed in the injured zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso This regulation is direct as when zzso is zzso in adult zzso zzso is induced in zzso Finally we show that zzso alone cannot induce zzso outgrowth but zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
