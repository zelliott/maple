zzso depletion zzso causes a rise in zzso level of zzso calcium zzso of pancreatic zzso a decrease in their zzso and zzso zzso content, a reduction in the maximum zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso impaired zzso calcium signal and decreased zzso insulin zzso The sequence of events that lead to these zzso during the evolution of zzso are not zzso The present study examined this issue by measuring the zzso and functional profile of pancreatic zzso weekly during the evolution of zzso over a period of 6 weeks, and whether zzso zzso reverses these zzso The results show that initial abnormalities are a rise in zzso of zzso zzso and modest rise in zzso zzso This was followed by a fall in zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the fall in zzso content, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreases and the rise in zzso becomes more zzso A decrease in zzso insulin zzso becomes evident with the fall in zzso the decrease in zzso calcium zzso and/or zzso All functional and zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso returned to normal after zzso zzso Taken together, our data are consistent with the notion that zzso is associated with an initial increase in calcium influx into the zzso This is followed by modest but significant rise in zzso which, in turn, would inhibit zzso zzso and zzso generation leading to a decrease in zzso zzso The latter compromises the activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are involved, directly or zzso in calcium zzso out of the zzso The increased influx of calcium combined with decreased calcium zzso is followed by a further rise in zzso levels of zzso This sequence of events continues until a steady state is reached and is characterized by reduced zzso and zzso zzso content, reduced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and elevated zzso level of zzso zzso zzso reverses all these zzso
