The transforming growth factor zzso family member myostatin is an important regulator of zzso zzso and zzso growth and zzso but the signaling mechanisms remain to be zzso We therefore determined the contribution of myostatin type I receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and -5 zzso and different zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells, and zzso zzso as well as in primary zzso and zzso We performed zzso zzso of each zzso and measured signaling activity using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as zzso We find that myostatin zzso zzso in zzso whereas it has a preference for zzso in zzso zzso zzso our results show that zzso zzso is expressed in zzso but not in the zzso cells and that it regulates myostatin zzso More specifically, myostatin requires zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso signaling is zzso zzso zzso myostatin signaling is dependent on both zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso signaling is solely zzso by the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso showing its importance in myostatin zzso Together, our results identify a molecular mechanism that explains the zzso specific aspects of signaling by myostatin and other zzso family zzso
