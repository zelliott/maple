zzso is the only known circulating zzso hormone that increases food intake and promotes zzso and these zzso functions of zzso are zzso through its zzso growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a crucial role in energy zzso Old zzso zzso mice exhibit a healthy zzso and insulin zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso mice have increased energy zzso yet exhibit no difference in food intake or locomotor activity compared to zzso zzso We have found that zzso is expressed in brown zzso tissue zzso of old zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decline in zzso exhibiting a higher core body zzso Indeed, the BAT of old zzso zzso mice reveals enhanced zzso capacity, which is consistent with the gene expression profile of increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The data collectively suggest that zzso signaling has important roles in zzso The recent discovery that BAT also regulates energy zzso in adult humans makes the BAT a new zzso zzso zzso the roles and molecular mechanisms of zzso in zzso is of great zzso zzso zzso might be a novel means of combating obesity by shifting zzso balance from zzso to zzso
