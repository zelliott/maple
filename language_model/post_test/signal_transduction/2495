zzso exerts multiple biological actions through one of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This review focuses on new developments regarding the structure and function of the zzso zzso In addition to the important role this zzso plays in stimulating gastric acid zzso recent studies have demonstrated that it is also involved in regulating gastrointestinal zzso and zzso zzso The potential role of the zzso zzso in regulating cell growth and differentiation has also been added to the list of actions this zzso zzso may exert in both normal and transformed zzso zzso cloning of the gene indicates that it has the structural characteristics of a zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of this zzso reveal the presence of key zzso acids within the third and fifth zzso zzso that are critical for zzso zzso zzso approaches have also shed light on the structural components of the zzso zzso important in regulating zzso and zzso Although the zzso zzso was classically thought to couple to the zzso zzso pathway, recent work with the cloned zzso indicates that it can also activate the zzso signaling cascade through an independent G zzso zzso The novel observation that zzso may stimulate zzso gene expression lends further support to the possible role of this zzso in regulating cell growth and zzso
