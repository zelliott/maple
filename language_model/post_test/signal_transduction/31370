zzso zzso zzso is defective in numerous zzso individuals, many of whom contain functional disruption of the zzso 1 zzso zzso Although this suggested a critical role for the zzso zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso in this response, a genetically controlled system has been lacking in which to determine the precise role of zzso Here we show that ultraviolet light zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso but fails to stimulate pigmentation in the absence of functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, pigmentation could be rescued by topical application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso without the need for ultraviolet light, demonstrating that the pigmentation machinery is available despite the absence of functional zzso This chemically induced pigmentation was protective against zzso zzso DNA damage and zzso when tested in the zzso zzso genetic zzso These data emphasize the essential role of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso response, and suggest a clinical strategy for topical zzso manipulation of zzso
