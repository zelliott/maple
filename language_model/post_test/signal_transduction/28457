zzso is the result of a refined interplay among various zzso molecules that process spatial and zzso zzso Here we present a modular scheme of the complex interactions between the front and the back of cells that allows them to zzso First, at the front of the cell, activated zzso zzso induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso is produced in a patch at the leading edge, where it binds zzso zzso which enhance zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso Third, in zzso zzso a zzso cascade has been identified that regulates zzso filament formation in the zzso of the cell, thereby zzso the formation of lateral zzso that could zzso the zzso
