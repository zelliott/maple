The speed at which zzso zzso fuse with the plasma membrane is a key zzso for zzso and zzso zzso We determined the precise time courses for fusion of small clear and large zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells by simultaneously measuring both plasma membrane areas and release of zzso zzso We found that instantaneous increases in zzso zzso concentration evoked zzso fusion, but with time zzso that varied over four orders of magnitude among different types of zzso and zzso This indicates that the molecular machinery for the final zzso fusion steps of zzso is highly variable and is as critical as zzso zzso processes in determining the speed and amount of zzso of zzso and zzso Our results suggest a new possibility that the molecules responsible for the final fusion reaction that leads to zzso fusion are key zzso for zzso plasticity and hormonal zzso
