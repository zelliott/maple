The membrane protein composition of the primary zzso a key sensory zzso is zzso regulated during zzso signaling zzso zzso During zzso zzso membrane zzso along with structural and signaling zzso are carried through the zzso intensely studied zzso diffusion barrier at the base of the zzso zzso by zzso transport zzso zzso A favored model is that zzso zzso of previously excluded membrane proteins in fully formed zzso zzso also requires zzso but direct evidence is zzso Here, in studies of regulated entry of a membrane protein into the zzso of zzso we show that cells use an zzso mechanism to breach the diffusion barrier at the zzso zzso In resting cells, a zzso signaling component zzso the integral membrane zzso zzso is zzso distributed over the plasma membrane and excluded from the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling triggers zzso striking zzso of the protein to the zzso ends of the cells zzso with entry into the zzso zzso polarization and zzso enrichment are facilitated by zzso zzso Using a conditional zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso machinery is not required for regulated zzso entry into zzso Thus, integral membrane proteins can negotiate passage through the zzso diffusion barrier without the need for a zzso
