A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches was used to investigate the role of zzso zzso as a potential trigger for zzso zzso Experimental observations of detachment in a variety of zzso systems were made with pure cultures of zzso zzso These observations indicated that zzso grown under zzso conditions detached after flow was stopped, that hollow cell clusters were sometimes observed in zzso grown in flow cells, and that zzso cells were apparent in the internal strata of colony zzso When zzso were zzso starved under zzso conditions, detachment still occurred, suggesting that zzso and not the zzso of a zzso product was responsible for triggering detachment in this particular zzso A cellular zzso computer model of zzso dynamics was used to explore the zzso detachment zzso The model predicted zzso structures and dynamics that were zzso similar to those observed zzso The predicted features included centrally located voids appearing in sufficiently large cell zzso zzso in growth rate within these zzso and the release of most of the zzso with simulated zzso zzso The model was also able to predict zzso zzso resulting solely from this detachment zzso These results support the conjecture that zzso zzso is an environmental cue for the release of microbes from a zzso
