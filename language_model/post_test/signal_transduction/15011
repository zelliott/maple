zzso zzso cells zzso have been used in a wide variety of zzso experiments and in an increasing number of human clinical zzso Although many of these studies have shown different levels of zzso the exact fate of zzso after transplantation and the tissue response to their zzso have not been investigated in zzso In the present work we studied the distribution of human zzso in a rat hind limb zzso injury model immediately after transplantation and also analyzed the recipient tissue response to transplanted zzso 

We tracked the in zzso fate of the transplanted zzso utilizing zzso imaging, zzso zzso and zzso expression analysis in a rat hind limb zzso zzso We also monitored the viability of transplanted cells by graft versus recipient expression analysis and determined the zzso and zzso effect of transplantation by zzso zzso 

According to imaging analysis only a small portion of cells persisted for an extended period of time at the site of zzso Interestingly, recipient versus graft expression studies showed increased synthesis of zzso zzso factors and no zzso zzso or protein synthesis in transplanted zzso More importantly, despite the lack of robust zzso or growth factor zzso the transplantation procedure exerted a significant zzso and zzso effect, which was zzso by zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

Our results show an immediate zzso tissue effect in response to zzso transplantation that may represent a novel indirect zzso mechanism for the beneficial effects of cell transplantation observed in injured zzso
