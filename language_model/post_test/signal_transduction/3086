Sensitive sensory mechanisms are instrumental in zzso zzso zzso the capacity to establish diverse yet severe human infections, which can manifest themselves in long-term zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to tightly regulate gene expression and zzso factor production, in response to zzso of these sensory zzso enables the pathogen to sustain infection despite the host immune response and aggressive zzso zzso Although a number of factors are recognized as playing a role in early infection, very little is known regarding the sensors involved in this zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso sensor that plays a key role during zzso zzso interactions and is required for optimum colonization and dissemination in a mouse model of zzso We demonstrated that zzso contributed to zzso of the type III zzso system zzso in response to host cells and zzso conditions in zzso zzso zzso zzso acted in concert with the response regulator zzso to regulate the zzso transport system and subsequently carbon zzso Through this signal zzso pathway, zzso zzso was zzso via the zzso regulatory cascade and involved the global zzso response regulator zzso
