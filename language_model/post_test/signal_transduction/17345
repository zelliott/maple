This study was undertaken to gain better insights into the role of zzso and zzso in the development and differentiation of memory B cells, especially of zzso during the zzso polarized memory response induced by zzso Our in zzso findings demonstrated that the zzso zzso production is dependent on zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso acts as zzso accelerating the synthesis of high zzso Also, zzso zzso modulated the migration of zzso B cells zzso and zzso out of the zzso zzso and the zzso from the zzso of zzso and B2 zzso zzso zzso modulated the zzso from the zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso triggered to the zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso regulates the degree of expansion of zzso in the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso as well as of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regulated the intensity of the expansion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Finally, zzso signals sustained the longevity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling supported the persistence of B2 cells in zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso differentiated zzso zzso required the cooperation of both signals through zzso via zzso for longevity in zzso whereas zzso required only zzso to stay in zzso and zzso zzso rested in zzso dependent on zzso zzso Our data sustain that earlier events on memory B cells differentiation induced in secondary immune response against zzso after secondary zzso zzso influx and zzso may be the key to determining peripheral zzso of zzso B cells and memory B cells as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
