zzso sorting signals direct zzso proteins to the compartments of the zzso zzso zzso signals present within the zzso tails of sorting zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The VHS zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso proteins are responsible for the highly specific recognition of these zzso zzso Here we report the structures of the VHS domain of human zzso zzso with signals from both zzso zzso The signals bind in an extended zzso to zzso 6 and 8 of the VHS zzso The structures highlight an zzso zzso separated by two zzso from a zzso sequence as critical recognition zzso The side chains of the zzso sequence interact with zzso consisting of one zzso and two shallow zzso pockets, zzso The rigid spatial alignment of the three binding zzso leads to high zzso
