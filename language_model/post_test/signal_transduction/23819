This study aims to zzso the zzso mechanisms by which zzso zzso maintains a normal level of zzso genes during colon cancer zzso We have reported that soy protein isolate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the reduction of zzso zzso in rat zzso We hypothesized that zzso and zzso induced zzso modifications on zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppressing their gene expression induced by zzso zzso a chemical zzso to the similar level as that of zzso zzso We identified that in the zzso period, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso at the promoter region of zzso zzso and zzso which paralleled with the reduced binding of zzso zzso zzso Nuclear level of zzso zzso 3 was enhanced by zzso and zzso The diets suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso of the specific region of zzso zzso and zzso genes was increased by zzso and zzso which was zzso correlated with the reduction of gene zzso zzso sequencing further confirmed that dietary zzso induced DNA zzso at zzso island of the promoter region of zzso zzso this region includes a zzso that had decreased zzso Here, we present a potential zzso mechanism by which dietary zzso controls the responses of zzso genes during zzso zzso which involves DNA zzso zzso modifications and their interactions at the regulatory region of zzso
