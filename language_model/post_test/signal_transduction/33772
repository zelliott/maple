The zzso zone zzso is a major site of zzso in the zzso We now show that zzso and zzso cells in the adult mouse zzso express zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit the proliferation of cultured neural stem cells, and the proliferation of zzso cells in young zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso stimulate zzso cell proliferation in zzso with this effect being more pronounced in older zzso A similar response was seen with a fatty acid zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that limits degradation of zzso The effects on proliferation were mirrored in changes in the number of zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso bulb zzso In this context, zzso zzso reduced the number of newborn zzso appearing in the zzso in the young adult animals while zzso zzso zzso this in older zzso These data identify zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as agents that can counteract the naturally observed decline in adult zzso that is associated with zzso
