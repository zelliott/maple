zzso a regulator of zzso zzso has recently been linked to vascular zzso and zzso Whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells leading to vascular zzso in hypertension remains zzso The present study was designed to analyze the correlation of zzso and vascular zzso during hypertension and to evaluate the role of zzso in proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and the underlying zzso The vascular zzso and the expression of zzso in zzso zzso of spontaneously zzso rats and zzso rats were zzso The zzso expression was significantly increased zzso with zzso vascular zzso by evaluating the media zzso zzso diameter, media zzso diameter ratio and mean nuclear area in artery media in spontaneously zzso rats, which was inhibited by treatment with zzso In cultured rat zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso II induced zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso using small hairpin zzso inhibited zzso zzso proliferation of zzso Moreover, blockade of zzso signaling zzso also inhibited zzso zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates the proliferation of zzso induced by zzso II via zzso of zzso II type 1 zzso signaling pathway, which may contribute to vascular zzso in zzso
