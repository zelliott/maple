zzso zzso induction of zzso expression is associated with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, zzso and zzso cells with stable zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso in zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell line which expressed low levels of zzso were used to explored how zzso zzso zzso and the role of zzso in zzso zzso First, we demonstrate that zzso induced zzso zzso and protein expressions, as well as activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso both, reduced zzso cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso zzso Both, zzso and zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso induction and promoter zzso We further examined the role of zzso and zzso in the induction of zzso expression using the zzso fusion zzso which consisted of a zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and either zzso zzso or zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could induced zzso expression and promoter zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso through the zzso pathway, and that zzso and zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso of zzso
