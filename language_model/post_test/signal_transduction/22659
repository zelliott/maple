Although previous studies have shown that members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso family are expressed in the zzso zzso the functions of these growth factors in zzso remain zzso In order to shed light on the mechanisms of zzso action in zzso it is crucial to determine whether and where their downstream signaling molecules are expressed in the zzso We examined the expression of zzso an zzso signal zzso of the zzso in mouse zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso and protein were detected in zzso germ cells, from zzso to zzso zzso but not in zzso germ zzso zzso expression was also observed in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso our data provide molecular evidence for zzso signal zzso during zzso
