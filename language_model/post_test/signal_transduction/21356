The zzso zzso I zzso and zzso have well established functions in the polarization of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso of the G zzso zzso zzso A number of results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso I motor head by the zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso is required for the organization of the zzso zzso However, the role of this signaling cascade in the zzso zzso has not been zzso Interestingly, we find that zzso zzso site zzso is not required for slow, zzso zzso of zzso but it is essential for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Our results strongly suggest that a zzso activates the zzso I to sustain fast zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, despite the fact that only zzso zzso are known to zzso the zzso zzso site, we find that these zzso are not essential for zzso zzso of zzso Our observations indicate that a different signaling zzso involving the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and serum and zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate zzso and zzso for their zzso zzso
