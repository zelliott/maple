The zzso zzso infectious cycle requires that the zzso adapt to vast differences in environmental conditions found in its tick and zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso accomplishes this accommodation in part by regulating expression of its surface zzso zzso surface protein A zzso is a zzso protein important in colonization of the tick zzso zzso is zzso when the zzso is in its tick host and zzso when it is in a zzso zzso However, little is known about how it is zzso again in a zzso host in preparation for entry into a feeding zzso Here, we report that the host neuroendocrine stress hormones, zzso and zzso are specifically bound by zzso zzso and result in increased expression of zzso This recognition is specific and blocked by competitive zzso of human zzso zzso To determine whether recognition of zzso which are likely to be present at the site of a tick zzso may play a role in preparing the zzso for zzso into a tick from a zzso host, we administered a zzso blocker, zzso to infected zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso of zzso zzso by feeding ticks and decreased expression of zzso in zzso zzso recovered from ticks that fed on zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso may co-opt host neuroendocrine signals to inform the zzso of local changes that predict the presence of its next host and allow it to prepare for transition to a new zzso
