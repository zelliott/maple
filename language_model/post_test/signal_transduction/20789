Vitamin A derivatives zzso affect a large variety of fundamental biological zzso zzso of the signaling mechanism has been greatly advanced by the cloning of specific zzso zzso These regulatory proteins belong to the zzso hormone nuclear zzso zzso Two types of zzso receptors have been identified, the zzso acid receptors zzso zzso beta and zzso and the zzso X receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similar to the steroid hormone zzso the zzso receptors bind to specific DNA sequences that have zzso zzso However, the zzso require zzso with zzso for efficient DNA binding and gene regulation, while the zzso can bind to DNA and function as zzso in the presence of zzso zzso In addition, zzso can form zzso with zzso hormone receptors and the vitamin D3 zzso and other zzso Thus the zzso have a very central role in serving as a partner for several hormone and vitamin receptors and thus may allow cross talk between different hormone zzso zzso responses can be restricted by the zzso orphan receptors which bind to overlapping DNA zzso Besides the classical way of action via DNA zzso the zzso receptors can also interfere with other signaling pathways by interacting with the zzso factor zzso The advances made in understanding the mechanism of action of zzso promise to contribute to the understanding and control of zzso responses and zzso
