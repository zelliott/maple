We previously reported that primary zzso cells treated with zzso E zzso or an zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso via zzso zzso Here, we examined if the effects observed in zzso were observed in zzso Similar to our observations in primary zzso in zzso we found that injections of zzso zzso into the rat zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso However, the time course of these effects was slower in zzso zzso analysis of the tissue showed prominently increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso in zzso cells throughout the zzso particularly in the zzso zzso To determine if zzso was zzso by zzso we zzso fluorescent zzso with the zzso and injected them into the rat zzso After 7 days, the zzso were present in zzso We also examined the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and full-length zzso and zzso increased zzso fragments of zzso and zzso after a single injection, multiple injections, and chronic infusion zzso zzso produced higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso fragments than zzso These results demonstrate that zzso alters zzso and zzso processing in zzso The increase in zzso zzso is consistent with a role for zzso in a zzso response to stress, and the decrease in zzso zzso suggests that zzso may have zzso effects, over several zzso
