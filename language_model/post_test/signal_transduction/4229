The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso develops from the three zzso precursor cells zzso that are induced by a signal from the zzso anchor zzso This signal is thought to be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso to a downstream signal zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been found to be one of the major components of an zzso zzso in other zzso We expressed a wild type and an activated zzso of zzso a zzso zzso in each of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of an activated from of zzso in each of the zzso effectively induced a normal, functional zzso that is, suppressed the zzso zzso The wild type zzso also suppressed albeit less zzso These results suggest that a zzso is involved in the zzso induction of zzso zzso
