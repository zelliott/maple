It is known that excessive zzso contributes to zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso committed zzso into zzso may be a potential zzso approach for zzso We explored whether bone zzso protein 9 zzso could induce zzso zzso to zzso into zzso zzso effectively increased expression of zzso markers and promoted zzso in zzso However, zzso also led to zzso differentiation of zzso as evidenced by increased zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In order to regulate the switch between zzso and zzso we evaluated the effect of zzso zzso acid zzso on zzso differentiation of zzso We found that zzso enhanced zzso zzso differentiation and blocked zzso zzso differentiation both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was shown to elevate zzso expression and activate zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso exerted a synergistic effect on zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso alkaline zzso activity and reversed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and promoted zzso zzso and inhibited expression of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso that zzso zzso zzso function, suggesting that zzso signaling was activated at least partly through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso differentiation of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso may be explored as an effective therapeutic strategy for zzso
