The present study was performed to investigate the underlying zzso particularly the roles of zzso oxygen species zzso and protein zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso transient zzso potential 6 zzso zzso We found that high zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso protein expression in cultured zzso cells zzso zzso protein was also significantly reduced in the zzso but not in the heart or zzso isolated from zzso diabetic zzso In the cultured zzso zzso suppressed zzso protein expression in a zzso and zzso manner, which zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were able to prevent the zzso effect of zzso on zzso The zzso effect observed in cultured cells was also observed in diabetic rats treated with zzso for 2 zzso which exhibited a preservation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a component of zzso zzso increased zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not its analog zzso 12, zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and this zzso effect was not affected by zzso Moreover, zzso but not zzso attenuated the negative effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso effect on zzso Furthermore, either zzso of zzso or zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso contraction, and the zzso zzso contraction was rescued by zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso in diabetes zzso zzso protein expression in zzso through a zzso zzso zzso pathway, proving a mechanism for impaired zzso contraction in zzso
