zzso I zzso is a zzso protein complex located in the zzso zzso of green plants and algae, where it zzso one of the first steps of solar energy conversion by zzso electron zzso In this review, we discuss recent progress on several topics related to the functioning of the zzso complex, like the protein composition of the complex in the plant zzso zzso the function of these zzso and the mechanism by which zzso zzso can be inserted into or transported through the zzso zzso Furthermore, the structure of the native zzso complex in several zzso zzso organisms and the role of the zzso and zzso in the antenna complexes in light harvesting and zzso are zzso The special role of the zzso zzso zzso molecules that absorb at longer wavelength than the primary electron donor zzso is zzso The physiology and mechanism of the association of the major zzso complex of zzso II zzso with zzso during short term adaptation to changes in light quality and quantity is discussed in functional and structural zzso The mechanism of zzso energy transfer between the zzso and the mechanism of primary charge separation is outlined and zzso Finally, a number of regulatory processes like zzso responses and retrograde zzso is reviewed with respect to function of the zzso zzso We finish this review by shortly discussing the perspectives for future research on zzso
