zzso cancer zzso is the most common zzso in zzso Despite high response rates and clinical benefits, zzso therapy is ineffective for advanced or relapsed PC because of the emergence of aggressive zzso prostate cancer zzso Through our zzso gene expression analysis of PC cells zzso from clinical zzso zzso we here identified a novel molecular target, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which was zzso specifically in zzso and aggressive zzso zzso analysis confirmed its zzso in zzso and its strong correlation with high zzso scores of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in drastic growth suppression of PC cells, and, zzso zzso introduction of zzso into PC cells enhanced their growth and zzso We found the direct interaction between zzso and zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and showed that zzso of zzso in PC cells diminished the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso also decreased the zzso level of zzso at zzso in PC cells, and zzso zzso introduction enhanced zzso zzso in PC cells by incorporating with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso validated the zzso zzso enhanced zzso of zzso at zzso by zzso zzso These findings show that zzso and zzso zzso can have critical functions of aggressive zzso of PCs through zzso zzso and that they should be a promising molecular target for PC zzso
