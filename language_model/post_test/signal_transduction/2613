The function of the temporally regulated B zzso zzso heavy chain zzso 3' zzso has been linked to the zzso class switch machinery, but the zzso zzso of zzso has not been zzso Following zzso of the zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso is zzso in the B zzso cell line zzso In both induced primary B zzso and zzso cells, the zzso zzso is zzso with the recruitment of a novel DNA binding complex, nuclear factor of activated B cells zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso which bind to a novel 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or stimulation by zzso in zzso cells demonstrates that the zzso zzso when linked to a zzso zzso can zzso a zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso expression is required for efficient zzso promoter activity in response to stimulation by zzso zzso Our results suggest a biological role for zzso in the regulation of zzso gene zzso attribute a functional role for zzso zzso proteins in B zzso and provide evidence for a direct link between zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso
