zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a separate entity of aggressive zzso lymphoma, characterized by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathway, also observed in zzso zzso Although many zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes have not been reported in zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and 20 of 55 zzso zzso cases harbor zzso zzso zzso in zzso DNA binding domain, whereas no zzso was found in 25 diffuse large zzso zzso zzso In 3 cases, zzso origin was indicated by the absence of the zzso in the zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso was different from the classical features of zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins showed a decreased DNA binding ability in zzso zzso cells, but no decrease in expression of zzso zzso target genes was observed in zzso cases with a zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso properties of zzso zzso proteins remain to be determined, their zzso selection in zzso strongly argues for their involvement in the zzso of this aggressive zzso zzso
