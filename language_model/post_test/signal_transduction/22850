The zzso zzso factor functions as both a zzso and an zzso of gene expression in the developing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso exhibits strict cell autonomy in zzso In contrast, zzso repression of zzso genes in zzso cells during seed development is determined by a combination of cell autonomous and cell zzso zzso To analyze signaling between the zzso and zzso during seed development, a zzso zzso zzso was used to create seed that has zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso of an zzso reporter gene in developing zzso zzso zzso cells strongly depends on the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the developing zzso in zzso zzso and zzso seeds through the introduction of an early zzso zzso caused a similar enhancement of zzso expression in the zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso present in normal seed is a critical source of zzso zzso Analysis of an zzso deficient zzso zzso double zzso indicates that zzso zzso in the zzso interacts zzso with zzso to prevent precocious induction of zzso genes in the zzso of the developing zzso A lack of zzso zzso however, does not account for the strongly synergistic interaction between a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso is a source of other zzso zzso
