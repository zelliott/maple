zzso D zzso has been reported to generate survival signals that prevent zzso induced by serum zzso We have now found that elevated expression of zzso also suppresses DNA zzso zzso Since DNA zzso zzso is often zzso by zzso we examined the effect of elevated zzso expression on the regulation of zzso zzso We report here that zzso suppresses DNA zzso increases in zzso stabilization in cells where zzso has been shown to provide a survival zzso zzso expression of zzso also led to increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased turnover of zzso zzso increases in zzso expression and suppression of zzso zzso were blocked by zzso of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso Although zzso did not activate the zzso zzso zzso survival zzso activate the zzso levels of zzso activity were partially required for zzso increases in zzso These data provide evidence that survival signals generated by zzso involve suppression of the zzso response zzso
