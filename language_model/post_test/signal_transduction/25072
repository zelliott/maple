zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso for central, zzso and sensory zzso In the mature zzso zzso treatment enhances survival of retinal zzso and zzso cells exposed to otherwise lethal zzso To understand its mechanism of action in zzso the adult rat zzso was used as a model to investigate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso an analog of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and produces delayed zzso of total zzso and zzso protein in rat zzso zzso zzso is predominantly localized in zzso of retinal zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso but not in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are localized predominantly if not exclusively in retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling prompted us to investigate zzso zzso after a variety of zzso conditioning zzso We show that zzso is activated in the zzso after exposure to zzso bright light, mechanical zzso and systemic administration of the zzso zzso zzso all of which have been shown previously to condition zzso to resist zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso directly stimulates zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and strongly suggest that zzso signaling is an underlying component of neural responsiveness to stress zzso The observation that zzso activates zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso suggests that zzso signaling influences zzso survival via both direct and indirect modes of zzso
