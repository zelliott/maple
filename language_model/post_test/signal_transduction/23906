The zzso adapter protein zzso is a critical component of multiple zzso signaling zzso in T cells that integrate zzso signaling events initiated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into more zzso zzso Given the important role ascribed to zzso signaling in directing the outcome of zzso selection, it seems likely that zzso may also function in signaling pathways that ultimately impact the establishment of the peripheral zzso zzso It is generally accepted that the peripheral zzso repertoire is selected in large part during zzso development in the zzso zzso interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso complexes expressed on zzso zzso elements dictate the fate of developing zzso zzso survival and further maturation zzso zzso require an active signal delivered to the cell as a consequence of zzso zzso This raises the intriguing question of how a zzso can, for a narrow window of zzso time, obtain responsiveness to self while maintaining tolerance to these same zzso upon export to the zzso This article reviews the current literature describing zzso signaling pathways in mature T cells and developing zzso A potential role for this critical signaling intermediate in zzso signals leading to positive and negative selection of the peripheral zzso repertoire is also zzso
