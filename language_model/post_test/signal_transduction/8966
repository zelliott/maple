The neural zzso of zzso forms when the bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso is zzso zzso we review the molecules that directly antagonize zzso zzso and the signaling pathways that further contribute to reduce zzso activity in the neural zzso zzso of neural zzso a large number of zzso fate zzso zzso zzso factors are expressed in the zzso neural zzso developing neural tube and ultimately in neural stem zzso zzso we review what is known about their activities during normal development to maintain a neural fate and regulate neural zzso Further zzso of how the zzso genes interact to regulate neural zzso and differentiation should ultimately prove useful for regulating the expansion and differentiation of neural stem and zzso zzso
