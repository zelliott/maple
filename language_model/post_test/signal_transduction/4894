Historically, the circulation was thought to be the primary source of zzso influencing skeletal zzso However, a growing body of research indicates that skeletal muscle expresses several zzso zzso including zzso The intramuscular expression of these zzso suggests that skeletal muscle is capable of zzso zzso zzso which could induce zzso effects via zzso zzso 

The aim of this brief review is to discuss recent research related to the zzso and zzso roles of zzso with particular focus on zzso as a zzso zzso 

Included in the review are 17 reviews and 58 original studies that were identified by a systematic review from zzso and deemed particularly relevant to our zzso zzso are summarized to provide an overview of zzso as a zzso of the zzso effects of zzso In particular, discussions are included regarding zzso zzso and zzso signaling within skeletal muscle, the effects of exercise on intramuscular zzso zzso and clinical applications of zzso and of a new class of zzso zzso termed selective zzso zzso zzso 

The ability of several peripheral zzso to zzso zzso zzso is well documented in the zzso zzso we zzso newer studies that demonstrate that 1) skeletal muscle has the capability to zzso both testosterone and zzso from zzso which is present in abundance within the zzso and 2) that exercise increases the expression of certain zzso zzso within zzso 

zzso zzso zzso have the potential to influence skeletal muscle via zzso zzso however, their exact role in skeletal muscle development and maintenance requires further zzso
