The adapter protein zzso regulates T zzso zzso and zzso We present evidence for a previously zzso function for zzso in regulating T cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso mouse T cells with zzso to zzso and zzso resulted in impaired nuclear zzso of zzso a reduced DNA zzso and delayed degradation and decreased zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso assembly of the zzso complex was substantially impaired in the absence of zzso We further identified a region of zzso that is required for association with the zzso adapter and zzso zzso but is not required for zzso regulation of zzso These findings provide new insights into zzso function and the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso in T zzso
