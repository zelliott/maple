zzso signaling has been reported to regulate three essential processes for the establishment of neural networks in different zzso zzso zzso migration, cell positioning and zzso zzso However, it is not known whether it regulates the development of zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso is expressed in the zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is present in zzso zzso precursors and zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso is activated in zzso cells as they migrate towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted migration and zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso of zzso at zzso in the zzso plate resulted in lateral migration, whereas expression in the zzso resulted in retention of zzso cells in the zzso close to the zzso Analysis of zzso mice revealed the presence of zzso zzso cells with disoriented processes in the intermediate zone zzso at zzso and marginal zone zzso at zzso zzso pharmacological blockade of zzso or genetic deletion of zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso cells in the lateral aspect of the zzso at zzso indicating that zzso is required for the zzso migration of zzso zzso in zzso Altogether, our findings demonstrate that zzso regulates the migration and orientation of processes in zzso zzso zzso
