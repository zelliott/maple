zzso are an zzso zzso group of zzso and zzso proteins that belong to the large zzso of zzso zzso While originally discovered in zzso as cell division cycle zzso with zzso zzso they are now known to have diverse cellular roles which include polarity determination, zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso trafficking, and zzso zzso proteins form zzso and zzso zzso which can assemble into zzso zzso They are also known to interact with components of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The precise role of zzso binding is not clear but a current model suggests that it is associated with zzso changes which alter binding to other zzso There are at least 12 human zzso zzso and although information on expression patterns is zzso most undergo complex alternative zzso with some degree of tissue zzso Nevertheless, an increasing body of data implicates the zzso family in the zzso of diverse disease states including zzso neurodegenerative conditions, and zzso Here the known zzso properties of zzso zzso are reviewed in the light of the data from zzso and other model zzso The data implicating zzso in human disease are considered and a model linking these data is zzso It is zzso that zzso can act as zzso scaffolds where the zzso of zzso associations, zzso zzso status, and the interactions with other proteins allow the regulation of key cellular processes including polarity zzso zzso of such zzso scaffolds thus explain the role of zzso in disease zzso
