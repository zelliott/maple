The processing and presentation of zzso by B zzso are initiated by zzso binding to the B cell zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we recently identified a compartment in B cells in which functional, processed zzso II complexes are formed following zzso zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso These studies, however, did not address the transport of zzso or zzso from the cell surface to the zzso zzso In this work, we describe the zzso trafficking of zzso and surface zzso zzso in B cells and evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on this zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso from the plasma zzso through zzso to the zzso class II zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso increases the rate of zzso of zzso and bound zzso but does not alter the trafficking zzso Thus, the delivery of zzso to the class II zzso compartment by the zzso is independent of zzso zzso but can be influenced by zzso zzso
