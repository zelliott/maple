The zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso is involved in lung tumor growth and zzso and agents that target this zzso have clinical potential for lung cancer zzso zzso a single potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed profound zzso of human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso wound healing, and invasion in lung tumor cells in zzso zzso mice that zzso human zzso in the airways were used to study the therapeutic efficacy of zzso for lung cancer zzso Mice were treated with the tobacco zzso zzso zzso over 4 zzso Beginning at week 3, zzso treatment with 100 mug zzso or zzso zzso control, zzso was initiated and continued through week zzso The mean number of tumors per mouse in the zzso group was significantly lower than in the control group zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso index was decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumors from zzso mice versus zzso mice, whereas extent of zzso was increased in these same tumors by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso expression was also significantly decreased by zzso in tumors from zzso mice versus zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso that arose in zzso transgenic animals despite zzso treatment were more likely to contain zzso zzso suggesting that targeting the zzso zzso may not be as effective if downstream signaling is activated by a zzso zzso These zzso results show that blocking the zzso interaction with a single zzso zzso delivered zzso can have profound zzso effects on development of lung zzso
