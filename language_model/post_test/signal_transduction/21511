The zzso of long-term zzso zzso in zzso area zzso requires gene expression and de zzso protein synthesis but it is expressed in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso theory proposes that gene products can only be captured and zzso at zzso that have been zzso by previous zzso The mechanisms underlying synaptic zzso and its activity zzso are largely zzso Previously, we reported that zzso stimulation zzso decreases the stability of zzso in a zzso manner by zzso synaptic zzso We show here that a zzso zzso zzso acid, blocked zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by prior zzso In addition, prior zzso zzso and zzso impaired chemically induced synaptic zzso zzso by zzso suggesting that there is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso signaling concurrent with zzso zzso We propose that prior zzso zzso expression of zzso by zzso synaptic tagging through its actions on the zzso zzso In support of this notion, we show that zzso slices from transgenic mice that have genetically reduced zzso zzso activity display impaired synaptic capture of zzso An inhibitor of zzso zzso also blocked synaptic capture of zzso Moreover, pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso can produce a synaptic tag to capture zzso zzso resulting in persistent synaptic zzso zzso our results show that zzso is critical for synaptic tagging and for zzso zzso zzso signaling can be constrained by prior episodes of synaptic activity to regulate subsequent zzso expression and perhaps control the integration of multiple synaptic events over zzso
