The zzso zzso zzso exhibits behavioral responses to many volatile zzso zzso toward one such zzso zzso zzso requires the function of a zzso zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso To determine directly whether zzso protein is an zzso zzso it is necessary to express the protein in a zzso system and show that it responds to zzso by zzso of a G protein signaling zzso Here we demonstrate that human cells expressing zzso on their surfaces exhibit a transient zzso in zzso zzso levels after zzso zzso zzso compounds that differ from zzso only by the addition of a zzso group zzso or the absence of a zzso group zzso are not zzso zzso zzso responses to these compounds are not dependent on zzso function, so zzso specificity in human cells resembles in zzso zzso The apparent affinity of zzso for zzso observed in human cells is consistent with the zzso concentration ranges that allow efficient zzso zzso zzso expressed in human cells also responds to two zzso compounds, zzso and zzso which are zzso precursors used for zzso production by certain bacterial zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso is due to release from zzso zzso
