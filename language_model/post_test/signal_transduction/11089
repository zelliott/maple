Whereas zzso are essential components in zzso other zzso seem to be involved in programmed cell zzso This study investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso proteins in tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso We report that zzso isolated from patients affected with zzso disease zzso having a deficient activity of almost all zzso zzso are resistant to the toxic effect of zzso These zzso cells exhibited a zzso in zzso zzso zzso Bid zzso and release of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression remained zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso derived from mice zzso for zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which develop an zzso zzso were also resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, correction of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using a medium enriched in zzso zzso enabled restoration of sensitivity to zzso This effect was blocked by zzso zzso but not by zzso B or L zzso Altogether, these findings suggest that some zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso As a matter of fact, zzso zzso zzso 1, a zzso zzso could sensitize zzso zzso to zzso These observations highlight the zzso zzso role of some zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso 1 in the zzso cascade triggered by zzso
