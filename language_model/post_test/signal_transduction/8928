zzso zzso in dental zzso is regularly exposed to cycles of zzso pH during the zzso of zzso dietary zzso The ability of zzso zzso to tolerate low pH is crucial for its zzso and zzso in dental zzso To better understand its acid tolerance mechanisms, we performed zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in response to an zzso pH zzso The preliminary results showed that adaptation of zzso zzso to pH zzso induced differential expression of nearly 14 % of the genes in the zzso including 169 zzso genes and 108 zzso zzso largely zzso into nine functional zzso One of the most interesting findings was that the genes zzso multiple zzso systems zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso during acid zzso zzso zzso confirmed the same trend in the expression profiles of these genes at pH zzso To determine the roles of these zzso systems in acid adaptation, zzso with a deletion of the zzso genes were constructed and zzso for the acid tolerance response zzso The results revealed that zzso of each of these systems resulted in a zzso that was impaired in zzso since zzso of these zzso to pH zzso did not induce the same level of protection against lethal pH levels as the parent zzso A competitive fitness zzso showed that all the zzso were unable to compete with the parent strain for persistence in zzso mixed cultures at zzso zzso although, with the exception of the zzso in zzso little effect was observed at neutral zzso The evidence from this study suggests that the multiple zzso are required for zzso zzso to orchestrate its signal zzso networks for optimal adaptation to zzso zzso
