zzso zzso and zzso acid were produced in guinea pig zzso in response to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Both responses were zzso but the former response to a zzso zzso was not at all, inhibited when the cellular zzso level was raised by zzso E1 combined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso influx without any effect on the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso respiratory burst was abolished when zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso or zzso but was not affected when zzso influx was zzso On the contrary, zzso released zzso acid from the cells treated with the zzso zzso zzso as well as from zzso cells, but it did not so when cellular zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso activated zzso zzso even in cells in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso and respiratory burst were both abolished by exposure of the cells to a permeable zzso zzso Thus, stimulation of zzso receptors gave rise to dual effects, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both effects were necessary for the zzso respiratory zzso zzso cellular zzso inhibited the respiratory burst and zzso acid release as a result of the inhibitions of zzso zzso and zzso influx, respectively, in zzso zzso
