zzso components of zzso zzso regulatory systems include zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso use these regulatory networks to channel environmental cues into zzso zzso A typical network is highly zzso using a specific zzso relay that connects particular signals to appropriate zzso Current understanding of zzso signal zzso includes zzso signal binding with the subsequent zzso changes being zzso via zzso zzso movements, into the sensory zzso zzso zzso These induced zzso changes bias the zzso regulatory zzso Although the zzso analyses reviewed here identify a role for the zzso region in zzso signal zzso no specific mechanism of zzso function has yet been zzso We propose a zzso zzso model for zzso function based on interactions between two putative zzso zzso The model attempts to explain both zzso zzso and hybrid sensor data, while accounting for recognized features of zzso zzso
