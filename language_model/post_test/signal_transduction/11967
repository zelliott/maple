zzso protein 2 zzso is known to play a major role in plant defense and general stress zzso Resistance against the zzso pathogen zzso zzso in zzso requires zzso acid zzso which promotes the deposition of zzso a zzso zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso in zzso deposition in relation to zzso treatment and challenge with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants and the knockout line indicated that zzso zzso affects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso showed zzso activity, and a considerable reduction in the zzso activity was observed in the leaf extract of the zzso knockout line compared with the zzso zzso zzso before challenge with zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of an zzso zzso gene zzso resulted in reduced zzso expression and increased zzso zzso We propose that zzso promotes zzso deposition through the zzso repression of zzso in zzso challenged by zzso and zzso zzso by itself is likely to act zzso on salicylic acid zzso defense zzso suggesting that zzso may function as a zzso of zzso and zzso defense zzso
