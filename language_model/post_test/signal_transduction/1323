Many cells cluster signaling complexes in plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso cells cluster all zzso signaling zzso including zzso at the zzso zzso The functional significance of such an arrangement is not known because of a lack of techniques for functional mapping of signaling complexes at plasma membrane zzso In the present work, we developed such a technique based on the use of two patch zzso a recording and a stimulating zzso zzso Including zzso zzso in the SP solution increased the zzso and the zzso to prevent leakage and formation of tight seals on the plasma zzso This allowed moving the SP between sites to stimulate multiple patches of the same cell and with the same zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso cells revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso signaling complexes at the zzso pole are much more sensitive to stimulation than those at the zzso zzso Furthermore, at zzso zzso zzso zzso signals could be evoked only by stimulation of membrane patches at the zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed that zzso waves were invariably initiated at the site of zzso membrane patch zzso suggesting that long range diffusion of second zzso is not obligatory to initiate and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present studies reveal a remarkable zzso in responsiveness of zzso signaling complexes at membrane zzso with the most responsive complexes confined to the zzso pole, probably to restrict the zzso signals to the site of zzso and allow the polarized functions of zzso zzso
