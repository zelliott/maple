zzso zzso is believed to zzso zzso functions relevant to zzso biology through the actions of zzso receptors zzso that in turn regulate the expression of target zzso The molecular effects of zzso action in bone remain to be fully zzso This study reports a zzso molecular and zzso analysis of the interaction between zzso and regulatory elements on the DNA of target genes in human primary zzso Of approximately zzso gene zzso surveyed in this study, a total of 375 genes were zzso and zzso genes were zzso on exposure to zzso with only 46 of these being direct target genes after 24 zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis discovered several pathways where zzso zzso multiple functionally linked zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso binding protein 4 located zzso response elements within the first zzso Using by zzso zzso we show a zzso and zzso recruitment of zzso factors to this newly identified regulatory zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that this zzso region acts as a functional promoter in human zzso Taken together, this analysis provides a comprehensive gene zzso profile and identifies several genes of potential zzso importance in controlling zzso signaling in primary zzso
