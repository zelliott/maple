zzso protein stability and turnover is a key task in the zzso Besides zzso zzso zzso degradation comprises the major zzso zzso in zzso zzso destined for degradation by the zzso are zzso by a zzso a zzso chain to a zzso through an extensively regulated zzso zzso The zzso proteins are subsequently targeted for degradation by the zzso zzso the major zzso machinery for zzso proteins in the zzso zzso can be considered as another zzso zzso modification and zzso comparable to zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso has multiple roles in addition to targeting proteins for zzso Depending on the number of zzso zzso and the linkages made, zzso also plays an important role in DNA repair, protein sorting and virus zzso zzso degradation of zzso or zzso stable zzso interfere with several regulatory zzso and the zzso zzso is affected in a number of diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and identifying proteins involved in conjunction with the signals required for specific degradation of certain zzso would help in developing novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases where the zzso zzso is zzso
