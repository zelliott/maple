We have shown previously that zzso zzso D3 zzso compounds, which have two side chains attached to zzso had increased zzso activities against breast, prostate and leukemia cell lines in comparison to zzso vitamin zzso This prompted us to zzso additional zzso compounds with further modifications and evaluate their zzso zzso Most effective in this series was zzso D3 zzso This analog was approximately zzso more potent than previously characterized zzso compounds in zzso the zzso growth of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Also in zzso cells, zzso caused zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso target zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were also inhibited by the analog as demonstrated by decreased zzso of both zzso zzso and the translation zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso decreased their rate of protein synthesis and increased the association of zzso with the translation initiation factor, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso represents a novel mechanism by which vitamin D3 zzso may zzso the expression and activity of proteins involved in cancer cell zzso
