We used zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and investigated the effects of an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso expression of bone zzso protein zzso antagonists, zzso and Dan, and addition of each of 10 zzso M zzso 10 zzso M zzso zzso M zzso and zzso M zzso significantly reversed the enhancement in zzso expression of zzso and Dan and zzso that of zzso in the cells zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly suppressed zzso in the cells, and addition of each of these agents significantly reversed the suppression of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso was involved in zzso zzso dysfunction, and that its zzso might promote bone formation through zzso and alleviate zzso zzso
