To analyze the function of zzso in cartilage formation, two types of primary zzso zzso and US cells, were prepared from zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions of chicken zzso zzso All the known components of chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in both cell types, but the expression level of zzso was much higher in zzso cells, which are rich in less mature zzso than US zzso In the zzso the expression level of zzso was also lower in the zzso or zzso zzso than in zzso zzso When US cells were treated with zzso hormone zzso which prevented maturation as judged from the zzso markers such as alkaline zzso and type X zzso the expression levels of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso To analyze the possible relationship between differentiation status and expression levels of zzso family zzso they were zzso introduced into the entire population of US cells within 2 days by using high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers in US cells were specifically lowered by zzso expression of zzso or zzso to similar levels to those of zzso cells or US cells treated with zzso When US cells were infected with the virus zzso a dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso maturation markers were moderately increased 10 days after zzso The potent induction of alkaline zzso activity in US cells by zzso zzso acid was zzso by zzso expression of either zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso family proteins zzso regulate the maturation process of zzso
