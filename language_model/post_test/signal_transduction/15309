Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso cells were treated with heat stress for 4 weeks with short duration (15 zzso heat shock every alternate day in zzso It was observed that zzso 70 and the zzso zzso zzso became zzso during the chronic heat stress zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso became zzso by chronic heat stress zzso zzso exposure to zzso a potent and specific zzso inhibitor drastically inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, exposure to zzso also blocked the increase in zzso and zzso levels and the elevated zzso activity brought about by chronic heat zzso Heat shock factor 1 zzso zzso activity and nuclear zzso of zzso were prominently zzso by chronic heat stress, and this amplification is markedly reduced by zzso exposure to zzso Also, zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were observed on exposure to heat shock for a single exposure of longer duration (40 zzso zzso against zzso notably reduced zzso zzso by single exposure to heat stress and drastically diminished the rise in zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso against zzso also eliminated the zzso in zzso and zzso levels but zzso levels remained zzso Heat stress produced zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the increase in zzso of zzso amplification of zzso and zzso levels by heat zzso zzso we conclude that heat zzso zzso which in turn activated zzso zzso acted downstream of zzso to increase zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso injury of the skin over a long period of time has been associated with development of zzso zzso Also, in many zzso the zzso genes zzso and zzso have been found to be zzso zzso we considered it important to identify the signaling elements upstream of the zzso survival genes in heat zzso We conclude that heat stress activated zzso which in turn activated zzso zzso zzso an zzso in zzso and zzso levels working downstream of zzso
