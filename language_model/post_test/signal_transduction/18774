zzso represents a critical component in zzso B cell zzso signal zzso but is compromised in a subset of zzso zzso acute zzso zzso Based on these findings, we investigated zzso whether zzso also occurs in mature B zzso zzso and zzso whether zzso B cell zzso cells use an alternative B cell zzso signaling zzso in the absence of zzso Indeed, expression of zzso protein was also missing in a fraction of B cell zzso zzso While zzso is essential for B cell zzso zzso zzso in normal B cells, B cell zzso engagement in zzso as compared to zzso B cell zzso cells resulted in an accelerated yet zzso zzso B cell zzso engagement of zzso zzso cells involves zzso zzso zzso which is critical for B cell zzso zzso in the absence but not in the presence of zzso As shown by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is required for B cell zzso zzso release in zzso B cell zzso cells but zzso after zzso B cell zzso engagement in zzso B cell zzso cells also resulted in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was sensitive to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity resulted in growth arrest and cell death specifically in zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso can zzso conventional B cell zzso signaling in zzso B cell zzso cells and thereby promote zzso of survival and zzso zzso
