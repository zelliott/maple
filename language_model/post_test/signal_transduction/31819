Animal models of human disease are necessary in order to rigorously study stages of disease progression and associated mechanisms, and ultimately, as zzso models to test zzso In these methods, we describe a technique in which zzso zzso is injected into the zzso mouse zzso zzso via the zzso effectively modeling zzso or zzso of the zzso This simulated infection results in increased nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso as zzso through zzso imaging of an zzso zzso reporter zzso Our ultimate goal in developing these methods was to study the inflammation associated with zzso in the zzso zzso which often includes zzso zzso and immune cell zzso zzso we were keenly aware that incision or any type of wounding of the skin, the zzso or the zzso in order to introduce the zzso could not be zzso in our methods since the approach would likely confound the zzso of zzso We also desired a zzso method that did not require specially made zzso zzso or the use of zzso to hold these specialized tools in zzso Thus, we determined to use a commercially available insulin syringe and to inject the agent into the zzso duct of an intact zzso This method was successful and allowed us to study the inflammation associated with zzso injection without any additional effects zzso by the process of zzso In addition, this method also zzso an zzso zzso reporter transgenic mouse and zzso imaging technology to visually and zzso show increased zzso signaling within the zzso zzso These methods are of interest to researchers of many disciplines who wish to model disease within the zzso zzso zzso as ultimately, the technique described here could be zzso for injection of a number of zzso and is not limited to only zzso
