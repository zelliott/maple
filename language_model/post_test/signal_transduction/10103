To test a hypothesis of zzso zzso of different types of arthritis, namely inflammatory arthritis zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cartilage zzso were examined for the expression of zzso and zzso zzso In cartilage, we found zzso expression of all receptors in normal zzso and decreased expression of zzso receptors in pathological zzso In zzso there was a lower expression of zzso receptors in cases of zzso compared to those of zzso In zzso the three zzso receptors were more abundantly expressed in cartilage, while in zzso they were mainly present in zzso tissue zzso being expressed more than zzso zzso decoy zzso type II was low or absent in zzso zzso but present in zzso The increased expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cartilage, compared to zzso in addition to the abundant local zzso production, strengthens the hypothesis of zzso action by inflammatory zzso in the zzso of cartilage zzso
