In recent years the discovery of a number of major zzso proteins expressed in the liver and zzso specifically involved in zzso acid transport has led to improved understanding of zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso from portal blood into the liver is zzso primarily by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso across the zzso membrane into the zzso is carried out by the zzso salt export pump zzso In the zzso zzso of zzso acids from the zzso into zzso cells is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso whereas exit into portal blood across the zzso membrane is zzso by the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression and function occurs at several different zzso in the nucleus, members of the nuclear zzso zzso regulated by zzso acids and other zzso are primarily involved in controlling gene zzso while cell zzso events directly affect zzso function, and zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and impaired zzso responses of several of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in liver and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso are now understood to play central roles in driving zzso flow, as well as adaptation to various pathological conditions, with complex regulation of activity and function in the nucleus, zzso and zzso
