Renal zzso is the inevitable consequence of an excessive zzso of zzso zzso that occurs in virtually every type of chronic kidney zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is a progressive process that ultimately leads to zzso zzso failure, a devastating disorder that requires dialysis or kidney zzso In a simplistic view, zzso zzso represents a failed zzso process of the kidney tissue after zzso sustained zzso Several cellular zzso including zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso transition, have been identified as the major avenues for the generation of the zzso cells in diseased zzso Among the many zzso factors that regulate zzso zzso process, transforming growth zzso zzso is one that plays a central zzso Although defective zzso degradation may contribute to tissue zzso the exact action and mechanisms of the zzso zzso in the injured kidney have become increasingly zzso Recent discoveries on zzso zzso factors have evolved novel strategies aimed at zzso the zzso action of zzso zzso Many therapeutic interventions appear effective in animal zzso however, translation of these promising results into humans in the clinical setting remains a daunting zzso This zzso attempts to highlight the recent progress in our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways leading to zzso fibrosis, and discusses the challenges and opportunities in developing therapeutic zzso
