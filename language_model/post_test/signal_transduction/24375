We examined the pattern of gene expression resulting from spontaneous differentiation of zzso zzso cells to gain insight into the molecular changes necessary for zzso zzso zzso was prepared from cells harvested at three cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 days in zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso and differentiated (15 zzso Gene expression profiles were determined using zzso Human Genome zzso zzso zzso expressed genes were identified following statistical analysis zzso zzso zzso adjustments to P values, false detection rate zzso We identified zzso unique genes as zzso zzso expression of zzso fell and zzso increased from 2 to 15 days, while zzso had expression that either peaked or dipped at 8 zzso Genes expressed during differentiation included several zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folate zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and M, indicating that this zzso zzso cell line has a hybrid zzso zzso zzso of gene expression based upon functional zzso suggest a role for zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways during zzso zzso
