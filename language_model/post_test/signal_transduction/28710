The zzso zzso of zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso Various modifications of zzso have been shown to result in a considerable increase in signaling potency zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our structural investigations revealed an unusually stable zzso structure of the signaling domain zzso where zzso 6 zzso and 10 zzso or zzso were located on the same face of the zzso To test whether a stable zzso zzso is required for productive interaction with zzso zzso we designed two zzso restricted zzso zzso each containing a zzso bridge at positions 6 and zzso Specifically, zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into the most potent zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were characterized to examine the importance of orientation of the zzso According to biological studies zzso et zzso zzso zzso 42, zzso none of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso remained as active as the parent zzso However, relative to their corresponding linear zzso zzso zzso either maintained potency or showed zzso zzso zzso structures as determined by zzso zzso and zzso molecular dynamics simulations clearly illustrate the structural differences between the linear and zzso zzso fragments, supporting the hypothesis that an zzso is the preferred zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, our results demonstrate that the structural order of the very first zzso zzso of the signaling domain plays a significant role in zzso zzso
