Although the main role of zzso zzso in pregnant zzso is to sustain zzso production by the corpus zzso zzso treatment of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso mice is unable to prevent fetal zzso We have previously shown that the rat zzso is a site of zzso production and zzso In this report, we examined the hypothesis, using zzso zzso mice and rat zzso cell culture, that the absence of this hormone leads to the expression in the zzso of genes zzso to zzso The results show that zzso growth is normal in zzso zzso mice treated with zzso zzso or their zzso However, the zzso of mice treated with zzso starts expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso two proteins absent from the zzso of zzso mice and involved, respectively, in inflammation and zzso zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso is prevented by zzso zzso Our results further suggest that zzso zzso of zzso expression is at the level of zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso but not other zzso prevent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso promoter with expression zzso of zzso active zzso zzso or signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso leads to substantial zzso of promoter zzso Taken together, our investigation provides an explanation for the inability of zzso to sustain pregnancy in zzso zzso mice and suggests that zzso plays an important role in pregnancy by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso The study also demonstrates that zzso signals through the zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression in the zzso
