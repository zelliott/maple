zzso represents an zzso of the visceral zzso tissue exerting zzso zzso The aim of the study was to characterize the zzso regulation of zzso release in zzso in healthy, zzso zzso and in zzso in zzso 

One hundred healthy subjects zzso females and 36 zzso underwent an oral zzso tolerance test (75 zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and laboratory zzso zzso and zzso (1 and 2 zzso serum zzso of zzso insulin, and zzso were zzso zzso experiments using zzso insulin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso including Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were not different between zzso or zzso individuals but were zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were rapidly and significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso upon an oral zzso zzso and this suppression was more pronounced in overweight and female zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso stress, and sex steroids did not influence zzso zzso In contrast, insulin strongly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso release in zzso by approximately zzso and this suppression was more pronounced under zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso release by approximately zzso 

zzso and zzso are responsible for the rapid suppression of zzso levels upon an oral zzso zzso in healthy zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso release together with the absence of direct zzso effects on zzso release suggests the existence of a novel zzso effect represented by a zzso
