We recently demonstrated that rapid zzso pacing caused cardiac failure zzso in dogs with zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused no significant increases in function, zzso consumption and zzso zzso zzso level in the failing zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso would correlate with the reduced functional and zzso responses to zzso stimulation during the transition from the compensated zzso to zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso was created using zzso valve zzso in 10 dogs over a zzso zzso Five months after zzso valve zzso zzso heart failure was induced in 5 dogs by rapid zzso pacing at 240 zzso for 4 zzso The density of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso wet zzso was significantly reduced in the Failure dogs zzso zzso when compared to those of the Control zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso affinities were not significantly different among all zzso There was a small but significant decrease in the percentage of zzso of the failing zzso hearts zzso when compared to that of the zzso hearts zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso was significantly lower in the Failure dogs zzso than in the Control zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also significantly lower in the Failure dogs zzso than in the Control dogs zzso and slightly lower than in the zzso dogs zzso There were no significant differences in low zzso zzso zzso activities among all zzso We conclude that down regulation of zzso and reduced zzso zzso activities contribute to the decreases in zzso functions and zzso responses in the failing zzso hearts induced by rapid zzso zzso
