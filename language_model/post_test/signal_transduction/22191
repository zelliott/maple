zzso E zzso zzso zzso are produced by zzso cells in the central nervous system zzso When zzso are supplied to zzso zzso but not cell bodies, of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso extension is zzso In this study we have investigated the molecular requirements underlying the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso We show that enhancement of zzso growth by zzso requires the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso since zzso zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso directed against zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, an alternative zzso zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso extension, suggesting that zzso do not exert their zzso effect solely by zzso of a zzso signaling zzso In addition, although zzso zzso enhanced zzso extension, zzso zzso did zzso zzso of zzso in rat cortical zzso cells resulted in production of zzso that increased the rate of zzso extension to a greater extent than did expression of an zzso zzso form of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso particles containing zzso zzso and zzso but not cholesterol, zzso zzso extension, suggesting that zzso but not cholesterol, is involved in the zzso effect of zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso and zzso promote zzso extension, and suggest that lipids exported to zzso by zzso are important for the enhancement of zzso extension zzso by zzso
