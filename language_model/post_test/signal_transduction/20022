zzso zzso zzso can induce the tolerance against focal cerebral zzso However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully zzso Emerging zzso suggest that zzso zzso signaling may be involved in zzso brain zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso tolerance against focal cerebral zzso is zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and zzso gene transcriptions in the zzso except zzso zzso domain level, which could be increased evidently by zzso After zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain level in zzso zzso in zzso zzso group were increased and reached the peak at 2 h and 24 zzso respectively, which were both earlier than the peak achieved in control zzso zzso injection with the zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the zzso effect of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the tolerance against focal cerebral zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
