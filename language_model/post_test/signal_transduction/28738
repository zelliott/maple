In this study, guinea pig zzso smooth muscle zzso with zzso was relaxed by the addition of zzso zzso a zzso and zzso analog for zzso This effect was not sensitive to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso whereas it was partially blocked by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The relaxation observed was also reverted up to zzso by zzso a selective inhibitor of large zzso zzso zzso channels zzso Our results indicate that there exists a zzso mechanism between zzso and zzso signaling pathways which lead to relaxation of guinea pig zzso smooth muscle and also that zzso channels are involved to a certain extent in this zzso
