The importance of zzso zzso replacement therapy in zzso protection against the selective and delayed zzso death associated with cardiac arrest or cardiac surgery in women remains zzso Here we report that zzso zzso at levels that are zzso for hormone replacement in zzso women zzso protection against global zzso zzso death and prevents zzso of zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso of male zzso Global zzso induced a marked increase in activated zzso in zzso evident at 6 zzso after zzso Global zzso induced a marked zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso evident at 48 zzso zzso expression was induced primarily in terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating expression in zzso undergoing zzso Global zzso also induced a marked zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly changed in zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso changes in gene expression were cell zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso increases in activated zzso and blocked the increase in zzso in zzso zzso zzso but did not prevent zzso zzso of zzso These findings demonstrate that long-term zzso at zzso levels ameliorates zzso zzso injury and indicate that zzso intervenes at the level of zzso signaling zzso to prevent onset of death in zzso otherwise zzso to zzso
