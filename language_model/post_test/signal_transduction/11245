zzso ethanol abuse results in deleterious behavioral responses such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The objective of this research was to identify transcripts that are zzso regulated in zzso cortical zzso compared with controls by using a zzso complementary DNA zzso 

zzso zzso were isolated from zzso day 14 zzso mouse fetuses and cultured according to a standard zzso The cortical zzso cells were treated with 100 zzso ethanol for five consecutive days with a change of media every zzso A zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso genes was used to measure transcripts zzso regulated in four zzso cortical zzso samples and four control zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction analysis was used to verify the zzso expression levels of genes of interest detected from the zzso zzso 

We identified 56 zzso and 10 zzso genes in zzso cortical zzso relative to zzso controls at a zzso zzso zzso The expression of many genes involved in zzso and protein synthesis was decreased by ethanol, including zzso B, zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and members of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression of heat shock zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10, and zzso binding protein zzso protein zzso zzso was also decreased in zzso cortical zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction analysis of genes involved in the zzso cascade revealed a zzso of these zzso thereby corroborating our zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that chronic ethanol treatment of cortical zzso resulted in decreased zzso expression of genes involving the zzso zzso and zzso proteins together with zzso expression leading to disruption of protein degradation mechanism and impairment of protein synthesis zzso
