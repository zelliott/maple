The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An in zzso zzso zzso model and an in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso model simulating zzso injury in zzso were adopted to investigate whether and how the zzso effects of zzso are zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso (1 zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso size, zzso zzso activity, and zzso in rats with zzso and similar protection was observed in primary cultures of zzso rat zzso The protective effects of zzso were associated with the suppression of zzso stress, as evidenced by reversing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were induced by zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso resistance to zzso stress and zzso injury by modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso further increased zzso zzso zzso The protective effects of zzso on zzso stress and zzso activity were abolished by zzso of rat zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso stress and zzso dysfunction were also significantly ameliorated by zzso These effects involved zzso signaling zzso 

The protective effects of zzso during zzso are zzso at least in part, by modulating zzso activity and consequently suppressing zzso stress via the zzso of zzso zzso
