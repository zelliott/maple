zzso activates zzso to kill diverse zzso zzso but does not activate human zzso to kill virulent zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that this is due to zzso of zzso signaling by zzso tuberculosis and found that zzso tuberculosis infection of human zzso blocks several responses to zzso including killing of zzso zzso and induction of zzso The zzso effect of zzso tuberculosis is directed at zzso of zzso zzso but does not affect zzso steps in the zzso zzso pathway, as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and DNA binding are intact in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, there is a marked decrease in zzso association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso binding protein and zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso tuberculosis directly or indirectly zzso this zzso interaction that is essential for zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and isolated cell walls reproduce the effects of live bacteria, indicating that the bacterial zzso that zzso zzso of zzso responses is zzso zzso Although zzso has been found to exert effects on zzso it does not account for the zzso effects of cell zzso These results indicate that one mechanism for zzso tuberculosis to evade the human immune response is to inhibit the zzso signaling pathway, and that the mechanism of zzso is distinct from that reported for zzso zzso or zzso in that it targets the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
