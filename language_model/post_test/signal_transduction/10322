T zzso are an essential component of the immune response against zzso zzso We previously reported that T cells became functionally impaired or zzso after zzso zzso zzso In our current study, we investigate the mechanisms of zzso We report that zzso zzso or zzso alone can zzso T cells by profoundly zzso zzso signal zzso zzso requires zzso penetration into T cells but not de zzso zzso or zzso In zzso T cells zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso occurs zzso However, zzso signaling is inhibited at zzso for zzso of T cells zzso and at steps zzso to zzso in the zzso signal cascade including zzso of calcium flux and zzso of multiple zzso zzso of T cells by zzso leads to the reduced zzso of zzso at zzso zzso critical for zzso signal zzso Treatment of T cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and stimulus with a zzso that zzso zzso zzso overcomes zzso Our findings zzso a potentially novel method of viral immune evasion that could be exploited to better manage zzso infection, aid in vaccine design, or allow targeted manipulation of T cell zzso
