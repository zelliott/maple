zzso growth factor zzso zzso block cell growth in zzso and downstream signaling in zzso but controlled trials in patients with advanced solid tumors have yielded disappointing response zzso To clarify this zzso we compared the patterns of zzso zzso expression in human cancer cells and primary zzso 

zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso were combined with mass zzso to determine the zzso signatures of 40 matched normal and zzso zzso from patients with breast or liver zzso The identities and abundance of the detected zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso proteins are similar among normal zzso of the same origin but vary markedly between different zzso zzso breast tumors exhibit a zzso homogeneous zzso zzso profile, whereas liver zzso display greater zzso zzso The main zzso zzso zzso are zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, control studies in zzso zzso human cancer cells revealed an additional zzso subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Identification of zzso and stress proteins as the most abundant zzso zzso in breast tumors implicates these zzso rather than zzso zzso as the prime zzso zzso for zzso zzso drugs in zzso Because zzso zzso proteins and zzso mediate cell zzso and zzso resistance, respectively, these data raise the intriguing possibility that zzso zzso zzso zzso may be of greatest value either as zzso zzso drugs or as zzso
