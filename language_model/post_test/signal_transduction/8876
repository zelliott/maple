To unravel the roles of zzso in inflammation and zzso we examined the function of zzso in development of zzso inflammation using cultured rat brain zzso zzso zzso inhibit neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso to the nucleus but, rather, inhibit zzso binding to promoters and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso formed a zzso with zzso whereas zzso formed a zzso with zzso zzso by direct zzso binding to the zzso zzso In line with the fact that both zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso or zzso respectively, and zzso was blocked by transient zzso of appropriate individual zzso reversing zzso suppression of zzso and zzso zzso Together, our data show that zzso is required for the suppression of zzso inflammatory responses by zzso in zzso brain zzso
