zzso zzso are tightly associated with transient zzso disorder zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso in children with Down zzso Numerous genes are altered in zzso zzso which may contribute to the zzso and abnormal terminal differentiation of these zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso gene that controls zzso zzso expression of zzso impaired zzso differentiation as evidenced by a decrease of zzso expression and reduced DNA content in zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused enhanced zzso of zzso family zzso and subsequently reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the opposite effect on differentiation and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso defective in its interaction with zzso family zzso that recruit zzso terminal zzso zzso to suppress zzso family zzso failed to inhibit differentiation and lost its ability to enhance zzso family zzso or reduce zzso zzso In fact, the zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso recruiting zzso zzso somehow blocked zzso activity and led to enhanced zzso of zzso family zzso and reduced zzso zzso which ultimately zzso zzso zzso Supporting this idea, zzso zzso with zzso and the expression of a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso overwhelmed the zzso effect of zzso on differentiation and zzso zzso In addition, a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso the enhanced zzso differentiation and zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation and verified that zzso zzso zzso zzso development in primary mouse bone zzso zzso Our study thus reveals a novel mechanism by which zzso of zzso due to zzso zzso may contribute to abnormal zzso proliferation and differentiation in zzso of related zzso
