The effects of the partial zzso zzso zzso on zzso responses were investigated in rat pancreatic zzso cells and compared with zzso a full zzso zzso together with previous results using zzso a partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to stimulate zzso release from isolated pancreatic zzso in a zzso zzso At a zzso concentration (10 zzso zzso was only capable of stimulating zzso of the zzso zzso by a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso did not induce a decrease in zzso at zzso zzso as does zzso In zzso loaded with zzso zzso of zzso resulted exclusively in generation of zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso at all zzso tested zzso zzso zzso in marked contrast to high zzso of full zzso which result in a zzso sustained increase in zzso In common with low zzso of other zzso that stimulate zzso zzso zzso at all zzso was only able to stimulate a very small increase in zzso zzso zzso In zzso previously incubated with zzso zzso was shown to stimulate zzso zzso zzso above zzso compared with zzso for zzso To ascertain if this small degree of zzso zzso seen with zzso is responsible for the generation of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been shown to inhibit zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso but not zzso was zzso This agent rapidly inhibited zzso zzso indicating that in contrast to zzso zzso induced by zzso are the result of zzso zzso
