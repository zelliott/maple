The zzso zzso supports the development and maintenance of several aspects of zzso structure, but its significance for marginal zzso zzso vascular organization is zzso We showed here that, in early zzso zzso mice, the developing zzso white pulp vessels failed to organize or zzso zzso leading to altered spatial zzso of both the white pulp zzso cells and the smooth muscle zzso zzso In zzso zzso directed the reorganization of zzso zzso zzso cells grown on zzso zzso also regulated the maintenance of both zzso expression and mature zzso structure in adult mice, contributing zzso to normal trafficking of zzso cells in response to bacterial zzso Together, our studies demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso signals control proper development and maintenance of the mature zzso structure and zzso zzso in the structuring of the zzso zzso cells that is important for the movement of immune cells within the zzso
