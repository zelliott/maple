We have recently described an zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso gene program that is induced by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In our current study, we show that zzso of zzso response gene expression in primary zzso cells is stronger and prolonged with zzso stimulation compared with that of zzso Our data also reveal that the zzso tails of both zzso and zzso can directly interact with zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso However, although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to associate with zzso we were unable to detect any interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By using quantitative real-time zzso zzso we found that zzso expression is zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso while zzso expression is not zzso by these same zzso Furthermore, using cells derived from mice deficient in the zzso we show that both zzso and zzso require zzso zzso feedback to induce zzso expression and zzso genes required for zzso zzso More specifically, a subset of zzso genes is initially induced independent of zzso yet the zzso further enhances expression at later time zzso This was in contrast to a second set of genes (including zzso that is induced only after zzso zzso Taken together, our data argue that, despite both zzso and zzso being able to use zzso to zzso zzso gene zzso zzso uses multiple mechanisms to enhance and sustain the zzso response more strongly than zzso
