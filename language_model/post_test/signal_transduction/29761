zzso zzso a zzso implicated in the zzso and zzso of a variety of zzso has been reported to be zzso in prostate zzso In this study, we ascribe a new role for zzso in prostate cancer progression using zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso activates the zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth, while serving as a potent zzso zzso Our evaluation of the possible signal pathways involved in zzso and cell migration shows that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso and zzso interfere with zzso cell migration, while only the zzso inhibitor was able to repress zzso zzso This suggests that both growth and migration depend on the activity of zzso whereas cell migration also requires the zzso of zzso Our evidence that zzso zzso growth is, at least in part, due to zzso zzso zzso includes zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso activity diminishes cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the promoter of prostate specific zzso zzso upon zzso treatment, based on zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that in addition to its role in zzso and zzso zzso may also serve as a zzso for zzso transition of prostate zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report about the zzso zzso signals and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in prostate cancer zzso The observation that zzso mediates its growth and zzso effects via zzso and zzso suggests the potential use for zzso zzso zzso at early stage of prostate cancer zzso
