zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso involved in the control of a variety of diverse zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso zzso signaling in some zzso cell types, raising the possibility that some zzso effects of zzso in zzso cells may be achieved by a similar zzso zzso we tested whether zzso affect signaling through the insulin zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade in zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso for 24 zzso 1) suppressed zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso 2) increased the level of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso and 3) induced the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This response was zzso in part, by zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso the zzso complex by zzso zzso we tested whether zzso of zzso signaling would zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso increased zzso activity, and zzso did not further stimulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso increased the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso inhibit signaling through the zzso zzso with a consequence of increased zzso zzso acid zzso
