In order to evaluate the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso system in the basic mechanisms of zzso we examine the expression levels of zzso zzso and specific zzso ability in the zzso of zzso rats at various seizure zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a significant increase in the zzso zzso expression level in the bilateral zzso at zzso after the last generalized zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso revealed a remarkable increase of zzso values in the zzso control and partially zzso zzso However, the zzso increase of zzso values was abolished on both sides of the zzso at 24 h after and at 4 weeks after the last generalized seizure in fully zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso in the zzso function and zzso zzso zzso might be implicated in the zzso basis of the induction mechanisms of the zzso of zzso and the mechanisms of the maintenance of enduring zzso zzso the zzso zzso system might have a lesser impact on the acquisition process of zzso
