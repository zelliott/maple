The role of adult zzso stem cells zzso in tissue maintenance and zzso has received significant attention of zzso Questions arise to what extent these cells are either subject to, or causes of zzso whether age-related changes in these cells are due to intrinsic factors or induced by the zzso zzso This review zzso and examines recent data in support of these different zzso By means of introduction, a brief overview is given of current zzso definitions and their basic role in tissue zzso followed by a comparative analysis of zzso studies involving zzso Evidence for zzso aging and various aging markers relating to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and other indicators is zzso We observe that while the literature might often appear to conflict, many apparent discrepancies are attributable to inconsistent methods of zzso and zzso zzso which in fact contains various zzso of adult stem cells, varying not only in their differentiation potential but also in their vulnerability to zzso from zzso lifespan to perennial zzso Thus, zzso stem cells emerge as both subject to and key zzso of zzso zzso
