The mechanisms underlying zzso pain are poorly zzso However, several studies have implied a role for zzso zzso located in the zzso horn in zzso zzso To clarify the roles of activated zzso in zzso pain, we investigated the interactions among zzso and other neural components in the zzso horn using electron zzso zzso were more abundantly localized in layers zzso of the zzso horn than in other areas, and some of them zzso to and engulfed both injured and zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was rarely observed in the normal zzso horn, and the number of zzso attached to zzso zzso was markedly increased on zzso day 7 on the operated zzso However, after blocking the zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso administration of its zzso zzso the increase in the number of zzso attached to zzso zzso as well as the development of tactile zzso were markedly zzso although the number of activated zzso did not change zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso by activated zzso via zzso signaling in the zzso horn may be a critical event in the zzso of zzso zzso
