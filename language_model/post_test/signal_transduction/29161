Psychological stress causes an inflammatory response in the brain and is able to exacerbate brain damage caused by experimental zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso stress in mice worsens stroke outcome through mechanisms that involve inflammatory mechanisms, such as zzso of zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso in the zzso Some of these inflammatory zzso could be regulated by innate zzso the zzso of which takes place in the brain and produces an inflammatory response zzso by zzso receptors zzso Recently, we described the implications of zzso in zzso injury, but the role of zzso in stress has not yet been zzso We therefore investigated whether inflammation produced by zzso stress differs in mice that lack a functional zzso signaling zzso 

We used an experimental paradigm consisting of the exposure of mice to repeated zzso sessions (1 hour daily for 7 zzso before permanent middle cerebral artery zzso 

We found that zzso mice subjected to zzso stress had a better behavioral condition compared with normal mice zzso and that this effect was associated with a minor inflammatory response zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso Furthermore, previous exposure to stress was followed by a smaller zzso volume after permanent middle cerebral artery zzso in zzso mice than in mice that express zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso is involved in the inflammatory response after zzso stress and its zzso effect on zzso These data zzso the effects of innate immunity on inflammation and damage in the brain after zzso
