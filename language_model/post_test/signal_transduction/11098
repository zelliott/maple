zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso transmit signals from membrane bound G zzso receptors zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso couples zzso zzso to the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Regulators of G protein signaling zzso proteins bind to activated zzso zzso including zzso and regulate zzso signaling by acting as zzso zzso proteins zzso increasing the rate of the intrinsic zzso activity, or by acting as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors in the first step of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all zzso contain an zzso zzso zzso domain, and binding of the zzso zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso through a novel zzso binding surface termed the zzso zzso Here, molecular modeling of the zzso complex and zzso zzso of zzso were used to identify zzso in zzso that interact with zzso The model identifies zzso in zzso I of zzso as being at the crux of the zzso and zzso of this zzso to zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso III also appears to play a role in zzso binding because the zzso zzso zzso both zzso within zzso III, and zzso a zzso that structurally supports zzso III, are defective in binding zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso release is reduced in comparison to zzso Interestingly, the model also predicts that zzso in the zzso domain of zzso interact with zzso In fact, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have reduced binding to the zzso zzso Finally, although the zzso zzso has greatly reduced binding to zzso and zzso it has little to no effect on binding to zzso Thus the zzso domain A and C sites for zzso interaction rely on contacts with distinct regions and different zzso I zzso in zzso
