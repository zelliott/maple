The zzso system provides zzso host defense, but it can also be exploited by pathogens for zzso On the zzso surface, zzso tissue factor zzso and zzso zzso C zzso can stimulate zzso activated zzso 1 zzso infection by triggering zzso zzso Using novel engineered zzso zzso deficient in either zzso and/or zzso in the present study, we show that activated zzso factors X zzso or zzso zzso directly affect zzso infection of human zzso vein zzso cells in a manner that is dependent on viral zzso and zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso enhanced infection for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that both zzso act on zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the required zzso source was zzso zzso zzso or zzso partly enhanced the effect of zzso but not zzso revealing zzso as a novel zzso zzso for zzso In sharp contrast, zzso enhanced infection via zzso independently of viral zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso enhanced infection, suggesting that zzso and zzso are independently involved in virus zzso These results show that zzso surface zzso promote cellular zzso infection, indicating a novel mode by which pathogens exploit the initiation phase of the host zzso zzso
