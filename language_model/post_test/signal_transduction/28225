Recently published studies of zzso cell function reveal unexpected features of zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in the pancreatic zzso Although zzso is established to be a zzso agent, these studies demonstrate that protein zzso A zzso is not the only zzso protein by which zzso zzso Instead, an alternative zzso signaling mechanism has been zzso one in which zzso activates zzso proteins designated as zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso also known as zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso and zzso of zzso function diminishes zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso signaling and insulin zzso Of particular note are new reports demonstrating that zzso couples zzso zzso production to the stimulation of fast zzso zzso It is also reported that zzso mediates the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso This is a process of zzso zzso release zzso and it generates an increase of zzso that may serve as a direct stimulus for zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso This article summarizes new findings concerning zzso zzso signal zzso and seeks to define the relative importance of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso
