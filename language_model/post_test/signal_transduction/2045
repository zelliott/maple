zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in a variety of biological zzso including proliferation and zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of an 85 zzso adapter protein zzso containing one zzso domain and two zzso zzso and a 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently an zzso form of zzso named zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain has been cloned from an zzso zzso zzso zzso and transgenic mice expressing zzso in T zzso develop a zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning of a zzso truncated form of zzso expressed in a human zzso cell line zzso with a T cell zzso derived from a patient with Hodgkin's zzso As a result of a zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso zzso is lacking most of the zzso zzso domain, but contains the zzso domain and is associated with an active form of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in CO cells which was only partially reduced after serum zzso Treatment of CO cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of cell proliferation associated with an increased number of zzso zzso This is the first detection of a zzso form of the zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso cells further underlining a potential role of zzso signaling in human zzso
