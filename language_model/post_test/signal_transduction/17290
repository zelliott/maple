Making effective use of multiple data sources is a major challenge in modern zzso zzso data such as measures of zzso factor zzso gene zzso and sequence zzso which are used to identify binding regions and genes that are important to major biological processes such as development and disease, can be difficult to use together due to the different biological zzso and statistical zzso of the zzso data types, but each can provide valuable information for understanding the processes under zzso Here we present methods for zzso multiple data sources to gain a more complete picture of gene regulation and zzso Our goal is to identify genes and zzso regions which play specific biological zzso We describe a zzso mixture model approach for data integration, examine the effect of using different model zzso and discuss methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the zzso Model fitting is zzso efficient and produces results which have clear biological and statistical zzso The zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso which are critical in embryonic development, are used as zzso
