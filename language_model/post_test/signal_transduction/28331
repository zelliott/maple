Stem cells are crucial for normal development and zzso and their misbehavior may be related to the origin of zzso Progress in these areas has been difficult because the mechanisms regulating stem cell lineages are not well zzso Here, we have investigated the role of the zzso zzso in the developing mouse zzso The results show that zzso signaling zzso regulates the number of embryonic and zzso mouse zzso cells with stem cell properties, and controls precursor proliferation in a zzso manner in cooperation with zzso zzso These findings identify a crucial mechanism for the regulation of the number of cells with stem cell properties that is unexpectedly zzso in different stem cell zzso
