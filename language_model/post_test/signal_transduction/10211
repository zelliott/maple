zzso life span zzso in zzso zzso defined as the time cells in a stationary phase culture remain viable, has been proposed as a model for the aging of zzso zzso in zzso We developed a zzso zzso to determine CLS for approximately zzso zzso deletion strains of zzso and identified zzso strains carrying zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates multiple cellular processes in response to zzso especially zzso zzso raising the possibility that decreased zzso signaling mediates life span extension by calorie zzso In support of this possibility, removal of either zzso or zzso from the media significantly increased stationary phase zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso or zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso activity also promoted increased zzso of storage carbohydrates and enhanced stress resistance and nuclear zzso of the stress-related zzso factor zzso We propose that zzso of a highly zzso response to zzso stress is important for life span extension by decreased zzso signaling in zzso and higher zzso
