zzso acid zzso is a common dietary zzso zzso zzso fatty acid that under zzso conditions is present in an zzso form in cell membrane zzso and it might be present in the zzso zzso AA and its zzso are implicated in zzso zzso and cell migration in zzso breast cancer cells, and an zzso transition process in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso During zzso transformation is present an altered expression of zzso which promote changes on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso I zzso I) is an zzso that zzso in a variety of biological functions including cell growth, migration, and zzso However, the participation of AA in the regulation of zzso I expression and the role of this zzso in the cell zzso process in breast cancer cells remains to be zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that AA zzso an increase of zzso I expression through a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Moreover, zzso cells adhere to zzso via zzso I expression and zzso of cells with AA zzso an increase of cell zzso to zzso In conclusion, our findings zzso for the first time, that AA promotes an increase of zzso I expression through an AA zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathway, and that zzso I plays a pivotal role in cell zzso to zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
