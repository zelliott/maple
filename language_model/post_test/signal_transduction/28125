zzso zzso is a zzso which associates with important agricultural zzso The nitrogen fixation process in this zzso is highly regulated by ammonium and zzso and involves several proteins including the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although these proteins are structurally very similar, they play different roles in the control of nitrogen zzso In this work, we describe the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein of zzso zzso strain zzso The amplified zzso gene was zzso and expressed as a zzso fusion zzso After zzso we obtained zzso zzso of zzso zzso per liter of zzso This protein was zzso to zzso purity and zzso for in zzso zzso using a partially zzso zzso coli zzso as a source of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso reactions in zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso showed that up to zzso of zzso zzso were modified after 30 zzso zzso This zzso modification is strictly dependent on zzso and zzso while zzso acts as an inhibitor and promotes zzso
