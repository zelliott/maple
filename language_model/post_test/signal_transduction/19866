zzso have been reported to contribute to zzso injury during obesity or diabetes zzso However, the mechanisms zzso the actions of various zzso on the kidney remained zzso The present study was performed to determine whether acid zzso zzso associated zzso raft zzso zzso is involved in local zzso stress in zzso zzso cells zzso induced by zzso such as zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was found to increase zzso zzso in the membrane of zzso in a dose and time dependent zzso Upon zzso stimulation zzso activity was increased, and an zzso of zzso product, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed in the zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso signaling zzso The formation of this signaling platform was blocked by prior treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso production was significantly increased zzso zzso upon zzso zzso as measured by electron spin resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso layer in culture and disrupted zzso networks, which were blocked by zzso of zzso zzso signaling platform zzso In conclusion, the zzso effect of zzso but not zzso on the zzso zzso is associated with the formation of zzso zzso signaling platforms via zzso zzso which produces local zzso stress resulting in the disruption of zzso networks in zzso and increases the zzso zzso
