zzso rich 15 zzso which encodes a protein of unknown function, is expressed almost exclusively in zzso cells both during fetal development and in adult zzso such as the zzso zzso and the zzso To determine if this specific expression is lost in zzso zzso we examined zzso expression by in zzso zzso zzso on mouse zzso tumors caused by different gene zzso and on human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso expression was consistently observed in mouse gastrointestinal zzso tumors caused by zzso in the zzso zzso as well as in several advanced stage human zzso In contrast, no zzso expression was detected in zzso tumors derived from mice carrying zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings, combined with the fact that a majority of sporadic human zzso carry zzso zzso strongly suggest that the expression of zzso in mouse and human zzso tumors is linked, directly or zzso to the absence of the zzso protein or, more generally, to the disruption of the zzso signaling zzso
