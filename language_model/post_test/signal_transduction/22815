zzso E is an unstable protein that is zzso in a zzso and zzso dependent zzso Two factors stimulate zzso E zzso in zzso when it is free of its zzso partner, and when it is zzso on zzso zzso We pursued the first of these pathways by using a zzso screen to identify proteins that could bind only to free zzso zzso This resulted in the isolation of human zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso was bound to zzso E but not to zzso zzso complexes in zzso cells, and that zzso of zzso increased zzso of zzso E but not other zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene in mice caused increased zzso of zzso E zzso and had zzso effects on zzso zzso In the zzso zzso in which cells undergo a standard zzso cycle, there was a greatly increased number of cells in S zzso In the zzso in which cells go through zzso there was a block to entry into S zzso The zzso pathway, which targets zzso for zzso on the basis of their zzso state, and the zzso pathway, which selects zzso E for zzso on the basis of its assembly into zzso complexes, may be complementary ways to control zzso zzso
