Most zzso studies of plant defense responses to zzso zzso have focused on zzso However, zzso zzso are also zzso of diverse plants, and zzso induce different patterns of damage to plant zzso than do well-studied insects zzso zzso larvae or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is among the most significant zzso zzso in agriculture, feeding on a staggering number of plant zzso To understand the interactions between zzso zzso and a plant at the molecular level, we examined zzso zzso responses of zzso and its host zzso zzso zzso Despite differences in feeding zzso we found that zzso responses of zzso to zzso zzso resembled those observed for zzso zzso zzso analysis of induced plant defense pathways showed functionally that only a subset of induced programs, including zzso acid signaling and zzso of zzso zzso are central to zzso defense to zzso zzso On the zzso side, zzso zzso dramatically increased zzso mortality and development zzso We identified an zzso zzso zzso increase in the number of zzso expressed zzso genes belonging to pathways associated with zzso of zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso defenses that have also been associated with the deterrence of insect zzso that are very zzso related to zzso Our findings provide molecular insights into the nature of, and response to, zzso for a representative of a major class of zzso zzso
