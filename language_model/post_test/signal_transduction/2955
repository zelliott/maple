zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso disorder caused due to deletions or zzso zzso in zzso inherited zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso of steroid hormone zzso However, the mechanisms by which maternal zzso zzso gives rise to zzso features of AS are not zzso We report here that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso is disrupted in zzso mice zzso The expression of several zzso genes is zzso in multiple brain regions of zzso zzso AS mice show significantly higher level of blood zzso selective loss of zzso and reduced number of zzso zzso zzso in their zzso that could ultimately lead to increased zzso These mice also exhibit increased zzso behavior, which could be due to chronic zzso Altogether, our findings suggest that chronic stress due to altered zzso signaling might lead to zzso behavior in a mouse of model of zzso
