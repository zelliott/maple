zzso zzso develops competence for genetic transformation in response to regulatory circuits that sense at least two zzso zzso One zzso known as zzso is sensed by a zzso signal zzso system through a membrane zzso zzso The other, derived from the primary translation product zzso is thought to be sensed by an zzso zzso zzso after zzso by zzso zzso To allow study of this process in a medium that does not itself contain zzso development of competence was examined in the chemically defined medium zzso described by van de zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We confirmed a previous report that in this medium zzso zzso of strain zzso respond to a synthetic zzso zzso the seven zzso zzso of zzso zzso by increasing expression of the alternative zzso factor zzso which in turn allows expression of competence zzso zzso This response provided the basis for a zzso for the zzso zzso in the 100 to 1,000 zzso zzso It was further observed that zzso (but not zzso zzso cultures developed a high level of competence in the late log and transition zzso of growth in this zzso without the introduction of any synthetic zzso zzso This zzso competence development was accompanied by zzso release of one or more signals that zzso a zzso zzso at levels equivalent to 1 zzso synthetic zzso
