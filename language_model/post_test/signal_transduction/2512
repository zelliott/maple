The zzso state of the putative signal zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso depends on the cellular state of nitrogen and carbon zzso In this study, zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso was investigated both in zzso and in zzso The in zzso studies implied that zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of ammonium zzso An in zzso zzso for zzso zzso was established that revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities could be separated zzso A partially zzso zzso zzso preparation also zzso the zzso of zzso zzso on other proteins in a zzso zzso However, only zzso of zzso was regulated by synergistic zzso by zzso and zzso As the same zzso stimulate the zzso zzso activity, it appears that the zzso state of zzso is determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso towards its zzso and zzso
