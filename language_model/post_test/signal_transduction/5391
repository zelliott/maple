The zzso and stationary behavior of protein modification zzso has been extensively zzso yet little is known about the spatial aspects of signal zzso We have previously shown that the spatial separation of opposing zzso such as a zzso and a zzso creates signaling activity zzso Here we show under what conditions signals stall in the space or robustly zzso through zzso distributed signaling zzso zzso signal propagation results in activity zzso with long zzso which abruptly zzso at successive spatial zzso We derive an approximate zzso solution that relates the zzso zzso and propagation length of each zzso profile with the cascade level, protein zzso and the ratio of the opposing zzso zzso The control of the spatial signal propagation appears to be very different from the control of transient zzso responses for zzso zzso zzso For zzso distributed zzso where zzso and zzso zzso operate far from zzso the ratio of the opposing zzso activities is shown to be a key zzso controlling signal zzso The signaling zzso characteristic for robust signal propagation exemplify a pattern formation mechanism that generates precise spatial guidance for multiple cellular processes and conveys information about the cell size to the zzso
