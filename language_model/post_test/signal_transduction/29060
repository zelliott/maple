The zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso gene produces a functional zzso only when zzso into cells of zzso origin, zzso that it may require an zzso accessory zzso Recently we showed that the zzso accessory protein zzso is essential for the cell surface expression of the zzso in such zzso Using zzso interference zzso technology, we have further explored the action of zzso in the functioning of the zzso in zzso mouse zzso cells that zzso express zzso and zzso We created stable cell lines expressing mouse zzso short hairpin zzso zzso by zzso cells with an expression zzso containing the zzso small interfering zzso zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso zzso The zzso of a mouse zzso construct did not restore the expression of zzso due to its degradation by the mouse zzso The introduction of human zzso that is resistant to zzso by mouse zzso zzso resulted in the rescue of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso with markedly lower mobility than predicted for a zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso suggests that zzso exists as a zzso that is resistant to zzso by sodium zzso zzso and reducing zzso
