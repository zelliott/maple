zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular energy zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso regulating de zzso synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso zzso gene expression was found to be under the control of both zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso levels were governed by zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as revealed by studies with zzso zzso mice and zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift analyses showed an zzso binding site in the zzso gene promoter that directed zzso of reporter gene zzso by zzso The zzso promoter was not responsive to zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso protein levels in zzso but not zzso mouse zzso with no changes in zzso zzso These results show that zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels, leading to reduced expression of the zzso target gene zzso
