zzso cells respond to the zzso zzso virus zzso by producing zzso zzso and zzso After this inflammatory burst, these cells undergo zzso cell zzso We have recently demonstrated that both zzso immune zzso production and zzso were induced through zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Based upon these findings, we hypothesized that the zzso of zzso signaling may serve as a means to alleviate excessive zzso In the present study, we cloned four zzso virus zzso zzso which have been reported to disrupt either zzso signaling or zzso zzso and zzso them in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso and in primary zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso reporter gene zzso we show that upon stimulation with zzso and zzso zzso all four zzso proteins inhibited zzso signaling with different levels of zzso in the zzso cell line and primary zzso We found similar results when zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide evidence that these zzso proteins can function as zzso of zzso signaling in primary zzso zzso
