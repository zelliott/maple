In zzso and zzso neural zzso cells zzso signals that pattern the central nervous system zzso However, an important part of the developing insect brain, involved in functions such as zzso and feeding behavior, is positioned lateral to the zzso and lacks neural cells at the zzso Could the zzso substitute for neural zzso cells and zzso signals that pattern this part of the brain? 

In zzso zzso the neural zzso marker zzso is expressed in zzso cells adjacent to the brain, as are members of the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso the function of these molecules results in zzso proliferation and reduced size in the brain lateral to the zzso 

zzso of the brain lateral to the zzso receive an zzso signal from the zzso and zzso in zzso A likely source of this signal is the zzso These findings raise the possibility that the brain lateral to the zzso is an zzso recent addition to the zzso brain, and that the anterior boundary of the brain neural zzso is a zzso feature in zzso zzso zzso
