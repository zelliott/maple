zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that plays zzso important roles in promoting innate and zzso immune zzso The absence of zzso gamma production or cellular responsiveness in humans and experimental animals significantly zzso the host to microbial infection, a result that zzso the zzso importance of this zzso in preventing infectious zzso Recently, an additional role for zzso gamma in preventing development of primary and transplanted tumors has been zzso Although there now appears to be a consensus that zzso gamma promotes host responses to tumors, the mechanisms by which this zzso achieves its effects remain zzso In this review, we briefly discuss key issues of the molecular cell biology of zzso gamma and its zzso that are most relevant to zzso zzso zzso effects and then focus on the data implicating zzso gamma as a critical immune system component that regulates tumor zzso Potential mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso effects are discussed and a preliminary zzso model of zzso zzso actions on tumors is zzso Finally, the capacity of zzso gamma and zzso to not only provide protection against tumor development but also to zzso the zzso zzso of tumors that develop in an zzso host is presented and introduced as a zzso zzso zzso
