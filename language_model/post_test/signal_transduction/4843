Many authors have reported interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso yet little is known about the mechanisms triggered in the zzso In this paper we examine the participation of the salicylic acid zzso signaling zzso involved in the response of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants to zzso zzso plants were challenged with the virulent strain zzso of zzso zzso or with the zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso which zzso resistance to the zzso Our study showed that the isolate zzso induced a zzso zzso zzso that was accompanied with the induction of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Such events zzso after the zzso burst, evaluated as the zzso of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso and many hours before the protection could be zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso applied zzso zzso obtained supports the hypothesis that zzso plants activate a zzso zzso defense mechanisms that is effective against a zzso agent of zzso In contrast, plants zzso with zzso did not show zzso burst, zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso This is the first report about a defense response signaling zzso studied in zzso zzso
