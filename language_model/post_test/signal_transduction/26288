zzso zzso Muscle zzso zzso due to their plasticity and ability to shift from a zzso zzso zzso to a pathological zzso status, play a central role in the onset and progression of zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso among a series of zzso and growth factors, has been identified as the critical factor in this zzso zzso In order to obtain new insights on the molecular effects triggered by zzso a zzso zzso targeting the membrane zzso zzso was applied to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso loaded on a zzso zzso vehicle, were delivered into cultured zzso A significant impairment of the zzso mechanisms triggered by zzso was demonstrated since cell migration decreased after zzso In order to functionally validate the effects of zzso partial knock down we focused on the zzso status of two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and heat shock zzso zzso previously identified as indicative of zzso zzso switch after zzso zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso administration indicating that zzso is a factor downstream the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso status was greatly increased by the zzso zzso 

These contradictory observations suggested that zzso might trigger different parallel pathways that could be modulated by alternative zzso of the receptors for the growth zzso In conclusion the knock down strategy here described enables to discriminate between two tightly zzso zzso zzso it opens new attractive perspectives in functional investigations where combined gene knock down and zzso technologies would allow the identification of key factors and pathways involved in zzso pathological zzso
