For a disease such as cancer, where a number of zzso to normal cell function accumulate over time, there are several opportunities to zzso slow down or even reverse the zzso Many of the changes which drive the disease process occur in zzso pathways that regulate proliferation and zzso As our knowledge of these complicated zzso networks zzso it is becoming clear that many zzso both drugs and naturally occurring dietary constituents, can interact zzso with zzso zzso Aspirin and other zzso zzso drugs, as well as natural compounds present in plants such as green vegetables and tea, can zzso zzso by affecting zzso activity and therefore zzso of key zzso Examples of pathways which can be modulated by these agents include zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso by zzso promoters or zzso zzso by growth factors through the zzso zzso protein zzso pathways and by a number of other molecules through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso protein zzso pathways regulate a number of zzso factors including zzso and zzso Evidence exists, at least from in zzso experiments, that by targeting such zzso certain dietary compounds may be able to restore abnormal rates of zzso and proliferation to more normal zzso
