zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso in many transformed cells, suggesting TRAIL as an ideal candidate for cancer gene zzso A main obstacle in cancer therapy is intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance of zzso zzso To study induction of resistance against zzso we generated zzso zzso allowing efficient TRAIL expression and zzso induction in a variety of human cancer cell zzso Within days upon TRAIL zzso cells became resistant towards zzso but not to zzso zzso or DNA damage by zzso Cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 was completely zzso in resistant cells due to zzso retention of the receptors by zzso zzso directed against TRAIL zzso the resistant cells by restoring cell surface expression of TRAIL zzso These findings represent a novel resistance mechanism towards zzso specifically caused by TRAIL zzso and question the use of TRAIL expression in zzso targeting gene zzso
