zzso of the action potential duration zzso has consistently been observed in experimental models of cardiac zzso and failure as well as in humans and is partially attributed to a reduction of a zzso current provided by the zzso transient outward zzso channel zzso In the present study, we examined the effects of manipulating zzso channel currents zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the associated zzso in action potential duration on zzso zzso and signaling induced by zzso II zzso Our aim was to examined whether distinct patterns of zzso calcium manipulation could generate distinct patterns of zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso induced by incubation with zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso density, shortened zzso decreased zzso influx and inhibited zzso zzso incorporation and zzso and zzso zzso These zzso changes were also paralleled by blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso These electrical and zzso changes produced by zzso of zzso were completely and significantly reversed by zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso response in zzso can be zzso by an enhancement of zzso function through zzso of zzso and that zzso of action potential duration can be important in the development of cardiac zzso
