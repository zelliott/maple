zzso are the most common zzso solid tumors of zzso These tumors are associated with an overall poor zzso particularly for advanced stage zzso The zzso zzso antibiotic, zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity in certain cancer cell lines by zzso important signal zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of our study was to determine whether zzso can alter the expression of zzso and zzso which have been shown to be critical for zzso cell survival, and induce zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso for a variable period of zzso Cell viability was assessed with zzso zzso zzso was assessed with DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso decreases cell viability and zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso cell zzso These effects were zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso release of zzso c and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a reduction in the level and activity of zzso and zzso The importance of these proteins was further demonstrated by induction of zzso in zzso cells by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso Similar to zzso cells, other human zzso cells zzso and zzso were sensitive to the effects of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso may be a novel therapeutic agent, which may be effective in the treatment of zzso
