The zzso central nervous system zzso represents a highly complex unit, the correct function of which relies on the appropriate differentiation and survival of its zzso It is becoming apparent that the zzso family of small zzso and their downstream targets have a major function in regulating zzso zzso Among the zzso the role of the zzso family of zzso especially zzso is becoming increasingly zzso Although highest levels of zzso expression and zzso are detected in the developing nervous system, much remains undiscovered concerning its function in zzso This review zzso what is currently known regarding the biological and molecular role of zzso in the zzso zzso It zzso the importance of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso migration and synaptic zzso zzso there are also strong indications that zzso is required for normal cognitive zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso has been associated with the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease, while zzso and zzso may be responsible for zzso transformation of support cells within the zzso especially zzso zzso Together, these new and exciting findings encourage the future exploration into the function of zzso in the nervous system, thus, paving the way for novel strategies towards improved diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of diseases that affect the zzso
