zzso zzso diseases zzso can involve widespread gastrointestinal dysfunction, even in cases in which inflammation is localized to a single zzso The underlying zzso of dysfunction in zzso regions is zzso We examined whether colitis is associated with altered zzso zzso transport in the zzso zzso and/or changes in the properties of zzso zzso zzso Colitis was induced by administration of zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso from animals was examined 3, 7, and 28 days zzso zzso zzso transport was assessed in zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings were used to examine the zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso in animals with zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in the zzso from animals 7 days after the induction of zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in animals with zzso but the response to zzso was zzso Slow zzso synaptic transmission was dramatically reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso This change was detected as early as 3 days following zzso zzso No changes to fast synaptic transmission or the number of zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso fired more action zzso during a given zzso and intrinsic primary zzso zzso had broader action zzso in animals with zzso These findings zzso changes to enteric neural circuits as contributing factors in zzso zzso dysfunction at sites zzso to a localized inflammatory zzso
