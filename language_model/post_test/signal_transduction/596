The zzso zzso zzso is the major cellular compartment where folding and maturation of zzso and membrane proteins take zzso When protein folding needs exceed the capacity of the zzso the unfolded protein response zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso protein translation to restore zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso synthesis does not appear to involve the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso instead, zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs simultaneously or slightly prior to zzso zzso translation zzso Since zzso is the most abundant zzso species, zzso approximately zzso of total cellular zzso its zzso exerts a significant impact on cell zzso Our study demonstrates the first link between regulation of translation and zzso synthesis with zzso of zzso suggesting that this zzso may be broadly zzso by stresses that activate zzso zzso in order to zzso regulate translation and zzso zzso during cellular zzso
