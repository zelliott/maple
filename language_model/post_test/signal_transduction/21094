Unlike most other cellular zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is resistant to extraction by the zzso zzso zzso We exploited this property to isolate a zzso fraction highly enriched in zzso by zzso of zzso zzso of cells in zzso density zzso zzso electron zzso studies revealed a homogeneous preparation of membrane zzso zzso This preparation, designated zzso floating fraction zzso also contained a defined set of 20 other proteins and a single zzso zzso Cell surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso both confirmed the plasma membrane origin of this zzso The cell surface zzso zzso and a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were specifically localized in these structures, whereas the cell zzso zzso zzso most of the major cell surface membrane zzso zzso zzso the zzso integral membrane protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Overall, zzso represents about zzso of cell zzso exposed membrane zzso All of these results indicate that zzso is derived from specialized zzso of the plasma zzso The method of isolation is analogous to that of zzso However, we were unable to detect distinct zzso structures on the cell surface associated with zzso which showed a diffuse zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and related signaling proteins and the zzso characterization of zzso processes such as zzso zzso and zzso It also has important implications for the zzso zzso model of the plasma membrane zzso
