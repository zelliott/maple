zzso zzso is a naturally occurring fragrant compound found in a variety of plants and zzso zzso have attracted intense interest in recent years because of their diverse pharmacological zzso This study examines the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso for their effect on human zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso Here we show that both zzso and zzso not only inhibited cell zzso but also induced zzso with an zzso of 160 zzso as confirmed by zzso examination, zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso Interestingly, it was observed that these two zzso compounds exhibited little zzso towards peripheral blood zzso cells but induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in pronounced release of zzso zzso c from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Although an increase in the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso was observed, zzso with zzso showed no protective effect against zzso zzso zzso of present study suggest that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in the underlying molecular mechanism of zzso induction by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
