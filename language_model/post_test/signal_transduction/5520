We have demonstrated zzso of the zzso natural killer zzso and zzso zzso tumor cell zzso by zzso leaf zzso zzso These zzso and T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of head and neck zzso cell zzso patients with a state of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso reaction to kill oral cancer zzso zzso This zzso reaction is assisted by zzso zzso of zzso on T cells and zzso zzso on zzso zzso killing of zzso cells and zzso killing of zzso zzso cells are associated with zzso of these cells by zzso This zzso is evidenced by increased expression of early zzso marker zzso with altered expression of zzso zzso is a strong zzso of zzso from both T and zzso zzso however, zzso regulates the zzso zzso only without affecting zzso zzso zzso of this differential regulation may lie within zzso expression of zzso on zzso surface, not on zzso zzso This zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso B expression in killer cells, which is again zzso dependent in T cells and independent in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is increased by zzso it may not be truly linked with the zzso functions, as zzso A could not block such zzso zzso like, zzso A, a zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we conclude that zzso might be effective to recover the suppressed zzso functions of zzso and T cells from head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso
