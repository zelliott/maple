The zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso zzso is involved in both zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but it is unclear how zzso regulates these zzso zzso A key zzso factor downstream of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were zzso in an zzso zzso zzso to examine their effects on the zzso zzso and the zzso hypersensitivity of zzso and to examine whether zzso regulates the functions of zzso Because the zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 17 putative modification motifs of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which are known components of zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and one of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso alleviated the effects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the wild type and zzso and zzso of zzso alleviated the effects of zzso in both the wild type and zzso zzso did not affect the zzso state of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso but did not affect the zzso state of zzso The results suggest that zzso interacts with zzso but regulates the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
