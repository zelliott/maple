In rat zzso signaling through the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso type zzso includes stimulation of zzso zzso increases of zzso zzso zzso of zzso C, and the zzso zzso pathway, mechanisms that suffer zzso with zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an zzso at the level of the zzso zzso zzso is the basis for impaired zzso signaling in aged rat zzso Western zzso analysis with a specific zzso zzso zzso revealed that a 85 zzso zzso binding zzso the size expected for the mature zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and brush border zzso zzso of the zzso being the protein expression about zzso higher in the zzso Two other bands of 105 zzso zzso to highly zzso incompletely processed zzso zzso and 65 zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso protein expression significantly decreases with zzso while no substantial decrease was observed in the zzso from old zzso zzso zzso was also present in the nucleus where zzso protein levels were similar in zzso from young and aged zzso zzso analysis of rat zzso sections showed zzso of zzso in zzso cells all along the zzso with intense zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these cells were zzso to the zzso zzso but not all cells showed the same nuclear zzso The zzso was also detected in the zzso zzso zzso cells, but was absent in zzso cells from zzso In aged rats, zzso zzso was diffused in both zzso and zzso and again, zzso zzso expression was lower than in young animals, while the cell zzso showed a similar zzso pattern than in young zzso zzso binding to zzso was performed in zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso binding to zzso in a zzso zzso In both, aged (24 zzso and young (3 zzso rats, binding of zzso was characterized by a single class of zzso binding zzso The affinity of the zzso for zzso was not affected by zzso The maximum number of specific zzso binding sites was decreased by zzso in old zzso The results of this study suggest that age-related declines in zzso regulation of signal zzso pathways in rat zzso may be due, in part, to the loss of hormone zzso
