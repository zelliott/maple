We have examined whether a qualitative switch occurs in the response of the zzso zzso zzso genes to the effect of the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso during the development of brown zzso zzso expression of the genes for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso was high in zzso cells, but was markedly zzso in parallel with zzso zzso zzso zzso which promotes DNA synthesis and proliferation of brown zzso resulted in an increased expression of the zzso gene in zzso cells zzso but was without effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of zzso zzso brown zzso reduced both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso stimulation of zzso expression in zzso was zzso by zzso and abolished by zzso demonstrating mediation via zzso and protein zzso A zzso Also, zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stimulation of brown zzso by zzso specifically zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso stage of brown zzso development, the zzso zzso being a zzso cascade further involving zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulation of brown zzso proliferation may act at the level of gene expression of the limiting zzso for zzso activity, zzso and demonstrate a qualitative switch in the response of the zzso gene to zzso agents as a consequence of the switch from zzso to zzso cell zzso
