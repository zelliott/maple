zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice show similar anabolic action in zzso bone but have not been assessed in cortical zzso zzso bone mass is elevated in zzso mice through greater zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso results in reduced bone zzso We show opposing central regulation of cortical zzso 

Treatment of osteoporosis is zzso by a lack of agents capable of stimulating the formation of bone by zzso Recently, the brain has been identified as a potent anabolic regulator of bone zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling are known to regulate zzso activity in zzso zzso However, assessment of these pathways in the structural cortical bone is critical to understanding their role in skeletal health and their potential clinical relevance to osteoporosis and its zzso 

Long bones of zzso male zzso and zzso and zzso zzso mice were assessed by zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed zzso 

The zzso of zzso mature zzso mice and of zzso zzso and zzso mice were assessed for changes in cortical zzso activity and bone zzso zzso of zzso receptors increased zzso activity on both zzso and zzso surfaces, independent of zzso resulting in increased cortical bone mass and density in zzso mice along the entire zzso zzso these changes were evident after deletion of zzso zzso receptors in adult mice, with a zzso zzso in zzso bone zzso This is in marked contrast to zzso models that displayed reduced cortical mass and zzso These changes were associated with substantial differences in calculated strength between the zzso and zzso zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso anabolic zzso stimulates cortical and zzso bone formation, whereas the zzso zzso has opposing effects in cortical and zzso bone, diminishing the production of cortical zzso The findings from conditional zzso zzso knockout show a novel, zzso control mechanism for cortical bone formation and a potential new zzso for anabolic treatment of zzso
