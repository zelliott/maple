During chronic injury a population of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso become activated to zzso both zzso and zzso Here we show in human diseased liver and mouse models of the zzso reaction that zzso and zzso signaling direct zzso of zzso via their interactions with activated zzso or zzso In particular, we found that during zzso zzso expression of zzso 1 (a zzso zzso by zzso promoted zzso signaling in zzso and thus their zzso zzso to zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso debris induced zzso zzso This resulted in zzso zzso signaling in nearby zzso thus maintaining expression of zzso (a cell fate zzso within these cells and the promotion of their zzso to zzso By these two pathways adult zzso zzso during chronic liver injury is zzso
