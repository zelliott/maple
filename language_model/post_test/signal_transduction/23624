Heat shock proteins zzso are molecular zzso and have been implicated in longevity and aging in many zzso Their major functions include zzso zzso or newly zzso zzso protecting cells from zzso stress, and processing of zzso zzso These proteins are expressed zzso and can be induced by stresses such as heat, zzso stress and many zzso The induction of zzso in aging could potentially maintain protein zzso and longevity by zzso the damaged proteins which accumulate during aging and are toxic to zzso zzso are shown to increase life span in model organisms such as zzso zzso and decrease zzso zzso Thus, decrease in zzso in aging is associated with disruption of cellular zzso which causes diseases such as cancer, cell zzso and zzso zzso levels are decreased with aging in most zzso including zzso Aging also causes zzso or zzso of many zzso pathways as well as the expression of zzso factors such as heat shock factor zzso The zzso in regulation and synthesis of zzso box zzso zzso family of zzso factors as well as major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also seen in zzso Among many zzso mechanisms involved in altering longevity and aging, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are highly zzso This review zzso into the role of some of these pathways in zzso along with zzso
