zzso caused by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of zzso zzso in Southeast Asia and northern zzso An important controller of the immune system is the zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso of which zzso and zzso are the major signal zzso In this study, we aimed to characterize zzso expression and function in experimental zzso zzso expression was determined in 33 patients with zzso infection with zzso zzso and 30 healthy zzso We found that plasma zzso zzso were strongly elevated during zzso In line with this finding, zzso expression in zzso mice zzso zzso with zzso zzso was enhanced as zzso To assess the role of zzso we inhibited zzso using a selective zzso zzso zzso Treatment of mice with zzso zzso resulted in decreased lung zzso zzso zzso blockade appeared to be zzso mice treated with zzso zzso and subsequently infected with zzso zzso showed diminished bacterial zzso Moreover, less distant organ injury was observed in zzso treated mice as shown by reduced blood zzso nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso treatment did not have an effect on zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso during zzso zzso infection and plays a limited but zzso role during experimental zzso
