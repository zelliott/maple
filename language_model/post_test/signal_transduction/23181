zzso therapy against the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is one of the most promising molecular zzso for head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a wide range of zzso including zzso and zzso important signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso However, primary and acquired resistance are serious problems and are responsible for low zzso response rate and tumor zzso zzso an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to zzso zzso may provide valuable indications to identify zzso that can be used clinically to predict response to zzso blockade and to establish new treatment options to overcome zzso To date, no zzso zzso for zzso is available in the zzso zzso resistance to zzso therapy may arise from mechanisms that can compensate for reduced zzso signaling and/or mechanisms that can zzso zzso zzso In this review, we will zzso some of these molecular mechanisms and describe strategies to overcome that zzso
