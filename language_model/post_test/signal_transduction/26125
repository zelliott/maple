The development of obesity involves multiple zzso Here, we identify zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso as one such zzso Mice fed a high-fat diet zzso showed increased zzso activity in zzso tissue compared to mice fed a low-fat zzso Treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated weight gain and insulin resistance in mice on a zzso zzso mice zzso an zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed decreased zzso activity in zzso decreased zzso weight gain, and improved zzso metabolism compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice on a zzso showed decreased zzso zzso reduced zzso recruitment to zzso zzso and lower expression of zzso zzso various zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso was associated with increased zzso activity and increased abundance of zzso zzso which was reversed by a zzso zzso zzso application of mechanical stretch to mature zzso increased zzso activity and stress fiber zzso Stress fiber formation, which was also observed in zzso from zzso mice, was prevented by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso in zzso activates zzso to zzso zzso signaling at least in part through mechanical stretch and zzso zzso signaling in inflammatory changes in zzso tissue in zzso Thus, zzso of zzso signaling may provide a therapeutic strategy for zzso a vicious cycle of zzso stretch, zzso zzso and inflammation of zzso tissue that contributes to and zzso zzso
