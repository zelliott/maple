zzso zzso zzso has been traditionally used as an zzso agent to treat zzso diseases, acute urinary infection or subcutaneous zzso infection with invasion of the zzso zzso 

Nuclear factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor of many genes involved in inflammatory and zzso zzso To identify a novel, potent inhibitor of zzso signaling pathway, a plant extract library of traditional zzso medicine was screened for the capability to block the zzso activity in cells zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and then evaluated the zzso and zzso functions of water extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and cancer cells, zzso 

The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso oxide zzso production was measured using the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso efficiently inhibited zzso expression of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso degradation, nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activity induced by zzso were suppressed by zzso Furthermore, zzso dramatically enhances the zzso response, as evident by the combination with tumor necrosis factor zzso was able to induce the zzso action through zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso has a potential to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and is a valuable compound for modulating inflammatory or zzso zzso
