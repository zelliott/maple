We reported previously that protein zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of cell growth in the zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 translation by inducing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The current study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is shown to promote zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso directly involved in its association with zzso zzso with the known role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in regulation of zzso zzso signaling zzso inhibited zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso was not prevented by zzso active zzso of zzso or zzso indicating that blockade of zzso signaling is not the primary zzso of zzso zzso This idea is supported by the fact that zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso activity in these zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the activity of protein zzso 2A zzso zzso signaling induced an approximately zzso increase in zzso activity, and zzso zzso blocked the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso zzso and zzso two naturally occurring zzso zzso that promote growth arrest in zzso cells, activate zzso in zzso manner, supporting the zzso significance of the zzso Together, our studies indicate that zzso of zzso is an important mechanism underlying zzso zzso of zzso translation and growth suppression in zzso zzso zzso
