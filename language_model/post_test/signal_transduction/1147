zzso zzso has diverse biological functions acting inside cells as a second zzso to regulate cell proliferation and survival, and zzso as a zzso for a group of G zzso receptors zzso named the zzso differentiation gene zzso zzso Five closely related zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been identified as zzso zzso zzso These receptors are coupled via zzso zzso zzso and zzso The signaling pathways are linked to vascular cell migration, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso The formation of an zzso zzso occurs through zzso of cellular events that include zzso zzso to the zzso and vascular smooth muscle cell zzso migration and zzso Thus, zzso signaling may play an important role in the zzso of zzso vascular zzso This review highlights zzso zzso in vascular cells and its involvement in the formation of zzso zzso
