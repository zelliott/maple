Conservation of steroid hormone action outside the nucleus occurs from plants that make zzso to higher zzso zzso In plants, steroid hormone action occurs when the zzso bind a membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors for all sex steroids exist at the plasma membrane and rapidly signal through G proteins to second zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and more zzso zzso These signal zzso impact many functions of steroid hormones, responsible for the biological actions of these zzso Support also exists for zzso receptors of other members of the steroid zzso responding to zzso zzso zzso hormone, and vitamin zzso The nature of these receptors is in some cases zzso zzso receptors also exist in discrete zzso zzso most notably the zzso although the functions of these receptors are poorly zzso In this review, I highlight the essential elements of the membrane zzso zzso zzso noting where zzso aspects exist for other steroid zzso
