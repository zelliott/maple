Recent zzso studies, zzso coding and zzso findings of multiple zzso actions and/or zzso patterns, and the characterization of synaptic molecules and zzso zzso signaling mechanisms may help for a better understanding of zzso control in the zzso nervous zzso Thus, zzso oxide zzso zzso which generates the freely zzso and short-lived zzso NO and expression of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso growth zzso in zzso neural pathways or target zzso suggest unique actions in zzso zzso In central zzso zzso NO may serve as spatial zzso zzso within zzso ordered zzso zzso pools and zzso pathways for synchronized zzso zzso Likewise, NO zzso zzso and zzso transmission and zzso activity including long-term zzso In the visceral targets, NO appears to be a spatial zzso in local intrinsic networks or at zzso zzso In zzso zzso NO possibly acts as synaptic zzso or zzso as a zzso affecting zzso zzso or as a local zzso zzso The short-term neural zzso NO may also induce zzso zzso long-term zzso signals, thereby supporting zzso maintenance and zzso if not synaptic zzso in zzso zzso zzso
