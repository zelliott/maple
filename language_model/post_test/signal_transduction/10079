zzso act as graded zzso cues that control cell fate zzso in many developing zzso This concept, in which a zzso zzso regulates differential gene expression in a zzso manner, provides a basis for understanding many patterning zzso It also raises several zzso issues, such as how responding cells perceive and interpret the zzso information provided by a zzso to generate precise patterns of gene expression and cell differentiation in developing zzso Here, we review recent work on the molecular features of zzso zzso that facilitate the interpretation of graded signals and attempt to identify some emerging common zzso
