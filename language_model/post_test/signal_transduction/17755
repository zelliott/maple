zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are typical members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso family, respectively, with a pivotal role in the regulation of zzso zzso including zzso cell death, zzso zzso immune privilege and tumor zzso zzso of the zzso system has been implicated in liver failure, zzso diseases and immune zzso Thus, the zzso system was mainly appreciated with respect to its zzso zzso However, there is increasing evidence that zzso of zzso can also result in zzso responses like cell proliferation or zzso zzso While the zzso features of the zzso system and the pathways involved are comparably well investigated, the pathways that are zzso by zzso to zzso zzso and zzso signals are poorly zzso This review is focused on the zzso functions of the zzso zzso In particular, the similarities and differences of the molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso signaling are zzso
