Here, we show an increase in zzso zzso expression during zzso gastric damage in the zzso as assessed by zzso zzso of animals with zzso prevented this increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in gastric zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that both zzso and zzso act as parallel zzso mechanisms during zzso induced gastric zzso zzso
