zzso of genes in the zzso signaling zzso is controlled by zzso zzso factors originally defined as molecules that bind to the promoter of zzso zzso The zzso gene family consists of six members and is designated zzso The zzso signaling zzso is among the main regulators of the cell cycle, hence its importance in differentiation and zzso We document here zzso of zzso but not other members of the zzso gene family, in 15 of 18 primary zzso zzso zzso examined zzso in comparison to corresponding zzso zzso zzso and in all of 11 zzso zzso cancer zzso cell lines zzso The zzso zzso however, was zzso in 12 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso to zzso revealed prominent zzso zzso protein in most of the primary zzso zzso (16 of 18; zzso but was not zzso in normal zzso zzso These data indicated that increased expression of the zzso gene might play a significant role in human zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
