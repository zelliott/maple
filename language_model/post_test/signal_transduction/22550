Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are rapidly zzso on zzso zzso in response to zzso and growth factor stimulation of cell surface zzso zzso zzso are zzso to the nucleus where they act as zzso zzso Recent reports suggest that zzso zzso of zzso also is involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso Here, we studied the role of zzso zzso in zzso signaling in human zzso zzso T cell lines and zzso T cell zzso lines, expressing a zzso activated zzso We show that an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding activity, and zzso relocation of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso Similar results were obtained with other zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso but not with zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with the broad zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partly blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso In conclusion, we provide evidence that zzso plays a crucial role in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso distribution in T zzso Moreover, our findings suggest that the level of zzso zzso is balanced between a zzso zzso and zzso
