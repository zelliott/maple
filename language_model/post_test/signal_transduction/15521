After zzso nerve injury retinal zzso cells zzso normally fail to zzso zzso in the zzso nerve and undergo zzso However, lens injury zzso or zzso application of zzso switch zzso into an active zzso state, enabling these zzso to survive zzso and to zzso zzso into the injured zzso zzso Several factors have been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of zzso Here, we investigated the contribution of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso to zzso zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso expression was strongly zzso in retinal zzso the zzso zzso was activated in zzso and zzso were transformed into an active zzso state after zzso Interestingly, retinal zzso expression was correlated with zzso expression after zzso In zzso mice, the zzso and zzso zzso effects of zzso were significantly reduced compared with zzso animals, despite an observed zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso The positive effects of zzso and also zzso were completely abolished in zzso double zzso mice, whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso In culture zzso and zzso markedly zzso zzso outgrowth of mature zzso These data confirm a key role for zzso in directly zzso the zzso and zzso zzso effects of inflammatory stimulation in the eye and identify zzso as an additional contributing zzso
