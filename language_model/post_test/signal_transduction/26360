The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso have not been completely zzso Our observations indicate that defects in the transforming growth zzso and zzso signaling pathways are common in human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso due to zzso deletion in the mouse head and neck zzso gives rise to zzso but only a few zzso progress to zzso However, zzso mice developed zzso zzso in combination with type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed enhanced cell zzso decreased zzso and increased expression of zzso in the zzso layer of the head and neck zzso as well as in the tumors of zzso double conditional knockout zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transformation involves zzso zzso and is associated with an increased number of putative cancer stem zzso In addition, the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and immune suppression in the tumor zzso all of which are characteristics of human zzso contribute significantly to head and neck zzso in zzso zzso These tumors display pathology and multiple molecular zzso resembling human zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso mouse model is suitable for zzso intervention, and that it has significant implications in the development of diagnostic cancer zzso and effective strategies for prevention and treatment of zzso
