The sense of smell begins with zzso molecules binding to membrane receptors on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso a G zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have found in zzso zzso that an zzso event has a low probability of zzso sensory zzso at all; even when successful, the resulting zzso response apparently involves a single active zzso molecular zzso This low amplification is in contrast to rod zzso in vision, the zzso zzso signaling pathway, where each zzso zzso zzso is well known to produce substantial amplification by zzso many zzso and hence zzso zzso We have now carried out similar experiments on mouse zzso which offer, zzso the advantage of zzso Indeed, we found the same low probability of zzso based on the zzso zzso response having a fairly constant zzso and similar zzso across different zzso and randomly encountered zzso Also, consistent with our picture, the zzso response of zzso zzso was similar to zzso in zzso although their zzso expression was only half of zzso Finally, from the action potential zzso we estimated that zzso zzso events successfully triggering zzso in a zzso mouse zzso will lead to signaling to the zzso
