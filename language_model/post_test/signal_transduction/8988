zzso is a zzso that regulates dietary fat intake in zzso and zzso insulin zzso from pancreatic beta zzso zzso studies of the zzso response of both a human zzso cell line zzso zzso and a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso to zzso suggested that it might regulate protein zzso Using zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso analysis, we confirmed that zzso zzso zzso and down regulated zzso in these cell zzso The zzso for zzso is the zzso beta zzso We zzso zzso cells with either a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso beta zzso or a red fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso to study the effects of zzso on zzso of its own zzso zzso zzso induced movement of zzso zzso to the cell periphery area but did not have any effect on the zzso of zzso zzso protein in zzso As zzso is involved in zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells we tested zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin release was inhibited by zzso as reported zzso Using zzso to zzso did not change zzso zzso insulin release but zzso to zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso insulin release and abolished the response to zzso This suggests zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin release in pancreatic beta cells through down regulation of zzso This study also suggests that zzso might have a more generalized effect on protein trafficking in various zzso
