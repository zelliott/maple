zzso growth factors administered during unilateral zzso obstruction zzso in zzso rats significantly reduce zzso and zzso zzso Because the mechanism underlying these zzso effects is largely unknown, we investigated signaling pathways potentially activated by growth factors to determine their roles in therapeutic zzso 

Mechanical strain was applied to zzso cultures of immortalized rat zzso zzso cells to simulate zzso stretch injury in zzso Growth factors, zzso zzso or pharmacological zzso were added to cultures that were subsequently processed for zzso analysis or zzso to identify signaling pathways that could be modulating cell zzso For in zzso studies, zzso harvested from rats zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso were fixed or frozen for zzso or zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso or zzso growth zzso zzso during stretch decreased zzso by 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against either growth factor or its zzso blocked the reduction in zzso zzso decreased BAD zzso by approximately 50% zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso cells and each growth factor restored zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso that blocked growth zzso BAD zzso promoted zzso in zzso BAD zzso decreased by approximately 50% zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso rat zzso and administration of zzso restored BAD zzso to zzso zzso 

Signaling pathways zzso at BAD zzso are key to growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso
