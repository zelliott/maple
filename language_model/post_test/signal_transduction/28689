The zzso signaling cascade plays a crucial role in the correct positioning of zzso during embryonic brain zzso zzso binding to zzso E zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of disabled 1 zzso an zzso protein which associates with the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso for zzso have been zzso to be necessary for zzso zzso We show that zzso agents specifically binding to zzso or zzso are sufficient to mimic the zzso zzso These agents induce zzso zzso activate members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and increase long-term zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells leads to its zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso The mechanism for and the sites of these zzso are identical to those zzso by zzso in primary zzso These results suggest that binding of zzso which exists as a zzso in zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso As a consequence, zzso becomes zzso or zzso on the zzso side of the plasma zzso zzso the active zzso for the zzso this process seems to be sufficient to transmit the signal and does not appear to require any zzso
