zzso is a zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso stem cells and zzso zzso We used cultured embryonic stem zzso cells to determine the function of zzso during early vascular development and zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction was enriched for zzso and zzso zzso zzso To investigate zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso against zzso and found that zzso cells derived from zzso zzso cells possessed various characteristics of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso played a role in this process, we analyzed differentiation of zzso zzso zzso Although the initial numbers of zzso and zzso cells derived from zzso cells did not vary significantly, the number of both decreased dramatically upon extended zzso Such decreases were rescued by treatment with a zzso zzso suggesting that reductions were due to zzso as a consequence of a lack of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso cells did not show measurable defects in development of the zzso system, suggesting that zzso is not essential for zzso cell zzso
