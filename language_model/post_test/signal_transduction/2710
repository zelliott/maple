zzso stimulates zzso transport in insulin target zzso by recruiting zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso compartment to the cell zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin zzso zzso zzso activity and subsequent zzso of insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso contribute to zzso the effect of insulin on zzso zzso We have now investigated the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two signaling proteins located downstream from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with expression zzso that allowed transient expression of zzso zzso and the other genes of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso lacking the ability to bind and activate the zzso zzso zzso exerted a dominant negative effect to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the cell zzso In addition, treatment of control cells with zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso abolished the ability of insulin to recruit zzso zzso to the cell zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso recruitment in insulin target zzso In contrast, zzso of a zzso active zzso of zzso zzso resulted in high levels of cell surface zzso in the absence of insulin that were comparable to levels seen in control cells treated with a zzso stimulating dose of zzso However, zzso treatment of cells zzso zzso resulted in only a small decrease in the amount of cell surface zzso compared with that of the same cells in the absence of zzso zzso while activated zzso is sufficient to recruit zzso to the cell surface, it does so by a different mechanism that is probably not involved in the mechanism by which insulin stimulates zzso zzso in zzso target zzso
