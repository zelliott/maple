Controlled mechanical displacement was used to stimulate single whiskers in normal and zzso depleted rats to zzso examine the role of zzso in the response properties of barrel cortical zzso zzso depletion using zzso zzso treatment increased the barrel zzso response magnitude to zzso of both principal and adjacent whiskers while there was not any significant difference in the barrel zzso spontaneous zzso zzso treatment increased the neural response duration of adjacent zzso stimulation but did not change that to the principal zzso zzso There was no difference in response zzso of principal or adjacent zzso displacement between the normal and zzso zzso The efficiency of neural code for differentiation of principal and adjacent whiskers was measured by zzso analysis, which reflects the performance of an ideal observer in this discrimination using zzso firing zzso No significant difference was found in the performance of zzso in zzso and control groups in distinguishing principal and adjacent zzso zzso from each zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso depletion causes an expansion of barrel cells receptive field but it does not affect the discrimination of individual zzso stimulation by the barrel zzso
