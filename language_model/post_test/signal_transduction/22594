To investigate whether there is a zzso in the zzso signaling zzso in isolated hearts of obese, zzso rabbits compared with their lean, zzso zzso 

Female New Zealand white rabbits were fed a maintenance zzso zzso 5) or a zzso fat diet zzso zzso 6) for 12 zzso 

After 12 weeks, rabbits were weighed and resting blood pressure and heart rate measured in the conscious animal using a central ear artery zzso The isolated heart preparation was used to measure peak developed pressure, peak rate of pressure rise zzso and peak rate of pressure decline zzso under control and zzso M zzso zzso 

In response to zzso developed pressure increased zzso in lean zzso but only zzso in obese zzso Similarly, the increase in zzso in response to zzso was attenuated in obese rabbits zzso compared with lean rabbits zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso was also impaired, increasing zzso in lean rabbits but only zzso in obese zzso 

Since zzso zzso the zzso to directly stimulate zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is associated with a zzso in zzso signaling zzso
