Recent work has demonstrated that brief application of insulin to zzso slices can induce a novel form of long-term depression zzso in the zzso region of the zzso however, the molecular details of how insulin triggers zzso remain zzso Using zzso and zzso approaches in the zzso zzso we show here that zzso zzso is specific to zzso acid zzso zzso but not zzso zzso synaptic zzso zzso is induced and expressed zzso but does not require the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso channels zzso and the release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso requires the series of protein zzso including protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso is mechanistically distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso and independent on protein zzso 1/2 A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is dependent on a zzso local translation of zzso zzso and zzso is associated with a persistent decrease in the surface expression of zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso insulin zzso which controls zzso surface zzso zzso numbers through zzso zzso may be a major expression mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
