zzso protein zzso zzso pathways regulate multiple cellular functions and are highly active in many types of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an upstream zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso This study investigated the role of zzso in the development of gastric zzso In human gastric cancer zzso we observed increased zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Using a chemically induced zzso gastric zzso model, we observed increased tumor zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice had both fewer and smaller tumors than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation through the zzso of cells in zzso phase of the cell cycle, and reduced zzso D1 expression in gastric cancer cells, whereas these effects were uncommon in other cancer zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso levels were regulated by zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso D1 zzso followed by elevated expression of zzso zzso These results indicate an zzso mechanism of zzso in the development of gastric zzso zzso this positive feedback loop, zzso may present a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced gastric zzso
