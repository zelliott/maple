The plant shoot zzso maintains a group of stem cells that remain active throughout the plant zzso They continuously generate new cells that are then recruited for organ initiation in the peripheral zzso Stem cell proliferation and daughter cell differentiation has to be integrated with overall growth and development of the diverse functional zzso within the shoot zzso Several studies have revealed extensive communication between these zzso The signaling mechanisms employed comprise zzso zzso directional transport of plant hormones, but also complex interactions between zzso factors, that together establish a panoply of regulatory zzso that fine-tune stem cell behavior in the shoot zzso
