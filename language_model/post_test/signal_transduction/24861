zzso radiation zzso exposure causes zzso cells to undergo zzso cell cycle arrest and/or zzso The in zzso role of zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso of the DNA damage signal to zzso remains zzso To determine the relationship between zzso and zzso we studied the cell cycle and zzso responses to zzso in mice deficient in zzso Using the slip zzso which harbors an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated not only that these zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso but also that upon zzso treatment, zzso accumulated in their cultured cells and zzso zzso zzso was zzso active and zzso the induction of zzso and zzso in slip zzso zzso of the zzso cell cycle response to zzso treatment indicated that the slip zzso cell cycle checkpoint function was zzso We further show that slip mice exhibited a higher level of spontaneous zzso zzso as well as a more robust zzso response to zzso than zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that the zzso response to DNA damage is intact in cells devoid of zzso activity and suggest that other zzso such as the product of the gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso are better candidates for regulating zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
