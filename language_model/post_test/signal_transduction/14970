A large number of zzso bacteria employ zzso zzso zzso zzso as signaling molecules in zzso zzso which is a population zzso mechanism to coordinate gene zzso zzso zzso was zzso against a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and represents the only reported zzso zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso Due to its high zzso zzso showed remarkable zzso of zzso sensing signaling in zzso zzso a common opportunistic pathogen in zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso in complex with a zzso analog revealed complete zzso of the polar zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This mode of recognition provides an elegant zzso solution for tight binding to an zzso zzso zzso with a small head group lacking typical zzso features, such as zzso or charge, which are often incorporated into zzso design to generate zzso zzso The ability of zzso to discriminate between closely related zzso is zzso by six hydrogen bonds to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso towards the zzso is likely to originate from conservation of these hydrogen bonds as well as an additional hydrogen bond to the oxygen of the zzso zzso A short, narrow tunnel zzso at the protein surface harbors a portion of the zzso chain and would not allow entry of the head zzso The crystal structure of the zzso without its zzso zzso or zzso zzso revealed a considerably altered zzso site with a closed binding zzso zzso a completely buried zzso zzso zzso mimics the zzso ring and, thus, serves as a surrogate zzso The detailed structural zzso of this zzso zzso will aid further development of an zzso therapy against bacterial pathogens by interference with zzso zzso
