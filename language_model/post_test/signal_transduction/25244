If we understand pathological zzso within the zzso zzso it is apparent that the fundamental aspects of zzso interactions need to be examined in greater zzso zzso bacteria have evolved strategies to alter and zzso the function of T zzso and zzso in the gut wall, and exploiting these molecules may lead to new treatments for chronic inflammatory zzso zzso The adaptation of microbes to their host must involve zzso interference of the host innate immune zzso The recent demonstration that zzso zzso coli have a beneficial effect in zzso colitis further supports the notion that normal zzso may alter the expression of the innate immune receptors or recognize alternative receptors compared with zzso zzso Such differences may conceivably lead to beneficial and protective zzso to the host through zzso and zzso zzso zzso Perhaps the contact point between microbes and host cells lies with the zzso receptors such as zzso However, although much light has been shed on the downstream consequences of zzso zzso many more questions remain zzso For example, little is known about the expression profiles of the different zzso throughout the gastrointestinal zzso Additionally, ambiguities remain over the natural zzso for zzso The discovery that the zzso Toll zzso acts downstream of the pathogen recognition event suggests that there are many more twists and turns to be revealed in the story of zzso interactions in the gastrointestinal zzso
