Designed fluorescent indicators are the basis for a major new technique in cell zzso the quantitative measurement and dynamic imaging of zzso zzso of important zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso engineering has now produced indicators with quite good selectivity and sensitivity for these zzso In many cases, these zzso can be introduced into large populations of cells by means of zzso chemical zzso so that the plasma membrane need never be disrupted or physically breached at any zzso Like many other optical microscopic techniques, fluorescent indicators are readily applied to study living cells and zzso with an unparalleled combination of spatial and zzso zzso They offer one of the few methods for continuous zzso monitoring of dynamic zzso zzso and signal zzso in single cells or zzso of zzso
