Stress is essential for health, but if coping with stress fails, the action of the stress hormones cortisol and zzso zzso becomes zzso zzso a condition favorable for increased zzso to zzso We focus on the question how the action of zzso can change from protective to zzso 

zzso targets the zzso brain, where it affects cognitive processes and emotional zzso The magnitude and duration of the zzso feedback signal depends on zzso of the hormone, the activity of the zzso zzso machinery and the zzso zzso If zzso action becomes zzso we zzso that this is linked to compromised zzso regulation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso action on gene zzso is zzso by high affinity zzso zzso and 10 fold lower affinity zzso zzso receptors that also can mediate fast zzso zzso MR and zzso operate a feedback loop that involves access and binding to the zzso zzso and shuttling of the zzso zzso complexes, which require interaction with zzso and zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of gene transcripts zzso specific zzso motor proteins and zzso factors as well as its own zzso The emerging evidence of zzso operating zzso control points to further zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso actions caused by zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been proposed as risk factor in stress-related zzso We here provide key regulatory steps in the zzso transport and regulation of zzso receptors that may sensitize zzso pathways underlying zzso
