zzso of B zzso factor zzso a critical B cell survival factor, is elevated in zzso and zzso zzso Mice zzso zzso develop systemic lupus zzso zzso disease and exhibit B cell zzso of classical and alternative zzso zzso We used a genetic approach and found that both zzso pathways contributed to disease development but act through distinct zzso Whereas zzso enhanced long-term B cell survival primarily through the alternative, but not the classical, zzso pathway, it promoted zzso class switching and generation of zzso zzso through the classical zzso zzso of the alternative zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso thereby retaining zzso B cells in the zzso marginal zone, a compartment that contributes to their zzso Thus, both classical and alternative zzso signaling are important for development of zzso disease associated with zzso zzso The same mechanisms may be involved in the zzso of human zzso
