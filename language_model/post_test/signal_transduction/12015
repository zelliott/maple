zzso injury zzso remains an unresolved and complicated situation in clinical practice, especially in the case of organ zzso Several factors contribute to its zzso the depletion of energy during zzso and the induction of zzso stress during zzso initiate a cascade of pathways that lead to cell death and finally to severe organ zzso Recently, the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso has gained increasing attention from researchers, due to their involvement in the zzso of a wide variety of cellular zzso There are seven zzso zzso and, among them, the zzso zzso 1 zzso and the zzso zzso 3 zzso are zzso expressed in many tissue zzso zzso are known to play major roles in protecting against cellular stress and in controlling zzso zzso which are key processes during zzso In this review, we mainly focus on zzso and zzso and examine their role in modulating pathways against energy depletion during zzso and their involvement in zzso stress, zzso zzso stress and inflammation during zzso We present evidence of the beneficial effects of zzso against zzso and emphasize the importance of developing new strategies by enhancing their zzso
