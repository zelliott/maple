zzso gene zzso is required for proper cell cycle exit in the developing mouse inner ear and its deletion in the zzso leads to proliferation of sensory zzso cells that differentiate into hair cells and supporting zzso In a conditional hair cell zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso hair cells differentiate and survive into adulthood whereas differentiation and survival of zzso cochlear hair cells are zzso To zzso survey the zzso zzso in the zzso inner ear, we performed zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso The comparative analysis shows that the core zzso shared between zzso zzso and zzso is centered on zzso the key zzso that mediates zzso zzso A majority of zzso expressed genes and enriched pathways are not shared but uniquely associated with zzso zzso or zzso In zzso zzso pathways involved in early inner ear development such as zzso and zzso were zzso whereas pathways involving in proliferation and survival are enriched in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso inner ear has characteristics of a younger control inner ear, an indication of delayed zzso We created a transgenic mouse model zzso in which zzso can be acutely deleted zzso Acute zzso deletion in the adult mouse fails to induce proliferation or cell death in inner ear, strongly indicating that zzso loss in these zzso zzso can be effectively compensated for, or that zzso changes in the zzso compartment result in events that are functionally irreversible once zzso This study thus supports the concept that zzso pathways relevant to hair cell development, encompassing zzso differentiation and survival, act predominantly during early zzso
