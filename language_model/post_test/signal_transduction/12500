zzso zzso zzso cells are a major peripheral output of the sympathetic nervous zzso zzso release from these cells is driven by synaptic zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has long been shown to be the primary zzso at the zzso zzso acting through zzso zzso zzso receptors to elicit action zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This zzso stimulation has been shown to zzso under sustained zzso yet zzso release persists under this same zzso Recent evidence supports synaptic zzso cell stimulation through alternate zzso One candidate is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso present in the adrenal zzso shown to have an zzso effect on zzso cell zzso In this study we zzso native zzso stimulation of adrenal zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso detection to demonstrate that zzso specifically elicits zzso release under elevated zzso zzso Further data reveal that the immediate zzso stimulation involves a zzso C and protein zzso zzso zzso to facilitate calcium influx through a zzso and zzso calcium zzso that results in zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso acts as a primary zzso at the zzso zzso under the stress zzso
