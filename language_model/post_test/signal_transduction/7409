zzso zzso cells play an essential role in zzso zzso They are also widely employed as donor cells for cloning by zzso cell nuclear zzso Our previous studies revealed that zzso zzso was zzso in cloned zzso zzso These data indicated that zzso may regulate normal zzso cell differentiation and that its zzso in clones could contribute to zzso gene zzso We used zzso zzso of zzso to assess its role in determining zzso cell zzso and compared the effects of this zzso to published data for zzso gene regulation in cloned zzso We observed widespread effects on the expression of genes related to diverse processes in cultured zzso cells, including cell zzso and DNA zzso zzso function, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso with apparent effects of zzso in promoting zzso cell proliferation and survival and zzso zzso Overall, the data zzso zzso as a key component in the zzso zzso zzso signals, zzso zzso factors, and zzso factors in the control of zzso cell zzso We also observed altered expression of 25 zzso cell markers of zzso quality, indicating an important role of zzso in production of high quality zzso Finally, we found that about one-quarter of the genes showing zzso zzso in cloned zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso cells, consistent with a role for zzso zzso regulation in zzso abnormal cloned zzso zzso
