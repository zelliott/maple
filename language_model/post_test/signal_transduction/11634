The study of zzso zzso patterns is a classic and enduring field of zzso zzso zzso of zzso pattern development comes from a variety of systems, including zzso zzso and more recently, the zzso zzso zzso Recent analyses of the mechanisms underlying the development of the neural zzso zzso cell type common to all zzso the zzso have revealed remarkable similarities and several surprising differences between zzso and zzso Here, we zzso recent advances in the study of zzso development in zzso with reference to human, zzso and avian zzso We first review zzso development in zzso and zzso followed by a summary of the molecules known to be required for their zzso We then discuss several relatively unaddressed issues in zzso zzso pattern development that are being investigated in zzso These include determining the relationships between genetically distinct classes of zzso characterizing and zzso zzso stem cell development, and understanding how zzso cells organize into a patterned zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso pattern zzso as well as new generations of directed zzso screens promise to extend our understanding of zzso pattern zzso
