The ability to zzso an zzso reaction via direct zzso electron transfer has been demonstrated for a number of zzso zzso In the case of zzso electron transfer, the electron is transferred directly from the zzso to the zzso zzso via the active site of the zzso or vice zzso The electron itself is the second zzso for the zzso An important point characterizing zzso is the zzso removal of the reaction zzso Therefore the zzso attached to the zzso is able to zzso zzso reaction and forms a zzso zzso The zzso can be detected by zzso measurement of the removal of reaction zzso The zzso zzso is able to zzso the reaction of oxygen zzso Therefore a zzso molecular layer attached to the zzso surface forms an oxygen zzso The formation of the layer results in a change of the zzso feature of the zzso zzso label coupled with either zzso or zzso allows the detection of zzso complex zzso on the zzso zzso The detection is virtually zzso The zzso for the reaction are molecular oxygen and the electron zzso Numerous zzso zzso of different formats zzso displacement and zzso have been developed, as well as the zzso detection system for zzso
