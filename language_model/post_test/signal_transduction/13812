Using NO specific probe zzso rapid zzso oxide zzso zzso as a response to zzso zzso treatment has been observed in the zzso from the zzso of sunflower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso leads to significant reduction in NO zzso indicating that NO signals represent an early signaling event during zzso zzso A surge in NO production has also been demonstrated in whole zzso zzso showing zzso root zzso zzso Evidence of zzso zzso of zzso proteins as a consequence of NO zzso has been provided by western zzso analysis and zzso in the sections of zzso producing zzso zzso Most abundant zzso labeling is evident in proteins ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso of a particular protein zzso zzso is completely absent in presence of zzso (which suppresses zzso zzso Similar lack of zzso zzso of this protein is also evident in other conditions which do not allow zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have revealed that zzso treatments (such as zzso for zzso zzso from zzso segments coincide with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins in the zzso zzso in contrast with negligible (and mainly zzso zzso of proteins in the zzso cells and zzso zzso Application of zzso does not affect zzso zzso of proteins even in the presence of an external source of NO zzso zzso zzso proteins are abundant around the zzso in the actively dividing cells of the root zzso Thus, zzso rapid response to zzso treatment through differential distribution of zzso zzso proteins is evident as an inherent aspect of the zzso zzso
