The invasion of host cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is calcium zzso We have identified two calcium storage areas in zzso the zzso zzso and zzso that contain high zzso of calcium as zzso calcium zzso zzso Our data indicate that these zzso slowly lose their calcium during the zzso development of the zzso as their nucleus zzso content zzso We found fluctuations in the sulfur content of the zzso during invasion following the zzso of protein from the zzso zzso with a loss of sodium and zzso and the zzso of zzso from the host cell zzso We demonstrated that penetration of the zzso into the host cell was accompanied by increases in the zzso of zzso and sulfur in the host cell nucleus, probably due to increased zzso The zzso sodium zzso zzso while the zzso content zzso Thus, the zzso element distribution of zzso and host cells changes during invasion and zzso growth of the zzso In addition, our results indicate that zzso calcium might be involved in the zzso of the zzso from the host zzso
