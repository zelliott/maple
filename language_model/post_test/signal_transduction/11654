A decade after the discovery of zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso methods that finally allowed gentle zzso of large zzso mass zzso has become a powerful tool in protein analysis and the key technology in the emerging field of zzso The success of mass zzso is driven both by innovative zzso designs, especially those operating on the zzso or zzso principles, and by large-scale zzso strategies, which use mass zzso to detect the isolated zzso Any human protein can now be identified directly from zzso databases on the basis of minimal data derived by mass zzso As has already happened in zzso increased automation of sample zzso analysis, and the interpretation of results will generate an avalanche of qualitative and quantitative zzso zzso zzso interactions can be analyzed directly by zzso of a zzso bait followed by mass zzso identification of its binding zzso By these and similar strategies, entire protein complexes, signaling zzso and whole zzso are being zzso zzso modifications remain difficult to analyze but are starting to yield to generic zzso
