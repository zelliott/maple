The nuclear factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor whose zzso results in zzso viral zzso and growth zzso Due to its role in zzso zzso is considered a key target for drug zzso In the present report we show that zzso (a zzso zzso a known zzso agent, is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso cells with tumor necrosis factor rapidly activated zzso this zzso was completely suppressed by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the binding of zzso protein to the DNA but rather inhibited the zzso leading to zzso zzso The reversal of zzso effects of zzso by reducing agents suggests a critical zzso group is involved in zzso zzso zzso blocked the tumor necrosis zzso zzso and degradation of zzso an zzso zzso of zzso and inhibited zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso As zzso also inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid but not that activated by hydrogen zzso or zzso the zzso leading to zzso zzso is likely different for different zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso zzso and it acts at a step prior to zzso zzso
