Human zzso zzso must adapt to cold climates, and yet, in zzso human zzso beat frequency zzso is zero at 4 degrees zzso Similarly, zzso zzso do not die of pneumonia despite a core body temperature as low as 6 degrees C, zzso that zzso continue to zzso Here, we show that protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso II zzso regulate the profile of human zzso zzso in response to rising temperature from 4 degrees zzso zzso of zzso beat was at 10 degrees C in zzso zzso 7 degrees C in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the calcium zzso zzso or the zzso blocker zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso and 6 degrees C for the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso During cell warming to 32 degrees C, the zzso profile was zzso in all solutions except those containing zzso Surprisingly, zzso continued to beat despite 4 degrees C and were significantly more responsive to rising temperature with either zzso or zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso regulate the zzso slope and profile of zzso in zzso and that when these protein zzso are manipulated, zzso can continue to beat despite zzso These findings may relate to zzso responses to cold zzso
