zzso and zzso between nuclear hormone receptors often zzso For example, zzso zzso alpha zzso physically binds to zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso its zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and the vitamin D zzso zzso however, is zzso Here, we zzso the molecular mechanisms linking zzso and zzso zzso and for the first time we show that zzso physically associates with zzso in human breast cancer zzso We found that zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of the vitamin D target zzso zzso by zzso and the activity of zzso a vitamin D responsive reporter, by zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso experiments illustrated that zzso 1 and 4 of zzso hinge and zzso binding zzso respectively, governed this zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso zzso domain attenuated its repressive action on zzso zzso indicating that this domain is integral in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to compete with zzso for their binding partner zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso effect on zzso action, enhancing zzso zzso In conclusion, these observations uncover molecular mechanisms connecting the zzso and zzso zzso
