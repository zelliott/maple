zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso proliferation and survival through stimulation of its specific zzso zzso however, the potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso to promote growth and proliferation of human zzso cells remains poorly zzso We identified five human pancreatic cancer cell lines that express the zzso and analyzed cell growth and survival in response to zzso zzso Although zzso toxin (an zzso of zzso and zzso (an zzso of zzso zzso increased levels of zzso zzso in all cell lines, the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso only in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso regulated zzso zzso 1/2 zzso in zzso 45 cells in a zzso zzso growth factor zzso manner, whereas zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the proliferation of these cell lines in zzso and did not inhibit zzso after exposure of cells to zzso agents such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, daily zzso treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on the propagation of zzso or zzso 45 tumor cells evaluated in nude mice in zzso Thus, acute or chronic (4 weeks) zzso stimulation does not modify the growth or survival of human pancreatic cancer zzso
