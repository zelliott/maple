From earliest development on, the vitamin D zzso zzso is expressed in most cells of the zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor that regulates in complex with zzso active vitamin D the expression of more than 900 genes involved in a wide array of zzso functions zzso calcium zzso growth control, zzso zzso immune response, zzso zzso severe health problems are associated to vitamin zzso zzso of the major active form zzso from vitamin D and subsequent metabolism are exclusively controlled by specific zzso zzso a zzso process, starts with a zzso primarily by zzso zzso zzso and zzso may also zzso and a subsequent zzso via zzso zzso in the zzso zzso acts at sites of zzso expression (target zzso in an zzso zzso However, it is also capable of zzso functions since various target zzso are fully competent in zzso zzso as illustrated by three zzso zzso levels are zzso the hormone zzso its rapid metabolism by zzso that attacks repeatedly the vitamin D zzso side chain, thereby producing a complex cascade of transient zzso with increasing zzso Most of these zzso still retain zzso activities on the zzso contributing to the overall effect that is commonly attributed to zzso As selective zzso of zzso increase the lifetime and thereby the function of vitamin D zzso they will help exploring whether and which intrinsic activities distinct zzso zzso It appears likely that this strategy may zzso important regulators of new zzso
