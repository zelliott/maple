In the zzso system zzso a zzso surface zzso is restricted to group I zzso zzso zzso cell lines and a subset of zzso center B zzso Recently, we have reported that zzso B zzso of zzso which specifically binds to zzso induce programmed cell death of zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that an zzso zzso zzso zzso immobilized on tissue culture dishes also zzso zzso and we have explored the signal zzso events leading to this cell zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso causes an increase of the zzso zzso concentration zzso to an influx of zzso zzso through calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso partially prevents zzso zzso indicating that this process is probably zzso zzso We show that the zzso of zzso provokes an increase of zzso zzso levels followed by zzso protein zzso zzso We report that zzso cells produce zzso when they are exposed to zzso but, unexpectedly, without a zzso decrease in zzso or zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso calcium zzso and zzso (which increases zzso levels of zzso independently induce zzso of zzso zzso cells and, moreover, that zzso and zzso strongly zzso to cause cell zzso The possible role of zzso zzso in the B cell selection that occurs in zzso centers is zzso
