We earlier documented that zzso zzso zzso of small zzso zzso activity protects vulnerable zzso zzso in mixed zzso cell cultures zzso with zzso zzso and in a zzso model of multiple sclerosis zzso However, the precise mechanism of OL protection remains zzso We here employed genetic and zzso approaches to zzso the underlying mechanism that protects zzso treated zzso from zzso zzso necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso toxicity in in zzso zzso enhanced the zzso oxygen species zzso generation and zzso membrane zzso with corresponding lowering of zzso zzso level in zzso and that were reverted by zzso In addition, the expression of zzso detoxifying zzso zzso and zzso 2) and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso were enhanced by zzso in similarly treated zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity enhanced the levels of zzso zzso in zzso via zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade zzso Small hairpin zzso zzso studies established that zzso mainly enhances zzso and less so of zzso and zzso zzso that enhances zzso detoxifying defense in zzso In support of this, the observed zzso protection was lacking in zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso these data provide unprecedented evidence that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso boosts zzso detoxifying defense in zzso via zzso mechanism that has implication in neurodegenerative disorders including zzso
