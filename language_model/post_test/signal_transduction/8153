zzso zzso zzso zzso are important molecules in zzso and zzso communication, playing a major role in signal zzso zzso We have previously identified and characterized the molecular structure of a new zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits the characteristic features of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of which it is the first member described in zzso zzso we show that genes zzso to zzso are also present in other zzso species and the transcript is detected in zzso zzso The zzso protein was detected at all the main zzso stages and was most abundant in zzso and zzso zzso However, no protein was detected in zzso maintained in zzso for 7 zzso By zzso zzso we showed that zzso is particularly concentrated at the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play a role in signal zzso pathways involved in zzso transformation after penetration into intermediate and definitive zzso
