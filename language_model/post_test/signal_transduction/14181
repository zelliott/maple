During mismatch repair, zzso is responsible for mismatch detection and the recruitment of zzso to the mismatch through a mechanism that is unknown in most zzso Here, we identified a discrete site on zzso that is occupied by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso binding site is composed of two adjacent zzso zzso located zzso in an exposed loop of zzso zzso of this site renders zzso defective in binding zzso zzso and in zzso while also eliminating mismatch zzso Analysis of zzso repair complexes in zzso shows that zzso zzso defective in interaction with zzso are zzso in a repetitive loading zzso Furthermore, these zzso zzso repair complexes persist on DNA away from the DNA zzso suggesting that zzso remains loaded on mismatch zzso DNA awaiting arrival of zzso We also provide evidence that zzso and zzso interact independent of mismatch binding by zzso zzso and in zzso suggesting that zzso can zzso probe zzso to determine if zzso is mismatch zzso Together, these data provide insights into the mechanism that zzso employs to recruit zzso and the consequences that ensue when zzso recruitment is zzso
