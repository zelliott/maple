Cell proliferation in the developing zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso occurring in two zzso to generate a consistent number of zzso zzso The later phase of cell division is promoted by zzso zzso zzso from a zzso subset of zzso cells, the tip cells, which express the zzso zzso and are thus able to zzso the zzso zzso zzso We show that the response to zzso zzso and in consequence cell division, is patterned by the zzso of a second cell type in the zzso These cells are primed to respond to zzso zzso by the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso which is zzso on zzso zzso and Seven zzso While expression of zzso is induced by zzso zzso seven up is initiated in a subset of the zzso cells through the activity of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that both zzso and responsive cells are set aside in each zzso zzso from a zzso zzso cluster of cells, in a zzso zzso First, a zzso cluster develops within the domain of zzso zzso cells to initiate the zzso of seven zzso Second, lateral zzso zzso by the zzso zzso acts within this cluster of cells to segregate the tip cell zzso in which zzso gene expression strengthens to initiate zzso zzso As a consequence, when the precursor cell zzso both daughters zzso zzso and become zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells competent to zzso the zzso signal and divide ensures a rapid and reliable response to zzso zzso in the zzso and also zzso a limit on the extent of cell division, thus preventing zzso zzso
