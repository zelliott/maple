zzso zzso are major consumers of microbial biomass in aquatic zzso However, zzso mechanisms underlying prey recognition and zzso by zzso are not well zzso We investigated the potential roles of cell signaling mechanisms in zzso response to zzso and in capture of prey cells, by a marine zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso signal zzso zzso caused a decrease in both zzso response and zzso zzso of zzso coupled zzso signaling pathways significantly decreased zzso response but had no effect on prey zzso zzso compounds did not appear to affect general cell health, but had a targeted zzso These results support the idea that cell signaling pathways known in other zzso organisms are involved in feeding behavior of zzso zzso
