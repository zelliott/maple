Previously, we reported that the zzso factor zzso zzso regulates zzso responses to zzso zzso infection in an zzso zzso In an effort to further understand this regulation, we examined the development and plasticity of zzso cells during zzso zzso zzso zzso cells recovered from infected zzso mice were amenable to the zzso effects of zzso as zzso expression of zzso reduced zzso zzso We subsequently addressed the role of zzso family zzso zzso and zzso and report that zzso mice infected with zzso zzso exhibited a significant increase in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso culture of these cells with zzso led to a dramatic reduction in zzso production and zzso increase in zzso zzso the ability of zzso to suppress zzso was independent of zzso Surprisingly, and contrary to results reported for other zzso zzso had no zzso effect on zzso development, as zzso mice failed to show any increase in their zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso could not compensate or zzso with zzso to suppress zzso production ex zzso Thus, we have established that zzso not zzso is critical for regulating zzso responses to zzso zzso
