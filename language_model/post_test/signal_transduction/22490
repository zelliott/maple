The development of zzso organisms relies on a small set of construction zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and temporally regulated in a zzso manner to produce the diversity of zzso within the zzso These basic processes are well zzso across tissue types and species at the level of both genes and zzso Here we review the zzso zzso and zzso transformations that occur in two well-studied model systems of zzso folding to illustrate both the complexity and zzso of tissue zzso In particular, we discuss the possibility of a spatial code specifying zzso To decipher this code, engineers and scientists need to establish quantitative experimental systems and to develop models that address mechanisms at multiple levels of organization, from gene sequence to tissue zzso In turn, quantitative models of zzso can inspire novel methods for creating synthetic zzso and treating degenerative tissue zzso
