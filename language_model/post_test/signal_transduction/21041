We previously reported the isolation of zzso zzso two zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Elliott, zzso zzso zzso and Johnson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso experiments were used to examine the regulation by zzso and zzso of the dual specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically zzso and activates zzso whereas zzso zzso and activates both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of zzso as assessed by enhanced zzso and by its ability to zzso and activate zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was also observed following zzso of zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso directly activated zzso zzso in zzso but failed to activate zzso The sites of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were identified within zzso zzso zzso and zzso Replacement of zzso or zzso in zzso with Ala abolished zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso indicated that zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso were necessary for zzso zzso by zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso is zzso activated by zzso whereas zzso is activated both by zzso and zzso zzso with these zzso zzso and zzso also activated zzso in zzso However, zzso failed to activate zzso when zzso in either the absence or presence of zzso indicating that zzso is not coupled to zzso zzso in zzso These observations suggest that regulation of zzso and zzso pathways by zzso may involve distinct mechanisms to prevent zzso zzso but to allow zzso zzso
