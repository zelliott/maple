The zzso consists of zzso and zzso cells generated from common neural zzso cells during zzso Cellular events for neural zzso cells, such as proliferation and zzso are regulated by multiple intrinsic and zzso cell zzso Although much is known on the importance of the zzso factors in regulating the fate of neural zzso cells, the involvement of other molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso remains to be zzso To zzso the biological functions of zzso in neural zzso cells, we zzso an immortalized neural zzso cell line, zzso which does not express zzso zzso with a fusion protein of zzso zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso proliferation induced by zzso growth factor zzso was severely zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells was dependent on the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, and the zzso zzso of this zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso zzso retarded proliferation of zzso cells via repression of the zzso zzso The result supports the concept that zzso may play an important role in regulating the proliferation of neural zzso zzso
