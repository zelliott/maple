Previously, we demonstrated that ethanol zzso zzso current zzso in zzso of zzso freshly isolated from the zzso zzso area zzso of rats zzso zzso zzso zzso 296 (2001) zzso In the present study, we examined the role of protein zzso C zzso in this action of ethanol on zzso zzso from young zzso zzso ethanol and zzso zzso when applied separately zzso zzso However, ethanol zzso of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso a zzso zzso also increased zzso and reduced ethanol zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor antagonized the zzso effects produced either by zzso or by zzso Thus, ethanol zzso of zzso may be associated with zzso zzso While zzso application of zzso acid, a zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso had no appreciable effect on ethanol zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced ethanol zzso an action the zzso inhibitor zzso negative control zzso zzso zzso did not zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso of zzso zzso
