Exposure of zzso cells to viruses will activate the host zzso zzso factor, resulting in zzso and immune protein zzso zzso virus zzso the zzso zzso expresses products that inhibit this zzso zzso To identify novel mechanisms responsible for this effect, we made use of a zzso deletion zzso zzso that stimulates zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso In this zzso system, the zzso of zzso gene expression and nuclear zzso were reduced in the presence of either zzso zzso or zzso two compounds capable of blocking zzso and zzso zzso A similar repression was also observed in cells that contained a dominant, zzso form of zzso but not in cells where zzso zzso was inhibited via zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Presumably, proteins expressed from a zzso zzso that block zzso activity would also inhibit zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the expression of one such open reading frame, zzso supported this zzso First, zzso zzso expression hampered zzso zzso induced by exposure to zzso zzso zzso Second, viral zzso expression via infection of cells with a zzso zzso construct that zzso expressed zzso decreased the zzso of zzso compared to that in cells infected with the parental zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso virus restored the zzso zzso zzso as indicated by decreased zzso migration to infected cell zzso and interference in zzso Thus, in zzso cells, zzso apparently zzso its zzso protein to interfere with a zzso that would otherwise enable zzso zzso and the consequential zzso of an zzso zzso
