zzso zzso zzso stimulates natural killer zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso delivers zzso signals from the zzso zzso to the zzso cell interior are incompletely zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso stimulation induced the zzso zzso of multiple proteins in zzso cells, together with a prominent reduction in the zzso mobility of zzso The present studies indicate that zzso zzso a rapid zzso or zzso 1 zzso increase in the zzso activity of zzso as measured by increases in protein zzso zzso activity in zzso Furthermore, in response to zzso zzso itself zzso complex zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps indicate that zzso stimulates a pronounced increase in the zzso of the zzso region of zzso containing multiple known sites of zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced a marked increase in the zzso of a zzso zzso containing the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso serves as a zzso for both protein zzso and zzso zzso activated during stimulation of this cell type with zzso Furthermore, these results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell physiology are initiated and regulated by a complex and zzso interaction of different protein zzso including zzso
