zzso zzso zzso components regulate zzso outgrowth in tissue culture and in zzso Live imaging of zzso zzso signals revealed that zzso zzso growth cones extending on zzso zzso zzso assemble adhesive point contacts containing enriched levels of zzso zzso Whereas focal zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso for the assembly of focal zzso in zzso cells, zzso activity is required for the formation of growth cone point zzso zzso point contacts promote rapid zzso outgrowth by stabilizing zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, local zzso activity is required for zzso growth cone turning in zzso suggesting that zzso may control zzso zzso in zzso zzso with this possibility, proper growth and guidance of zzso sensory zzso and spinal zzso zzso requires zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as a key regulator of zzso growth and guidance downstream of growth zzso zzso
