zzso of the molecular mechanisms regulating cell zzso zzso transition and migration movements during zzso zzso is steadily zzso In the zzso and fish zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed around the zzso and play an important role in regulating cell movements associated with zzso In the chicken zzso although zzso and zzso are expressed in the primitive streak, the known zzso gene is expressed in zzso and intermediate zzso and in differentiated zzso cells, but not in the zzso Here, we identify a previously zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Chicken zzso is expressed in the primitive streak in a pattern similar to chicken zzso and zzso When zzso zzso signaling is blocked using a zzso zzso zzso zzso movements are inhibited and cells accumulate in the primitive zzso Furthermore, disruption of zzso zzso signaling by zzso of full-length or zzso zzso or zzso constructions abrogates normal cell migration through the primitive zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso in part by zzso is important for regulation of zzso cell movements in the avian zzso
