The triggering zzso expressed on zzso cells 1 zzso has been implicated in the production of zzso zzso and zzso during bacterial infection and zzso For downstream signal zzso zzso is coupled to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that Bruton zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso becomes zzso upon zzso zzso In zzso cell lines, in which expression of zzso was diminished by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were reduced after zzso zzso zzso zzso production of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso cell surface markers were impaired in zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained upon zzso stimulation of zzso of zzso zzso The analysis of cells containing zzso zzso revealed that intact membrane zzso and a functional zzso domain were required for zzso zzso Finally, after zzso engagement, zzso production by zzso was reduced in the majority of patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso a rare zzso disease caused by zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, our data identify zzso as a positive regulator in the zzso zzso zzso and suggest its implication in inflammatory zzso
