zzso occurring zzso regulatory T cells are generally identified through their expression of zzso However, in several experimental systems considerable zzso activity has been observed in the zzso zzso Upon adoptive transfer, the expression of zzso in zzso cells is not stable, with zzso cells appearing in zzso T zzso animals and vice zzso We show in this study that zzso cells arising from donor zzso cells upon zzso proliferation in recipient mice express markers of freshly isolated zzso cells, display an zzso state, and suppress the proliferation of other cells in zzso The maintenance of zzso expression by zzso cells depends on zzso zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso T cells in peripheral zzso zzso
