The zzso zzso zzso zzso acts in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells, zzso and zzso cells, zzso on target cells, binds to the zzso zzso zzso and signals via complex formation with the zzso expressed zzso zzso Paradoxically, most cells that respond to zzso during inflammatory states do not express the zzso and are themselves not directly responsive to the zzso A naturally occurring soluble form of the zzso renders all cells responsive to zzso This alternative signaling process is called zzso zzso Here we developed a transgenic strategy based on the zzso of the soluble form of zzso which specifically blocks all zzso responses zzso by the soluble zzso but does not affect zzso responses via the membrane bound zzso In these mice, inflammatory processes are blocked as in zzso mice, strongly arguing for a major role of the soluble zzso during inflammation in zzso
