We examined the effect of IGF-1 in a rat model of stress urinary zzso induced by simulated childbirth zzso 

zzso birth trauma was induced by zzso zzso in female Sprague zzso zzso zzso 7, 14 and 28 days after zzso we performed functional assessment by measuring leak point pressure, zzso baseline pressure and the zzso response during a passive zzso in zzso zzso The expression of IGF-1 and zzso zzso and protein in damaged zzso was examined by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 150 zzso per day) was continuously delivered from 1 day before zzso using subcutaneous zzso zzso Four and 7 days after zzso the effect of zzso treatment was examined by functional analysis of leak point pressure, zzso baseline pressure and the zzso response as well as Western zzso and zzso zzso 

After 4 and 7 days rats with zzso zzso had significantly decreased leak point pressure, zzso baseline pressure and zzso zzso IGF-1 and zzso zzso and protein levels were significantly increased in zzso and zzso nerves 4 and 7 days after zzso IGF-1 treated groups showed significant improvement in leak point pressure, zzso baseline pressure and zzso responses 4 and 7 days after zzso Moreover, IGF-1 treatment increased zzso zzso and induced cellular proliferation and zzso effects in the zzso 

IGF-1 treatment accelerated recovery from stress urinary zzso induced by simulated childbirth trauma in association with zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso This suggests that IGF-1 has therapeutic potential for stress urinary zzso in zzso
