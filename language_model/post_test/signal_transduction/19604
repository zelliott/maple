zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common human zzso and is primarily defined by zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells of zzso zzso presumed cell of origin for zzso well as in zzso stem cells, zzso mast cells and germ zzso Yet, families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mice with zzso Kit zzso almost exclusively develop zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the cellular context is important for zzso to mediate zzso Here we show that the zzso family member zzso is highly expressed in the zzso of zzso sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso and is required for their zzso In addition, zzso is universally highly expressed in zzso and is required for growth of zzso and resistant zzso cell zzso zzso profiling and global analyses of zzso sites suggest that zzso is a master regulator of an zzso zzso network mainly through zzso zzso The zzso zzso program is further regulated by activated zzso which zzso zzso protein stability and zzso with zzso to promote zzso We propose that zzso arises from zzso with high levels of zzso zzso expression that, when coupled with an zzso zzso zzso drives an zzso zzso zzso zzso This differs from other zzso zzso such as prostate cancer, melanoma and Ewing zzso where zzso zzso or amplification drives zzso zzso zzso It also represents a novel mechanism of zzso zzso factor zzso
