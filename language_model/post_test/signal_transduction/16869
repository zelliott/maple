The use of zzso zzso acting outside the central nervous system zzso is a promising therapeutic strategy for pain control that avoids deleterious central side effects such as zzso and zzso In human clinical trials and rat models of inflammatory pain, peripherally restricted zzso have repeatedly shown powerful zzso zzso in some mouse models however, their actions remain zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso zzso to zzso channels as a mechanism to explain such zzso We found that zzso channels, major zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso are absent from mouse peripheral sensory zzso but present in human and zzso In zzso transgenic expression of zzso channels in mouse zzso established peripheral zzso zzso and local zzso We further identified a regulatory element in the rat zzso gene that accounts for differential expression in zzso Thus, zzso channels are indispensable for peripheral zzso zzso and their absence in mice has profound consequences for zzso zzso in peripheral sensory zzso
