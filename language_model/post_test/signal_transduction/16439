Different types of sensory zzso in the zzso root zzso project zzso to the spinal zzso to convey peripheral information to the central nervous zzso Whereas most zzso zzso enter the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso typically do so zzso Because heavily zzso zzso zzso project to the zzso spinal cord, zzso zzso and their associated zzso avoid the superficial zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether their exclusion from the superficial zzso horn is an important aspect of neural zzso Here we show that a mouse zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso placement of the shafts of zzso zzso and their associated zzso in the superficial zzso horn, zzso its synaptic zzso zzso and zzso analyses show that proper zzso positioning does not seem to be required for sensory zzso connectivity with motor zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso from zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso inhibit zzso formation in zzso zzso Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between zzso and zzso formation in zzso which might be an important element in controlling the development of neural wiring in the central nervous zzso
