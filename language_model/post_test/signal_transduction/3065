zzso zzso zzso channels play pivotal roles in the cardiovascular zzso They regulate vascular smooth muscle tone and participate in cardiac action potential zzso in some zzso zzso zzso zzso channels were recently discovered to be zzso by members of the zzso zzso also called zzso zzso but the mechanisms of zzso gating by zzso remain zzso 

The objective was to identify regions of zzso involved in channel gating by zzso 

The zzso sensitivity of zzso was estimated from rates of current zzso and zzso in excised patches rapidly switched between zero and high zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso dramatically altered zzso zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to be in an zzso loop, but zzso zzso introduced into this loop are not accessible to zzso zzso suggesting this loop is zzso zzso applied zzso zzso zzso alter the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso as expected if zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso accessibility zzso of the putative zzso loop suggests that zzso and zzso are located adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso 

We propose an alternative model of zzso zzso based on zzso zzso accessibility, and zzso zzso These data contradict the popular zzso loop model by showing that the putative fourth zzso loop zzso 4) is zzso and may contain a zzso binding zzso These studies provide new perspectives on regulation of zzso by zzso
