The basic scheme of odor perception and signaling from zzso zzso to the brain is well zzso However, factors that affect zzso acuity of an animal, the threshold sensitivity to zzso are less well zzso Using signal sequence trap screening of a mouse zzso zzso zzso library, we identified a novel zzso zzso that is essential for zzso acuity in zzso zzso encodes an integral membrane protein with specific expression in the zzso and zzso sensory zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso mice display zzso zzso zzso including the impaired trafficking of zzso zzso III, stunted zzso zzso and a higher threshold for zzso and behavioral responses to zzso In addition, the expression of zzso form of zzso protein zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso a possible zzso link between zzso and zzso in the zzso sensory zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in establishing the acuity of zzso sensory zzso
