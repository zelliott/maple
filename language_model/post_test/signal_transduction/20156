zzso of nutrients in the stomach is of crucial importance for the regulation of zzso behavior especially in the context of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso in the gastric zzso with zzso elements are considered as candidates for sensing the composition of zzso food and consequently zzso gastrointestinal zzso To assess whether obesity might have an impact on gastric zzso cells, gastric tissue samples from zzso obese patients and zzso subjects were compared using a reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Analysis of biopsy tissue samples from human stomach revealed that transcripts for the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso involved in the reception of zzso acids and zzso the fatty acid zzso zzso the G protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso channel zzso are present in the human gastric zzso and led to the zzso of candidate zzso cells in the stomach expressing zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated striking differences in the expression profiles of specimens from obese subjects compared with zzso For zzso zzso zzso and zzso the expression levels were increased, whereas for zzso the level zzso Using zzso as an example, we found that the higher expression level was associated with a higher number of zzso cells in gastric tissue samples from obese zzso This remarkable change was accompanied by an increased number of zzso zzso 

Our findings argue for a relationship between the amount of food intake and/or the energy status and the number of candidate zzso cells in the gastric zzso
