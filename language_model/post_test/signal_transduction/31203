zzso is a zzso zzso composed of a unique zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso that is also common to zzso We defined the distinct signaling mechanisms that regulate the zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso expression but did not alter zzso expression or zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso and in human zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence either zzso zzso or zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso both zzso gene expression and zzso trans zzso zzso by zzso without affecting the degradation of zzso or DNA binding to zzso Furthermore, small interference zzso of zzso zzso attenuated cellular amounts of zzso and suppressed zzso zzso expression but did not affect zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso controls zzso zzso zzso expression through an zzso zzso trans zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso which causes differences in the control of zzso zzso and zzso expression by zzso
