The zzso fungus zzso commune has been zzso as a model system for examining the genetic regulation of sexual zzso a process that culminates in the production of mushrooms in this and many other related zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play a role in the control of mushroom development in zzso zzso The small zzso Ras also appears to impinge on the process, either by zzso into the zzso pathway, or by acting in zzso The molecular connections between zzso sensing and mushroom development are now beginning to be zzso
