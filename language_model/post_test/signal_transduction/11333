We have previously identified a nuclear zzso sequence zzso in zzso zzso This zzso functions zzso by forming a complex with its zzso factor zzso and the nuclear importer of zzso the zzso analog zzso The stability of this complex and the subsequent nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso are dependent on the integrity of this zzso showing that zzso nuclear import is zzso by the zzso zzso In this study, to directly evaluate the intrinsic requirement of nuclear zzso toward its zzso activities, we engineered a zzso in which the zzso zzso has been zzso by a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso large T zzso which would drive nuclear zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was equally active in zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was also zzso to the nucleus and was also recovered zzso as a complex with the zzso importer zzso like zzso zzso zzso with an zzso deletion zzso showed that deletion or changes within the zzso motif of zzso were inconsequential to the zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso complex, yet the presence of an zzso was critical to the expression of the zzso activities of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Our data zzso demonstrate that nuclear zzso of zzso is an intrinsic requirement for the full expression of the zzso activities of zzso and strengthen the conclusion that nuclear zzso of zzso is the primary role of zzso nuclear zzso This type of zzso zzso by zzso of activated zzso may contribute to the specificity of zzso nuclear zzso
