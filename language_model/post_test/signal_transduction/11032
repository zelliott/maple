According to our suggested hypothesis, long-term memory is a collection of zzso zzso selectively tuned to past zzso The formation of long-term memory occurs with the involvement of constantly appearing new zzso which differentiate from stem cells during the process of zzso in particular in zzso zzso of precursor zzso into zzso zzso selective in relation to ongoing events, supplemented by the involvement of zzso zzso zzso which increase the flow of information needing to be fixed in long-term zzso zzso zzso form before the informational processes occurring in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of new zzso zzso selectively tuned to a particular event results from the combination of zzso of the detector for stimulus characteristics and the novelty signal generated by zzso zzso in the zzso
