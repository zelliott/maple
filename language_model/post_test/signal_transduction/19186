zzso zzso zzso were developed for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso following the discovery of zzso zzso zzso in the majority of patients with zzso However, to date zzso inhibitor treatment has shown limited efficacy and apparent zzso in clinical zzso We report here that an zzso zzso zzso demonstrated efficacy in cell line and mouse models of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and essential zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso physically associated with both zzso and zzso and was zzso by zzso treatment in zzso and in zzso demonstrating that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused zzso zzso zzso of cell growth and signaling in zzso zzso cell lines and in primary zzso patient zzso zzso treatment of mice resulted in zzso degradation, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood counts, and improved survival in zzso models at doses that did not degrade zzso in normal zzso or cause substantial zzso zzso zzso treatment also reduced the zzso zzso burden in zzso These data establish what we believe to be a novel therapeutic rationale for zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
