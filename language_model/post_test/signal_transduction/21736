zzso is suggested to act as a tumor zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso does so by repression of zzso an zzso of zzso protein that regulates zzso progression as well as zzso and is commonly zzso in human zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells or zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells caused zzso or zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was paralleled by reduced cell zzso increases in zzso and decreases in zzso phase of the cell zzso In addition, zzso was zzso as judged by several zzso zzso expression of green fluorescent zzso in zzso zzso cells restored cell proliferation and zzso In addition, expression of zzso inhibited zzso activity of a zzso promoter construct in a zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso cells zzso associated with zzso and inhibited zzso zzso Similar results were obtained upon zzso expression in zzso cells, where zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso properties of zzso may be attributed to reduced zzso expression via a mechanism involving diminished zzso zzso
