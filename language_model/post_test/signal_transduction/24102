zzso is a zzso zzso by zzso and recognized as a hormone that could link obesity to insulin zzso This study was designed to examine the effect and zzso of insulin on zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso with insulin and zzso zzso expression was examined by Northern zzso zzso In some experiments, the insulin signal was blocked by several chemical zzso or zzso of a dominant negative form zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treatment caused a reduction of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso manners in zzso zzso zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso pathway, or zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, did not influence zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso also failed to block zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso a protein synthesis zzso completely blocked zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso D, a zzso synthesis zzso also blocked zzso reduction of zzso zzso and the decreasing rate of zzso zzso in cells treated with insulin alone was faster than that with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso independent pathways in zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso zzso by insulin would be an indirect event through the synthesis of novel zzso that could accelerate the degradation of zzso zzso
