Recently novel synthetic zzso derivatives were shown to have very powerful stimulating effects on the zzso of zzso C zzso by zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To provide an insight into the zzso mechanism of the newly zzso zzso by taking zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso as a typical example, in this work the defense signals were detected and their influences on the expression of important genes in zzso zzso zzso were examined in cell cultures of zzso zzso The zzso burst zzso zzso zzso was confirmed, and the induction of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso acid zzso synthesis was zzso The gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso of zzso zzso by a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively depressed the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso production by membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the transcriptions of those zzso For the zzso zzso production, it was suppressed with addition of zzso or zzso The results suggest that both zzso and zzso signals were involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the induction of zzso and zzso genes zzso but zzso was not essential to activate zzso Finally, a signal zzso cascade from defense signal response to activated zzso of zzso zzso genes and enhanced zzso production is zzso
