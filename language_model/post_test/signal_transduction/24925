zzso play crucial roles in a variety of cell processes such as zzso migration, zzso and differentiation of zzso For understanding the molecular mechanisms of these various biological effects, it may be particularly important to analyze cell signaling through the zzso Our previous study had shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in their zzso zzso upon engagement of zzso We identified zzso as zzso zzso zzso protein and successfully cloned its zzso zzso is a zzso zzso predominantly expressed in the cells of zzso zzso which led us to designate it as zzso Like zzso zzso contains a single zzso domain and multiple zzso binding sites zzso zzso which is suggested to bind zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso binds zzso on its zzso domain and zzso its zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso expressed in zzso it is conceivable that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso as well as the zzso signaling zzso zzso is zzso zzso following zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso which lacks the binding site for zzso is still zzso upon zzso zzso but not upon zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not involved in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we have identified a crucial role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have known to provide a zzso for zzso zzso production and proliferation of peripheral zzso We have found that this zzso zzso is impaired in the zzso zzso line, and that the expression level of zzso is reduced in zzso cells compared with peripheral zzso The zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells restored the zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso failed to do so, showing a contrast to the case with zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a key role through the association and zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso might be the zzso zzso protein that assembles the signals through zzso and zzso and zzso in a variety of zzso zzso
