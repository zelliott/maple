zzso zzso including zzso have been shown to be an important mechanism of gene zzso in zzso zzso has been well characterized at the DNA copy number and zzso expression zzso However little is known about DNA zzso zzso To gain a more global view of the zzso profile of zzso we conducted an zzso zzso Our data demonstrated tumors to segregate according to their location in the zzso which was associated with a difference in the global level of zzso zzso and spinal tumors displayed significantly more zzso genes than zzso zzso tumors, similar to the zzso island zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso and colon zzso This zzso profile was associated with an increase in expression of genes zzso for proteins involved in zzso DNA, suggesting an underlying zzso An integrated analysis of zzso and zzso expression array data allowed us to identify zzso expression zzso Most notably genes involved in the control of cell growth and death and the immune system were identified, including members of the zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, we have generated a global view of the zzso profile of zzso The data suggests zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes is an important mechanism in the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor zzso genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor zzso
