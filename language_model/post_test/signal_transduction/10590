zzso are highly zzso ubiquitous zzso zzso particles with an unidentified zzso For the three protein species zzso zzso and zzso and a small zzso that comprises vault, expression of the unique zzso major vault protein zzso is sufficient to form the basic vault zzso To identify and characterize proteins that interact with the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain of zzso and potentially regulate zzso activity, we used a pull-down zzso using zzso fusion zzso We found zzso as a zzso binding protein in human stomach zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also observed in zzso stomach cancer zzso A zzso zzso study using zzso zzso shows that zzso growth factor zzso stimulation triggers zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso and zzso region where it zzso with zzso We found that the interaction between zzso and zzso is critically dependent on zzso activity and protein zzso zzso zzso which are induced by zzso zzso Our results also indicate zzso to be a novel zzso of zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso inhibited the in zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso interacting with a protein zzso zzso involved in a distinct cell zzso zzso It appears that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso
