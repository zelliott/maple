The zzso development of the zzso zzso encompasses a series of critical events: the transition from zzso to zzso the first cell zzso the establishment of cellular zzso the first lineage zzso the first subtle steps toward a future body zzso Here, we use zzso to explore gene activity during zzso zzso We reveal robust and dynamic patterns of zzso gene activity that fall into two major zzso one up to the zzso stage zzso zzso and one after the zzso stage zzso zzso The mouse zzso and early zzso express components of multiple signaling pathways including those downstream of zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso regulators of cell fate and pattern formation are likely to function at the earliest embryonic zzso Overall, these data provide a detailed zzso profile of gene expression that reveals the richness of signaling processes in early zzso zzso
