In rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso persistent sodium currents in conjunction with zzso zzso currents are critical for generation of zzso membrane zzso and onset of burst zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso zzso persistent sodium zzso In particular, we show that zzso of zzso suppresses a zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso Bath application of zzso (20 zzso a stimulant for the production of zzso reduced the peak zzso zzso (20 zzso an inactive form of zzso produced minimal effects on zzso and the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso (2 zzso a specific zzso zzso suppressed the effect of zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in this zzso zzso zzso stimulation (20 zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso via the zzso signaling zzso Current clamp analysis demonstrated that zzso membrane resonance in response to a zzso input current at zzso holding zzso zzso zzso zzso was specifically suppressed by zzso or zzso Moreover, drug application enhanced frequency adaptation in response to a zzso current zzso These results indicate that zzso of persistent sodium currents by a zzso zzso can significantly alter the membrane zzso and discharge characteristics of zzso V zzso
