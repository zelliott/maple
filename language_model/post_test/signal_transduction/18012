The zzso zzso of zzso zzso integrate zzso from various cortical layers and are central to information zzso Here we show that the growth of zzso zzso towards the zzso surface is regulated by a zzso zzso present at high levels near the marginal zzso A major component of this signal is zzso 3A zzso which was previously characterized as a zzso for cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso localized to the developing zzso zzso and is required for the zzso effect of zzso Thus the zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso distinct zzso responses to zzso and zzso These observations reveal a mechanism by which a single zzso signal can pattern both zzso and zzso during zzso
