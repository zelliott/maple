Both zzso and zzso toxins inhibit zzso zzso turnover in rat zzso The actions of zzso and zzso toxins as well as those of zzso are reversed by zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso does not have a major effect on zzso zzso by the toxins in the presence of zzso The results suggest that the stimulation by zzso of zzso turnover does not involve direct obligatory zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Rather, indirect effects on protein zzso A zzso may contribute to the zzso effects of both zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests that caution must be exercised in interpreting zzso of zzso turnover by zzso toxin in whole cell experiments as indicative of direct involvement of a zzso zzso zzso
