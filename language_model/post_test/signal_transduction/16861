The present studies examined viability and DNA damage levels in zzso zzso cells following zzso and zzso inhibitor drug combination zzso zzso zzso zzso ; zzso ; zzso ; zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso ; zzso ; zzso to kill zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to increase both single strand and double strand DNA breaks that correlated with increased zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso down of zzso suppressed the drug-induced increases in zzso and zzso zzso and enhanced tumor cell killing by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso enhanced drug-induced DNA damage whereas expression of activated zzso suppressed both the DNA damage response and tumor cell zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso interact to kill zzso zzso cells and that increased DNA damage is a surrogate marker for the response of cells to this drug zzso
