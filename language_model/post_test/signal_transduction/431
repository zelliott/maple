zzso is widely used as an zzso drug in various diseases however excess of it often causes cardiovascular zzso The present study was undertaken to understand the molecular mechanism of zzso cardiac zzso 

zzso were treated daily with synthetic zzso zzso with or without zzso or zzso up to 15 zzso zzso parameters were measured by zzso method using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress were monitored after 15 zzso 

The zzso blood pressure was increased whereas the heart beat and cardiac output zzso were decreased by zzso zzso caused increase in the heart weight to body weight ratio zzso zzso increased level of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and an increased deposition of zzso in the zzso zzso of the left zzso which were inhibited by both zzso and zzso The rate of oxygen consumption was decreased in association with increased levels of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in zzso treated rat zzso All these changes were reversed by zzso and zzso 

The excess of zzso zzso cardiac zzso and zzso changes of the zzso via zzso II zzso zzso
