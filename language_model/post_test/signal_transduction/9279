zzso modifications are thought to be important for gene expression changes during development and zzso However, besides the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso there is scant evidence implicating zzso regulations in zzso The zzso signaling zzso zzso is a major life span regulatory zzso Here, we show that progressive increases in gene expression and loss of zzso on zzso components are due, at least in part, to increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the zzso gene extended the mean life span of zzso zzso by zzso dependent on zzso activity and not additive in zzso zzso The loss of zzso increased zzso on the zzso gene and decreased zzso activity, leading to a more zzso zzso zzso Like stem cell zzso our results suggest that zzso of zzso marks lost during aging might help zzso the zzso age of animal zzso
