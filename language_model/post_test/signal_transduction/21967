zzso zzso zzso stress zzso pathways are involved in various zzso of the central nervous system such as neurodegenerative diseases or zzso The current mechanisms linking zzso stress zzso to zzso cell fate upon chronic or acute stresses remain however to be fully zzso Recent studies have associated zzso stress severity and the relative zzso levels of certain output pathways to influence zzso zzso In the present report, to further test the impact of zzso stress severity on zzso survival, we designed an experimental system zzso acute and chronic stress in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse neural stem cells zzso Two well characterized zzso stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the duration of zzso zzso is critical for cell survival upon zzso zzso zzso transient zzso zzso is a protective event in zzso and zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso while zzso prolonged zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso stress zzso zzso expression regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression level are zzso altered upon TM and zzso zzso Increased zzso protein stability via its zzso on zzso induced by TM accounts for transient zzso zzso and the resulting cell survival in zzso and zzso zzso subjected to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso cell zzso through regulating zzso zzso
