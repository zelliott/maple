The zzso zzso regulates multiple biological events during embryonic development, including bone zzso zzso repair zzso some of the processes of normal bone development, such as the formation of bone from a zzso template, and many zzso pathways that zzso bone development are activated during the repair zzso The zzso signaling zzso is activated during fracture repair, and zzso of this zzso alters the normal zzso zzso In early zzso zzso stem cells, zzso signaling needs to be precisely regulated to facilitate the differentiation of zzso by contrast, zzso is not needed for zzso zzso Once zzso stem cells are committed to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling enhances bone zzso This activity suggests that the zzso zzso is a therapeutic target during bone zzso Indeed, treatments that activate zzso zzso such as lithium, increase bone density and also enhance zzso
