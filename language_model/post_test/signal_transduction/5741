zzso receptors take their zzso effects by affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso second zzso zzso has been recently suggested to play an important role in zzso zzso the compound that regulates the signal zzso may have potential as zzso zzso is the main component of zzso zzso zzso a well-known indigenous herb with comprehensive zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso produced beneficial effects on the stressed rats by effectively improving zzso low zzso consumption and reducing serum zzso levels in zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced zzso activity and zzso levels in zzso and various brain regions, and zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso 8 and zzso response element binding protein zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso reductions of zzso zzso levels and high expressions of central zzso receptors in zzso These results suggested that the potent zzso property of zzso might be attributed to its improvement of zzso zzso as well as zzso via suppressing central zzso receptors in the zzso zzso Our findings provided a basis for examining the interaction of zzso receptors and zzso zzso in depression and zzso zzso
