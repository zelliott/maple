zzso Forest virus zzso requires zzso replication and zzso for efficient zzso zzso However, cells lacking zzso continue to die in a zzso zzso In this study, we show in both mouse and human cells that this zzso zzso involves zzso innate immune signaling via zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso or zzso or zzso cells lacking zzso or zzso expression are resistant to zzso zzso The signaling zzso triggered by zzso does neither involve death receptors nor the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but the physical interaction of zzso with zzso on zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reduced in zzso zzso Thus, after zzso virus infection zzso does not only elicit a type I zzso response but also recruits zzso to zzso to mediate zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso
