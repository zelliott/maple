We investigated the role of tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family, in neural zzso response to zzso zzso zzso cells were obtained from zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso mouse zzso They were cultured in conditions allowing neural zzso to form zzso clusters zzso A 2 zzso zzso induced a zzso cell cycle arrest and triggered zzso in zzso neural zzso cultures in correlation with an enhanced expression of zzso and of its downstream target zzso both of them acquiring a nuclear zzso These effects did not occur in zzso neural zzso demonstrating the central role played by zzso in their response to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso induced zzso of wild type but not of zzso neural zzso indicating the existence of a functional zzso signaling zzso in neural zzso zzso radiation induced an increase of zzso membrane expression related to a zzso increase of zzso zzso expression in zzso neural zzso Moreover, zzso neural zzso exhibited delayed zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso these findings establish a role for zzso related to zzso in the response of neural zzso to zzso zzso Similar mechanisms could be triggered in neural zzso in case of different stresses during brain development or in the course of various diseases affecting the adult zzso
