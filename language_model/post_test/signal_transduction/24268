The zzso zzso provides the spatial cue that coordinates zzso with nuclear zzso However, the specific property of the zzso zzso that mediates this spatial regulation remains obscure, in part because different aspects of the zzso zzso appear to have zzso inducing activity in different zzso We show that in zzso zzso zzso although the central zzso is usually zzso for zzso zzso it becomes essential for zzso formation when the extent of zzso separation during zzso is zzso zzso of zzso density demonstrate that zzso formation occurs in the vicinity of a local minimum of zzso zzso Reduction of the extent of zzso zzso or disruption of the central zzso causes delayed formation of the zzso zzso These data suggest that reduced zzso density triggers zzso zzso initiation and demonstrate that redundant mechanisms direct efficient formation of the zzso zzso
