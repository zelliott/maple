We analyze here, by zzso zzso local and systemic plant responses in the interaction of barley zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the short term zzso zzso a constant flow of zzso zzso zzso along primary roots altered surface pH zzso whereas the zzso zone zzso zzso typical zzso zzso zzso zone zzso indicative of enhanced zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso Eight to 10 zzso after treating roots with zzso the zzso pH of leaves began to zzso which contrasts with observations of an zzso response to various zzso and zzso molecular patterns zzso In the long term zzso plants with zzso zzso roots responded to zzso with the zzso powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a leaf zzso pH increase of about 2, while the leaf zzso of zzso barley responded to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso merely with a pH increase of zzso The strong zzso pH response is reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH shifts in resistance zzso resistant barley leaves or upon treatment with a chemical resistance zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso did not induce resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and did not trigger the primed zzso pH zzso We speculate that the primed pH increase is indicative of and supports the zzso systemic response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso
