Bone zzso zzso zzso cells zzso offer great promise for zzso zzso Although certain zzso factors have been identified in association with tendency toward particular zzso differentiation zzso the regulatory network of key zzso signaling pathways activated by zzso zzso that induce various differentiation responses remains poorly zzso Attempts to predict differentiation fate tendencies from individual pathways in isolation are problematic due to the complex zzso interactions inherent in signaling zzso zzso we have undertaken a zzso systems approach zzso experimental measurement of multiple zzso zzso activities and zzso differentiation in zzso together with zzso analysis to zzso quantitative combinations of zzso signals zzso of cell behavior across diverse zzso In particular, for culture on zzso zzso surfaces presenting zzso zzso growth factor, type I zzso neither, or both, we have found that a partial zzso zzso model yields successful prediction of zzso behavior on the basis of two principal components zzso the weighted sums of eight zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso shock protein 27, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This combination provides the strongest zzso capability for zzso differentiated zzso status when calculated from zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso are also significantly zzso indicating a broad time frame during zzso osteogenesis wherein multiple pathways and states of the zzso signaling network are zzso integrated to regulate gene zzso cell zzso and ultimately, cell zzso
