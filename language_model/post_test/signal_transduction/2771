We have used two zzso zzso that bind zzso to study the relationship between the zzso of receptors with high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso and the responses zzso zzso zzso influx, and zzso of rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso One of these is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds specifically to the combining sites of a zzso zzso zzso and efficiently zzso cell surface zzso but does not trigger significant zzso or increases in zzso zzso Several lines of evidence, including lateral mobility zzso indicate that this zzso zzso forms stable zzso complexes containing two zzso and two zzso The second zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which causes lateral mobility changes consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso and also does not trigger increases in zzso zzso or zzso The two zzso together trigger robust zzso In the presence of zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a broad concentration zzso in a more narrow concentration range, it is a potent stimulant of changes in both zzso and zzso We have compared the zzso zzso for cellular zzso to simulated zzso zzso curves, zzso zzso that predict the equilibrium zzso zzso size distribution as a function of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso cellular zzso occurs at a much higher zzso concentration than zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso is zzso almost all zzso zzso is in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso appear to be functionally zzso even after they have been zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is effective in stimulating a cellular response may have particular structural or dynamic properties that allow critical interactions for initiating the signaling zzso
