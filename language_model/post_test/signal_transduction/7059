The ability to generate lung and airway zzso cells from human zzso stem cells zzso would have applications in zzso medicine, modeling of lung disease, drug screening and studies of human lung zzso We have established, based on zzso zzso a highly efficient method for directed differentiation of zzso into lung and airway zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso in zzso and in zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso type I and type II zzso zzso zzso The type II zzso zzso cells were capable of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso release, providing evidence of specific zzso zzso or removing zzso acid, zzso and zzso to signaling pathways critical for early lung development in the zzso defects in corresponding genetic mouse zzso As this protocol generates most cell types of the respiratory system, it may be useful for zzso zzso therapeutic zzso
