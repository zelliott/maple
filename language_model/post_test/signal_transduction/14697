Blood vessels and nerve fibers often course alongside one another in an orderly fashion throughout the zzso This zzso gives rise to a zzso signaling network between zzso and nerve cells that follows highly stereotyped anatomical zzso One such molecular signal that is produced by zzso cells and acts on surrounding zzso is heat shock protein zzso Here we briefly review recent studies that have revealed a critical role of this signaling zzso during harmful insults to the brain, particularly during episodes of cerebral zzso
