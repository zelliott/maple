zzso zzso zzso was used to clone genes associated with proliferation of oval cells in rat liver zzso after a zzso partial zzso combined with the feeding of zzso A subset of the identified genes comprised zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso which constitute part of the cellular program modulated by zzso zzso expression analysis performed by Northern zzso and zzso were extended to include zzso the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso three secondary response genes induced by interaction of zzso with zzso zzso complexes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The Northern zzso analysis showed that all examined genes were modulated when zzso oval cells were activated and recruited for liver zzso zzso localized the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, zzso and zzso the secondary response genes zzso and zzso the zzso factor zzso and ICE to the zzso structures of oval zzso In contrast, during liver zzso after a zzso partial zzso only zzso of zzso and ICE was zzso Our results, therefore, indicate that zzso events may be particularly important when cells in the zzso zzso must respond to liver damage by production of zzso oval zzso
