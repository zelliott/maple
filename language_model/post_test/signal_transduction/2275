zzso zzso cells and skin zzso from different zzso zzso zzso patients bearing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso released more zzso acid in response to zzso than do other zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were used as models to study the mechanisms of this zzso An 85 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in these cells and zzso increased its binding to zzso of zzso cells zzso but not to those of a double zzso zzso cells zzso or of control cells zzso The expression of G zzso protein was also increased in zzso cells, with increased stimulation of zzso zzso zzso C zzso by zzso and an early, transient zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso As the binding of zzso to zzso is zzso the increased zzso to zzso could cause the hypersensitivity to zzso zzso of the effects of zzso to those observed with zzso an inhibitor of calcium zzso suggests that the increase of zzso calcium is not the only mechanism involved in zzso acid release by zzso in zzso zzso The lack of effect of calcium zzso zzso or zzso on zzso acid release from any of the cell lines suggested that zzso needs a zzso zzso zzso step, perhaps via zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso after zzso stimulation still occurred in zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that a membrane component plus increased zzso calcium influenced zzso zzso to zzso The defective processing of zzso zzso seems to increase zzso stimulation by zzso since the zzso release of zzso acid is reversed by growing cells at 28 degrees C for 48 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso appears to increase the stimulation of zzso by zzso receptors in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso Hence normal zzso or normally processed zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso The greater zzso of zzso zzso cells to inflammatory zzso might be part of the increased sensitivity of zzso patients to lung zzso
