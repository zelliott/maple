Signaling via zzso zzso appears necessary for regulation of synaptic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso proteins were studied in area zzso of rat zzso slices 10 zzso after induction of long-term zzso zzso by 100 zzso s stimulation zzso zzso enhanced association of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an approximately 120 zzso zzso zzso component containing the focal zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Association of zzso with zzso and of zzso with zzso was increased following the zzso Further, increase in zzso zzso of zzso was detected following the zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in distinct signaling pathways and provide evidence for zzso of zzso and zzso following synaptic stimulation inducing zzso in zzso
