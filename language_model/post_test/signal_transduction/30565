Search of the protein database with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed putative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that could require partnerships with a pair of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of fatty zzso hybrid zzso A starter zzso protein zzso zzso domain was discovered in the zzso zzso This domain is thought to accept the fatty acid product from the zzso to initiate zzso zzso We expressed the zzso zzso SAT domain in zzso coli and showed that this domain, unlike that from the zzso zzso zzso transferred zzso four times faster than zzso The SAT domain also formed a zzso zzso intermediate and transferred this group to a zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso both human zzso zzso contain a zzso cluster with functional similarity to the zzso cluster found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and determination of in zzso SAT domain specificity provides a tool to uncover the growing number of similar zzso pathways in zzso and to guide zzso of the fatty zzso hybrid zzso that they zzso
