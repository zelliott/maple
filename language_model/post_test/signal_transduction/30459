Human and mouse zzso zzso proteins play an important role in zzso zzso development and zzso In this study, we examined the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso a membrane protein that acts as a tumor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was found to interact with zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso mouse zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso expression markedly reduced the ability of zzso to enhance migration, invasion, and formation of branching structures in zzso zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso together with zzso in zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso signaling zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso transgenic animals showed enhanced zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso tumors derived from mouse zzso tumor zzso mice showed a dramatic reduction of zzso expression as compared to zzso tissue from normal zzso mice, suggesting that in zzso zzso is zzso during the process of zzso zzso zzso
