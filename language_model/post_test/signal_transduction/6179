zzso zzso zzso zzso is central to zzso wherein the zzso of the zzso zzso members zzso and zzso results in the robust induction of type I zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unknown how the zzso signal zzso can be processed through zzso to zzso the induction of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso factor zzso interacts with zzso to form a complex in the zzso We provide evidence that this complex also involves zzso and zzso and provides the foundation for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The complex defined in this study represents an example of how the zzso of the signaling zzso and zzso zzso molecules together with the zzso factor regulate the processing of an zzso signal to evoke its versatile downstream zzso events in a zzso Thus, we propose that this molecular complex may function as a zzso zzso zzso
