Acute zzso rejection zzso involves both the innate and the zzso immune zzso As a critical zzso in peripheral zzso differentiation and function, zzso signaling is potentially involved in the zzso of zzso but its role in zzso responses has not been fully zzso By using fully zzso zzso transplantation model and zzso specific zzso deficient mice, we examined the role of zzso zzso in zzso responses in zzso zzso was significantly accelerated in zzso deficient mice compared with the zzso controls, as demonstrated by the marked reduction in graft zzso The reduction in graft survival was associated with zzso zzso specific zzso proliferation and increased number of zzso zzso and zzso cells in the zzso deficient recipient zzso Furthermore, although the frequency of zzso zzso was intact in zzso knockout recipients, their ability to suppress zzso responses in zzso was significantly zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may zzso zzso by suppressing in zzso expansion of zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso suppression ability, indicating that zzso zzso could be exploited to limit zzso zzso
