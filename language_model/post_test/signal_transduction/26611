We have demonstrated that entire zzso zzso system is zzso in the rat and human heart and this hormone is implicated in several cardiac functions including stem cells differentiation into zzso These observations led us to the invention of OT as an zzso of zzso zzso We also proposed the use of zzso its functional zzso and/or zzso precursors as well as zzso acids capable of zzso OT as zzso and useful agents for treating or preventing diseases, such as heart diseases associated with loss of zzso The invention is relevant to the use of OT or zzso zzso OT is claimed as an zzso that promotes the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which can be used to repair, restore or zzso damaged cardiac tissue or in cell culture in order to provide material for cell or tissue zzso in the zzso Recent reports documented the significant progress in the research on the role of OT in cardiovascular zzso Most of the results are consistent with the zzso zzso role of zzso In this review, new data are discussed in the context of the main points presented in the zzso
