We investigated whether insulin zzso known to mediate zzso plasticity in response to changes in nutrition, also zzso discrete zzso responses such as zzso We test the hypothesis that the gene zzso regulates growth arrest under zzso zzso a nutritional zzso in the horned zzso zzso zzso Male zzso in the zzso zzso vary their mating strategy with body size: large males express horns and fight for access to females while small males invest heavily in zzso and sneak zzso with zzso Given that body size and zzso nutrition are linked, we predicted that 1) zzso expression would zzso scale with body size zzso zzso between males and zzso and 2) manipulation of zzso expression would affect the nutritional zzso in horns and zzso First, we found that zzso expression varied with body size in a zzso and zzso manner, being more highly expressed in the abdominal tissue of large zzso zzso in particular in regions associated with zzso zzso Second, we found that zzso of zzso through zzso resulted in the growth of relatively larger zzso zzso compared to zzso individuals and zzso albeit modest, increases in relative horn zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso expression in the abdominal tissue limits zzso growth, and provides limited support for the hypothesis that zzso regulates relative horn length through direct suppression of horn zzso Both results support the idea that zzso zzso expression may play a general role in regulating zzso relationships in nutritional zzso by signaling traits to be relatively zzso
