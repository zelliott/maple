The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors mediate zzso biological functions by binding to zzso zzso Most zzso beta tails contain one or two zzso motifs that can form beta zzso These motifs are part of a zzso recognition sequence for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that are present in a wide variety of signaling and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso bind to zzso beta tails by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess the zzso of this interaction we examined the binding of a series of zzso zzso zzso to a panel of short zzso beta zzso In addition to the known zzso zzso we found that zzso (a negative regulator of zzso zzso and zzso (a signaling zzso involved in cell zzso and their isolated zzso domain bound to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso physically associated with zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso of the zzso beta tails confirmed that these interactions are zzso zzso zzso zzso First, the interactions were blocked by zzso of an zzso motif in the zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso interactions were observed with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso We used this zzso and a molecular model of an zzso beta zzso domain interaction to predict critical interacting zzso The importance of these zzso was confirmed by generation of zzso and zzso zzso in beta 7 and beta 3 zzso These data establish that short zzso beta tails interact with a large number of zzso zzso proteins through a structurally zzso zzso
