The growth and function of zzso such as pancreatic zzso adapt to meet zzso challenges and maintain zzso balance, but the mechanisms controlling these zzso responses are zzso Diabetes in patients treated with zzso zzso such as zzso A indicates that zzso factor of activated zzso zzso zzso might control zzso zzso responses, but the roles of this zzso in zzso in zzso are not zzso Here we show that mice with a zzso deletion of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso develop zzso diabetes characterized by decreased zzso proliferation and mass, reduced pancreatic insulin content and zzso Moreover, zzso lacking zzso have a reduced expression of established regulators of zzso zzso zzso expression of active zzso in zzso zzso zzso these defects and prevents zzso In normal adult zzso conditional zzso zzso promotes the expression of zzso regulators and increases zzso proliferation and mass, resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the expression of genes critical for zzso zzso function, including all six genes zzso in zzso forms of zzso type 2 zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates multiple factors that control growth and hallmark zzso functions, revealing unique models for the zzso and therapy of zzso
