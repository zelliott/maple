Visual activity acts via zzso zzso to refine developing zzso maps by shaping retinal zzso zzso zzso add and delete transient zzso and the dynamic rates increase when zzso blocks zzso as if this prevents release of a stabilizing zzso zzso entry through zzso activates zzso zzso zzso to release zzso acid zzso which taps into a zzso growth control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all stimulate zzso growth via AA zzso of protein zzso C to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our previous results show that blocking zzso mimics zzso blockers, whereas zzso AA reverses the increased zzso and zzso zzso also arrest zzso To test whether this zzso zzso control mechanism shapes zzso zzso in zzso we used the zzso promoter to express zzso fusion proteins in retinal zzso cells, and zzso zzso in zzso to test for effects of zzso levels and its zzso zzso zzso zzso gave faster growth and larger zzso zzso spatial extent, total length of zzso at three days and especially four zzso Surprisingly, the zzso 20 zzso acid segment alone caused the same increase in zzso but no increase in zzso Earlier studies zzso this region in zzso zzso resulting in collapse of growth cones, which is now known to zzso branch zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso to prevent zzso did not increase either branching or growth but resulted in zzso zzso zzso even at four to five zzso In support of this zzso effect, only half of zzso zzso expressing zzso successfully initiated zzso outgrowth zzso nearly zzso for zzso These results suggest that the region around the zzso zzso site, which binds zzso and zzso promotes growth only when zzso and also activates the branching control region in the first zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso introduces a bulky negative charge group, zzso of zzso to zzso introduces a bulky positive zzso But this also produced the same growth and branching as zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso is through zzso bulk rather than negative charge, in agreement with other zzso zzso The results zzso the zzso zzso as part of an zzso based mechanism that both zzso new zzso and zzso new branches near effective zzso
