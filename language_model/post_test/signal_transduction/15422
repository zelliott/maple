Gold zzso zzso have been widely used in various biomedical applications for zzso therapy, imaging and drug zzso Although zzso have been recognized as a biologically safe material, very little is known about their molecular and cellular zzso To evaluate the gene expression profile and mechanism of the molecular level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effect of particle size, we applied an expression profiling zzso zzso zzso of different particle sizes, 4 and 100 zzso were zzso administered to zzso mice zzso zzso body zzso Thirty minutes after injection of zzso the mice were sacrificed and liver zzso were zzso Then, pathological examination and zzso analysis were performed on the liver zzso zzso of the liver zzso did not indicate any pathological changes in all treatment zzso Only zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the total genes zzso zzso were significantly induced by the treatment of 4 or 100 zzso zzso zzso In addition, the 4 and 100 zzso zzso treatment groups shared zzso and zzso of the significantly changed zzso zzso zzso expressed genes by a single intravenous injection of 4 or 100 zzso zzso were zzso as zzso cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso In the specifically expressed genes of 4 or 100 zzso zzso although the genes were different each other, 4 and 100 zzso zzso showed similar gene categories such as cell cycle, response to stress, signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso we can conclude that 4 and 100 zzso zzso showed similar biological effects on liver zzso of zzso
