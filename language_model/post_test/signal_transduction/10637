In this study, we examined changes in the zzso and zzso events of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso was induced by treating experimental animals with zzso zzso zzso in drinking water for 7 zzso A significant decrease of zzso and an increase in zzso density as well as an increase in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C was observed in zzso zzso zzso from zzso hearts as compared to zzso zzso zzso Following stimulation with 10 zzso zzso (in the presence of 10 zzso zzso the increase of zzso parameters over baseline values was significantly higher in zzso than zzso hearts, while the opposite occurred under zzso with zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the increase in zzso positive zzso was accompanied by a significant increase in the zzso zzso C activity and in the zzso zzso content in zzso as compared to zzso zzso Our results suggest that cardiac zzso and its associated zzso signaling zzso may act as a reserve for zzso zzso response in hypothyroidism, where the zzso are zzso
