The neural cell zzso zzso zzso and its zzso form zzso contribute to many aspects of the development and plasticity of the central nervous zzso This includes mechanisms of cell differentiation and migration, zzso zzso establishment of specific patterns of synaptic connections, synaptic plasticity and long-term zzso How zzso and zzso contribute to regulate all these different mechanisms remains essentially zzso zzso properties appear to be important, but recent studies also point to possible interactions between zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso that are essential to biological zzso Some of these mechanisms are discussed and a hypothesis is proposed based on the existence of zzso between these molecules and zzso pathways zzso by growth zzso
