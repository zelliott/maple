The zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein can bind zzso zzso to activate the production of type I zzso and inflammatory zzso The zzso zzso can be bacterial second zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of single zzso zzso zzso data from the 1000 Genome Project revealed that zzso zzso occurs in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of human zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso had only modest effect on the stimulation of zzso and zzso promoter activities in zzso cells, while zzso had significantly lower intrinsic zzso The decrease was primarily due to the zzso zzso The zzso also affected the response to the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso partially decreased the ability to activate zzso while it was defective for the response to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso dramatically decreased the zzso response to all bacterial zzso Surprisingly, the zzso and zzso zzso maintained partial abilities to activate the zzso signaling in the presence of zzso due primarily to the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso protein could affect the zzso of the zzso domain of zzso and the binding to zzso zzso of zzso structure with that of zzso revealed that the zzso of the lid region that zzso onto the zzso was significantly zzso These results suggest that zzso variation can affect innate immune signaling and that the common zzso zzso expresses a zzso protein with reduced intrinsic signaling activity but retained the ability to response to bacterial zzso zzso
