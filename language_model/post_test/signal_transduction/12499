zzso zzso is a zzso zzso cellular zzso that acts in part by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling is an emerging zzso target for zzso zzso Although multiple zzso zzso types exist in the zzso little is known about their zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso and results from zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso show that in several regions a majority of this activity is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso as determined by zzso recordings in cortical zzso in zzso and this effect was zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso Moreover, central administration of zzso produced in zzso effects resembling the actions of zzso including zzso zzso hypothermia, zzso and zzso but these actions were independent of zzso zzso At least one of the central effects of zzso zzso zzso is also at least partly zzso zzso zzso because it was produced by zzso and attenuated by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso receptors are part of a zzso relevant and widespread zzso system, and that the zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso
