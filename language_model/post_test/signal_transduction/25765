In zzso the zzso zzso zzso operates in the regulation of the size of the stem cell population in the shoot zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a small zzso zzso to zzso regulate the expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor through three major zzso zzso complexes of zzso zzso OF zzso zzso zzso and recently identified zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso to understand the precise molecular details of zzso zzso we investigated the contribution of zzso potentially regulated by these zzso complexes, to the zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso zzso which is also zzso by the rest of the zzso zzso presumably by their direct zzso Our comprehensive analysis of the activities of the respective zzso receptors on zzso protein zzso zzso suggested that the precise balanced regulation of zzso activity by the zzso receptors is likely to be key for SAM zzso
