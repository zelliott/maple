zzso zzso by the zzso symbiotic bacteria zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion of the nap promoter region to the reporter gene zzso zzso was very low in zzso grown cells of zzso but expression was induced zzso zzso when the cells were cultured under zzso conditions, and zzso when nitrate was added to the zzso incubation zzso The zzso fusion was not expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso fusion was retained in the zzso zzso zzso but no increase in zzso activity was observed upon nitrate zzso zzso and zzso zzso nitrate zzso activity zzso showed that synthesis and activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso was similar to that in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains incubated zzso with zzso These results suggest that nitrate and zzso which are not reduced by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells respectively, induced the synthesis and activity of zzso conversely, formation of zzso NO was not required for induction of zzso zzso
