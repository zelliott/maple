Plant architecture is a major trait for plant survival and plant fitness and has a huge influence on the zzso value for most zzso The classical theory of zzso dominance based on zzso experiments suggested that two major plant hormones, zzso and zzso were acting zzso on bud outgrowth to promote or repress zzso However this theory was challenged in the late zzso by Snow who suggested the existence of a second zzso to zzso as zzso was not acting directly to repress zzso The use of branching zzso in zzso zzso and rice led to the discovery of a new zzso signal zzso zzso Genes involved in synthesis zzso zzso as well as in response zzso to this new signal have been identified and have given rise to a new model of the branching zzso Two independent group have recently zzso one on zzso the other on rice, that zzso zzso to this novel signal which zzso branching and to the secondary zzso in the theory of zzso zzso zzso have been first identified for their role in zzso of zzso plants like zzso or zzso They also play a critical role in the widespread association between zzso of plants and zzso the zzso zzso zzso as they are necessary for interaction between certain plants and zzso in the zzso
