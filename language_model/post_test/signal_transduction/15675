In addition to their zzso effects in inflammation and zzso zzso are involved in cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates its biological activities through zzso of G zzso zzso zzso and binds to zzso zzso 

Using zzso cell migration chambers, specific antagonists, flow zzso and zzso zzso we evaluate the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso invasion of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso cell invasion is dependent on zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso C delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are implicated in this event, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the invasion of zzso cells induced by zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells with zzso or with zzso zzso zzso or with zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso cell zzso zzso probably on zzso are involved in zzso cell zzso 

These data suggest that targeting the zzso interaction could be a new therapeutic approach for zzso in which zzso is zzso
