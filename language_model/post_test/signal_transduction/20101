The DNA damage response zzso is critical for the maintenance of genetic stability and serves as an zzso barrier during early zzso However, the role of the zzso in tumor progression and zzso is less zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso one of the critical zzso zzso is zzso in late stage breast tumor zzso with zzso zzso and this zzso zzso with elevated expression of the zzso transition marker, zzso At the molecular level, we demonstrate that zzso regulates Snail stabilization by zzso on zzso Using mass zzso we identified zzso as a critical binding protein of Snail in response to DNA zzso zzso binds to and zzso zzso zzso We further provide in zzso and in zzso evidence that zzso of zzso Snail zzso promotes tumor invasion and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that Snail zzso zzso is elevated in breast cancer zzso with zzso zzso indicating clinical significance of the zzso zzso Together, our findings provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso promotes tumor zzso highlighting a previously zzso role of the zzso in tumor invasion and zzso
