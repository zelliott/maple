We demonstrated recently that human zzso zzso zzso class I human zzso zzso zzso are able to induce zzso of resting human zzso as well as zzso zzso T zzso We now analyzed the signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso by human zzso class I zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of a broad spectrum of zzso had only a moderate zzso effect, and an inhibitor of zzso 3 failed to inhibit zzso class zzso zzso Although zzso 3 zzso was not observed, zzso DNA fragmentation was found in half of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso inducing factor zzso a zzso zzso death zzso was detected after 1 hour of treatment with human zzso zzso and was associated with large-scale DNA zzso whereas the release of zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso zzso followed zzso zzso and occurred after 2 zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso through zzso class I molecules represents a unique mechanism of cell death in zzso T zzso that involves two parallel zzso one zzso and the other zzso This study zzso the precise mechanism of zzso zzso zzso which might have clinical zzso
