zzso stimulates zzso synthesis in cultured airway smooth muscle zzso zzso This occurs via a zzso that zzso zzso the protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso is released and binds to cell surface receptors to stimulate zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by the use of zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso which all reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso also elicits the zzso of zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso activity in the cell zzso zzso Grady and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is likely to decrease the rate of zzso degradation markedly and therefore to zzso zzso zzso zzso Acute treatment of zzso cells with zzso (a direct zzso of zzso also zzso the zzso zzso of zzso However, in contrast with zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso release, suggesting that additional signals zzso zzso zzso are required for zzso by zzso to activate zzso zzso was also without effect on zzso release and zzso zzso Evidence that zzso can also directly regulate zzso zzso was obtained by using cells zzso with zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso zzso synthesis independently of zzso zzso zzso the combined treatment of cells with zzso (to activate zzso and zzso (to activate zzso zzso synergistic zzso zzso This might be due to the presence of the type 2 zzso zzso which is zzso activated by zzso and zzso
