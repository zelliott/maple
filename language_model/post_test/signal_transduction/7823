Parkinson's disease zzso is characterized by selective loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso Although the underlying causes are not well zzso zzso studies suggest an elevated risk of zzso with occupational zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso zzso 12 and zzso cells as well as rat primary cultured zzso zzso to investigate mechanisms for zzso cell death induced by zzso and zzso pesticides that are used to model zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso induce selective loss of zzso zzso in primary zzso We discovered that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso cells, while zzso exposure causes zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The selective ability of zzso and zzso to induce zzso in different cell lines zzso with their ability to activate zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso Newhouse et zzso 2004, zzso zzso 79, zzso as well as primary zzso and for zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso but not zzso plays a role in zzso loss of primary cultured zzso zzso Our data identify zzso zzso as a common mechanism underlying zzso cell death induced by both zzso and zzso in model cell lines and primary zzso
