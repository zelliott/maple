zzso zzso zzso zzso are key regulators of the insect innate zzso zzso Even if they have been zzso zzso some of them have yet unknown zzso Here, we present a functional analysis of zzso an as yet zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located in cluster with zzso and zzso which zzso a zzso and a negative regulator of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso predictions indicate that zzso would not bind to zzso pointing to a regulatory role of this zzso zzso expression was enriched in barrier zzso but low in the fat zzso Use of a newly generated zzso deficient zzso indicates that zzso is not required for the production of zzso peptides by the fat body in response to a systemic zzso Focusing on the respiratory zzso where zzso is strongly zzso we conducted a zzso zzso analysis of the zzso immune response of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparing our data to previous zzso studies, we report that a majority of genes regulated in the trachea upon infection differ from those induced in the gut or the fat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was reduced in the zzso of larvae and in the adult gut of zzso zzso upon oral bacterial zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso positively regulates the zzso zzso in barrier zzso
