zzso zzso of zzso cells into normal brain tissue is considered to be a main reason for the zzso outcomes of patients with zzso zzso Invasion of zzso cells into the brain zzso is facilitated by zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso are released as inactive zzso and get activated upon zzso by membrane bound zzso Here, we show that membrane type 1 zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is even lethal for zzso zzso zzso factors trigger the expression and activity of zzso via zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso pathway, as deletion of the zzso zzso adapter protein zzso or zzso zzso prevented zzso expression and activity in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn activates zzso zzso and promotes zzso expansion, as shown in an ex zzso model using zzso brain tissue and a zzso depletion zzso Finally, zzso zzso or zzso depletion largely attenuated zzso expansion in 2 independent in zzso zzso
