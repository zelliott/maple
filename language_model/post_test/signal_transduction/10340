zzso signaling plays a critical role in many cellular zzso including cell zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso protein interacts directly with zzso zzso its signaling by blocking the interaction with its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso during infection resulted in an absence of zzso cell zzso and zzso of viral zzso zzso of the zzso binding site in zzso which resembles that of zzso led to an identical zzso Thus, zzso of zzso signaling is required for both zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
