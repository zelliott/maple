The study of zzso impaired in the sensitivity or synthesis of zzso acid zzso has become a powerful tool to zzso the interactions occurring between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with potential to change the traditional view of the role of zzso as just being involved in growth zzso The zzso tomato zzso which is hypersensitive to zzso and zzso stress, shows enhanced growth zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso tomato zzso is also hypersensitive to zzso stress, but in contrast to zzso shows decreased sensitivity to zzso Surprisingly, blocking zzso zzso suppresses the growth zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso stress, but not the zzso hypersensitivity of zzso The zzso production of zzso zzso is increased compared with that of control zzso under zzso zzso In addition, the zzso plants are hypersensitive to root growth zzso by the zzso precursor zzso acid zzso This suggests that, in addition to zzso regulation, zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso As previously shown in zzso it is shown here that extensive zzso occurs between the zzso and zzso zzso pathways in tomato and that the zzso and zzso zzso appear as regulators of this zzso
