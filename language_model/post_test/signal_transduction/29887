Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso long term depression zzso at zzso zzso zzso However, the cascade responsible of zzso to activate zzso zzso and the signaling zzso immediately downstream from it to induce synaptic depression is poorly zzso Here, we show that transient zzso of group I zzso with the selective zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso through G protein zzso small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thus resulting in zzso zzso Furthermore, our data clearly show that an accelerating zzso zzso zzso by stimulating the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is a potential downstream processing of zzso zzso zzso to mediate zzso These results suggest an important role for zzso zzso zzso in the induction of zzso zzso by directly zzso to zzso trafficking zzso to facilitate the loss of synaptic zzso zzso
