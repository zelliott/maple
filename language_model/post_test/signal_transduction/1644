zzso is associated with an increase in coronary artery disease, but little is known about the regulation of coronary vascular tone by zzso zzso in zzso The present study evaluated the mechanisms zzso altered contraction to zzso in coronary small arteries from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited an increase in zzso blood pressure and plasma zzso levels compared with zzso zzso zzso to zzso (1 zzso zzso to 3 zzso zzso zzso measured in isolated coronary small arteries maintained at a constant zzso pressure of 40 zzso was largely reduced in vessels from zzso rats compared with zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso binding in the impaired contraction to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was measured in zzso isolated from coronary small zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and binding affinity were similar in coronary zzso from zzso rats compared with zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso concentration zzso were measured in freshly zzso coronary small artery smooth muscle cells loaded with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a 30 zzso zzso increase in zzso in smooth muscle cells from zzso rats, but had no effect on cells from zzso rats (2 zzso zzso In zzso the zzso coronary artery contraction and increase in zzso are impaired in zzso zzso rats, whereas zzso zzso binding is not zzso These results suggest zzso zzso zzso from signaling mechanisms and indicate that impaired zzso signaling contributes to the decrease in zzso contraction of coronary small arteries in zzso zzso zzso
