zzso tuberculosis is a zzso metabolically flexible zzso that has achieved a spread in the human population that is zzso by any other bacterial zzso The success of zzso tuberculosis as a pathogen can be attributed to its extraordinary stealth and capacity to adapt to environmental changes throughout the course of zzso These changes include: zzso zzso zzso various zzso stress conditions and, in the case of the zzso species, the zzso zzso zzso of the physiology of zzso tuberculosis during this process has been limited by the slow growth of the zzso in the laboratory and other technical problems such as cell zzso Advances in zzso and molecular methods to analyze the zzso tuberculosis zzso have revealed that zzso changes are zzso by complex regulatory networks and signals, resulting in zzso gene expression coupled to zzso and energetic zzso An important goal for bacterial zzso will be to zzso the physiology of zzso tuberculosis during the transition between the diverse conditions encountered by zzso zzso This review covers the growth of the zzso cell and how environmental stimuli are sensed by this zzso zzso to different environments is described from the viewpoint of zzso zzso energy generation, and zzso To gain quantitative understanding of zzso physiology will require a systems biology approach and recent efforts in this area are zzso
