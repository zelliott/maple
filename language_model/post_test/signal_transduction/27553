zzso is a zzso cell line derived from a patient with zzso syndrome zzso The cells readily undergo zzso in response to various agents, and the cell line has been suggested as a useful model to study zzso in zzso The aims of the present study were to assess differentiation and zzso induced with zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso to characterize the mode of zzso in these two model systems, and to assess the influence of zzso zzso factor zzso which in combination with zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso in zzso zzso induced differentiation and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were partially rescued (by zzso from zzso with zzso zzso induced zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, but no signs of preceding maturation or zzso rescue were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both zzso through the zzso zzso and were partially blocked with the general zzso inhibitor zzso zzso treatment with zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso However, the two pathways differed in terms of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso which was not affected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso of zzso while zzso remained zzso The zzso system did not seem to play a major role in any of these zzso zzso Our results may provide new tools to study the mechanisms of zzso in zzso
