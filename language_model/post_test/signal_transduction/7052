The zzso zzso locus plays an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso Our zzso analysis of the zzso locus provides new information on the complex regulation of this zzso zzso of the zzso is regulated by a promoter upstream of the zzso and by a second internal promoter upstream of the zzso zzso Here we identify the location of the internal promoter and provide information on how this promoter is zzso by proteins within the zzso We determined by primer extension that the zzso promoter is located within the zzso gene and identified several regulatory regions important for zzso The higher activity of the promoter in a zzso deletion strain indicates a role in repression by the zzso response zzso Further, this promoter had higher activity in a zzso deletion strain, implicating zzso or a signaling role for the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that this promoter can be controlled by host zzso Analysis of zzso regulation of this locus provides a better understanding of the function of the zzso locus in zzso zzso zzso
