zzso human zzso type 16 zzso is found in a subset of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso drives zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with the viral zzso E6 and zzso paralleled by a low level of zzso in zzso and zzso loss at zzso zzso and zzso genetic changes frequently found in zzso of zzso zzso We zzso that two pathways to zzso zzso one determined by zzso and the other by environmental zzso To define the critical genetic events in these two zzso we now present a detailed zzso analysis of zzso with and without zzso involvement by employing high-resolution zzso comparative zzso zzso Four regions showed zzso in zzso tumors that were absent in zzso zzso losses at zzso zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso Also, zzso tumors demonstrated loss at zzso in contrast to gain in zzso zzso Seven regions were altered at high frequency zzso in both groups: gains at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and losses at zzso and zzso These data show that zzso arising by environmental zzso are characterized by genetic zzso that differ from those observed in zzso zzso and most likely occur early in zzso A number of genetic changes are shared in both tumor groups and can be considered crucial in the later stages of zzso zzso
