The zzso cell line was used to study the cellular mechanisms of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso release, but not its zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso release was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was abolished by zzso toxin zzso indicating that G alpha zzso belonging to the zzso and zzso family were involved in the zzso zzso labeling using zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso stimulation in cell zzso produced zzso of four G alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was also reversed by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso formation and calcium currents in zzso zzso The zzso of calcium currents inhibited by zzso were characterized using holding potential sensitivity and calcium channel zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso but not the zzso calcium zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso calcium zzso Taken together, the present findings indicate that zzso receptors can couple through zzso zzso G alpha zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and calcium currents and suppress zzso release from zzso zzso
