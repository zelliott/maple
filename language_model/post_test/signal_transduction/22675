zzso of scatter factor zzso also known as zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso is often associated with zzso progression of human tumors, including zzso zzso of zzso in experimental zzso enhances zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth of new blood zzso However, the role of zzso zzso or zzso expression in the zzso progression of zzso has not been examined zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that human zzso can be zzso dependent and that a reduction in zzso zzso or zzso expression can lead to zzso of tumor growth and zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso genes was inhibited by zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso consisting of zzso small nuclear zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of reduced zzso and zzso expression on 1) zzso induction of immediate early genes zzso and zzso indicative of signal zzso 2) zzso colony formation zzso an in zzso correlate of solid tumor zzso and 3) zzso tumor formation in zzso mice were zzso zzso tests were zzso 

Introduction of the zzso into zzso cells reduced expression of the zzso and zzso genes to as little as zzso of control cell zzso Reduction in zzso expression specifically inhibited zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso expression in zzso cells possessing an zzso zzso loop reduced tumor cell zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and substantially inhibited zzso zzso and tumor growth in zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first successful zzso of zzso and zzso expression in a tumor model directly demonstrating a role for zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso Our results suggest that targeting the zzso signaling zzso may be an important approach in controlling tumor zzso
