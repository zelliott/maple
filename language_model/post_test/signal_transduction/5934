The transfer of information by chemical signals during complex biological processes can, with increasing frequency, be described in terms of interacting signal zzso External zzso is rarely zzso rather, signal pairs are zzso in processes such as hormone zzso zzso cell growth and zzso The zzso of external zzso often results in the occurrence of zzso One signal appears to turn the cell on or off, and its synergistic partner increases cell zzso providing gain control of the cellular zzso zzso release provoked by certain zzso arises from a synergistic interaction between two zzso zzso zzso releasing hormone zzso and a zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell has been used to unravel the zzso zzso zzso of an external signal interaction that generates zzso Research emphasizes the single cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso free zzso were performed using the zzso fluorescent probe zzso and zzso for digital image zzso A reverse zzso plaque zzso was used to measure cumulative zzso release from single zzso cells in zzso What is the zzso role of zzso zzso as a zzso What are the zzso and feedback relationships between major second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso That is, how are individual zzso circuits zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso may act as a common signal into which interacting second zzso signals zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and integrated to govern zzso zzso A novel circuit of zzso pathways linked by zzso is proposed as the zzso basis for the synergistic interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
