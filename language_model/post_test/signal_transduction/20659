The zzso signal zzso zzso is central to T cell differentiation from zzso stem cells zzso Although T cell development is well characterized using expression of cell surface zzso the detailed mechanisms driving differentiation have not been zzso This issue becomes central with observations that adult zzso exhibit poor differentiation towards the T cell lineage relative to zzso or embryonic zzso This study investigates the contribution of zzso zzso and zzso support cells to differentiation of adult and zzso Blood zzso human zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso at weekly intervals during development for zzso markers using flow zzso zzso were also zzso for zzso expression at critical zzso zzso zzso of the central zzso marker zzso was initiated independently of zzso zzso while cells grown with zzso zzso had reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in partially differentiated cells increased zzso zzso and protein zzso and promoted differentiation to zzso zzso T zzso We identified a set of genes related to T cell development that were initiated by zzso zzso and also a set of genes subsequently altered by zzso signal zzso These results demonstrate that while zzso zzso is essential for establishment of the T cell zzso at later stages of zzso its removal late in differentiation promotes more efficient zzso cell zzso zzso zzso adds to signals provided by zzso cells to allow zzso to differentiate to T cells via initiation of zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso We also identify gene expression profile differences that may account for low generation of T cells from adult zzso
