In response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso drives multiple neuroendocrine and behavioral mechanisms to regulate energy zzso While central zzso reduces food intake and body weight, the specific zzso sites of zzso zzso downstream neural zzso and zzso zzso involved in this regulation remain largely zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso engages a neural energy regulatory circuit by stimulating zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso nucleus of the solitary tract to acutely suppress food intake by reducing meal zzso We identify central zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways as zzso zzso required for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso metabolism produced longer-term reductions in meal zzso Our data identify a novel, specific zzso circuit that links zzso acid availability and zzso sensing to the control of food zzso
