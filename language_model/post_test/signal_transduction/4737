Over the last two decades, extensive research on zzso medicinal compounds has revealed exciting and important pharmacological properties and activities of zzso zzso vegetables, zzso zzso herbs and medicinal plants are all considered to be biological sources of these zzso which have attracted great attention especially for their potent zzso and zzso zzso Published reports in the past have described the molecular zzso underlying the various biological activities of zzso which range from zzso of acute and chronic zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso induction of zzso suppression of zzso and zzso However systematic analysis of various pharmacological properties of these important classes of compounds has not been zzso In this review, we describe in detail the zzso zzso and therapeutic properties of selected zzso that inhibit multiple zzso signaling molecules and zzso factors involved in the zzso progression and promotion of various zzso zzso targets modulated by these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso that regulate tumor cell zzso zzso survival, invasion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, this review also analyzes the potential role of novel synthetic zzso identified recently which mimic natural zzso in physical and chemical properties and are moving rapidly from bench to bedside zzso
