The signaling zzso activated by insulin and IGF-1 contribute to the control of multiple cellular functions, including zzso metabolism and cell zzso In most cases these effects are zzso at least in part, by insulin zzso zzso zzso one of which is insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is a member of the Ras family of zzso and is involved in a variety of biological zzso including zzso zzso cell migration, and control of cell zzso Here we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso a regulator of zzso activity that has been implicated in breast cancer, regulate the level of zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso In particular, expression of a zzso activated zzso zzso zzso or of zzso zzso the degradation of zzso leading to the impairment of signaling through insulin but not zzso growth factor zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso levels in zzso cells zzso zzso degradation induced by zzso signaling blockade but not by long-term insulin zzso zzso with these results, both zzso expression and zzso signaling blockade lead to the degradation of zzso at least in part, through zzso zzso These findings show that zzso activity mediates zzso of insulin signaling associated with suppression of zzso action, implicating this zzso in a zzso mechanism associated with zzso treatment of breast zzso
