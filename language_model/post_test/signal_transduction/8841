zzso zzso have essential structural and zzso roles in tissue zzso during embryonic development, but the mechanisms that control their formation are still poorly zzso zzso are key components of basement zzso and are thought to be essential for initiation of basement membrane zzso Here, we report that muscle zzso cells zzso the zzso migrate zzso in the zzso zzso in the absence of sonic zzso zzso zzso and we show that this zzso is due to the failure to form a zzso basement zzso We reveal that expression of zzso which encodes zzso zzso a zzso of zzso is not activated in zzso zzso Recovery of zzso expression or addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso restores the zzso basement zzso demonstrating that zzso is necessary and sufficient to initiate assembly of the zzso basement zzso This study zzso an essential role for zzso zzso in the control of zzso synthesis and in the initiation of basement membrane assembly in the zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that zzso function cannot be compensated by zzso
