zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso hormone with zzso zzso However the role of zzso in human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso if any, remains zzso The effects of zzso zzso were tested with regard to cell zzso zzso and cell differentiation into zzso The zzso pathways involved in these processes were also zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and zzso approaches before and after being induce to differentiate into zzso zzso protein levels were used as an protein index, whereas cell zzso was studied by deprivation of fetal bovine zzso zzso zzso expressed stem cell markers as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso which decreased when they were induced to differentiate into zzso process produced zzso and zzso changes in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso These effects were exerted at least through the zzso and zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso significantly reduced cell zzso Our data indicate that, in zzso zzso promotes cellular proliferation and zzso and prevents cell differentiation into zzso These latter findings underscore the potential therapeutic role of zzso in preventing the zzso zzso associated with obesity and, zzso could bolster the maintenance of zzso stores by promoting the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso may have some function during embryonic zzso Thus, both the zzso and its zzso were identified early in the mouse development, as well as zzso modified significantly gene expression in mouse zzso zzso zzso These findings also suggest that the zzso implications of zzso imbalance in adulthood may have a counterpart during zzso
