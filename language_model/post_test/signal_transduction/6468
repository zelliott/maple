The zzso zzso factor zzso is expressed in sensory zzso and zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso muscles in chick zzso and is essential for the development of zzso connections between these two populations of zzso zzso need a zzso from limb bud zzso to initiate zzso zzso It is not known whether the mature expression pattern arises because zzso and zzso zzso are uniquely competent to respond to peripheral signals and express zzso or whether all zzso are competent to express zzso but normally only zzso and zzso zzso are exposed to the requisite zzso zzso To investigate these possibilities, we examined zzso expression in zzso that encountered limb tissue surgically mismatched with their target identity at stages after motor pool identities are zzso We found that zzso expression was not invariably linked to motor pool identity or target zzso and was more malleable in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso expression is regulated differently in sensory zzso and zzso Most striking was the observation that zzso zzso to the normal zzso and zzso pools could express zzso when exposed to the appropriate peripheral signals, although this competence did not extend through the entire zzso zzso zzso Thus, it appears that a zzso of competence to express zzso is established in early zzso zzso most likely in concert with their target identity, and that the expression zzso of zzso are subsequently refined by peripheral signals at later zzso
