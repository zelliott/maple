zzso the balance between zzso zzso and zzso differentiation is required for a regulated expansion of the developing zzso Previous observation that neural crest cells zzso migrate throughout the zzso regions, where trunk skeletal muscles first emerge, suggests a potential role for these cells in influencing early muscle zzso However, specific signaling interactions between zzso and skeletal muscle cells remain zzso Here we show that mice with specific zzso and peripheral nervous system defects display impaired survival of skeletal muscle and show skeletal muscle zzso cell zzso depletion due to precocious commitment to zzso We show that reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso culture experiments and genetic zzso in the zzso we demonstrate that zzso signals provided by the zzso lineage play a critical role in sustainable zzso by restraining zzso from precocious zzso
