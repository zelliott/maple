The vast majority of human tumors are of zzso origin and result from the zzso of zzso that alter the function of pathways that control critical cellular zzso including zzso checkpoint regulation, and zzso zzso replicating these events in animal models is critical to understanding the biology of cancer and for testing the feasibility of novel zzso We developed a mouse model that zzso the steps of zzso tumor progression of multiple tissue types zzso breast, zzso surface, and prostate zzso which takes advantage of the power of mouse zzso and that allows for zzso analysis, genetic selection, and zzso Moreover, this model enables functional interrogation of far more complex tumor zzso both of the tumor cells themselves, and of the cells in the tumor zzso This is a crucial advantage, as human tumors result from multiple compound zzso most of which are difficult to achieve through standard zzso mouse zzso We have applied this model to establish the role of zzso in zzso solid tumor progression and in treatment response, which has provided novel opportunities for cancer therapies in zzso
