zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso zzso cells zzso but the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly zzso We investigated the pathways regulating zzso factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso Exposure to zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso indicating the ability of zzso to activate the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso Similar findings were observed when zzso were exposed to zzso Both zzso and zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso In the presence of zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso were no longer able to activate zzso and expression of zzso was reduced, whereas zzso abundance was not zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso a component of the zzso complex, reduced the ability of zzso to increase zzso zzso was also necessary for zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso increased the generation of zzso oxygen species in zzso which was reduced by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso or zzso Finally, zzso media from zzso treated with zzso or zzso induced tube formation in cultured human zzso vein zzso zzso In conclusion, in zzso exposed to zzso or zzso increased expression of zzso requires both zzso of zzso and generation of zzso oxygen species via zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso but not zzso zzso
