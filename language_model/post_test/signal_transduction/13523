zzso zzso remains a major cause of acute zzso brain injury, leading ultimately to zzso dysfunction manifest as cerebral zzso mental zzso and zzso Research in experimental animals over the past 10 or more years has expanded greatly our understanding of the cellular and molecular events that occur during a zzso insult to brain, and recent discoveries have suggested that zzso zzso arising in the recovery period after resuscitation contribute substantially to the nature and extent of zzso zzso The review focuses on those zzso processes responsible for the maintenance of cellular zzso and how these mechanisms fail in zzso to culminate in brain zzso zzso of these critical events has opened new avenues of potential therapy for the fetus and newborn infant subjected to cerebral zzso to prevent the serious delayed effects of zzso brain zzso
