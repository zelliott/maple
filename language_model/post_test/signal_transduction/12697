Drugs with tumor selectivity may have an important benefit in zzso We have previously shown that zzso derived from the medicinal plant zzso kills various zzso cells through the zzso zzso zzso with only minor zzso to normal zzso Here, we show further that zzso zzso promotes zzso cell death in zzso T cells by differential regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhances and also zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso T cells leading to zzso of zzso but zzso of zzso zzso We also show that zzso T cells express a significantly higher amount of Bid - the molecular zzso that bridges the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a substantially lower amount of zzso in response to zzso stimulation compared to normal T cells is zzso This difference may provide a therapeutic window for cancer zzso The effect of zzso on zzso of zzso cell death in zzso T cells was further demonstrated in zzso in a mouse zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso may be a potential zzso drug that simultaneously targets both zzso and zzso expressions in tumor zzso This study may also provide a new clue to design a more efficient chemotherapy by using a combination of stimuli that engage the zzso and the zzso death zzso
