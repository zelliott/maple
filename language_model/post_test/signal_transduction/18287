zzso zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso enters nerve endings during a primary infection, is transported to sensory zzso and establishes zzso within zzso of a zzso of zzso The zzso state is characterized by absence of zzso zzso zzso minimal zzso of productive cycle zzso and high expression of zzso and zzso viral zzso termed the major zzso transcripts zzso within zzso of a zzso of infected zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso locus has been reported to both facilitate the establishment of zzso in additional zzso and to increase the frequency of spontaneous and induced viral zzso in animal model zzso More recent evidence suggests some possible mechanisms that may explain the relationship between zzso and both zzso and establishment of zzso This review summarizes general aspects of zzso but focuses on the structure, zzso and function of zzso and the interaction between host zzso regulators and viral gene expression that may impact zzso and zzso A model that incorporates evidence from a number of experimental studies is proposed that summarizes the involvement of the zzso locus in the biology of zzso zzso
