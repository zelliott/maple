The effects of a transient exposure to hydrogen zzso (10 zzso at 200 zzso zzso on pancreatic beta cell signal zzso and insulin zzso have been zzso In rat zzso insulin zzso evoked by zzso zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso was markedly blunted following exposure to zzso In contrast, the zzso response induced by plasma membrane zzso (20 zzso zzso was not significantly zzso Similar results were obtained in zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso as zzso After zzso treatment, zzso no longer zzso the membrane potential zzso of zzso cells or increased zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso responses were still observed with 30 zzso zzso despite an elevated baseline of zzso zzso appearing approximately 10 zzso after exposure to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso by zzso abolishing the zzso action of zzso These zzso changes correlated with altered zzso zzso the latter was not preserved by the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was increased following exposure to zzso up to the zzso zzso No further zzso occurred after zzso addition, which normally raises this zzso Nevertheless, zzso was still efficient in enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly reduced by zzso treatment, probably explaining the decreased zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data point to the zzso as primary targets for zzso damage, which will eventually interrupt the zzso of signals normally zzso zzso metabolism to insulin zzso
