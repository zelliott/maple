zzso growth factor beta zzso is a central zzso factor for zzso cells, and zzso of zzso zzso have been demonstrated in many different human zzso We have zzso human zzso zzso zzso for potential zzso zzso in regard to expression of zzso and zzso and expression changes of the zzso zzso zzso Ski and zzso as well as zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso was detected in all zzso while, using zzso loss of zzso expression was found in zzso of zzso Neither zzso in the zzso sequences nor significant zzso expression changes of the Ski and zzso genes were zzso In zzso cell lines, expression of both genes was zzso potentially involving zzso Ski showed a distinct nuclear speckled pattern, indicating recruitment to active zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased in zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso was derived only from zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated zzso These data argue against a significant role of Ski and zzso in human zzso and suggest that, in the majority of zzso the zzso factors are zzso by an upstream zzso potentially by zzso zzso
