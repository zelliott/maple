zzso cancer is a significant cause of cancer mortality worldwide as the disease has advanced significantly in patients before symptoms are zzso The signal zzso pathways that promote this rapid progression are not well zzso zzso or zzso an zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso signaling zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso zzso profile in a pancreatic cancer tumor zzso and observed that expression levels of activated zzso and zzso positively correlated with the severity of disease progression and zzso correlated with the survival of patients with pancreatic zzso To explore the mechanisms by which zzso promotes tumor zzso we investigated the role of zzso an zzso and zzso zzso zzso activates zzso directly in pancreatic and other cancer cell lines by zzso zzso at zzso to promote cell zzso In addition, the zzso inhibitor zzso not only inhibited zzso zzso but also suppressed zzso zzso zzso leading to cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso This effect resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and induction of zzso zzso our data indicate that activated zzso could be a zzso marker for zzso early or advanced pancreatic zzso Thus, zzso zzso hold promise for therapeutic intervention to inhibit pancreatic tumor zzso
