zzso zzso infection is zzso or persistent in many zzso and zzso cell types but can be activated in differentiated zzso We have shown elsewhere that both the major zzso gene zzso and zzso cycle infectious progeny virus expression can be induced in otherwise zzso zzso zzso cell cultures infected with either human zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso motifs within the zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 copies of the zzso zzso zzso response element zzso and 3 copies of novel zzso serum response factor zzso binding sites referred to as the zzso zzso zzso as well as four classical zzso sites within the zzso version, contribute to zzso responsiveness in transient zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso sites contain potential overlapping core recognition binding motifs for zzso zzso zzso and zzso class zzso factors but fail to respond to either serum or tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso to evaluate the mechanism of zzso responsiveness of the zzso motifs and of a related zzso SEE zzso zzso motif found in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we have examined the functional responses and protein binding properties of zzso zzso and zzso elements added upstream to the zzso zzso or zzso virus 40 minimal promoter regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Unlike classical zzso sites, neither the zzso nor the SEE motif responded to zzso zzso by zzso zzso However, the zzso responsiveness of both zzso elements proved to involve synergistic interactions between the core zzso binding site zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso binding motifs zzso which correlated directly with formation of a bound zzso complex containing both the cellular zzso and zzso zzso This protein complex was more abundant in zzso zzso and zzso cell extracts than in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells, but the binding activity was altered only twofold after zzso zzso A zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity zzso by four tandem repeats of the zzso could be induced within 2 h (and up to zzso within 6 zzso after addition of zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a true protein zzso zzso signal zzso event rather than a differentiation zzso Slight differences in the sequence of the core zzso binding site compared with that of the classical zzso promoter serum response element, together with differences in the spacing between the zzso and zzso zzso appear to account for the inability of the zzso zzso to respond to serum zzso
