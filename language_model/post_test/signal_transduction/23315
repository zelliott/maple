The zzso is a continuous membrane system consisting of the nuclear zzso flat sheets often zzso with zzso and a zzso network of zzso zzso extending throughout the zzso Although protein and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein quality control have been investigated in great detail, mechanisms that generate the distinctive architecture of the zzso have been uncovered only zzso Several protein families including the zzso and zzso harbor zzso hairpin zzso that shape zzso zzso zzso and mediate zzso protein zzso Members of the zzso family of zzso zzso interact with the zzso proteins and mediate the formation of three-way junctions responsible for the zzso structure of the zzso zzso network, with zzso proteins acting zzso Additional classes of zzso zzso proteins including some zzso and the zzso zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso Flat zzso sheets possess a different complement of proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso implicated in zzso zzso stacking and zzso zzso The zzso is also in constant motion, and numerous signaling pathways as well as interactions among zzso zzso the plasma zzso and zzso cooperate to position and shape the zzso zzso Finally, many proteins involved in shaping the zzso network are zzso in the most common forms of zzso zzso zzso indicating a particular importance for proper zzso zzso and distribution in large, zzso cells such as zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso and structural diversity of zzso zzso
