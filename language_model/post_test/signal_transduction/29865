zzso the product of the reaction between zzso oxide and zzso is zzso formed within most zzso cells under zzso zzso zzso work addressing the zzso of zzso afforded the generally accepted notion that this compound would be the long-term zzso zzso zzso However, over the past six years a number of interesting studies have reported direct in zzso and in zzso evidence that, at zzso zzso zzso zzso is actively involved in triggering cellular survival zzso Most such evidence came from studies demonstrating protection against zzso zzso injury and zzso zzso Although full zzso of the precise mechanism responsible for such protection still requires further research, zzso has been shown to promote the zzso and/or zzso of regulatory sites at zzso zzso receptors coupled to well-known zzso zzso such as those involving zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso In addition, zzso transient protection of zzso against zzso death is associated with rapid stimulation of zzso metabolism and zzso zzso In view of the potential zzso function of zzso further studies specifically focused on zzso the possible therapeutic potential of zzso are sure to zzso
