Group A zzso zzso is a zzso human bacterial pathogen that causes diseases ranging from relatively mild zzso cell surface infections to life-threatening invasive zzso Much is known about the zzso molecules that contribute to zzso zzso but in contrast, far less information is available about regulatory genes that control the expression of individual or multiple zzso zzso zzso The eight zzso zzso that have been zzso have 12 zzso zzso gene regulatory systems zzso but only 3 of these 12 have been studied in zzso Using an zzso replacement strategy with a zzso zzso we zzso the response regulator of four zzso that have only weak zzso with zzso genes of known or zzso function in other zzso The zzso strains were analyzed by expression zzso analysis at four time points and tested in two mouse infection zzso Each zzso influenced expression zzso or zzso of 12 to zzso of all zzso zzso as assessed by growth in zzso broth and a custom zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso strains was significantly altered for mouse zzso based on zzso zzso Similarly, compared to the zzso strain, there was no significant difference in skin zzso size for three of the four zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso strain produced significantly larger zzso after subcutaneous zzso into mice, consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso strain had significantly higher in zzso expression of several proven and putative zzso zzso including zzso zzso a zzso that zzso complement protein zzso Together, the data provide new information about previously zzso zzso zzso
