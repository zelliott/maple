Cell death regulation is vital for maintenance of zzso and proper development of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins are implicated in multiple ways in cell death regulation, ranging from zzso of zzso and necrosis to the regulation of cell cycle and zzso Due to their prominent ability to control cell death and elevated expression in a variety of cancer cell types, zzso proteins are attractive targets for the development of novel zzso zzso The most widely used strategy for targeting zzso proteins is based on mimicking the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently being tested in humans and they were designed for zzso therapy but they could potentially also be considered for treatments of the immune system zzso In this manuscript we will review the functional roles of zzso zzso specifically of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and evaluate zzso targeting strategies for disease zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso Four Decades zzso
