Class zzso zzso zzso zzso signal downstream of zzso zzso and Ras and control a wide variety of biological zzso In zzso these zzso zzso consist of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso bound to any of five distinct regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso collectively referred to as zzso The relative expression levels of zzso and zzso have been invoked to explain key features of zzso zzso For example, free zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to zzso regulate zzso signaling by competition with zzso for recruitment to zzso zzso zzso Using affinity and zzso exchange zzso and quantitative mass zzso we demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso are present in zzso amounts in zzso cell lines and zzso No evidence for free zzso or zzso zzso could be zzso Cell lines contain zzso zzso complexes per cell, with zzso and zzso being the most prevalent zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These results argue against a role of free zzso in zzso signaling and provide insights into the zzso functions of the different class zzso zzso zzso
