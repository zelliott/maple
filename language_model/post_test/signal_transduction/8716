zzso gel contraction by zzso is controlled by zzso membrane protein 2 zzso through focal zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to test the role of zzso in the cellular context of zzso zzso 

The zzso cell line was zzso modified to increase the expression of zzso and was used in this zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was determined with Western zzso analysis of whole cell zzso with the use of specific zzso for different target sites of zzso zzso of whole cell zzso with an zzso against zzso followed by Western zzso analysis and identification of zzso was zzso zzso zzso and their relationship to zzso were identified with zzso and zzso zzso zzso distribution was identified using zzso zzso and zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso expression was zzso with Western zzso analysis and specific zzso zzso to collagen type I was determined with a binding zzso 

zzso zzso led to increased zzso zzso at all measured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provided evidence for a physical association between zzso and zzso Increased zzso was also associated with altered distribution of focal zzso changes in zzso organization, increased zzso zzso and increased adherence to a zzso zzso 

The zzso association represents a novel zzso interaction, not previously reported, that demonstrates significant functional cellular responses in the context of in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso
