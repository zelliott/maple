The zzso gene zzso regulates zzso responses as shown by the finding that zzso zzso mice develop a lethal zzso inflammatory zzso The response of zzso mouse strains to infection with zzso major is under genetic zzso zzso mice are susceptible and develop a progressive zzso burden, whereas most other common laboratory strains of mice are resistant to zzso We found that zzso mice on a resistant genetic background zzso zzso 129 zzso zzso were highly susceptible to zzso major zzso they resembled zzso mice in terms of zzso size, zzso load, and the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were also susceptible to zzso major infection and produced zzso higher levels of the zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso mice were resistant to zzso major infection despite also producing elevated levels of zzso These results show that zzso is required for zzso to zzso major infection and suggest that zzso signaling through zzso may contribute to a zzso exacerbated zzso major zzso
