Using a newly developed zzso acid zzso zzso technique, we showed that the zzso H zzso zzso (for putative zzso acid zzso H zzso specifically binds zzso through the zzso half but not the zzso zzso A set of potential zzso to zzso including zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso substance zzso zzso acid, and zzso acid zzso zzso did not bind zzso A zzso zzso truncated zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was shown to bind zzso which may be a core of the zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso half truncated proteins fused with green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso plants zzso zzso hypersensitivity in all major zzso responses, including seed zzso zzso growth, and zzso movement, and the expression of the same truncated proteins fused with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene restored the zzso sensitivity of the zzso in all of the zzso zzso However, the effect of expression of the zzso zzso half fused with zzso in the zzso plants was limited to zzso growth, and the restoring effect of the zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso was limited to seed zzso In addition, we identified two new zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso pool in the zzso Biological Resource Center via zzso zzso zzso zzso Local zzso in zzso The zzso zzso has a point zzso resulting in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso has a point zzso resulting in the zzso zzso The two zzso show altered zzso zzso in seed zzso and zzso growth but not in zzso zzso These findings support the idea that zzso is an zzso zzso and reveal that the zzso half of zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso which is consistent with its zzso ability, but the zzso half is also functionally required, likely through a regulatory action on the zzso zzso
