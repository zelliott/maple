zzso research in recent years has broadened the functions of nuclear envelope proteins beyond simply stabilizing the nucleus zzso zzso integral nuclear membrane zzso such as the alternative spliced zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso have been shown to be important for the initiation of replication and repression of zzso The latter is regulated by zzso changes, induced by the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear envelope proteins in pathological zzso conditions, mainly those involving abnormal recruitment and zzso of zzso is still zzso In this paper, we show that various nuclear envelope proteins are highly expressed in normal and zzso activated zzso Specifically, rapidly replicating cells of various zzso zzso highly express zzso while slowly zzso zzso cells of chronic zzso zzso diseases do zzso Taking together the elevated expression of zzso in highly zzso zzso cells with its known ability to modify zzso through binding with zzso raises the possibility of its role in zzso zzso involving zzso activity of zzso Based on our presented results, we believe that the zzso regulatory zzso should be studied as a new target for rational zzso
