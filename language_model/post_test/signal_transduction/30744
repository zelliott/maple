zzso surface zzso zzso cells participate in zzso formation following inflammatory injury yet adjacent zzso zzso zzso cells zzso without zzso after zzso zzso cells show zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso enabling zzso generation of zzso cortisol to zzso tissue zzso We asked if human zzso cells show an zzso response to zzso stimulation and if so, how the zzso activity generated compares with zzso zzso collected from zzso women undergoing surgery for benign zzso conditions were used to establish primary zzso cell cultures that were treated for 48 h with zzso zzso zzso zzso steroid zzso or zzso zzso levels corresponding to the genes of interest zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso cells but zzso was zzso zzso (1 zzso not zzso (1 zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso more effectively than zzso zzso cells had a significantly lower zzso zzso zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso did not significantly increase the zzso activity in zzso cells but did so in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso cells respond to zzso and zzso steroids in zzso similar ways as zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso is lower in zzso and less responsive to zzso This could help explain why zzso healing often leads to zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso healing is zzso
