The proper function of zzso zzso requires precise spatial and zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with its zzso by controlling zzso membrane zzso Here, we show that the zzso of zzso to zzso is independent of zzso zzso but instead requires the zzso sequence near the zzso zzso zzso also requires zzso zzso for zzso to zzso A recently developed zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso yields the surprising result that, despite its uniform distribution, the interaction of activated zzso with a zzso zzso zzso domain is enhanced at specific regions near cell edges and is induced locally by zzso zzso This enhancement requires zzso membrane zzso We show that zzso which associates with zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso of zzso after membrane zzso allows zzso to bind to zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso restricted regulation of zzso zzso
