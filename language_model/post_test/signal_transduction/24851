zzso is a critical zzso of zzso function, but its impact on zzso zzso signaling is poorly zzso The role of zzso zzso receptors in the regulation of zzso zzso receptors was characterized using whole cell zzso recordings in acutely isolated, rat zzso medium zzso zzso zzso application of zzso evoked a rapidly desensitizing current that was blocked by zzso Application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso currents in most medium zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas an inhibitor of protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the response to zzso zzso zzso stimulation or zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed consistent expression of zzso for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso known zzso of zzso medium zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins revealed that zzso zzso zzso stimulation increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was attenuated significantly in zzso from zzso zzso zzso recordings zzso these results, revealing that the efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso currents was reduced in zzso medium zzso zzso These results argue that zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso medium zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso currents by zzso a zzso zzso 1 signaling cascade targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso
