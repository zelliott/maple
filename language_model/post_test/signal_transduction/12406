The actions of oxygen in the body are extremely complex, and are also involved in various zzso zzso zzso oxygen is known to contribute to the improvement of conditions where tissue circulation is zzso and has considerable usage in different treatment protocols and experimental zzso However, the precise mechanism by which zzso oxygen changes the functioning of coordinated blood vessel systems and zzso is still zzso Taking into account the known facts, we suggest that zzso oxygen zzso changes in conducted zzso responses, and in that way influences vascular sensitivity and zzso to zzso and zzso Conducted zzso responses are zzso and zzso that are zzso along the vessel, leading to changes in vessel diameter on a certain distance of the initial site of zzso substance zzso Because these vascular responses are of substantial significance in zzso zzso their modification would subsequently cause zzso of blood vessel function and tissue zzso that could explain observed effects of zzso zzso We also discuss potential molecular targets of zzso zzso investigation of which could presumably help in the eventual clarification of zzso oxygen zzso
