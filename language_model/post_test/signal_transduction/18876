In zzso and in humans, zzso infection zzso an immune response which is predominantly zzso in zzso In an attempt to understand the role of the zzso signaling pathway, the zzso activated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the induction of protection during zzso zzso infection, we have carried out experiments in mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso were also carried out in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice for zzso There was enhancement of zzso and abolition of zzso production in the small zzso of 7 zzso zzso animals but zzso elimination proceeded with very similar zzso to those of zzso zzso In zzso or zzso mice, there was a delay in zzso elimination and a large number of zzso zzso adult worms was still present in the small zzso 14 days after zzso Moreover, zzso production was completely abolished in zzso or zzso mice but tissue zzso was normally induced by the zzso infection in deficient zzso Bone zzso transfer experiments showed that zzso elimination occurred when a functional zzso zzso was present only in zzso zzso cells but not when zzso was only expressed in bone zzso zzso The induction of zzso but not zzso occurred independently of zzso We believe these results are the first direct evidence that the mechanism responsible for the timely elimination of zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, a functional protective response is dependent on the expression of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
