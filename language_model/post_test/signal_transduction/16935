zzso zzso models have been extensively applied to study zzso and osteogenesis to zzso pathways of zzso bone zzso Here we provide a detailed comparative analysis of the differentiation potential of zzso cultures established from either zzso zzso zzso cells or mouse embryonic limb zzso zzso cells, using zzso cultures from zzso zzso cells as zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso cells failed to form zzso zzso cells of both models expressed zzso transcripts for major zzso marker genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at similar zzso zzso while notable zzso expression was only detected in primary zzso Furthermore, zzso transcripts for markers of zzso differentiation including zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso were detected in both models, along with zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso marker gene zzso was also expressed in zzso cultures, Oil Red zzso cells along with zzso transcripts were only detected in zzso zzso zzso Apart from zzso marker zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso were also expressed in these models, reflecting on the presence of various zzso lineages as well as zzso zzso This cellular zzso has to be taken into consideration for the interpretation of data obtained by using these zzso
