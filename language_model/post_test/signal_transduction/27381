By attaching to cells or zzso zzso zzso microbes are thought to avoid elimination by the flow of zzso that constantly wash zzso zzso The attached state enhances their ability to trap nutrients and allows the bacteria to multiply more efficiently than do zzso bacterial zzso zzso is therefore regarded as an end result in itself, and emphasis has been placed on the role of adherence for colonization of zzso zzso zzso adherence was shown to be essential for the tissue zzso that is to guide microbes to their respective sites of zzso zzso is not only a mechanism of tissue targeting but also a first step in the zzso of many zzso The attaching bacteria engage in a zzso with the host cells through the mutual exchange of signals and zzso zzso zzso coli induce attaching and zzso zzso zzso et zzso this zzso zzso and zzso zzso invade the cells and cause zzso zzso zzso et zzso this zzso This review describes the ability of bacteria to trigger zzso inflammation through zzso of cells in the zzso zzso The results suggest that receptors for bacterial zzso bind their zzso with a high degree of specificity and that zzso interactions trigger zzso signaling events that cause cell zzso zzso for microbial zzso thus appear to fulfill also the same criteria as those used to define receptors for other classes of zzso such as hormones, growth factors, and zzso
