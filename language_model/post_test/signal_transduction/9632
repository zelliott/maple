The zzso zzso and zzso collaborate to support development of sympathetic zzso Although both promote zzso extension via the zzso zzso only zzso activates retrograde transport of zzso zzso to support zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso is essential for initiation of zzso zzso trafficking and zzso zzso signaling module associated with zzso early zzso supports their maturation to retrograde zzso zzso These zzso zzso components are absent from zzso zzso explaining the failure of zzso to support retrograde zzso transport and zzso The inability of zzso to activate zzso signaling is likely due to the zzso nature of zzso complexes within the zzso environment of zzso early zzso Thus, zzso zzso associate with zzso proteins to promote zzso zzso enabling their maturation into zzso signaling zzso zzso control of this process explains how zzso but not zzso supports retrograde survival of sympathetic zzso
