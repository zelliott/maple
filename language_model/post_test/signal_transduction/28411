Plants zzso an astonishing diversity of zzso some of which play essential roles in photosynthesis, zzso and the regulation of growth and zzso Two independent pathways for the zzso of zzso precursors coexist within the plant zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In at least some plants (including zzso common precursors are exchanged between the zzso and the zzso However, little is known about the signals that coordinate their zzso and zzso To identify such signals, we arrested zzso development by specifically blocking the zzso zzso with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and searched for zzso zzso zzso that also could survive in the presence of zzso Here, we show that one such zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is caused by the zzso of zzso zzso its resistance to zzso most likely is the result of an enhanced intake of zzso zzso precursors by the zzso The analysis of other zzso zzso showed that distinct light perception and signal zzso pathways regulate these two differential mechanisms for resistance, providing evidence for a coordinated regulation of the activity of the zzso zzso and the zzso between cell compartments for zzso zzso during the first stages of zzso zzso
