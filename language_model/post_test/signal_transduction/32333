We previously showed that zzso zzso oxide regulates net zzso zzso zzso zzso an effect that can be eliminated by zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso The aim of the current study was to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso Studies were performed on conscious dogs with zzso zzso A zzso clamp was established in the presence of portal vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was delivered zzso and either the zzso load to the liver zzso zzso zzso 5) or the zzso concentration entering the liver zzso zzso zzso 5) was clamped at zzso zzso In the control group, saline was given zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), and the zzso zzso concentration and load were zzso zzso increased portal blood flow, zzso the two approaches to zzso clamping in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the fractional extraction of zzso was zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso during the last hour of the study in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reduction of zzso in response to zzso was associated with increased zzso protein zzso zzso These data indicate that changes in liver zzso can regulate zzso under zzso zzso
