Early events following zzso infections determine the course of disease zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso immune responses induced soon after infection, prior to the induction of zzso immune responses, are key to early control of viral zzso Among the early innate immune zzso cells, natural killer zzso cells represent a unique subset of zzso that do not express an zzso specific zzso Rather, these cells integrate signals from an arsenal of zzso zzso and zzso receptors that are expressed on their cell zzso As such, these cells are classified as cells of the innate immune system, and they are able to lyse certain tumor targets and infected cells without the need for prior zzso zzso Over the past decade, accumulating evidence suggests that these innate zzso may not be as innate as once believed, but that individual zzso cell clones may show some target cell zzso and play a critical early role following infection with zzso
