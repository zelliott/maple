The objective of this study was to zzso molecular mechanisms behind the zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

Cell growth was determined by zzso incorporation and crystal violet zzso zzso levels were examined by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for measuring zzso zzso For reporter gene zzso plasmids were zzso into cells via zzso and zzso activity was measured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed followed by zzso with zzso II promoter specific zzso We could show that zzso cell growth zzso closely zzso with a zzso reduction of protein expression and zzso activity of zzso This effect seems to be due to reduced protein levels and zzso activity of zzso factor zzso a direct regulator of zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these results was further confirmed by using zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which largely zzso zzso effects of zzso on both, zzso activity and cell zzso 

Since elevated zzso zzso activity is associated with enhanced tumor development, zzso may be a dietary zzso with potential to prevent zzso
