zzso zzso has been found to be zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso but the zzso cell response to zzso has not been fully characterized so zzso We investigated gene expression profiles in human zzso cell lines zzso exposed to zzso Four zzso showing different sensitivities to the zzso effect of zzso two of them presenting a zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, were treated with 500 zzso of zzso Gene expression patterns were studied at 6 and 72 hours after exposure to the zzso using a zzso array zzso Six genes were studied with real-time reverse zzso chain zzso The gene expression profiles in response to zzso were shown to differ in different zzso Numerous genes involved in cell proliferation and cell zzso were regulated by zzso in zzso zzso Genes possibly involved in regulation of cell proliferation included zzso zzso and zzso as well as several genes involved in zzso interactions and cell zzso The zzso array technique revealed differences in expression zzso especially those involved in cell growth, cell zzso and cell zzso between zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso We found that the changes in gene expression profiles of zzso exposed to zzso were also related to features other than the zzso zzso
