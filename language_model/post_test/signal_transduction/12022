zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso zzso zzso is associated with deregulation of the cell signaling thus targeted therapy can zzso zzso progression by specific zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso is the only zzso drug approved for zzso treatment that blocks several crucial zzso signaling pathways thus suppressing tumor growth, zzso and providing survival benefit for subset of patients sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of other zzso mechanisms may lead to decrease of zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso are zzso tumors of zzso origin, and presence of zzso zzso of cancer stem cells or zzso zzso cells, that are less sensitive to zzso due to resistance to zzso action of the drug, promotes zzso resistance to zzso Analysis of the expression profile of genes zzso zzso zzso components of cell zzso stem cell and zzso markers can reveal zzso populations in zzso and identify signaling pathways that reduce response to zzso Identification of individual zzso resistance mechanisms may be useful for rational choice of an appropriate combination of targeted drugs for zzso of zzso progression and improving the efficacy of therapy
