zzso zzso zzso were made in zzso zzso zzso zzso External application of zzso zzso activated an outward and an inward current which could be separated by using zzso or zzso zzso zzso The slowly zzso inward current could be induced by BK independently of the filling of zzso zzso zzso By using zzso in the zzso zzso we showed that zzso outward and inward currents were zzso regulated through zzso and zzso mechanisms, zzso While the outward current was inhibited by zzso the inward current was not zzso Our results show that occupancy of BK receptors activates different signaling pathways for the induction of outward and inward zzso
