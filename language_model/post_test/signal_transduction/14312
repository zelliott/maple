The link between zzso zzso zzso zzso and T helper 2 zzso response has been zzso however, the mechanisms are poorly defined because of the lack of an appropriate zzso Here we report a novel zzso model characterized by zzso deletion of the gene zzso MAD zzso 4 zzso in T cells zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression in T cells results in overproduction of zzso zzso and high serum zzso zzso We found that zzso mice exhibited massive zzso zzso deposition, increased zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso all known features of zzso in zzso Furthermore, we examined the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and we found reduced zzso and zzso zzso levels in B zzso These findings indicate that zzso mice could be a useful model for studying the mechanisms between zzso and zzso response, and further, disruption of zzso signaling in T cells may play an important role in the zzso of human zzso and contributing to a zzso T cell zzso
