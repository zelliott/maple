Over the past decade, zzso zzso have been identified in dozens of signal zzso molecules and various forms have been found in animals, plants, and zzso In this review, we zzso this rapidly expanding research area by providing a detailed description of three signal zzso pathways that zzso zzso protein zzso to drive their zzso zzso It is hoped that these model pathways can provide a framework for use in understanding the biology of the less zzso members of this emerging zzso as well as of those to be characterized in the days to zzso We use this review to develop the idea that most zzso zzso proteins can be classified by functional similarities, as well as by predicted zzso zzso We focus on the zzso zzso which often act as sensors of environmental signals, and the zzso zzso which typically act as zzso partners that target these zzso to their zzso zzso
