zzso zzso a zzso green zzso is a model zzso for studies of zzso or zzso related activities including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a key regulator of these cellular processes whereas the signaling pathways linking calcium to these cellular functions are less zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which are present in plants but not in animals, are also present in zzso zzso which led us to examine their possible functions and mechanisms in zzso related zzso By in zzso analysis of zzso zzso we have identified 14 zzso and studied one of the zzso localized zzso zzso was a protein of zzso zzso acids and predicted to have a protein zzso domain at the zzso and four zzso motifs at the zzso In zzso zzso was exclusively localized in the membrane zzso fraction and formed an unknown 20 S protein zzso zzso of zzso expression by using artificial zzso did not affect zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso Though zzso zzso induced by treatment with zzso or sodium zzso was not affected in zzso zzso zzso increased in the zzso and zzso protein complex was zzso During zzso zzso zzso also increased in the zzso When zzso calcium was lowered to certain range by the addition of zzso after zzso zzso zzso was severely affected in zzso cells compared with wild type zzso In addition, during zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso cells exhibited early onset of zzso zzso This work expands new functions of zzso in zzso activities by showing involvement of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso
