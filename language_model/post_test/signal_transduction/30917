zzso cortical zzso that fail to initiate migration can remain near their site of origin and form persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso In human zzso this zzso is most commonly associated with zzso zzso zzso The lack of genetic animal models that reliably produce zzso has delayed our understanding of the underlying molecular zzso This review examines zzso zzso using a new mouse zzso Although zzso have not been observed in zzso mice generated thus far, the loss of zzso a regulator of zzso produces striking zzso in mice and offers insight into the mechanisms involved in zzso migration zzso zzso the basic functions of zzso and associated molecules is crucial for understanding the causes of zzso and for developing prevention for zzso zzso
