The zzso of zzso asymmetry is an zzso zzso zzso process in zzso The interplay between two zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with zzso such as zzso and zzso have been shown to provide the signals that lead to the establishment of zzso However, molecular events leading to and following these signals remain mostly zzso We find that zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso editing zzso is induced by zzso zzso and that its activity is necessary to specify the zzso axis in zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso selectively zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso effect is zzso as zzso blocks zzso zzso and promotes muscle zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso This demonstrates for the first time that a putative zzso editing zzso regulates zzso signaling and plays a major role in zzso
