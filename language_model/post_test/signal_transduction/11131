Recent work has indicated that zzso oxide zzso and its synthesis are important elements of signal zzso in plant pathogen defense and are a prerequisite for drought and zzso acid responses in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso guard zzso Nonetheless, its zzso of action has not been well zzso NO regulates zzso zzso channels of zzso guard cells through its action on zzso release from zzso zzso stores, but alternative pathways are indicated for its action on the zzso zzso channels zzso which are zzso zzso We report here that NO affects zzso when NO is elevated above approximately 10 to 20 zzso NO action on zzso was consistent with zzso stress and was suppressed by several reducing agents, the most effective being British zzso zzso The effect of NO on the zzso channel was zzso by zzso oxide, an zzso agent that zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso pH zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso zzso affected NO action on zzso indicating that changes in zzso pH and zzso zzso are unlikely to contribute to NO or zzso oxide action in this zzso Instead, our results strongly suggest that NO directly zzso the zzso channel or a closely associated regulatory zzso probably by zzso of zzso zzso zzso
