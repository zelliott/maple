zzso hormone zzso functions as a major zzso of bone zzso and as an essential regulator of calcium zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of the cell cycle in human colon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso treatment increases the number of cells in the zzso phase and diminishes the number in both zzso S and zzso In addition, analysis by Western zzso showed that the hormone increases the expression of the zzso protein zzso and diminishes the expression of zzso zzso zzso D3 and zzso However, the amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not different in the absence or presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso reversed zzso response in zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso phase arrest of zzso zzso cells and changes the expression of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation via the zzso signaling zzso
