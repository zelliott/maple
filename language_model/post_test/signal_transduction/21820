zzso zzso cells are abundant in adult human white zzso This study was designed to identify signaling pathways regulating their zzso and zzso 

We compared the zzso profiles of freshly sorted adult human white matter zzso cells zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso with those of the white matter from which they zzso 

We identified 132 genes zzso expressed by zzso these included principal components of five zzso signaling zzso represented by zzso derived growth factor zzso alpha zzso and type 3 zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso expressed the bone zzso protein 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso defense against zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by that of its zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso signaling to zzso When exposed to the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso against zzso zzso differentiated as zzso zzso when zzso and zzso were antagonized by zzso zzso differentiation was zzso which was zzso by zzso 

The zzso and zzso pathways regulate the zzso of adult human zzso and can be modulated to induce their zzso or zzso zzso As such, they provide targets by which to zzso mobilize resident zzso cells of the adult human zzso
