Energy zzso zzso depends on the relationship between the amount of consumed feed energy and energy zzso zzso of energy expenditure and feed intake zzso is necessary for the regulation of body zzso The zzso zzso peripheral and central signals to generate zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso common signaling molecules but some molecules possess zzso zzso If relevant, particular differences with the zzso regulatory system are highlighted in this zzso For example, zzso had no significant effect on feed intake of zzso but it was claimed to decrease food intake in zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso effects in zzso but zzso effects in zzso Recently, the function of the zzso zzso signaling zzso on feed intake regulation has received considerable attention in zzso zzso acid might exert its zzso effect by the zzso signaling zzso This review discusses the central regulation of energy zzso role of zzso zzso effect of feed deprivation on zzso zzso gene expression and provides a model for involvement of zzso in the regulation of avian energy zzso
