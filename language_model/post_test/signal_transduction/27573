zzso zzso of surface zzso including the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is followed by a zzso process involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso shared by several signaling zzso zzso zzso by recruiting zzso and increasing zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso type zinc finger of zzso is essential for zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso impaired the ability of zzso to enhance both zzso and zzso of zzso in living cells, although the zzso retained binding to the activated zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso acquired a dominant zzso function and lost the ability to inhibit signaling downstream to zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso implies that the zzso finger plays an essential direct role in zzso zzso Our results attribute to the zzso finger of zzso a zzso role in zzso sorting of zzso and zzso of signal zzso
