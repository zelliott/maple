The transforming growth zzso zzso has been identified as being involved in zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to determine how diet and lifestyle factors in combination with genetic variation in the transforming growth zzso zzso alters zzso cancer zzso 

We used data from 2 zzso zzso zzso 

Participants included patients with colon cancer zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso 1970) and patients with zzso cancer ( zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso 

The primary outcomes measured were newly diagnosed cases of colon or zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cancer risk increased with the number of zzso zzso within the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for colon zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso A high zzso lifestyle score also resulted in significant increased risk with number of zzso lifestyle factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for colon zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The combination of high-risk zzso and high-risk lifestyle results in the greatest increase in risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for colon zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

The study results need validation in other large studies of colon and zzso zzso 

In zzso our data suggest that there is increased colon and zzso cancer risk with increasing number of zzso zzso and zzso lifestyle zzso Although the integrity of the zzso can be diminished by a number of high-risk zzso this risk can be zzso in part, by maintaining a healthy zzso
