Type 1 diabetes is zzso by early zzso zzso and insulin zzso followed by invasive zzso and beta cell zzso The zzso events that zzso invasive zzso are not well zzso We tested the hypothesis that B cells in zzso zzso mice drive invasive zzso through elevated expression of zzso and zzso enhanced zzso and presentation of beta cell zzso zzso to zzso invasive T zzso 

zzso expression and zzso pathways in B cells from zzso and control mice were zzso Expansion of zzso T cells specific for insulin and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were compared in zzso and zzso zzso mice and this was correlated with zzso zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso treatment during the period of T cell zzso was assessed for its ability to block invasive zzso 

zzso expression and zzso in B cells was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly diminished the expansion of zzso T cells with specificity for the zzso beta cell zzso zzso zzso the reduction in zzso T cells with specificity for the soluble beta cell zzso insulin, was relatively small and not zzso 

zzso zzso on zzso B cells promotes presentation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the expansion of zzso T cells specific for zzso integral to beta cells, which are critical for invasive zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in insulin zzso individuals before the development of type 1 diabetes may prevent expansion of zzso T cells and preserve beta cell zzso
