The progression of zzso to more zzso zzso results from the zzso zzso of genetic zzso and the zzso disruption of the zzso zzso and zzso of survival zzso zzso a member of the human zzso zzso family, plays a role as a zzso of the growth of several human zzso however, to date it has not been identified in brain zzso We compared the gene and protein expression of zzso in human zzso zzso and normal brain zzso using quantitative real-time zzso Western zzso and zzso We also performed small interfering zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments to examine the role of zzso in human zzso zzso cells in zzso In brain tissue from patients with zzso zzso the gene and protein expression of zzso was lower than in normal brain tissue and was related to the zzso zzso In the primary zzso cell line, zzso zzso led to zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the reduction of zzso in zzso zzso experiments, cell growth was zzso Our results suggest that zzso regulates the growth and survival of these cells in a zzso and zzso way via modification of the zzso signaling zzso Our work is the first documentation that the gene and protein expression of zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso Our demonstration of the mechanisms underlying zzso cell death indicates that zzso plays a pivotal role in the biology of human zzso zzso and suggests that zzso is a promising candidate for molecular target zzso
