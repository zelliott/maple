The general stress response of the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso mechanism in which zzso and zzso zzso controls protein interactions in the zzso zzso The environmental branch of this zzso contains a family of five zzso proteins that function as negative zzso Here we present genetic evidence that a sixth zzso zzso acts as a positive regulator in the same environmental signaling zzso We also present zzso evidence that zzso and at least three of the negative regulators can be isolated from cell extracts in a large environmental signaling zzso zzso differs from these associated negative regulators by its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Others have shown that this domain has the zzso expected for a zzso zzso with the zzso linkage of the zzso zzso to zzso 62 zzso a critical part of the zzso zzso with the view that light intensity zzso the output of the environmental signaling pathway, we found that zzso 62 is required for zzso to exert its positive regulatory role in the absence of other zzso zzso analysis of the zzso structural gene indicated that it provides the entry point for at least one additional environmental zzso zzso by the zzso global regulator of zzso zzso These results support a model in which the large signaling complex serves to integrate multiple environmental signals in order to zzso the general stress zzso
