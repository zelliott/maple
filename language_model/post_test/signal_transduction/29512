zzso zzso zzso play an important role in the protection of cells against zzso and zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso In human, the zzso expression is commonly increased in many tumors and involved in the development of zzso drug zzso zzso oxygen species are released at inflammation sites and zzso stress conditions enhance the expression of genes zzso zzso zzso such as zzso Here we investigated the regulation of the zzso gene expression in the zzso cell line by nuclear factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso By studying zzso zzso expression and zzso promoter zzso we showed the implication of zzso in the zzso gene expression and we described a new specific zzso zzso binding site upstream of the minimal zzso Moreover, zzso treatment as well as zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso induced an zzso of the zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso site strongly inhibited zzso and zzso promoter zzso Altogether, we showed that a sequence located at zzso within the zzso promoter bound zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that this zzso site was involved in the regulation of the gene by zzso
