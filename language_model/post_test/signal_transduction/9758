zzso has been suggested to be the potent zzso causing toxicity to zzso and zzso zzso Our previous studies have illustrated that zzso zinc liberation contributes to zzso toxicity to mature zzso In this study, we further investigated the signaling pathways involved in this event and identified protein zzso C zzso as an important early signaling zzso We found that a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocked OL toxicity induced by a zzso generator zzso and zzso zzso The protective effects were due to its zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The same phenomenon was also observed in zzso following prolonged treatment with zzso 12 zzso 13 zzso zzso which zzso the conventional and the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine the role of specific zzso zzso we found that a specific zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced zzso or zzso zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso reduced OL toxicity triggered by zzso but not by zzso at high zzso zzso was more potent than zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso generation induced by zzso or zzso Surprisingly, zinc only induced zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso attenuated zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might be the major zzso zzso involved in zzso and zinc toxicity to mature zzso and provide a rationale for development of specific zzso of zzso in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases, in which zzso formation plays a zzso zzso
