In recent years, considerable progress has been achieved in the comprehension of the profound effects of zzso on zzso physiology and zzso zzso have been classified as molecules released by individuals and responsible for the zzso of specific behavioral expressions in members of the same zzso These signaling zzso often chemically zzso are contained in body zzso like zzso zzso specialized zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The standard view of zzso sensing was based on the assumption that most zzso have two separated zzso systems with different functional roles: the main zzso system for recognizing conventional zzso molecules and the zzso system specifically dedicated to the detection of zzso However, recent studies have zzso this traditional interpretation showing that both the main zzso and the zzso systems are actively involved in zzso zzso The current knowledge on the zzso zzso and molecular aspects of zzso detection in zzso is discussed in this zzso
