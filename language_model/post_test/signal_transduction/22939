To investigate the role of zzso zzso growth factor zzso in skeletal muscle, we studied its function in skeletal zzso in zzso using mouse zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso protein were increased specifically during their differentiation among zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso on the cell surface were zzso zzso zzso of zzso however, was zzso increased during zzso zzso of zzso zzso significantly rendered zzso sensitive to zzso cell death induced by hypoxic stress, suggesting that zzso in the skeletal muscle is specifically zzso to function as a survival zzso
