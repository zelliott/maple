The signaling components located downstream of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso are poorly zzso We constructed zzso zzso expressing a zzso form of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and used them to examine the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso signaling using zzso zzso cells in primary culture, and several established cells including a mink lung zzso cell line zzso The rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was eliminated completely, and zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was reduced by 50% in both zzso cells and zzso when they were infected with zzso However, the zzso effect of zzso as assessed by the induction of the zzso for zzso inhibitor zzso and by DNA zzso was not affected in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also abolished zzso zzso and partially inhibited zzso zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso may be partially involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth suppression by zzso were all unaffected in cells infected with zzso although the DNA synthesis zzso by serum zzso was suppressed completely in the infected zzso Our data indicate that zzso is essential for zzso protein zzso zzso partly required for zzso zzso by zzso but not critically involved in the signaling that exerts the zzso effect of zzso The results also suggest that zzso may not serve as an essential zzso in signaling by zzso in the cells zzso
