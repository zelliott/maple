Regulators of G protein signaling zzso zzso constitute a family of newly appreciated components of G zzso signal zzso With few exceptions, most information available on zzso zzso proteins was gained by zzso or in zzso experiments, with relatively little known about the zzso zzso zzso studies, typically of zzso zzso zzso have been conducted to overcome the low natural abundance of zzso zzso zzso Because zzso studies can lead to imprecise or erroneous conclusions, we have developed zzso of high specificity and sensitivity to focus study on zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was detected in rat brain tissue and cultured zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso presented as a single zzso zzso By contrast, cultured cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso expressed two zzso forms of the zzso apparently due to zzso of distinct sites of initiation of protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed zzso association with membrane zzso rather than in zzso zzso where most zzso expressed zzso has been zzso zzso levels of zzso exceeded zzso by zzso and studies of cultured cells revealed regulatory differences between the two zzso We observed that zzso zzso and protein were zzso zzso with increased cell density and decreased by exposure of zzso cells to nerve growth factor, whereas zzso was zzso zzso zzso was relatively stable, whereas zzso of zzso zzso was a strong zzso of its lower level expression and short zzso Although we searched without finding evidence for regulation of zzso zzso the possibility remains that zzso in the degradation of this protein could provide a means to promptly alter patterns of signal zzso
