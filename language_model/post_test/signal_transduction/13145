Generation of distinct cell types and numbers in developing cerebral zzso is subject to regulation by zzso factors that positively or zzso control precursor zzso Although signals stimulating proliferation are well zzso factors halting cell cycle progression are less well zzso At the molecular level, production and association of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulate cycle zzso We now report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the cell cycle by zzso zzso zzso activity in embryonic zzso zzso levels of zzso and members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso were detected in developing rat zzso from embryonic day zzso through zzso day zzso With advancing development, zzso protein levels zzso whereas zzso expression increased, suggesting that zzso and zzso cycle proteins control cell cycle zzso Using a well zzso zzso 8 zzso precursor culture, zzso decreased the fraction of cells crossing the zzso boundary, zzso DNA synthesis by zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited zzso by zzso whereas zzso protein and its regulatory zzso E zzso were zzso Moreover, decreased zzso activity was accompanied by a twofold increase in levels of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso complex revealed increased zzso association with the zzso and zzso reduction in free inhibitor after zzso exposure, suggesting that zzso interactions directly regulate zzso zzso These observations establish a mechanism zzso zzso signals actively induce cell cycle withdrawal in developing zzso
