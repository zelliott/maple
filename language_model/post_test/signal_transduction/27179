The zzso gene encodes zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed in high levels in the adrenal zzso zzso While the primary zzso regulators of zzso production are circulating zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso the action of these agents on zzso gene zzso have not been zzso Because these factors increase zzso calcium we have hypothesized that calcium signaling pathways are one mechanism controlling zzso zzso Previously we demonstrated that increases in zzso calcium increase zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the role of calcium in the expression of the human zzso gene using transient zzso of a zzso reporter construct containing zzso zzso of human zzso zzso DNA in mouse zzso and human zzso zzso cell zzso When zzso into zzso cells, reporter gene expression was increased following treatment with zzso or zzso but not with zzso II, the zzso calcium channel zzso zzso or zzso In zzso cells, however, reporter gene expression was increased following treatment with zzso II, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C with zzso did not alter reporter gene expression in either cell zzso These data demonstrate that both calcium and zzso signaling pathways regulate human zzso gene zzso In addition, the zzso adrenal cell line appears to be an appropriate model to study regulation of zzso by zzso
