zzso acid zzso has long been known to cause zzso zzso a neural tube zzso and other effects in fetuses of women treated with this zzso zzso tests in laboratory mice and rats at human therapeutic doses also show neural tube and other zzso Studies show that zzso alters zzso signaling in human and animal cells, inducing zzso gene expression at doses that cause zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that do not have this effect on zzso signaling do not cause zzso zzso Similarly, zzso A, a compound that mimics zzso in its effects on zzso gene zzso also causes similar zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling is zzso well supported as the zzso mode of action zzso for zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso signaling in both human and animal cells systems at the same dose zzso The correspondence of effects on signaling and of effects on development in animals and humans supports the view that zzso of zzso signaling is a relevant zzso in zzso
