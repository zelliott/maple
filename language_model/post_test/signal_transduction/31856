zzso inhalation of diesel exhaust particles results in damaged lung cells through formation of zzso oxygen species zzso but the details of the toxicity mechanism against zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we used human zzso zzso cells as surrogates of zzso and investigated the toxicity mechanism initiated by exposure to zzso zzso a major zzso component in diesel exhaust zzso A zzso incubation with zzso provoked zzso cell death, which was due to signaling through the enhanced zzso generation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso cells after long-term exposure to zzso revealed induction of differentiation that was evidenced by increasing expression of zzso a zzso marker for zzso differentiation into zzso The zzso differentiation was significantly abolished by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso generation contributes to cell zzso The zzso treatment increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso which reached a peak at 1 to zzso zzso and then zzso The zzso curve of the zzso expression by zzso resembled that caused by zzso zzso zzso a differentiation zzso Additionally, the zzso treatment with zzso acid, a selective zzso zzso zzso the differentiation induced by zzso These results suggest that zzso formation during zzso treatment acutely leads to zzso of zzso cells and the initiation of zzso zzso which proceeds after the provisional zzso of zzso
