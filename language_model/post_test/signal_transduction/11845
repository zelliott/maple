zzso zzso is generated as a precursor zzso that is zzso by zzso to produce a zzso zzso that functions as a regulator of T cell growth, and a zzso zzso that functions as a zzso and/or zzso zzso for induction of cell zzso and zzso zzso has been predominantly studied as a contributing factor in the orchestration of an immune zzso however, more recently zzso zzso has been closely associated with the progression of a number of different zzso While the association between zzso plasma levels and tumor progression has been reported for many types of cancer, the mechanism for zzso involvement has been partially zzso for three of the cancer types, zzso T cell zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso and breast zzso The mechanism for promoting cell growth is different in each of these zzso and involves a sequence zzso in the zzso zzso decreased zzso levels in zzso over expression of the zzso zzso zzso to induce proliferation in zzso T cells, and plasma cells in zzso and increased zzso zzso acting to recruit zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso This article will review the cellular process for generating zzso the biological activities for both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso and then the mechanism by which these forms contribute to cancer zzso As a soluble zzso the ability to reduce or eliminate zzso synthesis through zzso approaches or zzso through the use of zzso zzso treatment may represent a novel therapeutic zzso
