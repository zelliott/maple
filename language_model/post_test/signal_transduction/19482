In an effort to investigate the effect and mechanism of zzso zzso on zzso zzso six zzso zzso were isolated and zzso Among them, zzso acid displayed the most significant stimulating activity on zzso zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso acid on the expression profile of zzso zzso in differentiated zzso zzso was also zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso acid induced an increase in zzso but not zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso The role of zzso was further confirmed using the zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso The stimulating activity of zzso acid on zzso zzso was abolished when the zzso zzso expression was suppressed in zzso zzso In addition to increased zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the plasma membrane in zzso Exposure of the differentiated zzso to zzso acid increased the zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The involvement of zzso and zzso in the action of zzso acid was further confirmed as zzso and zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso zzso activities in zzso In addition, zzso acid was shown to induce zzso zzso and inhibit zzso in differentiated zzso Taken together, we demonstrated the zzso activities of this compound in stimulating zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso and promoting zzso zzso in zzso Our study provides important insights into the underlying mechanism of zzso activity of zzso zzso
