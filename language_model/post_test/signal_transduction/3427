zzso zzso are able to both zzso their whole bodies and continuously adapt their size to zzso zzso Tight control of stem cell proliferation and differentiation during these processes is the key feature of zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family member zzso and zzso complex 1 components are required for this tight zzso Loss of zzso results in a zzso to injury and growth and the formation of zzso zzso that remain zzso and that lead to lethal zzso zzso zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso and differentiation defects are hallmarks of this uncontrolled zzso These data imply a previously unappreciated and novel zzso function for this zzso family zzso In contrast we found that zzso members of the zzso complex 1, zzso and zzso are required for the initial response to injury and zzso zzso Double zzso zzso experiments with zzso or zzso show that abnormal growth requires zzso zzso We also found that the zzso zzso a natural compound inhibitor of zzso is able to increase the survival rate of zzso zzso animals by decreasing cell zzso Our findings support a model where zzso acts as a novel regulator of both the response to injury and growth control zzso Our data suggest the possibility that this may be by suppressing zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso components and another zzso family member as key regulators of zzso and growth will influence future work on zzso growth control, and the development of zzso therapies that target zzso zzso
