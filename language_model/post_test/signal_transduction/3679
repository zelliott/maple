A growing body of evidence has suggested that zzso stress causes cardiac injuries during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to play pivotal roles in many aspects of cell functions and to be activated by zzso stress in some types of zzso In this study, we examined zzso zzso signal zzso pathways leading to zzso of zzso in cultured zzso of zzso rats, and determined their role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso activated by hydrogen zzso zzso in cardiac zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso while zzso of protein zzso A and C or zzso zzso had no effects on the zzso When zzso a negative regulator of zzso family zzso zzso or zzso zzso of Ras or of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso The treatment with zzso increased the number of cells stained positive by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso and induced formation of DNA zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso induced zzso of cardiac zzso When zzso zzso of zzso was selectively inhibited by zzso the number of cardiac zzso which showed zzso death was zzso These results suggest that zzso family zzso zzso Ras and zzso are critical for zzso zzso by zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso may play an important role in protecting cardiac zzso from zzso death following zzso zzso
