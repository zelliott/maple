zzso diseases are common chronic inflammatory disorders that result in the destruction of zzso around zzso Many clinical studies suggest that zzso diseases are risk factors for insulin resistance and diabetic zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso diseases regulate the progress of diabetes zzso remain zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso a major pathogen of zzso diseases, present in the oral zzso moves to the liver and affects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the oral cavity to induce zzso disease in zzso old female zzso zzso zzso was detected in the liver extracted from zzso mice using zzso zzso zzso High blood zzso levels tended to promote zzso zzso from the oral cavity to the liver in zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso synthesis decreased in zzso zzso zzso was also zzso into the human zzso cell line zzso and this attenuated the zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso synthesis was suppressed by zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso from the oral cavity to the liver may contribute to the progress of diabetes zzso by influencing zzso zzso
