zzso protein zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and the downstream zzso zzso zzso which is activated by soluble zzso zzso zzso are believed to induce long-term changes in efficacy of zzso through the zzso of protein zzso G zzso The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso in a novel form of repetitive zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso A zzso test stimulation zzso zzso zzso on the zzso nerve evoked a single action potential, while repetitive stimulation zzso 1 zzso induced a long-lasting zzso that was abolished by a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Such an zzso effect was reversed by a relative excess of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was abolished by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso IX zzso reversed the blocking effect caused by zzso On the other hand, a zzso blocker, zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso applications of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium salt zzso zzso reversed the blocking effect on the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso Our findings suggest that a zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso which has pathological relevance to zzso and zzso
