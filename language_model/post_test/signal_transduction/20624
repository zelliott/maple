zzso in zzso growth factor zzso receptors are responsible for a variety of skeletal birth zzso but the underlying mechanisms responsible remain zzso Using a mouse model of zzso zzso type II in which zzso expression was directed to the zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso caused a block in zzso differentiation specifically at the zzso zzso The differentiation block led to a severe reduction in zzso zzso that normally produce vascular zzso growth factor, which in turn was associated with poor zzso of primary zzso centers and disrupted zzso zzso We show that the differentiation block and defects in joint formation are associated with persistent expression of the zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso levels and activity in growth plate zzso zzso with these in zzso results, zzso expression was found to increase zzso and decrease zzso levels and zzso activity in cultured zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in cells resulted in very high levels of zzso and cooperative suppression of zzso zzso zzso had opposing effects on zzso and zzso protein stability with it promoting zzso stabilization and zzso zzso Since both zzso zzso and zzso deletion independently blocks zzso differentiation of zzso and cause zzso similar to those caused by zzso in zzso our results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso levels and activity in growth plate zzso is an important underlying mechanism in skeletal diseases caused by zzso in zzso
