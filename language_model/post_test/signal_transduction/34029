The expression of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso has been detected in healthy tissue as well as in a variety of human zzso including zzso zzso zzso signaling in cancer cells, which contributes to disease zzso is not completely straightforward and is difficult to reconcile with the clinical practice of zzso anemia in cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso and clinical investigations have provided contrasting results, ranging from a beneficial role that improves the patient's overall survival to a negative impact that promotes tumor growth zzso A careful gathering of zzso zzso information enabled us to assemble an unexpected zzso puzzle which, via distinct zzso and zzso mechanisms and different zzso as well as zzso zzso could explain most of the controversies of zzso and clinical zzso However, until the mechanisms of the contrasting literature data are zzso this new point of view may shed light on the zzso zzso system and function, providing a basis for further studies in order to achieve the highest possible benefit for cancer zzso
