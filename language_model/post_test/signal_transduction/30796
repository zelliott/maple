zzso play a critical zzso and zzso role in the brain, and improper function of these cells may contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative zzso Because zzso are known to be enriched with zzso zzso zzso it is important to understand the factors that may lead to zzso effects of zzso on zzso In this report, we demonstrated a dramatic zzso effect of zzso zzso a membrane permeable metal zzso on zzso but not zzso or zzso in inducing zzso of cultured zzso It was estimated that individually, zzso and zzso only zzso exhibited zzso effects on zzso with zzso of 180 and 600 zzso zzso However, zzso at a nontoxic concentration of 10 zzso markedly reduced zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso reduced zzso of zzso down to zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying these dramatic zzso effects are zzso zzso increased the zzso concentration of zzso in zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to abolish all of the zzso zzso Cell death was determined to be via zzso due to increased zzso oxygen species production, zzso dysfunction, depletion of zzso and zzso zzso zzso c release, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding, coupled with our previous reports, suggests that metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso should be cautiously used as they may zzso a zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso Their clinical implications in the zzso of neurodegenerative diseases deserve further zzso
