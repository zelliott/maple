zzso is a characteristic of most living organisms and often requires specialized structures like zzso or zzso An alternative is zzso movement, where the zzso of zzso leads to the formation of zzso zzso and/or zzso that enable the cell to crawl along a zzso Despite their lack of zzso zzso and in absence of cell zzso members of the zzso zzso employ a unique form of locomotion called gliding zzso to promote their migration across biological barriers and to power zzso invasion and zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso and zzso species have revealed that this unique mode of movement is dependent on a zzso of class XIV and zzso zzso dynamics and the concerted discharge and processing of adhesive zzso zzso is essential for the survival and zzso of these zzso zzso zzso which cause severe disease in humans and zzso
