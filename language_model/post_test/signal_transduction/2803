The zzso processing of the two zzso receptors zzso and zzso into soluble forms was investigated in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso release of soluble forms of both zzso zzso were made with zzso and zzso zzso directed against different target zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso release of both soluble zzso forms with about zzso Furthermore, zzso also reduced zzso zzso of zzso in both cell lines as judged by zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso shedding by zzso was reversed by zzso indicating involvement of a zzso zzso Thus, both zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the processing of zzso
