The role of signal zzso during zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso and zzso acid was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were assessed by measuring the diameters of visible rings formed by the outward migration of zzso up zzso zzso of zzso This rapid and simple zzso method yields zzso rates equivalent to more complex zzso zzso In support of previous studies, zzso toward both zzso and zzso acid was inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso zzso zzso and zzso supporting the importance of calcium zzso and G zzso zzso in both zzso zzso The work was extended by examining the effects of the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso This agent inhibited zzso to folate in a zzso manner but had no zzso effect on zzso toward zzso The notion that zzso of proteins on zzso zzso is critical for zzso to zzso acid was supported by Western zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso which detected two candidate proteins of zzso 52,000 and 38,000 in the zzso of zzso zzso These two bands disappeared with zzso which leads to the loss of responsiveness of zzso acid and the acquisition of responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso also revealed some unique differences in zzso zzso zzso cells responded to zzso as individuals but feeding cells zzso to zzso acid on a zzso zzso The ability to compare two different types of zzso using a simple, rapid and accurate zzso system should enhance future studies of zzso in zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso
