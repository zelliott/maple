zzso T cells express zzso an zzso gene family member, which functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified Twisted zzso zzso as one of the genes suppressed by zzso zzso is a zzso protein that interacts with zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and regulates zzso effects in zzso Here, we report the expression and function of zzso in human T zzso zzso zzso was almost zzso in zzso T cells and was zzso after zzso by zzso and either zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein had no effect on responses of primary T cells to zzso stimulation but had a potent zzso effect on proliferation and zzso production of primed zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso did not affect zzso of the zzso zzso but induced zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding on zzso zzso sites, suggesting that it acted downstream of zzso In zzso association zzso revealed a direct interaction of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso functions as an zzso zzso with zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling may represent a novel target for molecular intervention toward control of zzso zzso responses during ongoing zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso
