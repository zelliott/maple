zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cause zzso zzso zzso Parkinson disease zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso to maintain zzso zzso A loss of zzso zzso potential zzso leads to the zzso recruitment of zzso to the outer zzso membrane zzso followed by the zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso and by the zzso clearance of zzso zzso We showed here that blockade of zzso protein import triggers the recruitment of zzso by zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weakened or disrupted the molecular interaction between zzso and specific zzso zzso the surface zzso zzso and the channel zzso zzso The zzso of zzso or its associated core zzso zzso was sufficient to trigger zzso protein clearance in the absence of zzso or zzso However, zzso was required to promote the degradation of whole zzso by zzso Furthermore, the overproduction of zzso or zzso reversed zzso clearance promoted by zzso and zzso after zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso machinery is a key molecular switch in the zzso clearance program controlled by the zzso zzso Loss of functional zzso between zzso protein import and the zzso degradation of dysfunctional zzso may therefore be a primary zzso mechanism in zzso zzso zzso
