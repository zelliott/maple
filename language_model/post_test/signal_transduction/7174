Although the clearance of zzso from the zzso under zzso conditions is performed by zzso zzso zzso their expression might be diminished under pathological zzso zzso zzso zzso however, might serve as a zzso system when zzso zzso zzso is impaired, and could have a prominent zzso function under pathological zzso In the current study, the effect of zzso well known as a zzso zzso on the function of zzso zzso in cultured rat cortical zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and pharmacological approaches demonstrated that, zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso 1 zzso is the major functional zzso zzso in cultured cortical zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was demonstrated to be the key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors in these zzso Treatment of cortical zzso with nicotine led to a significant increase of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which were markedly inhibited by zzso with zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein is zzso through an zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso depend zzso pathway, since zzso with either zzso C, an zzso zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso of zzso zzso specifically those expressing the zzso zzso on cortical zzso could be a key mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso
