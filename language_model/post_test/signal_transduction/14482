We have previously designed zzso zzso zzso that could respond to a zzso zzso While these zzso receptors were functional, it has not been investigated exactly how they mimic signal zzso through corresponding zzso zzso In this study, we compared the growth properties and the zzso status of zzso signal zzso between the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso region of zzso egg zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a pair of zzso zzso domain of zzso and zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso were constructed, and pairs of zzso zzso combinations zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in an zzso zzso cell line, zzso Growth zzso revealed that the zzso all grew in a zzso zzso As for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso receptors showed similar zzso pattern of zzso molecules with zzso zzso although the zzso receptors showed zzso and a little lower zzso zzso than the corresponding zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso could substantially mimic zzso zzso
