One of the most important issues in stem cell research is to understand the regulatory mechanisms responsible for their zzso An extensive understanding of mechanism underlying the process of differentiation is crucial in order to prompt stem cells to perform a particular function after zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for the zzso differentiation of embryonic stem cells zzso we investigated zzso zzso cells for the presence of zzso lineage markers as well as zzso signaling zzso during treatments with different zzso alone or in combination with zzso Here we report that zzso signaling is zzso in zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso We also found that differentiation induced by the zzso zzso and zzso combinations resulted in high expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in differentiated zzso zzso A high expression of zzso was observed in two zzso zzso cell zzso Gene and protein expression analysis revealed that the members downstream of zzso in this signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso as zzso cells differentiated into zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso signaling zzso plays a role in the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso and also may support zzso as a crucial factor in the maintenance of zzso cells in their zzso zzso
