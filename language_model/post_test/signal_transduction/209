The zzso and zzso activity of the membrane zzso zzso zzso involve interactions among the zzso zzso zzso and many other membrane or zzso zzso Decades of investigation have led to identification of the main zzso zzso but the mechanisms governing the successive zzso interactions have yet to be zzso We will need to unravel the dynamic membrane zzso of this complex and multifaceted molecular machinery if we are to understand these zzso Here, we review and discuss advances in our understanding of the zzso mechanism of zzso resulting from zzso or zzso studies of the zzso of this zzso in the plasma zzso
