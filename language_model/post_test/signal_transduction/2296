zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso family zzso initiate a cascade of events capable of modulating cellular growth and zzso The receptors responsible for zzso these cellular signals are referred to as the type I and type II zzso beta zzso zzso binding to the type II zzso results in the zzso and zzso of the type I zzso This zzso complex then zzso the zzso to downstream zzso There is presently little data concerning the fate of zzso beta receptors after zzso zzso with conflicting reports indicating no change or decreasing cell surface zzso zzso To address the fate of zzso zzso we have used our previously characterized zzso receptors consisting of the zzso binding domain from the zzso zzso factor alpha or beta zzso fused to the zzso and zzso domain of the type I or type II zzso beta zzso This system not only provides the necessary sensitivity and specificity to address these types of questions but also permits the differentiation of zzso responses to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso Data are presented that show, within minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta receptors are zzso However, although all the zzso zzso combinations show similar zzso rates, zzso zzso occurs only after zzso of zzso zzso beta zzso These results indicate that effective zzso zzso requires zzso between the type I and type II zzso beta receptors and that zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso show distinct trafficking zzso
