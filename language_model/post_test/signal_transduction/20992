Previous studies suggest that alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso cells declines with zzso In this study, we examined the effects of food restriction on alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells during zzso zzso levels in response to the alpha zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso cells from ad zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fischer 344 male rats at 4, 6, 14, and 24 months of zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso (10 zzso were significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso in cells from zzso zzso rats as compared to younger zzso zzso In contrast, no significant reduction of zzso and zzso responses was observed in zzso zzso zzso An age-related increase in zzso zzso zzso around 14 zzso p zzso zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso rats at 14 and 24 months of age zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso partially zzso or delays age-related zzso in alpha zzso and zzso signal zzso systems of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also appears to be altered during aging and by zzso
