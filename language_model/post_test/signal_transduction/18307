zzso receptors zzso mediate a diverse array of biological functions as a result of their ability to respond selectively to zzso zzso which ultimately results in zzso zzso of signaling zzso Generally, zzso zzso is followed rapidly by a loss of zzso termed zzso which is then followed by a period of recovery or zzso These changes in signaling potential are tightly zzso primarily via mechanisms that involve zzso zzso and trafficking to distinct locations within the zzso zzso of zzso with the green fluorescent protein zzso has enabled the direct zzso of real-time trafficking of zzso in living zzso Such analyses have provided crucial insight into the mechanisms involved in controlling zzso zzso
