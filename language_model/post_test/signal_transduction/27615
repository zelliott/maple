The zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins have been suggested to function as zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed zzso zzso and zzso expression in relation to zzso actions in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in various zzso responsive zzso including liver, muscle, and zzso In addition to the finding that different zzso express different levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso levels of these zzso transcripts were dependent on the zzso status of the zzso zzso expression was zzso higher in fat from old compared with younger zzso zzso reduced the levels of zzso and zzso zzso in liver, muscle, and fat, whereas zzso expression was zzso Using primary cultures of rat zzso zzso was shown to increase zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels with different zzso zzso was rapidly and zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were increased in a slower zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso expression in cultured zzso whereas zzso and zzso expression was zzso Our data fit well with a concept of zzso proteins acting as zzso of zzso signal zzso
