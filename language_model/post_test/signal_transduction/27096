zzso is present at sites of vascular zzso The objective of this study was to determine if zzso may regulate zzso zzso To address this our study was designed to determine the effect of zzso on cell shape and zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso Since these cells grow as islands of cells, zzso cultures serve as a model for conditions in which zzso occurs from several zzso following prominent zzso zzso zzso zzso incubation for 1, 2, and 4 zzso at zzso 4, and 8 zzso caused a significant increase in both the surface area of zzso cells and the amount of zzso zzso occupying the cell surface zzso The increase in zzso zzso was more than would be expected from the increased surface zzso However, the pattern of distribution of zzso and of zzso zzso plaques within the cells was not altered by zzso Attempts at understanding the molecular mechanisms involved were zzso The role of protein zzso C was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused cell spreading as well but no increase in zzso within the first 2 zzso of zzso Some cells showed mild disruption of zzso Following 24 zzso incubation with zzso which reduces protein zzso C, the cells showed zzso and zzso along with thinning and disruption of zzso zzso of zzso and addition of zzso reversed these changes to normal within 2 zzso while zzso of zzso on its own did not alter cell shape or zzso zzso also partially reversed the effects of zzso a protein zzso C zzso which on its own also caused cell zzso and disruption of zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso effect suggesting that the participation of the zzso system is not directly zzso In conclusion, zzso promotes zzso activities which are associated with long-term zzso zzso however, these effects do not appear to be directly due to the involvement of conventional zzso of protein zzso C or the zzso zzso
