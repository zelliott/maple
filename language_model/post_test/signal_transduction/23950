The zzso analysis of protein zzso and other zzso proteins in tumor samples by traditional two-dimensional zzso gel zzso is complicated by the low abundance of these regulatory proteins relative to zzso zzso and structural zzso We present an zzso method called zzso that relies on sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to permit the specific and quantitative detection of 45 or more protein zzso or other signal zzso proteins at zzso The technique can also permit the resolution of these proteins based on differences in their zzso state and other forms of zzso zzso zzso profiling of protein zzso in solid human tumors and cell lines can reveal profound differences in their expression and zzso states, which can serve for the identification of cancer diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for drug zzso
