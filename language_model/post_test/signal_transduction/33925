zzso zzso the latest member of the growth zzso family, is a novel zzso hormone with diverse zzso However, the signal zzso mechanisms responsible for zzso expression are still largely zzso Using grass carp as an animal model, we examined the direct effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso In primary cultures of grass carp zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso levels could be elevated by zzso via zzso of zzso zzso With the use of a pharmacological approach, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were shown to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso Apparently, the downstream zzso zzso were triggered by zzso zzso zzso entry via zzso zzso zzso channels zzso and zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso component could be activated by zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso signaling zzso were also observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso except that zzso entry through zzso zzso zzso to zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso were not zzso These findings, taken together, provide evidence for the first time that zzso can induce zzso and zzso gene expression in fish model via zzso receptors through differential zzso to overlapping and yet distinct signaling zzso
