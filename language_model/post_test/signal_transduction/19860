zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso controlling insulin, zzso zzso signaling and other zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso could function as zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated zzso and zzso function in multiple myeloma zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso expression and cellular zzso were investigated by Western zzso zzso and zzso analysis in a panel of zzso cell lines and in freshly isolated plasma cells from zzso zzso cell growth, viability and sensitivity to zzso was assessed upon treatment with zzso specific zzso or zzso with zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso Survival signaling pathways were studied with zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were differently expressed and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso small chemical compounds zzso and zzso caused zzso cell growth arrest and zzso through the zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso the two zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso interference experiments showed that the two zzso zzso have distinct roles: zzso knock down decreased zzso cell zzso while zzso knock down was associated with a higher rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Interestingly, zzso caused a reduction of zzso zzso zzso and its nuclear zzso with a mechanism that resulted partly dependent on zzso zzso 

These data suggest that in zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso play distinct roles in cell survival and zzso zzso the sensitivity to zzso zzso
