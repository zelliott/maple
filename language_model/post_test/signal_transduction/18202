In previous studies we showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso Because zzso activity of the zzso zzso is already found at low expression levels zzso zzso zzso this zzso is a relatively unique member of the zzso zzso zzso family and a useful tool for studying zzso zzso In this study the role of the highly zzso zzso motif in zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso 115 zzso in this motif resulted in zzso receptors with high zzso activity, increased zzso zzso and increased signaling zzso In addition, the zzso receptors were shown to be highly structurally zzso zzso of the zzso 116 zzso in the zzso motif resulted also in a highly structurally zzso zzso expression of the zzso could only be detected after stabilization with either an zzso or inverse zzso Moreover, the zzso affinity at the zzso zzso receptors was increased, whereas the signal zzso properties of these receptors were zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso receptors can adopt an active zzso but have a decreased ability to couple to or activate the zzso This study examines the pivotal role of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso motif in zzso zzso zzso of zzso stabilizing constraints by zzso in the zzso motif leads to the formation of active zzso zzso but zzso to zzso zzso
