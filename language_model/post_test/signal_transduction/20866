The recent discovery and cloning of zzso receptors has provided a major breakthrough in the understanding of the zzso mechanisms of action of delta zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are coupled to zzso and inhibit zzso zzso in a variety of zzso In the brain, zzso zzso zzso and the receptors are particularly prevalent in the zzso where they are localized to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso In these cells, zzso receptors are zzso with other zzso receptors such as zzso acid zzso zzso where they share common zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso but not common zzso This sharing of zzso leads to the phenomenon of zzso zzso in which zzso of different zzso types can produce the same biological response in certain zzso In cultured zzso zzso cannabinoids also act through zzso to increase zzso zzso In these cells, the zzso zzso response at relatively low zzso zzso of cannabinoids is zzso through a zzso zzso A current zzso zzso zzso The action of zzso receptors in this system is to shift the zzso sensitivity of zzso channels to higher zzso zzso thus increasing zzso zzso at lower membrane zzso and decreasing the probability of multiple action zzso When combined with data from other groups showing a zzso zzso decrease in calcium zzso along with the unique zzso of zzso receptors in the brain, it is clear that these zzso combinations are well situated to mediate many of the well-known zzso effects of delta zzso
