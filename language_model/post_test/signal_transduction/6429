Recent studies have shown that a novel class of zzso activated receptors zzso which are composed of seven zzso G zzso zzso are activated by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Although four types zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso 3 and zzso 4) of this class of receptors have been identified, their discrete zzso and pathological roles are still being zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of specific sites in the zzso domain and formation of a new zzso which functions as a zzso zzso The newly formed zzso zzso binds zzso to an exposed site in the second zzso loop and triggers zzso binding and zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso and zzso have been involved in vascular development and a variety of other biological processes including zzso and zzso The use of animal model systems, mainly transgenic mice and synthetic zzso zzso zzso have contributed enormously to our knowledge of molecular signaling and the regulatory properties of various zzso in zzso This review focuses on the role of zzso in cardiovascular function and zzso
