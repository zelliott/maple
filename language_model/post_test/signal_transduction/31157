The possibility that zzso zzso growth factor I zzso zzso is involved in development of zzso forms of Alzheimer's disease zzso is gaining increasing zzso We recently reported that circulating zzso zzso in brain zzso beta zzso clearance by modulating zzso zzso zzso We now present evidence that blockade of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso originates changes in brain that are reminiscent of those found in zzso In zzso zzso zzso impairment led to brain zzso cognitive zzso and zzso zzso deposits together with other changes found in Alzheimer's disease such as zzso and synaptic protein zzso While these disturbances were mostly corrected by restoring zzso function, blockade of the zzso zzso exacerbated zzso pathology in old zzso mice already affected of brain zzso and cognitive zzso These findings may provide new cues into the causes of zzso Alzheimer's disease in humans giving zzso to the notion that an abnormal zzso decline in zzso input to the zzso zzso may contribute to development of zzso in genetically prone zzso
