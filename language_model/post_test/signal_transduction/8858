zzso one of the zzso active ingredients of zzso zzso exhibits a potent zzso activity, but its effects on zzso immunity have not been zzso Here, we show that zzso has a profound zzso effect on zzso production in zzso T cells as well as in human peripheral blood zzso zzso neither influenced zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso nor inhibited zzso formation between T cells and B cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso also failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso does not interfere with zzso signals on the membrane zzso zzso In zzso T cells, zzso significantly induced zzso cell death, as evidenced by an increased population of zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso and zzso To our surprise, however, once cells were zzso zzso had little effect on zzso and instead slightly protected cells from zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso also is not a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso dramatically inhibited zzso degradation and zzso zzso and, consequently, inhibited zzso and zzso promoter activities in zzso T zzso Interestingly, zzso calcium flux was significantly zzso in cells zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might be targets for zzso zzso zzso our results provide evidence for dual regulatory functions of zzso zzso a zzso effect on resting T cells and zzso an zzso effect on activated T cells, presumably through zzso of zzso zzso
