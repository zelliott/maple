Work in different organisms revealed that the zzso gene product is essential for zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso segregation of zzso zzso zzso which zzso germ cell precursors from zzso cells in zzso stage zzso At the late zzso zzso stage, zzso zzso segregation changes from zzso to zzso a process that precedes primordial germ cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of hybrid fish between zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso is initiated shortly after the loss of unequal zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA replication indicates that the change in zzso zzso segregation is dependent on a maternal zzso zzso segregation is impaired in zzso zzso for the maternal effect gene zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso zzso particles reveals that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso to a zzso structure that resembles zzso a germ zzso zzso The structure is initially associated with the zzso cortex, and subsequent zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso Later, the structure is found in close proximity of zzso We previously showed that its zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso but not zzso protein is a component of the zzso germ zzso zzso by maternal signals, the pattern of germ zzso segregation changes, which results in the expression of primordial germ zzso genes such as zzso and, consequently, in zzso fate zzso
