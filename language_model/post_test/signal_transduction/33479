Different cellular receptors mediate the biological effects induced by zzso In addition to the classical nuclear zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso also signals through the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using as a model system zzso and zzso breast cancer cells lacking the classical zzso the regulation of zzso expression by zzso the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso was zzso zzso zzso with an expression zzso zzso a short zzso sequence of the zzso gene revealed that an zzso zzso site located within this region is required for the zzso potential exhibited only by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels, which accumulated predominantly in the zzso zzso The zzso role zzso by zzso on zzso expression was triggered through rapid zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was strongly recruited to the zzso zzso site found in the short zzso sequence of the zzso zzso Of note, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a regulatory loop that subsequently engaged zzso through zzso to boost the proliferation of zzso and zzso breast tumor zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling provides new insight into the well-known zzso and zzso cross talk, which, as largely reported, contributes to breast cancer zzso On the basis of our results, the action of zzso may include the zzso of zzso in zzso a zzso role of estrogen, even in zzso breast tumor zzso
