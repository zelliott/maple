zzso a member of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso metabolism zzso family of zzso zzso has been previously implicated as an zzso zzso in different signaling systems, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso thus zzso the biological effects of zzso in different cell types, including zzso zzso We have recently found that zzso stimulation also promotes the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso signaling and action in these zzso In the present work, we have studied the participation of zzso in the main signaling pathways activated by zzso to increase growth and proliferation in zzso zzso zzso 

We used an zzso strategy to zzso zzso expression in these cells, and we studied zzso signaling by zzso and zzso affinity zzso and by analyzing zzso levels of signaling proteins by zzso The effect of zzso on protein synthesis and proliferation was studied by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso We have also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso activity, since the pharmacological inhibitor zzso prevents the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Finally, the zzso and zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells is dependent on zzso zzso since its zzso impaired the zzso DNA and protein zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso zzso in the main signaling pathways of zzso to mediate the zzso and zzso effect of zzso in human zzso zzso
