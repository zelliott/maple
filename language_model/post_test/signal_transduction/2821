zzso stimulation of rat zzso leukemia cells releases zzso from internal stores and increases membrane zzso to zzso The delta zzso of zzso zzso is structurally similar to zzso zzso and is a potent zzso of stored zzso from zzso zzso This release of zzso is not zzso by a competitive interaction with the zzso zzso on the zzso release channel on the zzso zzso In intact cells, zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso increase the zzso zzso zzso The return to zzso zzso is zzso by the plasma membrane zzso pumps and not by zzso of zzso into zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso leads to a progressive zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso the rise in zzso zzso induced by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso channels may be present in zzso zzso At 25 zzso zzso a concentration that does not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso from zzso cells is enhanced as is zzso of zzso from cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso The depletion of zzso from zzso stores by zzso should evoke zzso entry into the cells by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across the plasma membrane zzso zzso is not increased but rather is decreased by zzso An understanding of the mechanism of action of zzso in releasing stored zzso and blocking zzso influx across the plasma membrane may provide insights into the regulation of zzso zzso entry in zzso zzso
