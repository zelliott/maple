The single zzso zzso zzso zzso within the gene locus region zzso protein zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso has been associated with Crohn's disease zzso zzso colitis zzso zzso diabetes, and zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso regulates zzso protein zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso Here, we studied whether zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates immune responses to the zzso domain 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso DNA samples from zzso CD and zzso zzso control patients zzso and zzso from a combined German, zzso and Polish cohort were zzso for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso or zzso cells using a zzso zzso 

We identified a novel association between the genetic zzso zzso located in zzso 7 of the zzso gene and zzso Human zzso zzso carrying this zzso revealed increased zzso zzso as well as elevated zzso expression of zzso zzso factor and zzso of zzso in response to the bacterial wall zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and tumor necrosis factor were zzso In both, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation was zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso innate immune responses to bacterial zzso These findings not only provide key insights into the effects of a functional zzso on a clinically relevant zzso but also reveal how such a zzso could contribute to the onset of zzso
