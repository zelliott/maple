The zzso pathways that lead from zzso and/or zzso triggering to the zzso of zzso factors of the zzso family have a crucial role in the regulation of immune zzso The understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control zzso zzso in zzso has, therefore, important implications for the therapy of immune zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso receptors necessary for full T zzso zzso zzso signals lower T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso thus leading to the enhancement of several T cell functions, including zzso production, cell cycle zzso survival and regulation of both zzso and zzso T cell zzso However, most of these pathways are under the tight control of zzso and may be zzso by repeated zzso zzso On the contrary, the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes is a unique feature of zzso The ultimate nature of zzso zzso relies on its zzso tail and on its ability to recruit several zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso to distinct zzso zzso This review will focus on the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso with the zzso in zzso zzso We also describe recent finding on the existence of autonomous signals emanating from zzso which through a zzso zzso cascade may account for the critical role of zzso in regulating zzso production and T cell zzso
