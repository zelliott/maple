Occupational asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and zzso associated with increased vascular zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been suggested to be a novel signaling zzso modulating inflammatory zzso 

We sought to evaluate the involvement of zzso in zzso of occupational asthma and more specifically investigate the effect and molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in regulating vascular zzso 

The mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of an zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested in a zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso attenuated airway inflammation and zzso increased by TDI zzso Moreover, zzso increases in levels of zzso factor zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor A zzso and plasma zzso were substantially decreased by treatment with zzso Our results also showed that zzso expression was remarkably reduced by zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and that an inhibitor of zzso activity, zzso as well as zzso significantly suppressed vascular zzso airway zzso of inflammatory cells, and airway zzso induced by zzso In addition, zzso reduced zzso oxygen species zzso generation and levels of zzso and zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso while this agent enhanced expression of an zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso ameliorates airway inflammatory responses by reducing vascular zzso via zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso production and thus may be a possible therapeutic strategy for zzso asthma and other airway inflammatory zzso
