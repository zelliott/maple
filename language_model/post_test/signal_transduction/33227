zzso zzso zzso site zzso elements are short stretches of DNA, originally defined as a requirement for the rapid zzso induction of genes in response to zzso zzso The protein complex binding to zzso sequences in zzso cells, the gamma zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso of zzso the zzso of a family of zzso zzso factors, the signal zzso and zzso of zzso To date, seven different zzso are known zzso alternatively spliced or processed zzso six of which recognize the same small zzso consensus sequence zzso zzso that defines a zzso zzso Because one or several zzso take part in nuclear signaling in response to most zzso or growth factors, the zzso sequence has changed from being viewed as a specific site for zzso zzso to becoming the general nuclear end of the zzso signaling zzso This review focuses on the identification and definition of zzso zzso their interaction with zzso zzso factors, and their contribution to the specificity of zzso gene zzso
