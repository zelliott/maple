zzso zzso produces zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso oxide zzso in zzso These molecules are involved in inflammation associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso a biologically essential trace element, zzso the functions of many regulatory proteins involved in signal zzso and affects a variety of cellular activities, including cell growth and zzso We demonstrate that zzso attenuated zzso zzso and NO production in zzso zzso cultures in zzso This zzso production of NO was demonstrated by decreases in both zzso and protein expression for zzso NO zzso zzso The preventive effects of zzso on zzso were zzso zzso protein zzso and nuclear zzso zzso specifically blocked the zzso zzso of zzso but not that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was confirmed using zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These results suggest that the mechanism by which zzso may act as an zzso agent and that zzso may be considered as a possible preventive intervention for zzso particularly in zzso zzso However, the efficacy and safety of zzso need to be further investigated, because long-term intake zzso zzso zzso zzso in adults can produce adverse zzso
