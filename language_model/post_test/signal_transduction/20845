Taste buds share a zzso with zzso zzso and evidence now indicates that neural responses in rats to zzso zzso of differing zzso are zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts its effects mainly on the zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso are enhanced by negative zzso clamp and suppressed by positive clamp in a manner indicating zzso of the zzso membrane potential of zzso zzso zzso effects are mainly zzso Under zero current clamp increasing zzso size reduces the neural response at constant zzso zzso Below about 50 zzso this difference is entirely eliminated under zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso normally create an zzso zzso At higher zzso the relatively high zzso of the zzso shunt to zzso permits sufficient zzso diffusion of zzso below the tight junctions to stimulate cells that do not make direct contact with the oral zzso In general, the sensitivity of a response to zzso in the zzso membrane potential indicates that some phase of zzso salt taste zzso is accompanied by changes in an zzso membrane channel zzso
