Although zzso of zzso zzso to zzso has been reported during zzso zzso it is unclear whether zzso zzso zzso is also activated under zzso zzso We observed little zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mouse liver and kidney under zzso conditions, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A small amount of zzso zzso was observed in the heart, independent of zzso In zzso zzso cells, there was little zzso of zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso whereas there was significant zzso of zzso zzso together with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was significant during zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed zzso of zzso turnover of zzso during the differentiation of zzso cells to zzso along with increased zzso turnover of zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso protein was still zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is active during the differentiation of zzso cells to zzso in contrast to zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso turnover of zzso was activated during the differentiation of zzso cells to zzso without zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, whereas little zzso turnover of zzso was activated during zzso zzso
