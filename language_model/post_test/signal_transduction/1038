zzso in critical cognitive zzso such as working memory, are now regarded as core features of zzso but available pharmacological treatments produce little or no improvement in these cognitive zzso Although other explanations are possible, these cognitive deficits appear to reflect a zzso in executive control, the processes that facilitate complex information processing and behavior and that include context representation and zzso functions dependent on the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso Studies in zzso primates indicate that normal working memory function depends upon appropriate zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso in markers of zzso zzso are well documented in the zzso of subjects with zzso 

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the nature of the altered zzso zzso in the zzso in zzso and to consider how these findings might inform the search for new treatments for cognitive dysfunction in this zzso 

zzso studies suggest that markers of reduced zzso zzso in schizophrenia may be selective for, or at least particularly prominent in, the zzso of zzso zzso chandelier cells, that provide zzso input to the zzso initial segment of populations of zzso zzso Given the critical role that chandelier cells play in zzso the activity of zzso zzso the pharmacological zzso of this deficit may be particularly effective in zzso the neural network activity required for working memory zzso Because zzso receptors containing the zzso zzso are selectively localized to the zzso initial segment of zzso cells, and appear to be markedly zzso in zzso treatment with novel zzso agents with selective activity at zzso receptors containing the zzso zzso may be effective zzso agents for improving working memory function in zzso
