The zzso zzso factor Nuclear zzso zzso is a master regulator for inflammatory responses, zzso cellular defense against infectious agents and environmental and cellular zzso However, recent evidence-based studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso is a ubiquitous phenomenon among various cell types in the aging zzso contributing deleterious effects that oppose the acutely beneficial effects of zzso seen in the inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso with age is consistent with elevated levels of inflammatory markers and a zzso zzso zzso in many zzso zzso While zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso in the innate immune response are well zzso zzso zzso in aging cells warrants further investigation of mechanisms collectively called zzso zzso In this review, we provide a comprehensive examination of such zzso zzso mechanisms, including zzso dysfunction, zzso stress response, zzso zzso secondary zzso and DNA zzso Investigation of mechanisms of zzso in aging as an important marker of cellular stress provides guidance for the development of a systems view of cellular zzso
