zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso under various zzso and pathological zzso The authors tested the hypothesis that the small zzso zzso and its downstream zzso ROCK zzso zzso protein zzso mediate zzso increases in zzso zzso They also investigated zzso light chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso targets of the zzso zzso that are implicated in the regulation of zzso barrier zzso 

The apparent zzso zzso of zzso zzso was measured in intact isolated zzso coronary zzso and in cultured coronary zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using a zzso pull down zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso was viewed using zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso in both isolated coronary zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response occurred in a similar time course to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber zzso Selective zzso of ROCK with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of either zzso with zzso zzso or ROCK with zzso attenuated zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso fiber formation in zzso zzso 

zzso these findings suggest that the zzso signal zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber formation occur zzso with the increase in zzso upon zzso zzso
