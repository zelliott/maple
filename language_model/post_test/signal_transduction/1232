The exact mechanism by which human zzso virus type 1 zzso produces zzso remains zzso We have recently found that zzso can inhibit neural zzso cell zzso We hypothesized that zzso could also inhibit neural zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso coat proteins that used zzso zzso zzso 3 or zzso zzso zzso 4 as zzso inhibited proliferation of neural zzso cells in isolated cultures, as well as in zzso zzso The zzso fluid from patients with zzso also inhibited neural zzso cell proliferation in these culture zzso To obtain an in zzso zzso we examined zzso tissue obtained from patients with zzso at autopsy and found reduced numbers of neural zzso cells in patients with zzso compared with patients without zzso zzso zzso but not zzso antagonized the effects of coat zzso We found reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso in neural zzso cells treated with coat zzso which may explain the zzso mechanism of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso neural zzso cell zzso which may result in impaired ability to form new memories and learn new zzso
