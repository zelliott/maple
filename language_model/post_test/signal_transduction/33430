zzso factor 1 zzso is a potent zzso zzso Its alpha zzso zzso which is tightly regulated in normal zzso is elevated in tumors due to zzso and zzso growth signaling zzso Although much is known about zzso regulation in cancer cells, crucial molecular targets that affect zzso levels modulated by both zzso and zzso signaling pathways remain to be zzso Additionally, whether and how the tumor zzso contributes to zzso zzso is zzso This study shows a novel mechanism by which zzso availability is regulated in both cancer cells and in zzso cells in the tumor zzso We show a requirement of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso for zzso zzso expression under both zzso and growth signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells express elevated levels of zzso zzso relative to their counterparts from normal zzso in a zzso zzso Additionally, zzso activity in the zzso cells in the tumor milieu affects zzso zzso expression of the entire growing zzso zzso with a role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso transcription, elevated zzso activity increases zzso promoter activity, and zzso protein binds to the zzso promoter in both transformed cells and in growing zzso Taken together, these findings show a novel mode by which zzso is regulated not only in cancer cells but also in the zzso inflammatory cells, suggesting zzso as an important molecular target for zzso the zzso potential of zzso induced by both zzso and zzso growth signaling pathways prevalent in zzso
