An enhanced activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the development of zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that green tea zzso containing a zzso group in the third position of the zzso structure interfere with zzso zzso signaling pathways by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are zzso Using human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, we demonstrate that zzso preferably inhibited zzso zzso signal zzso pathways and cell zzso To zzso cellular and molecular mechanisms of the zzso effects of zzso we studied the distribution of incorporated zzso into cellular compartments after zzso zzso Interestingly, most zzso of the zzso was found in the zzso zzso whereas only zzso was found within the cell plasma zzso However, no zzso of membrane fluidity has been observed after treatment of zzso with 50 zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso on zzso zzso demonstrated that the specific binding of zzso was completely zzso Moreover, when zzso was incubated with zzso in the presence of zzso a 50% reduction of cellular zzso binding was zzso Our findings suggest that plasma membrane incorporated zzso or soluble zzso directly interacts with zzso thereby preventing specific zzso zzso
