The zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of a number of zzso and inherited zzso syndromes which have led to zzso zzso such as zzso being tested in clinical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is rapidly zzso This review provides an update on the most recent additions to the zzso zzso with particular emphasis on zzso zzso zzso zzso is classically known for its role in regulating cell growth and proliferation through zzso of protein zzso Recent research has identified novel zzso cell zzso mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle progression and uncovered novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is zzso that regulation of zzso is multifaceted with many positive and negative zzso zzso We discuss the recent advances that have been made to determine the upstream mechanisms that control zzso through zzso energy sensing and zzso zzso Also discussed are current findings that have zzso a series of novel zzso proteins that directly control the activity of zzso and include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
