zzso group proteins are essential for early development in zzso but their contributions to human development are not well zzso We have mapped the zzso zzso Complex 2 zzso zzso zzso across the entire zzso portion of the zzso in human embryonic stem zzso zzso We found that zzso is distributed across large portions of over two hundred genes zzso key zzso zzso These genes are occupied by zzso zzso at zzso zzso are zzso zzso and contain some of the most highly zzso zzso elements in the zzso We found that zzso target genes are zzso activated during zzso cell differentiation and that the zzso cell regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso a significant subset of these zzso These results indicate that zzso occupies a special set of zzso genes in zzso cells that must be zzso to maintain zzso and that are poised for zzso during zzso cell zzso
