zzso zzso and adherence to the vessel zzso are common events in various zzso and pathological zzso However, the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso cause zzso remain zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso may alter the zzso sensitivity of the zzso apparatus in smooth muscle zzso We tested this hypothesis using rabbit common carotid arteries zzso with zzso In these zzso the zzso zzso is functionally intact, while the zzso zzso zzso in particular calcium zzso may be zzso zzso zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso On average, the zzso for calcium was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso This increase in calcium sensitivity was prevented by blockade of zzso with zzso zzso zzso modulated calcium sensitivity at zzso markedly lower than those that produce zzso of intact zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso in the vicinity of the vessel wall may sensitize the smooth muscle zzso apparatus to calcium via a zzso zzso This phenomenon may enhance vessel responses to zzso substance that produce vessel contraction via zzso of zzso calcium zzso
