zzso zzso zzso has been used in the treatment of several zzso and inflammatory zzso However, its mechanism of action remains incompletely zzso Here, we investigated the possibility that zzso zzso its zzso effects through zzso zzso receptors bearing an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in the zzso signaling zzso Recently, the concept of zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a new means to zzso control the immune zzso We found that interaction of zzso mouse or human zzso with zzso zzso or zzso or with zzso zzso zzso reduced calcium responses, zzso oxygen species production, zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso receptors on zzso and zzso zzso zzso required the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso recruitment involving formation of zzso zzso clusters containing zzso and the targeted zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso treatments controlled the development of zzso zzso inflammation in zzso independently of zzso These results demonstrate that circulating zzso zzso are not functionally zzso but act through continuous interaction with zzso zzso signaling to maintain immune zzso These data support a new mechanism of action for zzso and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of zzso targeting in zzso
