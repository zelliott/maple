Research using the well-studied model zzso zzso zzso has largely focused on zzso zzso while little information is currently available for this species on zzso zzso zzso We have performed a zzso analysis of this species with the objective of studying the zzso zzso no visible zzso and hypersensitive response zzso plant cell zzso in its leaves at 6 and at 24 h after infection by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although there were no visible symptoms at the zzso the zzso in gene expression were comparable to those found with the zzso Both responses resulted in the zzso zzso of hundreds of plant zzso however, the responses in the zzso were usually more zzso The reactions to zzso and zzso bacterial strains were significantly zzso Parallel zzso or zzso of genes with the same function occurred zzso However, some plant processes were regulated in one zzso for example, most of the protein zzso genes were activated and all of the zzso genes were suppressed during zzso The possible roles of several functional classes zzso cell rescue, zzso defense, cell death, zzso of zzso altered genes are zzso The results of the comparison with available zzso and zzso expression data show that there is a significant overlap between zzso and the leaf defense response and that during the early stage of the zzso in roots, zzso zzso zzso a fluctuation in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
