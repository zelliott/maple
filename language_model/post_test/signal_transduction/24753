zzso B, a drug that alters zzso structure, was found to zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso in zzso freedom of spin zzso and lateral diffusion of surface zzso These changes occur in zzso cells inherently sensitive to the zzso signal of zzso but not in insensitive cells, and were associated with the zzso signal zzso The zzso effects of zzso B were detected by flow zzso zzso of membrane potential using an zzso zzso by electron spin resonance zzso zzso and by zzso of zzso recovery after zzso zzso of surface zzso using a zzso cell imaging zzso zzso B treatment increased an zzso membrane potential shift by -5 zzso The zzso freedom of zzso acid changed from zzso to zzso as expressed by the order zzso zzso with zzso treatment and was prevented by zzso zzso Changes in the lateral diffusion of surface zzso induced by zzso treatment, D zzso zzso zzso zzso without treatment and D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with treatment, was blocked by zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were ineffective at dose levels sufficient to cause the characteristic cell zzso zzso of these zzso These results zzso zzso but not the zzso system in zzso of the zzso signal by zzso in zzso zzso
