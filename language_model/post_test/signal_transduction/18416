zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso incorporation zzso zzso cell growth and cell migration in human zzso zzso cells zzso The extent of the zzso responses are comparable to those zzso by vascular zzso growth factor, one of the most potent zzso of zzso These responses to zzso were zzso by zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso toxin zzso an zzso of zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso was inhibited again by zzso and also by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso an zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cell migration and zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso were inhibited by zzso but not by zzso In zzso zzso zzso binding activity and expression of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These results suggest that zzso might be a novel zzso factor and that the zzso proliferation and migration of zzso cells are possibly zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are linked to zzso zzso
