zzso A is a zzso which was isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis has been tested that the zzso effect of zzso A is zzso by zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso lung and zzso breast zzso cells are extremely sensitive to growth zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso the effect of zzso A on these cell lines was compared with that of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso A to zzso zzso activity in cellular zzso was assessed to determine the involvement of zzso in the induction of zzso zzso A inhibited the growth of both cell lines and initial seeding density determined its zzso zzso zzso values were between zzso and zzso zzso zzso A also had a profound effect on the colony forming ability of zzso cells, preventing zzso growth at 5 zzso Using the incorporation of zzso into cells to assess DNA synthetic activity and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to define zzso the compound was found to have both zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso by 50% after only zzso zzso in cell culture zzso zzso induced rapid zzso and the formation of a network of zzso colonies in both cell lines grown on zzso whereas zzso A did not cause the same zzso Cell zzso was zzso for zzso zzso binding sites after treatment with zzso A or zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso caused a reduction in binding sites to 57% of binding in control cells after 30 zzso and to zzso after 24 zzso zzso A did not cause a significant change in binding zzso zzso of zzso activity in cellular zzso revealed that zzso A was unable to activate or inhibit the zzso at zzso of up to 10 zzso The results suggest that zzso A is an exquisitely potent zzso agent in the two cell lines zzso but zzso of zzso is not involved in the mode of action by which it elicits this zzso
