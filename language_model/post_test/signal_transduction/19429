For more than a decade, zzso zzso cells zzso have been implicated in cardiovascular zzso zzso are believed to reside within the bone zzso in close contact with surrounding zzso cells, and, under stimulation of zzso zzso zzso are mobilized out of the bone zzso zzso circulating zzso home to peripheral zzso undergoing further proliferation and zzso Under certain zzso conditions this process seems to be zzso resulting in a reduced capacity of zzso to engage in zzso at sites of zzso injury or tissue zzso In this review, we focus on the effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on zzso biology and we explore whether zzso dietary and lifestyle interventions can favorably restore zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the process of zzso zzso migration and zzso we specifically emphasize the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso biology under these different zzso zzso zzso used drugs or lifestyle interventions that have been shown to zzso zzso biology are zzso These treatment strategies remain attractive targets to restore the zzso capacity of zzso in cardiovascular zzso
