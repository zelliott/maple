The zzso is normally zzso by a large and diverse zzso zzso and is occasionally exposed to a variety of potential zzso In recent years, there has been substantial progress made in identifying molecular mechanisms that normally serve to protect the zzso from such enteric bacteria and which may go awry in chronic idiopathic inflammatory diseases of the zzso One specific molecular interaction that appears to play a key role in governing zzso interactions is that of the bacterial protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso This article reviews studies performed in zzso in mice, and in humans that indicate an important role for the zzso interaction in regulating both the innate and zzso immune responses in the zzso
