Our previous studies have shown that dietary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human prostate cancer cells to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso nuclear factor zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that activated zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in regulation of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells to TRAIL by zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso which was not due to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso activity by zzso Because zzso is a downstream target of zzso we investigated whether zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso through suppression of zzso Data demonstrate that treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003), a specific inhibitor of zzso or zzso with small zzso zzso zzso not only inhibited zzso but also zzso the expression and zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso active zzso in cancer cells prevented the zzso of zzso by zzso In addition, treatment with zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso does not inhibit zzso or sensitize zzso cancer cells to TRAIL because these cells do not express zzso Because expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso is regulated by zzso both zzso and zzso decreased the levels of these proteins in zzso cells through zzso of zzso Furthermore, gene zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso these data define a zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer cells to TRAIL by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
