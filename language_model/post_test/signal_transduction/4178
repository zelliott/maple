In recent years, research aimed at the zzso of zzso molecular mechanisms has focused on signal zzso zzso This research has demonstrated that zzso has multiple effects on the zzso turnover signaling zzso We have previously demonstrated that chronic (but not zzso in zzso exposure of zzso cells to 1 zzso zzso reduces both zzso and zzso zzso activity without affecting zzso increases in zzso zzso or zzso breakdown, findings which suggest an zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso The present study sought to measure the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso more directly and demonstrated that zzso in zzso exposure of zzso cells to either 1 zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduces zzso alpha in both zzso and membrane zzso Given the critical role of zzso in regulating zzso signal zzso these effects may play a major role in zzso zzso zzso
