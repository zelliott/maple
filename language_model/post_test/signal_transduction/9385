While zzso and its receptors have traditionally been associated with zzso zzso we have recently shown that the vast majority of zzso zzso A expression following traumatic brain injury is localized within the zzso While it has been suggested that zzso zzso A plays a role in influencing zzso integrity, the significance of zzso expressed zzso zzso A remains zzso One report suggests that zzso signaling mediates diffuse zzso zzso zzso this work sought to determine whether treatment with zzso a selective zzso zzso A zzso diminishes the extent of diffuse zzso injury following zzso 

A total of 12 male zzso rats zzso zzso were used in this zzso Two groups zzso zzso 6 per zzso were generated as zzso sham operation and traumatic brain zzso zzso zzso delivered zzso zzso prior to the zzso zzso was induced using a weight acceleration impact zzso Animals were terminated 24 or 48 hours after zzso and a series of six zzso sections through the entire zzso extent of the corpus zzso were selected from each brain for zzso of diffuse zzso injury by zzso precursor protein zzso 

Our data indicated that animals treated with zzso 30 minutes prior to trauma showed a significant reduction in diffuse zzso injury in corpus zzso at both 24 and 48 hours zzso 

The results show that zzso zzso A antagonism reduced the extent of diffuse zzso injury, demonstrating a potential influence of the zzso system on the zzso cascade of molecular events underlying diffuse zzso zzso
