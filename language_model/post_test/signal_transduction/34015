The second zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso by specific members of the zzso zzso or by active zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso To determine the role of zzso and zzso in cell zzso we studied zzso zzso in which the effects of zzso zzso levels on zzso proliferation have been well zzso We found that zzso but not zzso was zzso during proliferation of isolated human coronary artery zzso and following injury of rat carotid arteries in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso levels and was sufficient to block proliferation and to prevent zzso growth in injured rat carotid zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was related to zzso zzso zzso Here we provide what we believe to be the first evidence that zzso acts as an independent zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso levels and as a zzso of zzso signal zzso to the zzso We also identify zzso zzso as a potentially new way of preventing abnormal zzso zzso
