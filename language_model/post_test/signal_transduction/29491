zzso is a novel tumor zzso gene identified in the human zzso zzso region where zzso losses and genetic zzso occur early and frequently for many human zzso zzso of zzso protein is absent or reduced in the majority of lung zzso and zzso lung zzso Restoration of zzso function in zzso zzso cell lung zzso cells significantly zzso tumor cell growth by induction of zzso and zzso of cell cycle zzso Here we present recent findings indicating that zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of the intrinsic zzso and zzso pathways and zzso the function of protein zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso administration of a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso effectively delivers zzso to distant tumor sites and mediates an zzso effect in zzso human lung cancer zzso zzso This approach is the rationale for an ongoing zzso gene delivery clinical trial for the treatment of lung zzso
