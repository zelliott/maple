zzso The zzso zzso which causes zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in rat urinary zzso smooth muscle by measuring zzso zzso zzso The responses to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 0 and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso % respectively of those obtained in zzso zzso zzso whereas those to 100 zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8) zzso in 0 and zzso zzso zzso zzso In both experimental conditions, the responses to the two zzso expressed as % of the control responses were significantly different zzso zzso zzso at high zzso zzso zzso decreased the responses to zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no significant difference was obtained between the responses to all the zzso at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso between 1 zzso and 100 zzso zzso decreased the responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and almost completely inhibited them at 100 zzso Although the responses to zzso zzso (10 zzso were also inhibited by the drug, at 50 and 100 zzso zzso the responses to zzso zzso were significantly larger than those to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso significantly inhibited the zzso contraction to zzso zzso of the control zzso zzso It is suggested that the contraction via zzso receptors in the rat urinary zzso smooth muscle mainly depends on zzso zzso liberated from zzso zzso stores, though the contribution of zzso zzso from the zzso space cannot be zzso The release of zzso zzso from stores is mainly zzso by the production of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso
