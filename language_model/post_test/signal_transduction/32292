The integrity of retinal zzso zzso cells is critical for zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts zzso effects against several types of injuries in zzso including zzso nerve zzso retinal zzso zzso injuries, zzso zzso and diabetic zzso In a recent study, we have proven that zzso is also protective in zzso zzso injury in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of this zzso zzso cells were exposed to a zzso hydrogen zzso zzso Expressions of zzso and zzso markers were studied by complex array kits and Western zzso zzso stress induced the zzso of several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso several heat shock zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein with death domain, while zzso treatment decreased zzso The changes in the expression of zzso zzso showed that zzso activated the protective zzso and downstream zzso and decreased the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an effect opposite to that observed with only zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased the zzso of the protective zzso zzso In addition, the effects of zzso stress on several other signaling molecules were zzso by zzso treatment zzso Yes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These play a role in cell death, cell cycle, zzso zzso differentiation and zzso In zzso zzso acting at several levels, influences the balance between zzso and zzso factors in favor of zzso thereby providing protection in zzso zzso injury of human retinal zzso zzso zzso
