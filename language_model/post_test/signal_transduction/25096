B zzso generation in bone zzso zzso compensates for cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso of various cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or of zzso expression are associated with excessive T cell proliferation and zzso To examine the role of the zzso zzso zzso system in B cell zzso we created zzso mice by transferring both zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso zzso zzso Equal numbers of stem cells were zzso into zzso zzso recipients, and their progeny were studied by using zzso directed against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso study lasting for up to 6 months revealed that cells of the zzso zzso dominated the B6 zzso in the zzso as a result of their active zzso Analysis of the B cell compartment showed more zzso than B6 cells among immature zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and B6 zzso were equally represented among mature B zzso zzso transfer to second hosts indicated that zzso B cell zzso were absent from the first zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the early steps of B cell development and might therefore contribute to the onset of zzso zzso
