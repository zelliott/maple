We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso We studied the effect of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso and other proteins in the zzso of zzso mice exposed to zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso The results showed that: zzso zzso zzso had no appreciable effect on zzso zzso while 3- and 10-day zzso progressively decreased zzso zzso resulting in zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso after 10-day exposure; zzso zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso partially reversed the zzso reduction of zzso expression in the 3- or 10-day exposed zzso zzso zzso zzso partially reversed the zzso reduction in functional zzso zzso and attenuated zzso increase in truncated zzso zzso in the 3- or 10-day hypoxic zzso and zzso prolonged zzso (10 zzso significantly increased zzso level and decreased zzso expression in the cortex, which was completely reversed following zzso zzso and zzso there was no significant change in zzso and zzso levels in the hypoxic zzso We conclude that prolonged zzso zzso zzso signaling leading to an increase in zzso in the cortex, while zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling thereby decreasing zzso levels in the hypoxic zzso
