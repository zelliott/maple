The mechanisms by which zzso zzso synthesis of zzso beta zzso and release of zzso from the zzso zzso are not clearly zzso However, zzso actions in the zzso zzso have been suggested to be zzso by the zzso and/or zzso zzso Thus, in the present study we have examined 1) whether the zzso of either the zzso and/or zzso signaling zzso could elevate the levels of zzso beta zzso and if so, 2) whether this increase of zzso beta zzso levels is the result of zzso zzso or the result of suppressing the turnover of zzso beta zzso In the present experiment, the zzso of protein zzso C and the zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso (10 zzso respectively, have elevated the steady state levels of zzso beta zzso significantly by 18 h at the specific zzso shown in the zzso zzso we have determined whether the zzso of zzso beta zzso levels by either zzso or zzso is due to the new synthesis of zzso beta zzso or the suppression of zzso beta zzso zzso zzso showed that the ability of zzso or zzso to elevate the zzso beta zzso levels was suppressed by the addition of zzso D, an inhibitor of zzso zzso further showed that the turnover of zzso beta zzso was not suppressed either by zzso or zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso as well as the zzso of zzso by zzso leads to the increase in the levels of zzso beta zzso by stimulating the new synthesis of zzso beta zzso instead of increasing the stability of pre-existing zzso beta zzso
