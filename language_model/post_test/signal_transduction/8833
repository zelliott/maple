A common feature of all zzso zzso is the zzso distribution of different zzso species in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso asymmetry provides the two sides of the plasma membrane with different zzso properties and influences numerous cellular zzso zzso of zzso asymmetry plays a prominent role during cell fusion, zzso of the zzso zzso and recognition and removal of zzso cell corpses by zzso zzso cell zzso Here we discuss the origin and maintenance of zzso zzso based on recent studies in zzso systems as well as in zzso zzso and other model organisms, along with emerging evidence for a zzso role of zzso in the loss of zzso asymmetry during zzso The functional significance of zzso asymmetry and its disruption during health and disease is also zzso
