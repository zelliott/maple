The zzso zzso zzso zzso binds all known zzso and has been suggested to either function as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso or be involved in independent signaling leading to cell zzso We have analyzed the effects of nerve growth factor zzso on the growth of cultured zzso zzso zzso and examined the possibility that the effects of zzso are zzso via generation of zzso produced by neutral zzso zzso During the initial hour of culture, the only zzso zzso zzso is zzso which by comparative Western zzso is expressed at 50- to zzso lower levels than on zzso zzso At this early stage of culture, zzso zzso zzso formation and outgrowth and zzso zzso formation in a zzso zzso An zzso zzso that is deficient in zzso binding has no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to compete with zzso for binding to zzso mimic the effects of zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso targeted against a different zzso does zzso Finally, zzso a specific zzso zzso blocks the effects of zzso We propose that a zzso signaling zzso influences outgrowth of zzso zzso This signaling role of zzso may be distinct from other signaling pathways that lead to zzso
