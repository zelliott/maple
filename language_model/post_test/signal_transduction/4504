The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated upon zzso sensing of a variety of zzso molecular patterns by zzso zzso Active zzso processes zzso and zzso to generate the zzso zzso and to initiate zzso immune zzso Little information is available on zzso and zzso zzso during infection with the gastric bacterial pathogen zzso zzso In this study, we addressed a possible role for zzso and its zzso zzso in the spontaneous and zzso control of zzso infection, as well as the development of zzso and gastric cancer precursor zzso using a variety of experimental infection, zzso protection, and gastric disease zzso We show that zzso is activated and zzso and zzso are processed in zzso and in zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling are absolutely required for the efficient control of zzso infection in vaccinated zzso zzso mice fail to develop protective immunity but are protected against zzso zzso and gastric zzso as a result of their inability to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso for zzso protective immunity but essential for preventing excessive T zzso zzso zzso animals develop strongly accelerated pathology that is accompanied by unrestricted zzso zzso In conclusion, we show in this study that the processing and release of a regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities of another zzso zzso zzso thereby balancing control of the infection with the prevention of excessive gastric zzso
