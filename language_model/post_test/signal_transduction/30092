Upon receiving a zzso zzso cells accumulate zzso zzso in zzso which binds directly to zzso zzso factors, leading to the zzso of zzso target zzso It is generally thought that zzso is a zzso zzso when bound to zzso in the nucleus and that this function is zzso by its C zzso However, recent findings in zzso indicated that zzso may activate zzso in the zzso 

Here, I zzso the mechanism of zzso signaling function in light of zzso and zzso two nuclear factors recently discovered to be essential for this zzso I show that zzso in order to activate zzso must enter the nucleus and form a complex with zzso and zzso The ability of this complex to stimulate zzso zzso can be altered by linkage of a strong zzso zzso or zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso is a strong zzso zzso when fused to the zzso zzso DNA binding zzso activity that depends on regions of the zzso repeat domain that mediate binding to zzso and to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, linkage of the zzso region of zzso but not the C zzso of zzso to zzso zzso can restore its signaling activity in transgenic zzso 

My evidence argues in favor of a revised zzso factor model in which zzso zzso function depends on regions within its zzso repeat domain to which zzso and other zzso zzso can zzso In contrast, the C zzso of zzso plays a less direct role in this zzso
