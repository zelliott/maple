zzso organization emerges from the action of sophisticated zzso zzso zzso But the design rules for zzso elementary signaling and information processing zzso into such functional systems and for zzso them into the noisy and convoluted living context remain incompletely zzso The construction of a synthetic gene circuit zzso zzso signal propagation demonstrates one broadly zzso approach to this zzso The circuit comprises zzso signaling through the Delta zzso and the zzso zzso zzso positive feedback, and zzso signal zzso Positive feedback and contact signaling proved sufficient for zzso and signal propagation across a population of zzso cells, but only when combined with signal zzso Thus, construction and characterization of synthetic gene circuits have made it possible to establish zzso zzso and the minimal requirements for the zzso of zzso
