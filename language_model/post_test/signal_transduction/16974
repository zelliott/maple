The zzso zzso related factor zzso zzso response zzso zzso controls a powerful array of zzso cellular zzso systems and is an important zzso in the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso in the zzso Using a combination of quantitative zzso and zzso zzso we have identified novel protective mechanisms of the zzso zzso against zzso stress in zzso Studies from our lab and others have shown zzso zzso protects zzso from zzso zzso However, the exact mechanisms by which zzso elicits these effects are zzso In this study, we show that induction of zzso reduces levels of zzso oxygen species zzso produced by various zzso zzso and results in robust zzso To identify the zzso responsible for these effects, we used stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso and quantitative shotgun zzso to identify 72 zzso proteins in zzso We hypothesized a subset of these proteins might play a critical role in zzso zzso In order to identify these critical zzso we used zzso to narrow our target list of proteins and then systematically screened each candidate with zzso to assess the role of each in zzso zzso We screened each target against zzso zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently identified three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso protection in zzso
