zzso receptors zzso are expressed by a variety of cells, including zzso zzso However, the full spectrum of regulators modulating innate responses via zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso have been identified as a highly zzso family of zzso zzso We sought to clarify the role of zzso in the zzso signaling zzso 

zzso zzso and protein levels were analyzed by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso in nuclear factor zzso B zzso pathways was assessed in zzso cells by zzso reporter zzso zzso that zzso with zzso were identified by mass zzso and confirmed by zzso The domain essential for zzso function was mapped using truncated zzso 

zzso expression is decreased in active inflamed tissue from patients with inflammatory zzso disease zzso zzso is expressed in human and mouse zzso zzso as well as immune cells, and its expression in zzso is zzso in a zzso manner by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso downstream of zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathways zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso binding partner in regulating the zzso signaling zzso that leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain are required for zzso zzso 

These observations indicate that zzso is a novel regulator in the zzso signaling zzso and altered expression of zzso may play a role in zzso
