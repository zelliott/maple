In cells of the innate immune system, pathological increases in zzso zzso zzso immune responses and contribute to infections by bacteria such as zzso zzso In this work, zzso from zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso is found to activate the zzso signaling zzso in both mouse zzso and human zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso of zzso induce zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and are able to significantly enhance the induction of these zzso target genes by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in increased levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and led to increased amounts of a zzso zzso complex consisting of zzso and the zzso target zzso To address the mechanism used by zzso to activate zzso zzso components of zzso signaling were zzso and results revealed that zzso increased levels of zzso recognition sequence binding protein at the zzso site zzso a DNA binding protein and principal zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso was sufficient to activate zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso Further examination of the mechanism used by zzso to activate zzso signaling revealed that zzso zzso a zzso factor activated by zzso helped activate zzso signaling and zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso activates zzso signaling and increases the expression of zzso which could be an important mechanism zzso by zzso to suppress immune zzso
