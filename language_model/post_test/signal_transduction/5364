zzso zzso zzso injury significantly contributes to the morbidity and mortality of critical zzso In this study, we hypothesized a protective role for zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling studies of zzso scrapings following zzso zzso demonstrated selective induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice for the zzso showed more profound zzso zzso injury compared with zzso In contrast, zzso mice exhibited no differences in zzso injury compared with zzso zzso In addition, selective zzso of the zzso resulted in enhanced zzso inflammation and injury during zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso protected from zzso injury, zzso and zzso dysfunction in zzso mice, whereas the therapeutic effects of BAY zzso were abolished following targeted zzso gene zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate the zzso as a novel therapeutic target for protection during gastrointestinal zzso zzso
