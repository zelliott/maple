The third zzso loop of the zzso zzso II type 1 zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso to G proteins and zzso of downstream zzso zzso we determined whether specific zzso sequences were required for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso II zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells zzso with zzso However, in zzso cells that expressed a zzso in which zzso acids 221 and 222 were deleted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was similar in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was independent of zzso whereas the low level of zzso zzso by zzso was completely zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso required zzso whereas zzso required zzso These results demonstrate the presence of 2 different pathways for zzso zzso by zzso II, which differ in their requirements for zzso and small G proteins zzso versus zzso Furthermore, zzso II prevented serum zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso was only zzso by zzso II in zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso significantly reduced serum zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso This study shows for the first time a direct link between zzso zzso and zzso of zzso dependent on zzso acids 221 and 222 in the third zzso loop of the zzso
