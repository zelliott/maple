The aim of the present study was to determine and compare the possible effects of exposure to an estrogen, zzso and to a metal, cadmium on zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the signaling pathways that probably mediate the studied effects exerted by these two zzso In addition, it was of interest to investigate if the studied parameters could constitute zzso for aquatic pollution zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of either cadmium or zzso affected the zzso status of zzso by modulating zzso parameters and zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, our results showed that treatment of zzso with either 5 zzso of cadmium zzso or with 25 zzso of zzso for 30 zzso caused significant increased zzso zzso this led to zzso damage exemplified by significant increased DNA damage, protein zzso and zzso zzso as well as increased zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that either cadmium or zzso signal is zzso either through one of the already known pathways initiated by zzso zzso zzso and reaching zzso zzso zzso probably through protein zzso C zzso or a zzso signaling zzso that involves in most of the cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results also attribute a protective role to zzso since zzso zzso zzso levels inhibited the signal induced by each zzso Finally, since aquatic zzso have been the most widely used monitoring organisms for pollution impact evaluation in marine environments and taking under consideration the positive correlation obtained between the studied zzso we can suggest the simultaneous use of these zzso stress parameters offering an effective early warning system in zzso of aquatic zzso
