In addition to the zzso zzso nuclear transport observed in zzso cells, we detected a mode of nuclear transport that was zzso at elevated zzso calcium zzso Nuclear transport under these conditions was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso nuclear transport in the absence of zzso zzso transport was inhibited by wheat germ zzso consistent with transport proceeding through nuclear zzso We propose that release of zzso calcium stores upon cell zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso the elevated zzso calcium then acts through zzso to stimulate the novel zzso mode of zzso
