Many disease states, including the aging process, are associated with the zzso of zzso harboring respiratory zzso zzso dysfunction is often accompanied by increased zzso levels that can contribute to cellular dysfunction and disease zzso Here we use the model zzso zzso zzso to investigate whether reduced zzso c zzso zzso activity, commonly reported in aging organisms and associated with neurodegenerative disorders, leads to zzso production from zzso We provide evidence that although reduced zzso complex activity zzso with zzso zzso zzso are not the major production zzso Instead we show that zzso zzso activate Ras upon their outer membrane that establishes a zzso zzso environment by suppressing zzso defenses and the zzso turnover of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that dysfunctional zzso can serve as a signaling platform to promote the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and accelerate aging in zzso
