The production of zzso heavy chain zzso protein in zzso cells provides feedback to terminate further zzso gene zzso This phenomenon is referred to as zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso genes regulates their zzso potential, hence zzso in zzso are a key factor in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso accessibility of the largest family of zzso genes zzso and potentially activates these genes for zzso Loss of these signals in the later stages of zzso development reverts the zzso gene segments to a less accessible state, making them zzso zzso This provides a molecular mechanism for zzso exclusion of these zzso Similar transient signals may be responsible for enforcing zzso exclusion in other zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso however, appear to be less susceptible to feedback zzso
