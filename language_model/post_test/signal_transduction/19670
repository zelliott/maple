Several zzso family members, especially the zzso and zzso zzso are highly and predominantly expressed in the central nervous zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso plays two unique roles at parallel fiber zzso cell zzso in the zzso the formation and stabilization of synaptic zzso and the control of functional synaptic plasticity by regulating the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in zzso cells, plays similar critical roles in the zzso In addition, viral expression of zzso or the application of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso methods were necessary to reveal the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso at the synaptic junction of zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso are located at the synaptic zzso where various proteins undergo intricate molecular interactions with each other, and serve as a zzso synaptic zzso
