zzso receptors are expressed on cells of the innate and the zzso immune zzso They play important roles in pathogen and danger sensing as they translate the information gathered by complement fluid phase sensors into cellular zzso Further, they control complement zzso on viable and zzso host cells, clearance of immune complexes and mediate zzso More recently, evidence has accumulated that complement receptors form a complex network with other innate receptors systems such as the zzso zzso the zzso signaling system, zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso receptors contributing to the benefit and burden of innate and zzso immune responses in zzso and allergic diseases as well as in cancer and zzso Here, we will discuss recent developments and emerging concepts of complement zzso zzso and regulation with a particular focus on the zzso maintenance and contraction of zzso and regulatory T zzso
