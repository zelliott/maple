During zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso growth and survival become independent of normal regulatory zzso These zzso cells acquire the remarkable ability to adapt to the surrounding zzso whose factors, such as zzso influence their zzso Although findings are becoming evident about the expression of zzso in prostate cancer zzso cells, their exact functional role in zzso cells has yet to be zzso Previous work has demonstrated that membrane zzso zzso associated with key zzso proteins mediate growth and survival zzso pathways in prostate cancer zzso 

In order to analyze the membrane zzso of the zzso we explored its presence by a zzso approach in zzso zzso resistant membrane zzso of the zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso observations demonstrated the zzso of the zzso with zzso the major protein component of zzso In addition, we showed that zzso stimulation of the zzso induced resistance to zzso zzso and that zzso was necessary for this zzso Further, zzso revealed the relation between high levels of zzso and zzso expression with advanced stage prostate zzso We also show by zzso that the zzso zzso resistance described in zzso cells is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, we propose that zzso stimulation in zzso prostate cancer cells via zzso constitutes one of the mechanisms contributing to their protection from zzso zzso
