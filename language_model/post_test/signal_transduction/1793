The zzso of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso shares a high degree of structural similarity and can carry out some redundant zzso However, mechanisms that regulate the zzso and activity of these proteins have not been fully zzso In this study, a nuclear zzso signal zzso was identified in zzso which is required for zzso nuclear import and which could promote the nuclear import of a zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso localized to the zzso and displayed diminished zzso zzso A nuclear export signal zzso was also recognized in zzso C zzso the deletion of which caused zzso to display a more nuclear zzso zzso This zzso was sensitive to zzso B and could function as an independent export signal when fused to a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso proteins lacking the zzso or the zzso were more stable than zzso zzso suggesting that nuclear import and nuclear export are required for efficient zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso is controlled by both nuclear import and export and suggest that the overall distribution of zzso is likely to result from the balance between these two zzso Proper control of nuclear import and export is likely to be an important regulatory zzso of zzso
