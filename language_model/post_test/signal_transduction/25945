zzso zzso are widespread in bacterial zzso but previous studies have focused on receptors with single zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unusual domain architecture consisting of a zzso domain sandwiched between three zzso and two zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso control zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso was recently zzso making zzso the first protein with resolved zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso but here we show that zzso can interact with the zzso system of zzso coli to mediate repellent responses to zzso carbon monoxide and zzso zzso Using this model system to investigate zzso and zzso function, we determined that the zzso zzso domain binds zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso requires four of the five zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and/or 3 resulted in a zzso zzso whereas deleting zzso 4 and/or 5 resulted in a zzso zzso Overall, these data support a model in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 and 3 act together to relieve zzso of the zzso control module by zzso 4 and 5, resulting in the zzso state of the zzso zzso
