The zzso zzso has the ability to respond to a large number of volatile compounds of small molecular zzso Ultimately, such a property lies on a specialized type of zzso the zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso responds with action zzso whose frequency depends on zzso zzso The primary events in the process of zzso zzso are thought to occur at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and involve the binding of zzso to zzso molecules followed by the opening of zzso zzso A crucial step in understanding zzso zzso requires identifying the mechanisms that regulate the electrical activity of zzso zzso In the last couple of years, zzso recording from isolated zzso cells and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso have begun to shed light on some of these zzso Although the information emerging from such studies is still zzso there are already zzso hypotheses on the molecular events that might zzso the primary events in zzso zzso Currently, attention is being focused on the notions that second zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso channels in zzso zzso and that zzso binding to a zzso zzso might lead directly to the gating of zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso The coming years promise to be exciting ones in the field of zzso zzso We have now the necessary tools to be able to confront hypotheses and experimental zzso
