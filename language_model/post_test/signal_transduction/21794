This study identified zzso in the sensory zzso complex with connections to the zzso zzso inferior zzso lateral zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso or the spinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso were localized by injection of retrograde zzso zzso processing revealed zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in these two zzso zzso zzso projecting to the zzso and the zzso were in the zzso principal nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and scattered throughout the zzso zzso zzso were bilateral to the zzso with an zzso dominance to the zzso except from the zzso zzso which was zzso zzso projecting to the zzso were numerous in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and less abundant in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggested that only zzso and zzso project to the zzso zzso zzso projecting to the zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso were mainly in the zzso zzso and zzso and in the lateral zzso rarely or never in zzso Among zzso zzso most of the zzso were zzso for zzso but some reacted for zzso Among zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso for each of the two zzso acids was zzso zzso terminals were observed in contact with zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso giving evidence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso facial zzso may contribute through zzso or zzso pathways to the control of zzso zzso
