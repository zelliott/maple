The localized expression of zzso zzso at the extreme anterior of zzso zzso suggests that it might provide an zzso cue that patterns developing egg chambers along the zzso zzso zzso or excessive zzso signaling zzso egg chamber patterning dramatically through primary effects at two zzso zzso First, excess zzso signaling in zzso stem cells stimulates zzso cell zzso This likely zzso the earliest interactions between zzso and zzso cells and may account for the frequent zzso of zzso within egg zzso Second, the initiation of the zzso programs of zzso cell lineages appears to be delayed by zzso zzso zzso This may account for the formation of zzso polar cells, the extended proliferation of zzso cells and the defective differentiation of zzso zzso cells, which, in turn, zzso polarity within the zzso zzso cells in the zzso cannot zzso normally in the absence of zzso or zzso zzso Loss of protein zzso A activity restores the proliferation of zzso cells in the absence of zzso activity and allows the formation of normally patterned zzso zzso localized zzso is not essential to direct egg chamber zzso
