To zzso signal zzso based on protein zzso in living cells, we have developed genetically zzso fluorescent zzso named zzso Two different color zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso were joined by a tandem fusion domain composed of a zzso domain for the protein zzso of interest, a flexible zzso zzso and a zzso recognition domain that binds with the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction of the zzso domain and the adjacent zzso recognition domain within a zzso was dependent upon zzso of the zzso domain by protein zzso which influenced the efficiency of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between the zzso within a zzso In the present study, we employed zzso composed of insulin signaling proteins to zzso protein zzso by the insulin zzso This method may provide a general approach for studying the dynamics of protein zzso signal zzso in living zzso
