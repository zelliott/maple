The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso pathways by which zzso zzso factor zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso regulate the development of rod zzso in the mouse zzso 

zzso zzso cultures derived from zzso zzso mice were used to monitor rod zzso zzso zzso was used to activate the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were manipulated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso were harvested at distinct time points and processed for zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect normal development of rods in zzso zzso or the suppression of their appearance by treatment with zzso In contrast, activated zzso was necessary for suppression of the rod cell fate zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso induced by a dominant negative zzso abolished zzso of rod development by zzso 

These results indicate that zzso but not zzso can critically regulate zzso development during mouse zzso zzso
