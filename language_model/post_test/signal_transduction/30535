All regulatory processes require components that sense the environmental or zzso conditions of the cell, and sophisticated sensory proteins have been studied in great zzso During the last few years, it turned out that zzso can control gene expression in response to the availability of their zzso Here, we review four different mechanisms by which these zzso interfere with regulation in zzso First, some zzso have acquired a zzso domain and act as direct zzso zzso by binding DNA in the absence of their zzso A second class is represented by zzso which can bind iron responsive elements in the absence of iron to control the expression of genes involved in iron zzso The third class of these zzso is sugar zzso of the zzso system that control the activity of zzso regulators by zzso them in the absence of the specific zzso Finally, a fourth class of regulatory zzso controls the activity of zzso factors by zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso that are active in the control of gene expression should be designated as trigger zzso An analysis of the occurrence of trigger zzso suggests that the zzso and subsequent functional specialization is a major pattern in their zzso
