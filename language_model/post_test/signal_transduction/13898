This study was designed to investigate the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso inflammatory zzso and its underlying mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso rats zzso N zzso zzso were created by zzso and were fed with normal diet for 16 weeks after the surgery, and compared with zzso rats zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso profile, zzso metabolism zzso serum zzso stress and inflammatory zzso were zzso The expression of inflammatory zzso in the zzso zzso was zzso To evaluate the signal zzso pathways of zzso on the expression of zzso rat zzso zzso cell lines zzso were treated with zzso and their protein expressions of inflammatory zzso and zzso levels of relevant signal pathways were zzso At the 16th week after surgery in zzso rats, their serum zzso very low density zzso cholesterol, free fatty acid and zzso levels were prominently elevated (all P zzso zzso serum zzso stress zzso zzso serum inflammatory zzso oxidized zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and C zzso protein were also significantly zzso Meanwhile, the expression of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso rats were significantly zzso (all P zzso zzso In zzso zzso significantly decreased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with the suppression of zzso levels of nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the serum inflammatory zzso and increases zzso inflammatory zzso zzso regulates these inflammatory responses by zzso and zzso involved zzso
