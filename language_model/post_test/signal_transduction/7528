Recent studies have shown that zzso injury in the zzso zzso leads to long-term neurological zzso such as zzso zzso and cognitive zzso How zzso zzso zzso affects the development and function of the zzso is largely zzso Our study focuses on developing a mouse model of zzso to determine the zzso zzso and molecular zzso resulting from a zzso insult to the developing zzso To induce zzso in the zzso mouse zzso we injected bacterial zzso which breaks down surrounding blood vessel walls, into the fourth zzso at zzso day zzso We found a reduction in zzso size during zzso growth, a decrease in zzso cells, and persistent zzso abnormalities similar to abnormalities reported in zzso infants with zzso We further investigated the molecular pathways that may be zzso due to zzso zzso and found a significant zzso of genes in the inflammatory and sonic zzso zzso These results point to an zzso of zzso mechanisms of injury and zzso in response to zzso zzso Our study provides a zzso model of zzso that may be used to understand the zzso of zzso zzso and for potential development of preventive therapies and zzso
