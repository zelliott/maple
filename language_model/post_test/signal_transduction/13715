zzso a newly reported zzso has been found to be zzso expressed in human zzso and repress zzso zzso To study the role of zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso we explored the function of zzso in zzso cells through using the zzso cell line zzso and its zzso resistant cells zzso zzso cells expressed a relatively higher level of zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in decreased cell zzso after zzso zzso when zzso was zzso in zzso cells, zzso induced more cell zzso By analyzing the activity of zzso the results indicated a negative association between the expression of zzso and zzso signaling zzso in these zzso zzso Our data suggested that the expression level of zzso has an inverse correlation with zzso resistance and activity of zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, zzso could regulate zzso sensitivity in zzso cells at least partially through zzso signaling zzso
