zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso integration site family zzso signaling is zzso of zzso zzso zzso harboring functional zzso in either zzso zzso coli or zzso zzso with zzso cascade zzso zzso also zzso the expression of zzso zzso feedback zzso particularly the putative tumor zzso zzso Because zzso serves as a negative regulator of zzso zzso signaling in normal cells, recent attention has focused on the utility of increasing zzso levels in zzso as a means to slow tumor zzso However, rather than functioning as a tumor zzso we demonstrate that zzso acts as a potent promoter of zzso behavior by zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso inducing a functional zzso transition zzso program and driving zzso zzso zzso zzso expression decreases zzso activity, reverses zzso and zzso zzso invasive and zzso activities in concert with global effects on the zzso cancer cell zzso The further identification of zzso and nuclear zzso proteins at the invasive front of human zzso supports a revised model wherein zzso acts as a potent tumor promoter in zzso
