The zzso anemia zzso protein network is necessary for repair of DNA zzso zzso zzso but its control mechanism remains zzso Here we show that the network is regulated by a zzso signaling cascade initiated by zzso and its partner, zzso and zzso by zzso a component of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso product of zzso and this zzso activity and zzso are both required for recruitment of zzso to zzso Both zzso and zzso are required for recruitment of zzso core complex and zzso to zzso whereas zzso can zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso and zzso are needed for efficient zzso zzso a key step of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso core complex work in the same zzso to promote cellular resistance to zzso Thus, the zzso zzso cascade is critical for recruiting zzso core complex to zzso and for normal function of the zzso zzso
