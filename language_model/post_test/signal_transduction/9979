Many biological functions of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso against zzso stress, zzso zzso in the central or peripheral nervous systems, and zzso zzso or zzso potential, have been attributed to its zzso byproduct carbon monoxide zzso although roles for zzso and iron have also been zzso In addition to these zzso effects, recent findings reveal that zzso CO may act as an oxygen sensor and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso CO may participate in regulatory T cell zzso A number of the known signaling effects of CO depend on stimulation of soluble zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso status may serve as an essential component of certain aspects of CO action, such as growth zzso In this review, we zzso recent findings of the beneficial or zzso effects of zzso CO with an emphasis on the signaling pathways and downstream targets that trigger the action of this zzso
