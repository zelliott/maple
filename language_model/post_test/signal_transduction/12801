zzso is known to have zzso effects on the release and action of a wide variety of gut zzso Previous studies in zzso have suggested a potential zzso role for zzso even on its own zzso To determine whether this zzso effect is the result of a direct action of the zzso on the cell that is responsible for its zzso we examined the effect of a zzso but biologically active analogue of zzso zzso on release of zzso zzso zzso from isolated canine zzso zzso We identified zzso binding sites with zzso zzso of zzso X zzso and zzso X zzso M that zzso with zzso zzso 14, zzso 28, and zzso were equivalent in zzso zzso from the binding zzso zzso inhibited zzso release from zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso toxin zzso prevented the zzso effects of zzso on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso by on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso release induced by zzso and zzso was not altered by zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso its own zzso via specific receptors on zzso This zzso effect is zzso by mechanisms that are both dependent on and independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso
