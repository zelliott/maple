We explored the impact of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes on prognosis and downstream signaling in a zzso cohort of 47 patients with pediatric zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso In zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso to zzso increased zzso of an zzso reporter construct over zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in further zzso of reporter gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso were accompanied by increased median transcripts for zzso target genes zzso zzso and zzso However, none of these zzso were associated with treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were associated with significant increases in transcript levels of several chemotherapy relevant zzso including zzso zzso reduced folate carrier, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts positively correlated with zzso and zzso transcript zzso Our results suggest that zzso multiple factors should be considered with attempting to identify zzso zzso factors for pediatric zzso and zzso depending on the zzso signaling status, modifications in the types or dosing of standard chemotherapy drugs for zzso or combinations of agents capable of targeting zzso zzso and/or zzso with standard chemotherapy agents may be zzso
