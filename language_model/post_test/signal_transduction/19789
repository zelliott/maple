In adult zzso zzso of mice, the proliferation of precursor cells can be zzso by voluntary exercise zzso Physical activity has an additional effect on late zzso cells zzso by promoting cell survival and further zzso zzso is a key regulator of various steps in zzso development, including the zzso of cell cycle exit and zzso differentiation of neural stem cells, as well as promoting the survival and zzso branching of newborn zzso We here report that physical activity increased the proportion and absolute number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells that showed an activated zzso zzso In contrast, the fraction of dividing cells with nuclear zzso zzso domain expression indicating an activated zzso zzso was not affected by physical zzso We used double labeling with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to distinguish between cell cycle exit and continued division at the zzso cell zzso After 7 days of physical exercise, the zzso activity of precursor cells was increased, whereas the proportion of zzso cells zzso zzso was zzso zzso with this zzso the proportion of zzso cells that expressed the marker of zzso immature zzso cells zzso was zzso Running promotes both the proliferation and cell cycle exit of zzso zzso zzso possibly by zzso stimulating a last zzso cell zzso These zzso effects are independent of zzso whereas the zzso survival and cell cycle exit of zzso zzso cells might by zzso by zzso zzso
