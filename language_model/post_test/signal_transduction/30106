Because zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso in the nucleus zzso zzso blocks cardiovascular responses to zzso of local zzso zzso and because zzso is a neurotransmitter of zzso zzso nerves, we sought to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso would block zzso transmission and cause zzso We determined zzso heart rate responses to intravenous zzso and sodium zzso in 5 zzso rats before and after bilateral zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus zzso zzso The inhibitor significantly increased mean zzso pressure without affecting heart rate, and it significantly reduced the gain of the zzso After administration of the zzso zzso responses of heart rate to changes in mean zzso pressure were always less than those responses to the same, or less, change in mean zzso pressure in the same animal without administration of the zzso zzso of saline zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus zzso zzso did not lead to hypertension or change zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis and suggest that zzso zzso oxide zzso is critical to transmission of zzso signals through the nucleus zzso zzso
