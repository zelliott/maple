In cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso cells the signal zzso at zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso was measured as an increase of influx of zzso This zzso influx of zzso was enhanced by zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was less active than zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso were zzso These zzso acids failed to activate zzso influx of zzso zzso of calcium influx at zzso receptors by zzso was unchanged by the zzso acids mentioned zzso zzso and zzso increased the potency but failed to change the efficacy of zzso zzso This action was not changed by zzso The enhancement of zzso signal zzso by zzso and zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but was even more evident in presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may function as positive zzso zzso of signal zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso
