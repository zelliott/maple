An inflammatory process in the central nervous system zzso is believed to play an important role in the zzso leading to zzso cell death in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, multiple sclerosis and zzso The inflammatory response is zzso by the activated zzso the resident immune cells of the zzso which normally respond to zzso damage and remove the damaged cells by zzso zzso of zzso is a hallmark of brain zzso However, it remains controversial whether zzso cells have beneficial or zzso functions in various zzso zzso The chronic zzso of zzso may in turn cause zzso damage through the release of potentially zzso molecules such as zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and complement zzso zzso suppression of zzso inflammation has been considered as an important strategy in neurodegenerative disease zzso Several zzso drugs of various chemical ingredients have been shown to repress the zzso zzso and to exert zzso effects in the zzso following different types of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which these effects occur remain zzso In recent years, several research groups including ours have attempted to explain the potential mechanisms and signaling pathways for the repressive effect of various drugs, on zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso We provide here a comprehensive review of recent findings of mechanisms and signaling pathways by which zzso cells are activated in zzso inflammatory zzso This review article further summarizes the role of zzso cells in neurodegenerative diseases and various forms of potential therapeutic options to inhibit the zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso injury in neurodegenerative zzso
