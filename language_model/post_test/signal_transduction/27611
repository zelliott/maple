The mechanisms underlying airway zzso are still unknown but increased zzso of airway smooth muscle may play a zzso This study sought to demonstrate a relationship between in zzso airway responsiveness and a number of measures of airway smooth muscle responsiveness ex zzso including zzso zzso zzso by comparing three zzso strains of rat with different degrees of airways responsiveness to zzso Lewis, zzso and Fisher strains of rat were characterized for their pulmonary responses to zzso zzso in zzso and Fisher rats were found to be zzso to zzso compared with zzso and Lewis zzso The responsiveness of the airways from these strains of rat ex zzso revealed that zzso airways from Fisher rats significantly narrowed to a greater degree and at a faster rate to zzso than Lewis rat zzso consistent with their differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, narrowed to the same degree as Fisher airways but took longer to do so at a high concentration of zzso zzso caused zzso increases in zzso zzso in airway smooth muscle cells from all three strains of zzso but Fisher and zzso displayed higher responses than Lewis airway smooth zzso Our results demonstrate that the degree of zzso zzso zzso by zzso in airway smooth muscle parallels the rate and degree of zzso airway narrowing and suggest that the degree of zzso zzso zzso plays a role in determining airway smooth muscle zzso
