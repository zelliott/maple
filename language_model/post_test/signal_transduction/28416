A basis for the insulin zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Because zzso serves as a major zzso of plasma membrane cholesterol and a relationship between plasma membrane cholesterol and zzso levels has recently become apparent, we assessed whether zzso zzso induced by zzso resulted from changes in membrane cholesterol zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a zzso loss of zzso from the plasma membrane and a zzso zzso zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso products of zzso did not mimic this zzso zzso Plasma membrane cholesterol amount was diminished in cells exposed to zzso Restoration of membrane cholesterol blocked the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso of zzso which resulted in a zzso zzso decrease in membrane cholesterol, led to a zzso zzso increase in zzso incorporation into the plasma zzso Although increased plasma membrane zzso content by cholesterol extraction with zzso of zzso above 5 zzso most likely reflected decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso below zzso zzso occurred without any visible changes in the zzso retrieval of zzso Furthermore, moderate loss of cholesterol induced by zzso or low zzso of zzso did not alter membrane integrity or increase the abundance of other plasma membrane proteins such as the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by moderate cholesterol loss did not involve known zzso zzso These data reveal that zzso enhances zzso zzso via a novel zzso zzso
