The heat stress zzso response in zzso is mainly regulated by heat shock factors zzso zzso disruption of the master zzso gene leads to dramatically reduced HS response and zzso in several model zzso However, it is not clear whether organisms devoid of the master regulator can still zzso to zzso Previously, we showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso act as master regulators in the HS zzso In this study, we examined the heat zzso capacity of the zzso quadruple and triple zzso knockout zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data showed that in the absence of the master regulators, a minimal but significant level of acquired zzso could be attained in the zzso zzso after zzso The optimum zzso temperature for the zzso quadruple zzso was lower than that for the wild type plants, suggesting that plant cells have two zzso mechanisms that can be distinguished zzso The acquired zzso of the quadruple zzso was likely due to the induction of a small number of zzso HS response genes regulated by other zzso zzso Here, we discuss the possible candidates and propose a working model of the zzso network of the HS response by including the zzso and zzso zzso
