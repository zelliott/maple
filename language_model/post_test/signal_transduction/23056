Natural killer zzso cell zzso is the result of a balance between positive and negative signals triggered by specific membrane zzso We report here the zzso of zzso cells induced through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by specific zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso and zzso which was prevented by treatment of cells with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, signaling through zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso cells and zzso an increase in the zzso zzso activity in zzso immune complexes of zzso cell zzso zzso was identified among the zzso zzso proteins that become zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed after 20 minutes of zzso zzso reached a maximum after 45 to 60 minutes, and decreased to almost zzso levels after 120 minutes of zzso Together, these results demonstrate the role of zzso as an zzso zzso able to zzso positive zzso signals in zzso cells, including the regulation of zzso zzso killing activity, and zzso zzso zzso
