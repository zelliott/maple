Renal dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with zzso In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso dysfunction and in particular that of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso we analyzed global gene expression changes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso rats with and without treatment with zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor known to inhibit zzso zzso global gene expression analysis was performed in zzso for each rat kidney taken from zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso rats, zzso rats treated with zzso or zzso rats treated with zzso From the initial data set of zzso gene spots per group, zzso of zzso genes and zzso of only 50 genes by more than zzso was observed in zzso rat zzso compared to zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment of animals with zzso or zzso prevented zzso of more than zzso of genes associated with hypertension in the rat zzso Analysis of zzso zzso artery responsiveness and zzso studies confirmed that zzso zzso rats had developed kidney damage over the study period and that this kidney dysfunction could be significantly prevented upon zzso or zzso treatment without zzso blood zzso Taken together, our data imply that signaling zzso involving zzso and/or zzso pathways are key contributors to the induction of zzso damage in hypertension and these and potentially other downstream zzso molecules may serve as novel targets for therapeutic zzso
