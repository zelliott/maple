Previous studies have evaluated role of zzso signaling in rotator cuff muscle zzso and determined that there was differential in signaling following zzso zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso following zzso and zzso was modulated by different protein degradation zzso In this study, two muscle zzso systems that have been shown to be potent regulators of muscle zzso in other injury models, the zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated following zzso and zzso In addition to examining protein degradation, this study assessed protein synthesis rate following these two surgical models to understand how the balance between protein degradation and synthesis results in zzso following rotator cuff zzso In contrast to the traditional theory that protein synthesis is decreased during muscle zzso this study suggests that protein synthesis is zzso in rotator cuff muscle zzso following both surgical zzso While the zzso zzso was a major contributor to the zzso seen following zzso zzso was a major contributor following zzso The findings of this study suggest that protein degradation is the primary factor contributing to zzso following rotator cuff zzso However, different zzso pathways are activated if zzso injury is zzso
