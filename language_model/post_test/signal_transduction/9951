zzso IV, a zzso protein and member of the zzso zzso family, is zzso in zzso of the human gastrointestinal zzso including zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso by zzso IV are not yet zzso 

To determine the signaling zzso responsive to zzso IV, we examined the effects of zzso zzso human zzso IV zzso on zzso and zzso colon zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso to cultures led to a zzso increase in cell number similar to that observed after treatment with zzso growth factor zzso In addition, zzso treatment resulted in rapid zzso of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso Using zzso reporter gene zzso we demonstrated that zzso IV signaling through zzso zzso and zzso results in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso analyses revealed quantitative increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression associated with increased zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso further revealed significant increases in zzso binding activity in zzso cells, with increased zzso in the presence of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso treatments led to the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes associated with a poor prognosis in advanced zzso 

zzso IV is a potent zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso of zzso signaling may have utility as a therapeutic intervention for human gastrointestinal zzso
