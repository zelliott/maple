A major barrier to clinical zzso is zzso zzso natural zzso zzso found in higher primates which react to zzso zzso zzso found on lower zzso zzso of zzso to zzso recipients involves zzso of zzso genes and resistance to complement dependent zzso zzso 

To develop methods of increasing these zzso effects, we established an in zzso zzso model utilizing human serum as the source of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso as zzso 

Using this system we demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso led to marginal protection from zzso while zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso a zzso that specifically binds to zzso zzso led to complete zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects were not associated with zzso of zzso binding to cells, but with significant decreased zzso expression and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso could block the zzso of zzso protein expression and reverse the protective effect of zzso zzso and zzso against zzso 

These data support the use of combination approaches targeting independent accommodation mechanisms to zzso enhance donor organ survival in a zzso zzso
