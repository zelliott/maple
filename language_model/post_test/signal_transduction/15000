Previous work has shown that mature B cells depend upon survival signals delivered to the cells by their zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular nature of this survival zzso we have developed a genetic approach in which zzso of the zzso is combined with the zzso of specific, zzso dependent signaling zzso in mature B cells in zzso Using this system, we provide evidence that the survival of zzso deficient mature B cells can be rescued by a single signaling zzso downstream of the zzso namely zzso zzso with the zzso zzso factor playing a central zzso
