zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso area have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and drug zzso zzso the mechanisms through which their activity is regulated via the zzso of zzso input is imperative to understanding their roles in these zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso liberated from zzso zzso activate zzso zzso receptors located on zzso zzso and on zzso terminals targeting zzso receptors located on these zzso zzso release was initiated by zzso either zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors or zzso zzso zzso channels, two conditions that also promote enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso release of zzso may act as a regulatory feedback mechanism to inhibit synaptic zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso thereby regulating firing patterns that may fine-tune zzso release from zzso zzso
