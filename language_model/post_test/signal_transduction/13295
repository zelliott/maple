Cell signaling systems that contain zzso zzso or zzso feedback zzso can, in principle, convert graded zzso into zzso irreversible zzso Systems of this sort are termed zzso Recently, several groups have engineered artificial zzso systems into zzso coli and zzso zzso and have shown that the systems exhibit interesting and potentially useful zzso In addition, two naturally occurring signaling systems, the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso have been shown to exhibit zzso zzso Here we review the basic properties of zzso zzso the requirements for construction of a satisfactory zzso switch, and the recent progress towards constructing and zzso zzso signaling zzso
