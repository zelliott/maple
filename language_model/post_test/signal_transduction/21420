The zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the G zzso receptors zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which differ in their zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso and zzso formed zzso or zzso and whether the zzso changed the function of zzso The zzso analysis using human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells expressing either zzso zzso or zzso showed that zzso is mainly distributed on plasma zzso and zzso existed on plasma zzso and within the zzso zzso analysis using zzso cells expressing both zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso formed zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso caused zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in a zzso manner in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso or zzso The responses were observed to a greater extent in the cells expressing zzso than zzso In the cells expressing both zzso and zzso zzso responses were observed to a lesser extent than in the cells expressing zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding showed that the level of the cell surface expression of zzso was the following order: the cells expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso formed zzso and zzso and zzso signaling may be regulated by the zzso
