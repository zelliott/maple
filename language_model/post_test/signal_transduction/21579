To investigate the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso male zzso rats were randomly allocated to four zzso zzso in model group received zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso treatment groups were given simultaneously zzso as those in model group and zzso 5 or 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso in control group received the same volume of normal zzso Left zzso function, left zzso mass index zzso the content of brain zzso zzso zzso in plasma and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were determined after 6 zzso The results showed that rats in model group developed significant cardiac zzso associated with reduced left zzso function compared with the control zzso However, compared with the model group, zzso cardiac zzso of rats was significantly relieved in zzso treatment groups, associated with improved left zzso function, decreased zzso lower zzso levels in plasma and zzso lower content of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In cultured rat zzso zzso zzso (30 or 100 zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso HO activity as well as the production of CO in zzso zzso with zinc zzso a HO zzso or zzso alone did not change zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso with zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso II in a zzso zzso zzso with zinc zzso significantly abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso may be one of the important mechanisms by which statins inhibit cardiac zzso caused by zzso
