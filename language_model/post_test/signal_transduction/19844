zzso factors produced by pathogens play an important role in the infectious process, which is regulated by a zzso communication mechanism called zzso sensing zzso zzso zzso is an important opportunistic human zzso which causes infections in patients with compromised immune systems and zzso zzso The zzso systems of zzso zzso use zzso zzso zzso zzso as signal zzso Previously we have demonstrated that zzso zzso treatment allowed the animals with zzso zzso pneumonia to effectively clear the bacterial zzso We zzso that the ability to impact the outcome of infections is partly due to zzso having direct effect on the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso The study explores the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and AHL zzso The effect of zzso extracts on growth and expression of zzso zzso factors on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso did not inhibit the growth of the bacteria, enhanced the zzso protein production and zzso the production of zzso However, zzso suppressed the production of zzso and zzso and zzso the synthesis of the AHL zzso zzso has a negative effect on the zzso system of zzso zzso may explain the zzso bacterial clearance from the animal lungs in zzso in our previous animal zzso It is possible that enhancing and zzso activities of zzso are mutually exclusive as it is a complex mixture, as shown with the zzso analysis of the hot water zzso Though zzso is a promising natural zzso zzso it is important to isolate and evaluate the zzso compounds associated with the zzso zzso
