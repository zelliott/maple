zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins have been shown to act as zzso mimics of plant zzso peptides and are required for successful zzso zzso however, the receptors for zzso zzso peptides have not been zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso family, are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are required for perception of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso showed that both receptors are expressed in zzso zzso Lastly, infection zzso with zzso zzso revealed a decrease in both zzso infection and zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that perception of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is not only required for successful zzso infection but is also involved in the formation and/or maintenance of zzso zzso
