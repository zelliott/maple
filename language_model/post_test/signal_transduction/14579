Sex steroid hormones, including estrogen, zzso and zzso mediate their biological effects on cell zzso zzso and zzso through their respective nuclear zzso In addition to functioning as zzso nuclear zzso factors to regulate gene transcription, these receptors also have been shown to mediate rapid zzso of zzso signaling pathways independent of their zzso zzso Despite the fact that zzso effects of sex steroids have been observed since more than three decades ago, the zzso mechanisms zzso these rapid effects still are not well zzso A zzso of nuclear steroid receptors localized to the cell membrane or zzso has been proposed to mediate steroid hormone zzso of signaling zzso however, novel membrane receptors unrelated to nuclear receptors have also been zzso This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the nature of the receptors and mechanisms responsible for rapid zzso signaling actions of sex steroids, including novel membrane receptors and interactions of nuclear steroid receptors with membrane and zzso signaling molecules such as adapter zzso G zzso zzso channels, and protein zzso A better definition of zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways is important to our overall understanding of the biology of steroid zzso
