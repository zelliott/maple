Positive feedback regulation is ubiquitous in cell signaling networks, often leading to zzso outcomes in response to graded zzso However, the role of such zzso in zzso and in spatial spreading of activated zzso has come to be appreciated only zzso We focus on the latter, using a simple model developed in the context of Ras zzso with competing negative and positive feedback zzso We find that positive feedback, in the presence of slow zzso results in zzso of activated molecules on the plasma zzso and rapid spatial spreading as the front of the cluster zzso with a constant zzso zzso on the feedback zzso The advancing fronts of the clusters of the activated species are rough, with zzso consistent with the zzso equation in one zzso Our minimal model is general enough to describe signal zzso in a wide variety of biological networks where activity in the zzso region is subject to feedback zzso
