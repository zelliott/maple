The DNA damage response triggered by bacterial zzso zzso toxins zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso protein zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which promotes the survival of intoxicated zzso cells exposed to a bacterial zzso zzso To identify the zzso of this zzso survival response, we screened a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso that carry deletions in zzso genes for reduced growth following zzso expression of zzso We identified 78 genes whose deletion zzso hypersensitivity to zzso zzso analysis revealed that DNA repair and zzso were the two most overrepresented signaling zzso Among the human zzso present in our data set, zzso and zzso regulate DNA repair and zzso respectively, and also share common interacting partners with zzso We further demonstrate that zzso but not zzso regulates cell survival, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reorganization in response to DNA zzso Our data reveal a previously zzso zzso between DNA damage and zzso dynamics in the regulation of cell survival, and might provide new insights on the role of chronic bacteria infection in zzso
