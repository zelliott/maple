It has been well established that disruption of zzso signaling regulation is involved in various zzso disorders; however, the detailed mechanism by which abnormal zzso of zzso exhibits transforming activity remains to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in most patients with zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso was zzso active and exhibited zzso activity as a potent zzso when zzso zzso zzso was zzso To clarify the signaling zzso of zzso zzso zzso we investigated the functional role of downstream zzso factor zzso in its induced cellular transformation and zzso in nude zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso failed to exhibit transforming activity when zzso zzso was inhibited utilizing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso active zzso zzso zzso exhibited transforming zzso Taking these observations together, it is concluded zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso zzso disorder and would be a good target for the treatment of zzso
