We have previously shown that the cultured zzso zzso are susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were detached from the culture zzso In the present study, we focused on focal zzso zzso zzso which plays pivotal roles in maintaining focal zzso function and cell zzso zzso normally localized at the focal zzso regions of the zzso was not observed at the regions under zzso stress induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso products, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments, as well as full-length zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso cultured under normal conditions by western zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Of interest was the finding that the zzso products of zzso (but not full-length zzso disappeared under zzso zzso The zzso of full-length zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso a specific zzso zzso In addition, zzso of cells with zzso resulted in a sharp decrease in survival signals, such as zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso under stress zzso By contrast, not only relative zzso but also zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso was significantly improved when cells were zzso with a DNA construct of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso positively regulates survival zzso in early zzso of zzso stress in the cultured zzso
