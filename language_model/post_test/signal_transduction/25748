zzso that metabolize or bind the zzso second zzso zzso zzso regulate a wide variety of important processes in zzso These processes include zzso zzso formation, cell division, zzso and zzso The role of zzso zzso signaling in the lifestyle of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, has not previously been zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes 22 predicted proteins containing zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We refer to these genes as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing deletions of all individual zzso genes were created and did not exhibit any zzso growth zzso in growth medium or inside host zzso However, when zzso several zzso genes strongly decreased the ability of zzso zzso to grow inside host zzso zzso of these zzso genes did not affect the zzso type zzso zzso system, the major zzso of zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso these zzso genes were less zzso to zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso but retained the ability to resist grazing by zzso In many cases, the zzso zzso caused by zzso gene zzso was independent of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso genes in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain that lacks all zzso zzso activity indicated that several zzso genes zzso potential zzso These results indicate that components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso play an important role in regulating the ability of zzso zzso to grow in host zzso
