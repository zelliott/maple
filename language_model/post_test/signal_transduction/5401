Memory T cells exhibit low zzso thresholds and rapid zzso responses following zzso zzso contrasting zzso T cells with high zzso thresholds and no zzso zzso Signaling mechanisms for the distinct properties of zzso and memory T cells remain poorly zzso Here, I will discuss new results on signal zzso in zzso and memory T cells that suggest zzso control of zzso threshold and a distinct zzso zzso to rapid zzso The signaling and zzso pathways controlling immediate zzso function in memory T cells closely resemble pathways for rapid zzso zzso production in innate immune cells, suggesting memory T cells use innate pathways for zzso zzso
