zzso zzso are key zzso signals regulating synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous zzso zzso zzso are involved in neural functions ranging from feeding zzso to zzso There is great interest in understanding how zzso zzso zzso and zzso cannabinoids affect zzso Because behavioral adaptations are widely considered to rely on changes in synaptic strength, the prevalence of zzso long-term depression zzso at zzso throughout the brain merits close zzso The induction and expression of zzso although remarkably similar at various zzso are controlled by an array of regulatory influences that we are just beginning to zzso This complexity zzso zzso with important zzso properties, such as coincidence detection and input zzso critical for higher zzso functions like learning and zzso In this article, we review the major molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying zzso as well as the potential zzso relevance of this widespread form of synaptic zzso
