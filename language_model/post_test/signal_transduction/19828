The zzso factor zzso has been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular zzso abnormalities including zzso zzso zzso zzso valves and zzso To date, its role in coronary vascular development remains zzso We have found that zzso mice developed coronary vascular abnormalities accompanied by a thin compact zzso zzso but zzso normal zzso and zzso zzso The coronary vascular anomalies included zzso large vessels and abnormal vascular structures at zzso and reduced recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells into the coronary arteries at zzso In zzso zzso hearts, the abnormal coronary veins demonstrated reduced expression of markers for vein zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso hearts indicated that zzso negative vein networks were increased in the surface layers of the zzso compared to those of the zzso zzso was not expressed in the zzso in zzso and cultured zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso mice showed no zzso zzso zzso mice with a zzso expressed zzso zzso partially rescued the vascular zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso signaling pathways are altered in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, global zzso zzso caused impaired vascular formation, the reduced recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells into coronary arteries and zzso remodeled vein zzso These findings suggest that zzso regulates the later steps of coronary vascular development in both a zzso zzso autonomous fashion and likely a vascular zzso effect as zzso
