zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions in B and T zzso In the absence of zzso B cell development is zzso while T cell development is arrested in the absence of zzso The receptors and the signaling molecules required for differentiation of zzso cells are poorly zzso Here we investigate the role of the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso common zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso fetal liver zzso The zzso mature zzso zzso cells that developed in this context were fully competent in natural zzso and in zzso functional zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated reduced levels of zzso cellular zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso cells could signal through zzso 1 and zzso zzso receptors and expressed zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso protein zzso zzso is not essential for zzso zzso cell development, and that zzso signaling pathways (including those zzso through zzso may sustain most zzso cell functions in the absence of zzso
