In their study published in Science Signaling zzso zzso 27 March 2012, zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso tackle the dynamic and complex wiring of the signaling network involving the protein zzso zzso which exists within two distinct protein complexes zzso and zzso that differ in their regulation and zzso The authors use a combination of zzso for specific zzso events and zzso zzso The primary experimental tool employed is to monitor the zzso of zzso on zzso in cell zzso as a surrogate for zzso activity, which the authors conclude is a specific zzso for zzso However, zzso zzso occurs on both zzso and zzso and will zzso change as the network through which these two complexes are connected is zzso zzso models of zzso network regulation built using this tool are inherently imperfect and open to alternative zzso zzso issues with the main conclusion made in this study, involving the zzso zzso sclerosis complex 1 and 2) complex and its potential regulation of zzso are discussed zzso A broader goal of this Letter is to clarify to other investigators the zzso of using zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso as a specific zzso for either of the two zzso zzso
