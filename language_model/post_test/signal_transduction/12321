A key question in zzso biology is how growth factor signals are integrated to generate zzso In this study we investigated the integration of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways via zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso was found to regulate the zzso of Mad by zzso in zzso In zzso experiments, the effects of zzso on wing disc molecular markers zzso zzso and zzso were suppressed by depletion of Mad with zzso zzso zzso zzso such as formation of zzso wing margins, were induced by Mad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that Mad zzso by zzso and zzso occurred in zzso zzso Mad depletion or zzso produced zzso embryonic zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso border formation was disrupted by zzso zzso The results show that Mad is required for zzso signaling and for the integration of zzso of zzso zzso
