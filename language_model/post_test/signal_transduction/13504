The role of zzso zzso in the signal zzso of four zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells was zzso In zzso cells, both zzso and zzso zzso within 10 zzso the zzso zzso of similar proteins with molecular masses of 70, 56, 51, 42, and 38 zzso as well as two different zzso zzso one being the zzso zzso Both of these growth factors were able to increase the transcription, within 1 zzso of two zzso zzso and the gamma chain of the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso on a common zzso protein occurred within 10 zzso in response to either zzso or zzso In addition, zzso stimulation increased the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Both growth factors were able to increase zzso of the zzso gene within 1 zzso Finally, in zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso within 10 zzso of two different zzso zzso one of which was the zzso zzso Both growth factors were able, within 1 zzso to increase the zzso of the zzso and gamma chain of the zzso zzso zzso
