After a zzso insulin suppresses zzso through the zzso of its downstream zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of protein zzso A zzso the main positive zzso of zzso During insulin resistance, this process is zzso leading to a characteristic zzso and the worsening of impaired insulin action and zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso using restricted zzso zzso This zzso selectively alters the zzso zzso of its major zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin regulates total zzso activity in an zzso zzso These findings indicate that localized changes in insulin action are responsible for the differential zzso of zzso zzso Thus, we identify a zzso by which insulin regulates zzso through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso
