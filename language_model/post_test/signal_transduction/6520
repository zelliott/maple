The zzso zzso organ detects social information about zzso status, and zzso The molecular cues carrying this information remain largely zzso Here, we show that small peptides that serve as zzso for major zzso complex zzso class I molecules function also as sensory stimuli for a subset of zzso sensory zzso located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zone of the zzso zzso In behaving mice, the same peptides function as individuality signals underlying mate recognition in the context of pregnancy zzso zzso peptides constitute a previously unknown family of zzso stimuli by which zzso zzso diversity can influence social zzso
