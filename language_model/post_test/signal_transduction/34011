zzso is one of the frequent integration sites for mouse zzso tumor zzso Although its product is the zzso of translation initiation factor zzso other evidence indicates that it interacts with zzso or other proteins to regulate protein zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso is required for overcoming stress imposed by zzso zzso using the drug zzso zzso zzso and complementary Northern studies using zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso core environmental stress response zzso genes in addition to typical general zzso acid control zzso genes whose zzso depends on the zzso zzso zzso In agreement with this, zzso zzso and its target zzso factor zzso which signal the zzso are required for overcoming zzso zzso We find that zzso is required for maintaining the zzso level of zzso and for rapid zzso zzso of the zzso on zzso Pulse labeling experiments indicate that zzso significantly slows down de zzso protein zzso Moreover, zzso protein zzso was reduced in zzso zzso These effects would account for the compromised zzso activity on zzso zzso Thus, the robust protein synthesis promoted by intact zzso appears to be a part of the requisites for sound zzso zzso signaling governed by the activity of the zzso zzso zzso
