zzso growth factors zzso zzso are implicated in pancreatic tissue repair but their role in acute zzso is not zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso the course of zzso induced acute zzso zzso was administered to zzso zzso and transgenic mice that are zzso zzso for expression of a dominant negative type II zzso zzso 

After 7 hourly zzso injections of zzso the zzso was evaluated zzso and serum was zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Next, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso were determined in mouse pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso 

The normal mouse zzso was devoid of inflammatory cells whereas the zzso from transgenic mice contained zzso zzso zzso injection in zzso mice resulted in 6- and zzso increases in serum zzso and zzso levels, respectively, increased serum zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, gross zzso and a marked inflammatory response in the zzso that consisted mainly of zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso mice exhibited minimal zzso in response to zzso with attenuated zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from zzso mice did not exhibit restricted stimulation at high zzso zzso even though zzso zzso zzso levels were not zzso 

Our findings indicate that a functional zzso zzso zzso may be required for zzso to induce acute zzso and for the zzso zzso to induce zzso cell damage at high zzso zzso Our results also support the concept that restricted stimulation at high zzso zzso contributes to the ability of zzso to induce acute zzso
