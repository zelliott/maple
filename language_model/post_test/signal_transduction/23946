zzso to, or deterioration of, the zzso horn tissue of the bovine hoof claw culminates ultimately in the development of zzso zzso We have observed abnormal zzso distribution at the site of zzso zzso in the bovine claw that may be due to zzso of the zzso cues of the zzso In this study we have characterized key cell biological changes associated with zzso in the claw that may zzso abnormal zzso Loss of basement membrane at sites of zzso was found by zzso detection of zzso and zzso In other zzso basement membrane breakdown results from degradation by zzso zzso zzso Similarly, elevated levels of zzso 2 and 9 were observed in zzso bovine claw tissue both by zzso and, zzso by zzso of zzso zzso In the sole of claws that contained an zzso tissue zzso to the zzso site also had elevated zzso 2 when compared with healthy sole tissue from the same animals, as did sole tissue of claws recovering from zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso 2) was detected by zzso in healthy zzso zzso 2 tended to be lower in diseased tissue zzso to zzso sites, and was significantly lower in zzso zzso zzso 2 was located by zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso region of sole zzso in the region of the basement zzso Increased zzso zzso of material in the zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 in tissue extracts enriched for zzso or zzso confirmed that the inhibitor was located predominantly in the zzso To investigate a possible zzso relationship between basement membrane zzso and zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was tested in tissue zzso cultures prepared from healthy sole zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on either protein or DNA zzso In contrast, in the presence of zzso zzso protein synthesis was decreased in a zzso manner, a significant effect being observed at the highest concentration after treatment for 24 zzso At this zzso DNA synthesis was also decreased after 48 h of culture, an effect that may be relevant to a zzso reduction in claw cell zzso and the associated seasonal vulnerability of cows to claw zzso The results provide evidence for basement membrane disruption at zzso sites, and an increased potential for disruption in the diseased zzso and a zzso link between this and abnormal zzso zzso zzso membrane disruption is in turn associated with zzso changes in zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso Whether zzso zzso is the primary cause of zzso deterioration and, if so, how zzso zzso is zzso remains to be zzso
