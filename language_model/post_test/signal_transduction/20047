zzso a product of the obesity zzso has been shown to produce cardiac zzso Although zzso mechanism of action is poorly understood zzso of the zzso zzso has been proposed as a contributing zzso The zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso program although it is not known whether zzso can activate this signaling zzso or whether there is a relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we determined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and assessed the possible role of zzso zzso were performed using cultured zzso rat zzso zzso exposed to 50 zzso zzso for zzso which resulted in a robust zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was associated with significantly reduced activity of the zzso The zzso response to zzso were completely zzso by both zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor as well as the reverse mode zzso exchange inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso however only the effect of the latter was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso significantly attenuated early zzso increase in zzso activity as well as the increase in nuclear zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor of activated T zzso The zzso response to zzso was also associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso but not zzso zzso into zzso Both zzso responses as well as zzso were zzso by zzso as well as the zzso inhibitor zzso although zzso zzso was zzso Our study therefore demonstrates a critical role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we report a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which acts independently of changes in zzso zzso zzso
