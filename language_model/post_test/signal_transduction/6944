zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts from the zzso are protective to zzso after zzso zzso The zzso response element zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in maintaining the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with potent zzso in its promoter, is a highly effective therapeutic target for the protection against neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso retinal zzso The aim of our present study was to investigate whether the protective effect of zzso after zzso damage was zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was induced by an increase in zzso pressure to 130 zzso zzso for 60 zzso Prior to the induction of zzso rats were orally treated with either vehicle (PBS) or zzso (1 zzso once a day for 1 zzso For specific experiments, zinc zzso zzso 20 zzso an zzso zzso was zzso administered at 24 h prior to zzso The protective effects of zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso cell and zzso cell survival, and by measuring cell zzso in the retinal zzso In addition, zzso expression was examined using Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso nuclear zzso and zzso expression in the zzso after zzso zzso Increased zzso and a decrease in the number of viable cells were observed in the zzso cell layer zzso and inner nuclear layer zzso in the zzso zzso which were reversed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso zzso protective effects in the zzso after zzso Taken together, these results suggested that zzso partially exerted its beneficial zzso effects via the zzso of zzso and an increase in zzso protein zzso
