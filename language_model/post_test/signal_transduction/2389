A signaling zzso active on the zzso side of the zzso zzso defines zzso zzso A cell surface signal relayed by zzso zzso and zzso releases the zzso protein zzso from its zzso inhibitor zzso free zzso zzso into zzso and directs expression of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system and zzso experiments, we define scaffolding and zzso interactions among the zzso zzso We show that zzso binds specifically to zzso zzso and zzso and that the protein zzso activity of zzso zzso regulates its interactions with zzso and zzso We also identify zzso zzso as a potential zzso linking the interaction network, via zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
