zzso damage to DNA is generally accepted as the main zzso of zzso and cancer induced by environmental zzso or zzso zzso However, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that zzso targets may also have a key role in zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso As the possibility of a particle zzso through the zzso is much higher than through the zzso in environmental radiation exposure, the contribution to zzso damage from zzso zzso should not be ignored in radiation risk zzso Although targeted zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso in zzso cells, the precise zzso underlying the zzso process is largely zzso 

A zzso that can target the zzso of cells with high precision was used to study mechanisms involved in zzso the zzso effects in zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA damages and zzso nitrogen species zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by the induction of zzso was enhanced in zzso cells, which could be suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso cells increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso proposed a possible zzso zzso involving zzso zzso species and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
