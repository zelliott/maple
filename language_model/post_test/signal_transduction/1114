The zzso mechanism of the zzso action of the zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in the mouse passive avoidance zzso Animals were zzso injected with zzso toxin zzso or with zzso zzso complementary to the sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso reversed the zzso induced by both zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso zzso the zzso effect induced by zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso with zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso per mouse zzso never modified the impairment of memory processes induced by the zzso At the highest effective doses, none of the compounds used impaired motor coordination zzso rod zzso nor modified spontaneous zzso and inspection activity, zzso board zzso These results indicate the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso protein zzso in the zzso mechanism responsible for the induction of zzso by zzso and zzso
