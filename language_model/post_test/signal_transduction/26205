zzso body zzso zzso and terminal differentiation of stratum zzso zzso cells are signaled by both zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

To address the early dynamics of LB zzso we examined zzso zzso of zzso in 3 mouse models following acute barrier zzso zzso mice, zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso 

Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso accumulates in zzso cells zzso while zzso zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso movement of zzso and the retreat of the zzso front, paralleled by upstream zzso zzso zzso This phenomenon was both enhanced by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso and in zzso knockout zzso We found that plasma membrane zzso changes causing LB zzso are controlled by zzso zzso zzso We next addressed the interaction dynamics between zzso and plasma membrane following zzso zzso stress fiber formation in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress fiber formation is increased in zzso zzso cells prior to and following zzso zzso zzso while absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso drives zzso membrane dynamics that regulate early LB zzso following barrier zzso stress fiber formation and zzso zzso
