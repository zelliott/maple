Relay of information from the zzso environment into the cell often results from a zzso growth factor binding to its zzso cell surface zzso this event is an integral mechanism by which many cellular functions occur, including cell growth, zzso and zzso In recent years, however, this requirement for zzso binding has been shown to be surpassed by several distinct mechanisms, including cell surface zzso zzso zzso between zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions zzso zzso zzso zzso and finally by structural zzso within the zzso zzso While all of these pathways result in so-called zzso signaling by the zzso zzso to date, only structural zzso in the zzso have been shown to result in qualitative changes in downstream targets of the zzso which specifically result in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we describe aspects of the known signaling properties of the zzso zzso zzso as a model of zzso zzso zzso and compare these properties to results emerging from ongoing studies on structurally related zzso zzso zzso originally identified in human zzso A better understanding of the signaling pathways used by these uniquely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may ultimately reveal new targets for the development of novel zzso selective for the zzso of tumor cell zzso
