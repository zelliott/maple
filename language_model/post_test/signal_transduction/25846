zzso a putative zzso like protein gene was amplified from a cherry tomato zzso zzso which encodes a precursor protein of 250 zzso acid zzso and shares high degrees of zzso with a number of other zzso zzso zzso of zzso in different tomato zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso showing that zzso expressed at different levels in leaves, zzso roots, flowers and zzso In addition, expression of zzso under different zzso stresses was carried out at different time zzso Three of the four tested zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid and zzso zzso triggered a significant induction of zzso after zzso However, zzso was weaker induced by zzso acid than by zzso The positive responses of zzso to the three zzso stimuli suggested that zzso may play an important role in response to zzso zzso and it may also be involved in plant defense system against zzso In addition, different expression patterns between tomato fruit and zzso suggested that zzso may play a distinctive role in the defensive system protecting tomato fruit and zzso
