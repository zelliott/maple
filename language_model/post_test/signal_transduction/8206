zzso clocks are required to coordinate metabolism and physiology with daily changes in the zzso Such clocks have several distinctive features, including a zzso rhythm of approximately 24 h and the ability to zzso to both light or temperature cycles zzso We have previously characterized the zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso as being important for robust zzso Here, it is shown that zzso is necessary for at least two core clock zzso zzso to an environmental cycle and rhythm zzso under constant zzso We show that zzso demonstrates clock input defects in light responsiveness and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso could be driven by an environmental cycle, but an increased sensitivity to light means the zzso system of zzso plants does not zzso zzso zzso of putative core clock genes and zzso were characterized in various zzso backgrounds to establish the molecular network of zzso zzso was found to be intimately associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso OF zzso zzso zzso feedback loop because, under free run, zzso is required to regulate the expression of zzso and zzso and, further, zzso is locked in the evening phase of this feedback zzso zzso therefore, can be considered a component of the central zzso feedback loop in the plant zzso zzso
