zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso factor of the zzso family zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice lacking zzso develop systemic zzso resembling systemic lupus zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso zzso and zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso production and inflammation of peripheral zzso As zzso production can occur in a zzso dependent or zzso independent manner, we investigated the role of zzso help during zzso zzso zzso was bred onto zzso zzso ) mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso While zzso zzso mice developed zzso and zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso and kidney pathology, zzso mice failed to develop any such signs of zzso Neither zzso nor zzso mice developed zzso disease, suggesting that zzso interactions on the zzso background are responsible for this zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso transitional zzso zzso previously reported in zzso mice, were intact in zzso mice and largely independent of T zzso In conclusion, T cells are necessary for the development of zzso disease in zzso mice, but not zzso transitional zzso zzso
