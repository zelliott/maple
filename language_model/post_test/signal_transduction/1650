zzso has long been implicated in zzso zzso induction and early development of the zzso however, the results of experiments in mouse and chick zzso to determine its function have proved to be zzso In this study, we determined zzso expression in relation to zzso development in the zzso and used zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein was demonstrated and this resulted in a reduction of zzso size together with reduction in expression of early markers of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in the zzso prior to zzso induction and, zzso when zzso zzso were zzso together with zzso zzso a significant number of zzso failed to form zzso These effects were made manifest at early stages of zzso development by an absence of early zzso markers zzso and zzso but were not accompanied by effects on cell division or zzso The zzso requirement for zzso zzso was established as being between zzso zzso and zzso stages using the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso However, the earliest molecular event in induction of the zzso territory, zzso zzso did not require zzso zzso indicating an zzso event upstream of zzso by zzso and zzso We propose that zzso and zzso are required together for formation of the zzso zzso and act during the earliest stages of its zzso
