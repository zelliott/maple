zzso growth receptors zzso consist of four signaling family zzso Mice with deletions of zzso or zzso are embryonic lethal prior to the onset of kidney zzso To determine roles of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso we used a conditional targeting zzso First, we generated transgenic mice using the zzso promoter to drive zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein expression throughout zzso bud zzso We crossed zzso mice with mice carrying zzso sites zzso critical regions of zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso bud zzso results in no apparent zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice have very zzso zzso bud zzso thin zzso bud zzso and fewer zzso bud zzso zzso zzso bud tips also demonstrate inappropriate regions of zzso and reduced zzso The zzso zzso lineage in zzso mice develops zzso zzso and zzso and only slightly fewer zzso than zzso In contrast, zzso zzso have zzso thickened zzso cortical zzso zzso Ultimately, zzso adult zzso are small and zzso shaped or are zzso Finally, there are no additional abnormalities in the zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso but not zzso appears crucial for zzso bud branching zzso and zzso zzso zzso
