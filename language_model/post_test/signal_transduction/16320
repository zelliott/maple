zzso hormone zzso is widely recognized as a key regulator of mineral zzso zzso Daily intermittent administration of zzso is the only currently available anabolic therapy for bone disorders such as zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso increases zzso and zzso of zzso growth factor 23 zzso another important regulator of zzso zzso and skeletal zzso However, the full relationship between zzso and zzso is largely zzso This study evaluated the effect of zzso signaling on the zzso and anabolic functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso or vehicle daily for a zzso and then zzso zzso injection of zzso successfully reduced the serum zzso levels and reversed the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Bone changes were analyzed in the zzso zzso zzso by peripheral quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment induced substantial increases in bone mineral density zzso and zzso bone volume in each mouse zzso zzso of zzso marker zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was similarly zzso In addition, primary zzso were isolated and treated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso treatment similarly induced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso from each zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso signaling is not essential for the zzso and anabolic functions of zzso suggesting that zzso can function as a therapeutic agent to improve the skeletal quality of patients even in the presence of abnormal serum zzso zzso
