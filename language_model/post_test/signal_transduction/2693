zzso zzso its multiple biological actions by interacting with a family of zzso referred to as zzso To determine the molecular mechanisms of action of zzso we have investigated the interaction of the different cloned receptors with G proteins and cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate with zzso zzso G proteins and are able to mediate the zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso Two forms of zzso zzso and zzso are generated by alternative zzso and differ in their zzso zzso acid zzso zzso couples to zzso zzso whereas zzso does zzso To investigate the basis for the differential zzso to zzso zzso we truncated zzso to the point of zzso acid sequence divergence from zzso The truncated zzso zzso the zzso of zzso formation by zzso indicating that the zzso is not needed for zzso zzso to zzso zzso It is likely that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso alpha 3 and zzso alpha but does not effectively interact with zzso alpha 1, a G protein that is necessary for zzso zzso receptors to zzso zzso The differential association of the zzso zzso with zzso alpha 1 may explain their contrasting effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso also couples to zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 links zzso to zzso zzso and zzso studies have shown that the zzso of zzso alpha 1 is necessary for this zzso The zzso of the zzso alpha proteins differ by only a few zzso acid zzso and only zzso alpha 1 couples zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
