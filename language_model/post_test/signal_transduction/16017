zzso derived factor zzso zzso is a zzso mainly zzso and zzso by pancreatic zzso zzso is proposed to be involved in regulation of zzso function under zzso conditions and impairment of zzso function under pathological zzso zzso zzso is expressed by normal pancreatic zzso and has been implicated in inflammation related pancreatic zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso expression by using zzso pancreatic zzso line zzso and pancreatic zzso We found that zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and protein synthesis in zzso cells and zzso By using calcium zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso isolated from zzso knockout zzso we demonstrated that zzso induced zzso gene expression in zzso through zzso and zzso signaling zzso Our findings suggest a new link between the zzso and immune systems and provide useful information for further investigating the zzso functions of zzso and its involvement in zzso pancreatic zzso
