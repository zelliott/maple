The tissue polarity genes of zzso are required for correct establishment of zzso polarity in zzso structures, which in the eye is shown in the zzso zzso arrangement of zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso in the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso result in the loss of this zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein required for reception and transmission of a polarity zzso Little else is known of the zzso zzso involved other than that zzso acts downstream of zzso We have identified zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and by analysis of their zzso show that zzso is required for the generation of tissue zzso zzso interactions indicate a role for zzso in zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso suggest that zzso zzso are zzso These data are consistent with a zzso zzso cascade analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that proposed for zzso of the serum response factor zzso in zzso zzso
