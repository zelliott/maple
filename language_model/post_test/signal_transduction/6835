zzso formation by zzso bacteria is an important zzso factor in the development of numerous chronic infections, thereby causing a severe health zzso Many of these infections cannot be zzso as bacteria in zzso are resistant to the zzso immune defenses and zzso zzso An urgent need for new strategies to treat zzso infections is critically zzso zzso zzso zzso is a widely zzso zzso signal essential for zzso zzso The absence of this zzso system in higher zzso makes it an attractive target for the development of new zzso zzso In this study, the results of an in zzso zzso screen to identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso are zzso Four small zzso LP zzso LP zzso LP zzso and LP zzso that antagonize these zzso and inhibit zzso formation by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso system are zzso All four molecules dispersed zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso development on urinary zzso One zzso dispersed zzso zzso zzso Two molecules displayed no toxic effects on zzso zzso These molecules represent the first compounds identified from an in zzso screen that are able to inhibit zzso activity to prevent zzso zzso
