Whether the well-known zzso switch zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in the zzso effect of calorie restriction zzso is zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the zzso effect of zzso in skeletal zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice received ad zzso zzso or zzso (8 weeks at zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased the protein level of zzso and zzso of zzso In zzso and zzso mice, zzso induced comparable changes of body weight, fat pad weight, serum zzso serum zzso fatty zzso and serum zzso zzso However, decreasing levels of zzso insulin and fed zzso were observed in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso improvements of zzso insulin sensitivity zzso by zzso tolerance zzso tolerance test zzso and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso were abolished in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso zzso pathway, and induction of zzso zzso cascade were remarkably impaired in zzso zzso zzso serum increased stability of zzso protein via zzso the X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be modulated by zzso in a zzso manner and acts as a chief dictator for the zzso effects of zzso in skeletal zzso
