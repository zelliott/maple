Resistance zzso disease resistance to zzso zzso is zzso by genetically zzso regulatory zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso we compared the expression profiles of approximately 8,000 zzso genes following zzso of three zzso genes directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso choice of zzso zzso zzso and loss of resistance plant zzso allowed us to compare the responses controlled by three genetically distinct resistance zzso signaling zzso We found that all three pathways can zzso leading to zzso of common sets of target zzso At least two zzso patterns of gene zzso are triggered by two of the pathways zzso Many genes defined by their early and transient increases in expression zzso proteins that execute defense zzso while genes exhibiting a sustained or delayed expression increase predominantly zzso putative signaling zzso Previously defined and novel sequence motifs were found to be enriched in the promoters of genes zzso by the local zzso zzso These putative promoter elements may operate downstream from signal convergence zzso
