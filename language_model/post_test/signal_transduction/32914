zzso zzso zzso a tumor necrosis factor zzso family member, plays a critical role in zzso T cell responses in zzso zzso expressed on activated zzso T cells stimulates zzso cells such as zzso cells, resulting in the zzso of zzso molecules and the production of various inflammatory zzso required for zzso T cell zzso in zzso However, zzso or zzso mice challenged with viruses mount protective zzso T cell responses that produce normal levels of zzso zzso suggesting a zzso mechanism of zzso T cell zzso that to date has not been zzso Here we show that zzso T cell responses to viral infection were greatly diminished in zzso mice by administration of a soluble form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the function of another zzso family member, zzso Thus, the zzso interaction provides zzso required for efficient zzso T cell zzso during viral infection in the absence of zzso These results also indicate that not even the potent inflammatory zzso induced by viral infections is sufficient to elicit efficient zzso T cell zzso without proper zzso provided by the zzso family zzso or zzso Moreover, the data suggest that zzso may be a novel and important target for immune zzso
