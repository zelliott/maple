zzso is a negative regulator of B cell zzso an activity modulated by its interaction with zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso B cells deficient in the zzso zzso I) that forms the zzso zzso show suppressed zzso zzso Here we report that mice deficient in both zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso showed restored B cell zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the suppressed signaling of zzso cells is zzso through zzso zzso with suppressed zzso zzso B cells lacking zzso I showed a net zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso containing most of the zzso resulting in a twofold increase in the zzso of zzso together with the zzso These studies suggest an important function for the zzso interaction in regulating zzso signaling and zzso zzso
