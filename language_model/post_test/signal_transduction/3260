The expression of zzso and zzso domain containing 1 zzso is zzso during liver zzso however, the function and underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso action remain to be zzso This study zzso zzso rat liver cells for zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis were used to detect zzso and protein expression levels, zzso A zzso incorporation zzso was performed to assess changes in cell proliferation zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to assess the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on calcium zzso influx into zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso The data showed that zzso treatment induced proliferation of rat zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso knocked down zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, compared to the negative control, zzso zzso zzso cells were highly zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso expression zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso into rat liver cells was also affected after zzso zzso The data from the current study demonstrate that zzso plays a negative role in zzso zzso zzso and indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso may mediate the function of zzso in zzso
