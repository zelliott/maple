zzso studies of zzso networks yield deeper insight into zzso functionality and capabilities of the zzso of different zzso Here, we address the analysis of potential failure modes in zzso networks whose occurrence will render the network structurally incapable of performing certain zzso Such studies will help to identify crucial parts in the network structure and to find suitable targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We introduce the concept of minimal cut sets for zzso zzso A minimal cut set zzso is a minimal zzso set of reactions in the network whose zzso will definitely lead to a failure in certain network zzso We present an zzso which enables the zzso of the zzso in a given network related to zzso objective zzso This zzso operates on elementary zzso A number of potential applications are zzso including network zzso zzso predictions, assessing structural zzso and zzso zzso flux analysis and target identification in drug zzso zzso are illustrated by the zzso in the central metabolism of zzso coli for growth on different zzso 

zzso and analysis of zzso is an additional feature of the zzso zzso available for academic users upon request, special contracts for industrial zzso see web page zzso
