zzso factor 1 zzso a pivotal zzso factor composed of zzso and zzso zzso plays a major role in tumor progression by zzso a number of genes critically involved in adaptation to zzso zzso is also induced by several zzso zzso zzso an environmental toxic metal, is considered as a potent zzso of tumors in animals and is reported to activate zzso zzso However, the involved mechanisms are poorly zzso In the present study, we have examined the zzso mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells by primarily focusing on the role of zzso protein zzso zzso which plays an essential role as an energy sensor under zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso was rapidly activated in response to zzso in zzso human prostate zzso and that its zzso preceded zzso zzso Under this condition, zzso of zzso by a pharmacological and molecular approach dramatically abolished the zzso zzso expression as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso signaling was also involved in zzso zzso zzso but it was independent of zzso signaling zzso Moreover, we demonstrate a role of zzso oxygen species as an upstream signal for these two zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel and critical component of zzso regulation, further zzso its involvement in zzso zzso
