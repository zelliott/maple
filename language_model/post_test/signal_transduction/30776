zzso zzso and their downstream zzso regulate changes in the zzso zzso that zzso cell zzso and zzso They also participate, with zzso in the regulation of gene zzso by zzso serum response factor zzso zzso from the serum response element zzso zzso zzso is also promoted by several proteins that regulate the zzso or stability of zzso We have previously identified a family of zzso zzso zzso which can zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso and zzso zzso zzso We now report that zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso zzso This interaction is enhanced when zzso is activated by zzso The binding of zzso to zzso or to an zzso complex greatly decreases the ability of zzso to activate zzso from the zzso We propose that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso serves to regulate both the zzso zzso and zzso transcription, and to link the zzso pathways with those of zzso
