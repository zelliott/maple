zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso primary zzso lymphoma, and zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein zzso by the open reading frame zzso of zzso is a member of the basic zzso zzso family of zzso zzso We studied the mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso by investigating whether zzso zzso signaling through transforming growth factor beta zzso which zzso proliferation of a wide range of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and antagonized the zzso effects of zzso Since both zzso and zzso are known to interact with zzso protein zzso the effect of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso zzso which lacked the zzso site, could not repress zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso restored zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Competitive interaction studies showed that zzso inhibited the interaction of zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso through its binding to zzso zzso zzso signaling by interfering with the recruitment of zzso into zzso initiation complexes on zzso zzso We propose a possibility that zzso may contribute to zzso through its ability to promote cell survival by zzso zzso zzso
