The zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is one of the most potent zzso signaling zzso that is zzso activated in a variety of human zzso Recent evidence demonstrates that pathological zzso of zzso also frequently occurs in zzso and zzso with poor zzso Thus, therapeutic targeting of zzso may present a promising approach for the design of molecular targeted therapies in zzso Several strategies have in recent years been developed to interfere with distinct components of zzso signaling at different levels of the zzso It will be subject to future studies to evaluate which of these compounds are most suitable for the treatment of zzso Eventually, zzso targeting agents may open novel perspectives to improve the poor prognosis of patients with zzso especially in advanced stages of the zzso
