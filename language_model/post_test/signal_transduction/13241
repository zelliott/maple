The zzso growth factor I zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell zzso cell survival, cell zzso and cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso are known to mediate zzso signaling pathways such as those of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are believed to play important roles in some of the zzso biological zzso We used the zzso domain of zzso in a zzso zzso interaction trap to identify zzso molecules that may potentially mediate zzso zzso We identified zzso a zzso repeat family member and a zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso interacts with the zzso but not with the closely related insulin zzso zzso In several types of zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso C, and zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas most of zzso resides in the zzso compartment of the zzso transformation of zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso resulted in a significantly increased association of zzso with the zzso We examined the role of zzso in zzso functions by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells that expressed an elevated level of zzso zzso zzso resulted in reduced zzso cell growth in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso also led to enhanced cell zzso increased stress zzso and increased focal zzso which were accompanied by increased zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and association of zzso with zzso were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso In zzso cells, delayed cell cycle progression in zzso or zzso was correlated with zzso protein zzso increased levels of zzso and zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso protein expression by zzso zzso prevented cell spreading and suppressed zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a novel zzso signaling zzso that functions as a positive zzso of cell spreading and contact with zzso zzso possibly through a novel zzso signaling zzso involving zzso and focal zzso signaling zzso
