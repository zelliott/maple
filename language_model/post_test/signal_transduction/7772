The median zzso nucleus zzso in the zzso zzso receives a prominent zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso The present investigation used whole cell zzso recordings in rat brain slice preparations to evaluate the hypothesis that zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Bath applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a prolonged and zzso suppression of zzso zzso currents zzso and reduced zzso depression evoked by stimulation in the zzso organ and zzso zzso zzso zzso These events were not correlated with any observed changes in membrane zzso arising from zzso activity at zzso zzso or zzso zzso with a role for zzso zzso responses were selectively zzso by an zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were without effect on these evoked zzso zzso was noted to increase (via zzso or decrease (via zzso the frequency of spontaneous and zzso miniature zzso zzso these observations imply that both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are capable of selective zzso of rapid zzso zzso zzso synaptic transmission along the zzso zzso and therefore likely to exert a prominent influence in regulating cell zzso within the zzso
