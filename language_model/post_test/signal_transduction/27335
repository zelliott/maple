zzso on filed exposure effects of zzso electric and magnetic fields zzso on biological systems have shown that, in many cases, the zzso status is of fundamental importance for an effective zzso For example, studies of calcium zzso regulation in cells of the immune system, particularly in T zzso have revealed that, depending on the degree of cellular zzso either zzso zzso or no field exposure effects are observed for identical field zzso A brief summary of the experimental findings is given, and a theoretical approach is presented that accounts in a qualitative manner for zzso exposure effects 1) that depend on the degree of cellular zzso and 2) that exhibit a zzso response behavior zzso zzso In the model, zzso stimulation of the cell results in zzso of specific signaling pathways that regulate calcium dynamics in the cell zzso release from zzso calcium stores and zzso calcium zzso We assume that, controlled by these zzso a specific zzso zzso system becomes zzso The activated zzso in turn, exhibits a feedback control on the signal zzso thus leading to a zzso of calcium zzso This zzso may affect other cellular processes that are calcium dependent zzso DNA zzso zzso field exposure is assumed to alter the zzso of a specific step within the zzso cycle in zzso with the zzso zzso although the zzso is not restricted to this specific zzso zzso show that inclusion of cooperative steps within the zzso cycle provides a theoretical basis that enables a simple description of a zzso response behavior to zzso zzso
