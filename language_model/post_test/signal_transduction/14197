zzso are abundant, short-lived zzso that play a key role in the immune defense against microbial zzso These cells die by zzso following zzso and zzso of microbes and will also enter zzso spontaneously at the end of their lifespan if they do not encounter a zzso zzso exerts zzso effects on zzso zzso functions, but whether this abundant zzso influences zzso zzso is zzso Here we report that zzso in the zzso range zzso reduced zzso in resting zzso decreasing zzso zzso and maintaining zzso expression by stabilizing this zzso zzso We show that zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso the zzso effects of zzso and treatment of zzso with an zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso respectively decreased and increased zzso Finally, zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso also decreased zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso a process involved in the early stages of spontaneous zzso giving another possible mechanism downstream of zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso
