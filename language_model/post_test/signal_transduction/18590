zzso is a zzso isolated from zzso zzso and is known to affect multiple biological functions, including the zzso of zzso zzso zzso infection, and zzso oxide producing zzso zzso stress is considered a major cause of aging and various age-related diseases, and among the key cellular components exquisitely sensitive to zzso stress is the zzso factor, nuclear zzso zzso In the present study, we attempted to zzso the mechanisms underlying the suppression of age-related zzso zzso by zzso in kidney tissue from old zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso with zzso In contrast, the increased expression of these zzso targeting genes was effectively inhibited by zzso zzso was shown to inhibit the zzso cascade via three signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Our results clearly indicated the zzso effects of zzso on age-related zzso zzso Thus, the significance of the current study is the new information revealing the zzso properties of zzso and the role it plays in the regulation of age-related zzso
