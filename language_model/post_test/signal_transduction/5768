Studies in zzso tissue and skeletal muscle suggest that impaired insulin action is due to defects in the insulin signaling zzso and may play a role in the zzso of insulin resistance associated with zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso The present study tested the hypothesis that zzso expression levels in the human term zzso of insulin signaling components are altered in zzso tissue from zzso women in comparison with normal controls and maternal zzso 

zzso tissue was collected from normal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both non-obese and obese women zzso per zzso Western zzso and quantitative zzso was performed to determine the level of expression in the insulin signaling zzso 

There was a significant increase in insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression with a concurrent decrease in zzso protein expression in non-obese women with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and normal zzso Furthermore, a decrease in both protein and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed in non-obese and obese women with insulin controlled zzso compared with normal zzso When comparing non-obese to obese patients, significant decreases in zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found in obese zzso 

Our results suggest that post zzso defects are present in the insulin signaling zzso in zzso of women with zzso complicated by diabetes and zzso In addition, expression studies demonstrate post zzso zzso in insulin signaling possibly under selective maternal regulation and not fetal zzso
