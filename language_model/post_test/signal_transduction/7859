Human skin zzso efficiently zzso the zzso zzso by zzso zzso however, very little is known about its zzso trafficking routes up to zzso zzso In an in zzso system measuring zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso when zzso zzso was inhibited using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling caused zzso reduction of zzso zzso whereas zzso of the zzso zzso had no zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we determined that only about zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso Thus, zzso depends on zzso signaling rather than trafficking along the same zzso zzso passes through early zzso towards trafficking to zzso since more than 50% of zzso zzso with zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso fusion by zzso caused a profound zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which has previously been shown to zzso zzso degradation blocked the degradation of zzso zzso depletion by zzso inhibited zzso of zzso by zzso however, nearly no zzso zzso was found between zzso and zzso The combined use of zzso and zzso had an additive zzso effect on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso diverted zzso from the zzso zzso to an alternative zzso zzso The zzso zzso was excluded as an zzso route for zzso Our observations indicate that zzso is taken up by more than one zzso zzso Of note, zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a potential feedback regulation mechanism for zzso of signaling events zzso by zzso
