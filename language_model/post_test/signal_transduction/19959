The genetic basis for bipolar disorder zzso is complex with the involvement of multiple zzso As it is well established that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates behavior, we tested zzso in 29 genes that zzso components of this signaling zzso for associations with zzso type I zzso I) and zzso type II zzso zzso A total of zzso individuals with zzso I, 516 individuals with zzso II and zzso controls were zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interactions were examined for association with zzso Several statistically significant zzso associations were observed between zzso I and zzso in the zzso gene and between zzso II and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis supported the conclusion that variation in these genes is associated with zzso We zzso zzso association with zzso I by sequencing a zzso region in 30 subjects zzso for seven minor zzso risk zzso and discovered eight additional rare zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso These zzso zzso were zzso in 999 zzso cases and 801 zzso We obtained a significant association for these zzso in the combined sample using multiple methods for rare zzso zzso After using newly developed methods to account for potential bias from sequencing zzso cases only, the results remained zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso interaction studies suggested that zzso in several zzso signaling zzso genes interact to increase the risk of zzso This report is among the first to use multiple rare zzso analysis methods following common zzso associations with zzso
