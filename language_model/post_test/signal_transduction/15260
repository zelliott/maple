Although frequently expressed in zzso virus zzso zzso the role that zzso membrane protein 2A and zzso zzso and zzso have in the zzso process remains zzso Here we show a novel function for these proteins in zzso cells, zzso their ability to zzso zzso from type zzso zzso receptors zzso We show that zzso and zzso zzso cells show decreased responsiveness to zzso zzso and zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso response element and zzso factor sequence elements and zzso reporter zzso zzso profiling highlighted the extent of this zzso with both viral proteins zzso zzso on zzso gene zzso Although not affecting the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso accelerated the turnover of zzso through processes requiring zzso zzso This function may form part of zzso strategy to limit zzso responses and define a novel function for zzso and zzso in modulating zzso from receptors that participate in innate immune zzso
