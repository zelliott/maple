zzso zzso zzso which was formerly known as zzso zzso II, is a highly zzso protein zzso zzso implicated in the control of cell proliferation through its zzso of regulatory nuclear zzso The zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso that zzso the activity of the zzso zzso These zzso are arranged in zzso zzso alpha 2 beta 2 or zzso 2 beta 2) or zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 2) zzso We previously demonstrated using the zzso zzso system that alpha (or zzso zzso can interact with beta zzso but not other alpha (or zzso zzso By comparison, beta zzso can interact with alpha (or zzso and with beta zzso suggesting that the protein zzso zzso zzso forms because of the ability of beta zzso to zzso bringing two zzso zzso beta or zzso zzso into a zzso zzso In the present study, we used the zzso zzso system to examine the zzso of interactions between the alpha and beta zzso of protein zzso zzso These studies indicate that the ability of beta to interact with alpha resides within the zzso domain of zzso By comparison, our studies suggest that individual zzso of alpha are not sufficient for interactions with zzso
