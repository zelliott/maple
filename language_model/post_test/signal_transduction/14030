zzso zzso zzso zzso stress has been proposed as an important zzso in the development of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and is zzso to the zzso The aim of the study was to determine the mechanisms involved in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso whole body knockout and zzso mice were subjected to a high-fat or normal zzso for 20 zzso zzso diet feeding induced body weight gain, increased zzso systemic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso fed zzso knockout mice also exhibited improved zzso zzso measured using zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso in the skeletal muscle zzso compared to their zzso control mice which received similar zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly attenuated in the zzso knockout zzso Mice lacking zzso showed decreased expression of the zzso related protein zzso and the unfolded protein response zzso protein zzso zzso region of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso leading to the zzso of protein expression of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso production activated nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and was required for zzso zzso expression of zzso Our data suggest that zzso is induced by zzso stress via the zzso of the zzso axis which is causes unfolded protein response and mediates insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle under obese zzso
