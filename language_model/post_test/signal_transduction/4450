The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso ) belongs to family B of zzso and is activated upon binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distributed throughout body, zzso plays important regulatory roles in human physiology and zzso Like most members of the zzso family, zzso zzso is predicted to follow the actual paradigm of a common zzso model of natural zzso zzso However the precise structural basis for zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso are still incompletely understood due in part to the absence of X-ray crystal structure of the whole zzso and to significant structural differences with the most extensively studied family of zzso the zzso zzso Here, we try to zzso the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso This includes search for zzso acids involved in the zzso process of zzso zzso in the stabilization of zzso inactive and active zzso and in binding and zzso of G zzso
