The zzso virus zzso proteins zzso membrane proteins 1 and 2 zzso and zzso are frequently expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and have complex effects on cell signaling and zzso The effects of these proteins on zzso cell growth were assessed in zzso using transgenic mice driven by the zzso 14 promoter zzso The development of zzso and zzso was determined in the tumor zzso and promoter model using zzso zzso zzso followed by repeated treatments of zzso zzso zzso zzso In these zzso zzso functioned as a weak tumor promoter and increased zzso zzso In contrast, mice expressing zzso did not induce or promote zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had slightly increased development of zzso cell zzso however, the development of zzso was significantly increased in the doubly transgenic mice expressing both zzso and zzso zzso treatment zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and this zzso was identified in most zzso and zzso although several zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso mice lacked the zzso Analysis of signaling pathways that are known to be activated by zzso and/or zzso indicated that all zzso had high levels of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with significantly higher zzso in the doubly transgenic zzso These findings suggest that, in zzso zzso and zzso contribute to zzso progression and that this may reflect the combined effects of the proteins on zzso of multiple signaling zzso This study is the first to characterize the effects of zzso on tumor initiation and promotion and to identify an effect of the combined expression of zzso and zzso on the increase of zzso zzso
