zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso promotes a differentiated zzso characterized by increased expression of zzso zzso Recent studies show that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso The serum response factor zzso complex binds to zzso sequences to activate zzso transcription, but no other regulators are known in zzso Using zzso zzso we found zzso induced following expression of a zzso active zzso zzso domain zzso We hypothesized that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling decreased steady state levels of zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso induction of zzso is zzso independent, although full acquisition of zzso markers requires zzso Using zzso promoter reporter zzso we show zzso increases promoter activity, and this is dependent on intact zzso consensus sites within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso complexes bind to zzso sites in the zzso zzso We also identified zzso complex binding to zzso sites within the zzso human zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso signaling requires induction of both zzso and zzso to promote the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso target of zzso signaling in zzso We propose zzso as activated independently by zzso and zzso in parallel zzso Multiple pathways zzso on zzso provides potential for zzso or amplification of zzso differentiation zzso
