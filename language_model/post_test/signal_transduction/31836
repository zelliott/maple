zzso a zzso compound, has been shown to exert zzso actions on human breast cancer cell lines and to have zzso zzso Nevertheless, there is currently no study addressing the effects of zzso on the induction of zzso in zzso human leukemia zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso effects and molecular mechanisms of zzso on zzso leukemia zzso We showed that zzso can zzso induce programmed cell death in zzso leukemia cell growth as well as zzso changes that were examined by zzso zzso and phase contrast zzso zzso The DNA content and the levels of zzso membrane potential zzso were determined by flow zzso zzso The cell cycle zzso and zzso protein levels were measured by western zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a decrease of the level of zzso and the percentage of viability and provoked zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of the protein level for zzso with the simultaneous zzso of zzso and -9 protein expression in zzso cells were observed after treatment with zzso zzso our data provide a potential mechanism for the zzso activity of zzso and we suggest that zzso may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of human zzso
