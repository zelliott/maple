Vitamin A is necessary for kidney development and has also been linked to regulation of zzso and water zzso and to protection against kidney stone disease, infection, zzso and zzso Most functions of vitamin A are zzso by its main active form, zzso zzso acid zzso which binds zzso acid receptors zzso to zzso gene zzso We and others have recently reported that zzso zzso activity is confined to the zzso bud zzso and collecting duct zzso cell zzso suggesting that zzso zzso primarily act through regulating gene expression in these cells in embryonic and adult zzso zzso 

To explore target genes of zzso zzso we employed the zzso mouse inner zzso CD cell line, which is a model of CD principal cells and exhibits zzso zzso activity as CD principal cells do in zzso Combining antagonism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso and gene expression profiling techniques, we have identified 125 genes as candidate targets and validated 20 genes that were highly regulated zzso zzso and zzso were the top zzso zzso zzso were more important in zzso rather than zzso zzso gene zzso Although many identified genes were expressed in zzso and/or CDs, their exact functions in this cell lineage are still poorly zzso Nevertheless, gene zzso analysis suggests that these genes are involved in kidney development, zzso zzso and regulation of zzso zzso 

A rigorous approach to defining target genes for zzso zzso has been zzso At the zzso level, genes regulated by zzso zzso in a CD cell line have been zzso for the first zzso Such a zzso will guide further studies on molecular zzso of zzso zzso during kidney development and in relation to zzso defects associated with vitamin A zzso
