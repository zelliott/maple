We have demonstrated previously that a combination of signals from the neural tube and the floor zzso complex zzso induce the expression of zzso zzso genes and zzso differentiation markers in unspecified zzso In this study we demonstrate that Sonic zzso zzso which is expressed in the floor zzso and a subset of zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in zzso regions of the neural tube, mimic the muscle inducing activity of these zzso In zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso are sufficient to induce zzso in zzso tissue in zzso zzso we propose that zzso formation in zzso may be directed by the zzso activity of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso plate and zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso neural zzso
