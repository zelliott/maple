zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso releases an zzso zzso called zzso small zzso zzso and a short zzso zzso domain that may provide a zzso signal analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso on the cell surface, but the cellular zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso We now show that in zzso cultured cells, the plasma membrane zzso protein zzso zzso when expressed as a full-length zzso zzso the zzso apparatus and blocks zzso traffic and zzso In contrast, truncated zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso but has no apparent effect on zzso traffic or zzso structure, whereas further truncated zzso zzso and zzso have no effect on either zzso or zzso zzso Using these zzso zzso fragments, we demonstrated that blocking zzso traffic greatly zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso whereas blocking zzso alone does not affect either process, even though zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is zzso Our data suggest that, different from zzso zzso of zzso is independent of cell surface regulation by zzso zzso but may be controlled by zzso zzso
