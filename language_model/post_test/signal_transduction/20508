zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which regulates their expression levels, membrane zzso and zzso zzso The selective zzso of individual zzso zzso from zzso ensures appropriate responses to cellular signals, but the underlying mechanisms are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso to yield zzso acid, selectively zzso zzso by stimulating zzso zzso of zzso on zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso on zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso selectively releases zzso Here we show zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were decreased in zzso zzso and rescued by zzso zzso or a zzso inactive zzso zzso bound directly to the zzso of zzso and the regulatory arm of zzso and was required for efficient interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso had condensed zzso zzso and altered focal zzso distribution, indicative of zzso zzso zzso Two targets of the zzso zzso ROCK showed reduced zzso in zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest zzso functions as a scaffold to assemble a signaling complex that functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso As a regulator of zzso and zzso activity, zzso is a critical factor linking changes in zzso signaling to zzso zzso
