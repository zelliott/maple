The current model for liver zzso suggests that cell damage triggers zzso zzso zzso signaling via zzso leading to the induction of nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso of inflammatory zzso that in turn prime liver zzso zzso is unique among zzso in that it signals through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not through zzso and may lead to zzso of either the inflammatory or zzso zzso The inflammatory zzso leads to zzso zzso whereas the zzso pathway, believed to be zzso by zzso leads to zzso zzso In this study, we explored the role of zzso in liver zzso by comparing the response to zzso partial zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We found that following partial zzso zzso mice demonstrated earlier zzso zzso Furthermore, within the first hours, we observed a dramatic zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso levels in zzso accompanied by zzso zzso but without an zzso zzso 

zzso plays an zzso role in the zzso of liver zzso thus reinforcing the role of the innate immune system in balancing tissue zzso
