zzso is highly resistant to radiation zzso The underlying molecular mechanism is not completely zzso The DNA damage response zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso of zzso zzso Growing evidence has demonstrated that radiation zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, how radiation zzso specific zzso and how they might regulate the zzso remain zzso In our study, we found that radiation induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 222 modulated zzso expression to affect DNA damage repair by zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso down of zzso significantly increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso treatment may overcome zzso induced zzso zzso combined zzso and zzso has remarkably inhibited tumor growth compared with zzso or zzso alone in a subcutaneous mouse zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso which mediates DNA damage repair of zzso cells independent of zzso These data indicate for the first time that zzso play an important role in zzso zzso DNA damage repair and that zzso could serve as potential therapeutic targets for increasing zzso of zzso zzso
