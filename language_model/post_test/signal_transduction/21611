During animal development, zzso zzso signaling is required for the patterning of multiple zzso While insufficient signal zzso is zzso to normal development, zzso zzso of the zzso can be just as zzso Thus, numerous controls exist to precisely regulate zzso signaling zzso zzso trafficking of zzso components has recently been proposed as one such control zzso Here, we characterize the zzso trafficking of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso and investigate whether trafficking is important to regulate zzso signaling during zzso patterning of the zzso zzso We demonstrate a role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso through the zzso zzso to the zzso where they are zzso in a zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso signaling is not attenuated by zzso targeting in the wing zzso Rather, we suggest that signaling is dampened zzso at an earlier trafficking zzso This is in contrast to patterning of the embryonic zzso where zzso targeting is required to restrict the range of zzso zzso Thus, signal zzso by zzso zzso will depend on the tissue to be patterned and the goals during that patterning zzso
