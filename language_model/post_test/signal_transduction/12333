The intent of this study was to determine whether aging affects signaling pathways involved in zzso zzso in response to a single bout of zzso zzso Acute stimulation (1 zzso 5 zzso of the zzso anterior zzso resulted in a greater rate of fatigue in old zzso zzso compared to young (6 zzso zzso rats, which was associated with reduced zzso synthesis and a lower zzso zzso To investigate fiber zzso zzso the zzso was zzso into red zzso and white zzso portions, possessing two- to zzso differences in zzso zzso The expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso protein expression tended to be higher in fiber sections with lower zzso content, such as the zzso relative to the zzso muscle, and this was exaggerated in zzso from zzso compared to young zzso At rest, zzso zzso was generally similar between young and old animals, despite the age-related variations in zzso zzso In response to zzso activity, age did not influence the signaling of these zzso in the zzso zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso was attenuated in old animals, despite the greater zzso stress imposed by zzso activity in this zzso Thus, the reduction of zzso zzso zzso in muscle from old animals is fiber zzso and depends on factors which are, in part, independent of the zzso milieu within the contracting zzso These findings imply that the downstream consequences of zzso signaling are reduced in aging zzso
