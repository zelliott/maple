The zzso brain is plastic in the sense that it shows a remarkable capacity for change throughout zzso The contribution of zzso activity to brain plasticity was first recognized in relation to critical periods of development, when manipulating the sensory environment was found to profoundly affect zzso zzso and receptive field zzso Since then, a growing body of evidence has established that brain plasticity extends beyond development and is an inherent feature of adult brain function, spanning multiple zzso from learning and memory to zzso of primary sensory zzso Here we discuss evolution of the current view that plasticity of the adult brain derives from dynamic tuning of zzso control mechanisms at the zzso level, in response to external and internal zzso We then review the identification of zzso zzso regulated by changes in the levels of electrical activity, and how zzso their cellular functions has revealed the intimate role zzso regulation plays in fundamental aspects of synaptic transmission and circuit plasticity that occur in the brain on an every day zzso
