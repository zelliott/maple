To investigate the role of zzso cell interactions in the auditory zzso we asked whether spiral zzso zzso zzso express zzso and whether zzso regulates proliferation and/or zzso expression in spiral zzso zzso cells zzso Using zzso we found that type I and type II zzso express zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso express the zzso receptors zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso in cultured zzso evidenced by increased zzso zzso of the receptors following zzso zzso zzso treatment increased the proliferation rate of cultured zzso by zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso also increased zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso and zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso protein zzso signaling but not by zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso we found that cultured zzso express zzso including zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso contribute to the zzso support of zzso Treatment with neither zzso nor zzso increased zzso expression in cultured zzso as had been observed in developing sympathetic zzso but appeared to zzso regulate zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may mediate zzso zzso interactions in the auditory zzso
