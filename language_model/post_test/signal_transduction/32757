In the fetus and zzso zzso stimulation fails to produce zzso zzso The current study explores the mechanisms underlying the response pattern in zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso caused by zzso treatment in zzso was zzso in adult rats by the immediate zzso and specific loss of the ability of zzso but not zzso to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was absent when the same treatment was given to zzso By 12 h zzso the adults showed zzso zzso zzso of the response to zzso an effect which was once again absent in the immature zzso The absence of zzso in zzso did not reflect a zzso in the activity or zzso distribution of beta zzso the zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso showed relatively poor zzso zzso as assessed by the zzso shift in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of adult rats led to zzso of zzso zzso but the same treatment in zzso enhanced zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso with the zzso rise in zzso zzso These results indicate that the maintenance of zzso responses in the face of zzso zzso stimulation does not reflect simply an absence of the ability to elicit zzso or zzso zzso but rather represents an active regulatory mechanism in which neural input exerts a positive zzso role at the level of zzso zzso
