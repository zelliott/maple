Little is known about vascular zzso regulation in response to mechanical zzso Whether zzso pathways are altered in hypertension is zzso We examined effects of stretch and zzso II on zzso of zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from zzso and zzso The role of zzso and zzso pathways in zzso effects were zzso zzso from zzso arteries were zzso onto flexible zzso plates and exposed to acute or chronic zzso stretch zzso 1 zzso with or without zzso II zzso zzso Acute stretch zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso independently of zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso since zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to alter zzso zzso zzso stretch blunted zzso zzso in zzso and increased zzso in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso II, induced an increase in zzso zzso This was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso is a zzso zzso zzso regulated by acute and chronic stretch in zzso and zzso zzso stretch and zzso II, amplify zzso responses in a zzso manner, responses that are zzso in zzso Such molecular process may influence vascular zzso in hypertension and appear to be independent of zzso and zzso
