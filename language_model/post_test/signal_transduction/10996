The differentiation of zzso T cells to zzso T cells is regulated by a variety of zzso The recent advance of the contribution of zzso signaling in this differentiation step has provided a new path to better understand the acquisition or persistence of zzso function of mature T zzso In this review, we zzso emerging and, in some points, conflicting evidence for zzso signaling on mature T cell zzso and zzso
