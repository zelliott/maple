zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are two closely related zzso which can activate protein zzso A zzso At least three receptors for zzso and zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a higher affinity for zzso than zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso have similar affinities for zzso and zzso Both zzso and their zzso receptors are highly expressed in the brain, including the zzso Recently, their roles in the regulation of synaptic transmission have begun to zzso zzso can signal through different pathways to regulate zzso zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increases evoked zzso currents via the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso stimulates a zzso signaling zzso to enhance zzso zzso function in zzso zzso Furthermore, different zzso of zzso induce different effects on the both zzso zzso current and zzso synaptic transmission by zzso different zzso Their roles in learning and memory are also demonstrated using transgenic mice and pharmacological zzso
