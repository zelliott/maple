The role of zzso in signaling by the zzso growth factor zzso zzso was studied and compared with zzso We demonstrate in zzso that zzso like zzso is zzso and recruited to the zzso upon zzso stimulation and both zzso proteins can bind to the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the functional role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso we zzso zzso or zzso into zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso This cell line is absolutely dependent on zzso zzso or zzso for sustained zzso zzso cells zzso zzso showed markedly inhibited growth in zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso This growth zzso by zzso was the result of a dramatic increase in the number of cells undergoing zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso markedly decreased the zzso and duration of zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation compared to either zzso controls or zzso zzso zzso In addition, the duration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cells zzso zzso is zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso cell growth and that zzso and zzso have distinct roles in zzso zzso zzso
