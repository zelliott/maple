Severe zzso is one of the leading causes of death zzso High mortality rates in zzso are frequently associated with zzso Despite the central role of zzso in innate zzso the mechanisms causing zzso during zzso remain zzso Here, we show that zzso is caused in part by zzso and is sustained by a block of zzso stem cell zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso model, we found that the human opportunistic bacterial pathogen zzso zzso caused zzso depletion and expansion of the zzso pool in the bone zzso zzso zzso were significantly impaired in competitive zzso zzso and defective in generating common zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in lower rates of zzso differentiation in zzso and in zzso Delayed zzso differentiation was further mapped using a zzso fluorescent protein zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient to induce zzso and required intact zzso zzso Our results establish a previously zzso link between zzso regulation and host response in severe zzso and demonstrate a novel role for zzso
