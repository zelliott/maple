We used a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso as a model system to investigate the likelihood that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may participate in the regulation of specific gene expression in zzso zzso Analysis by reverse zzso amplification revealed the presence in these cells of type I zzso zzso with a short zzso together with a heavier so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner, both zzso zzso formation and zzso breakdown, with zzso values of, respectively, zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso These zzso in addition, also elevated zzso by zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso less potent in stimulating zzso zzso (with zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and failed to change the turnover of zzso and to alter zzso Both forms of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters fused to a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity linked to both zzso and zzso promoters was obliterated upon zzso of a dominant zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso We conclude that zzso cells do express functional zzso type I zzso the zzso of which zzso on zzso and zzso zzso according to a process that is primarily dependent on the zzso zzso zzso
