The expression of the zzso cell zzso zzso is confined to the early stage of B cell development, and its zzso is associated with anomalies of zzso cells, including zzso Previous studies suggested that the zzso signal might trigger the autonomous termination of zzso expression even before the zzso of zzso gene expression to prevent sustained zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism remains ill zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso signal zzso the expression of zzso protein zzso 5 zzso which leads to the prompt zzso of the zzso While zzso induction had no significant impact on the zzso of cell surface zzso it zzso the zzso of a large pool of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso compartment zzso with a drastic reduction of the level of zzso zzso zzso This reduction was inhibited by zzso zzso indicating the zzso degradation of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso cells led to the zzso expression level of surface zzso zzso the zzso zzso the prompt zzso of its own expression through the induction of zzso which promotes the zzso transport and degradation of the zzso zzso pool and, zzso limits the supply of zzso to the cell zzso
