zzso and zzso are validated pathways for targeted therapy in zzso cell lung cancer zzso Once considered to be separate targets, zzso and zzso are now shown to have interconnected downstream zzso zzso the effectiveness of their dual signaling zzso in cancer zzso zzso such as zzso that inhibit zzso and zzso have also been reported to inhibit other zzso including zzso and additional zzso and may be beneficial in treating patients with solid zzso 

This review covers the significance of targeting zzso and zzso in the treatment of zzso and the rationale behind their dual zzso Clinical trials that evaluate the use of zzso in the setting of zzso zzso are also zzso 

zzso is currently not approved in the setting of zzso However, its approval for zzso zzso cancer makes it promising for identifying markers and potentially a zzso patient population who will benefit from the zzso
