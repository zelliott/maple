zzso a major feature of zzso is a common cause of acute lung injury and zzso rapid zzso of zzso in the lung zzso zzso mechanisms that zzso this zzso remain zzso as current experimental models of zzso are less suitable for targeted zzso of the zzso Toward zzso this, we used the isolated zzso rat lung zzso With a zzso inserted through a left zzso zzso we cleared blood cells from a small lung region and then infused zzso zzso into zzso After a zzso wash to remove residual zzso we infused zzso zzso zzso and zzso their transit through the treated zzso Image analysis revealed that zzso infused 90 zzso after zzso treatment were retained more in treated zzso and zzso than zzso zzso Further, zzso with either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso blunted zzso zzso retention in both zzso zzso In addition, retention of zzso treated ex zzso with zzso in zzso zzso was higher compared to retention of zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso expression at 90 zzso post zzso zzso zzso inhibited this zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso increased zzso retention in both zzso and zzso and this response was zzso by the increased expression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso mechanisms may themselves play a major role in zzso zzso retention in lung zzso zzso the zzso responses may mitigate zzso zzso
