zzso containing a zzso recruitment domain zzso play pivotal roles in signal zzso leading to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Here we identify and characterize human and mouse zzso protein 6 zzso zzso proteins of unique zzso zzso associates with zzso and interacts with zzso protein zzso interacting zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso a zzso member of the zzso family of protein zzso These zzso are involved in multiple zzso signaling pathways important for innate and zzso immune zzso Surprisingly, the zzso of zzso and zzso were not required for their zzso instead, zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso controls the association of these zzso zzso also binds to zzso a zzso zzso zzso that lacks a zzso but contains a zzso death zzso zzso of zzso targets zzso to zzso via a mechanism that requires the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression has a synergistic effect on zzso zzso induced by several independent signal zzso zzso In zzso our results indicate that zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso that zzso the functions of zzso zzso family zzso
