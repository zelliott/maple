Ras zzso are present in approximately 50% of human zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso of a zzso rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso cell zzso zzso the constantly active Ras signaling zzso to selectively target transformed but not normal cells is a plausible zzso 

To selectively kill Ras transformed cells by over expressing a lethal gene using a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and a number of colon cancer cell lines were zzso with zzso zzso reporter gene under the control of different zzso zzso The zzso promoter zzso contains two copies of adjacent zzso and zzso I binding sites followed by a minimal zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with expression zzso and a selected zzso and then grown for 3 weeks under zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso expressed high level of Luc activity following zzso with the zzso zzso zzso cell lines that do not contain this zzso expressed negligible low Luc zzso Following zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso there was a significant reduction in the number of colony zzso 

zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso the growth of Ras transformed cells, and not normal zzso zzso This gene approach therapy may become a useful, effective and safe to target Ras zzso tumor cells with sparing of the normal zzso
