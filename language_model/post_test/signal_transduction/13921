zzso zzso zzso consist of a family of zzso which play critical roles during multiple stages of cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso and decrease of zzso are associated with the developments and zzso of many types of human zzso zzso however, the situations of zzso in prion diseases are less zzso Using Western blots and zzso and zzso zzso marked increase of zzso and decrease of zzso were observed in the brains of zzso strain zzso zzso presenting obviously a zzso phenomenon along with disease zzso Similar zzso of zzso were also detected in a zzso infectious cell line zzso Both zzso and zzso were observed in zzso by zzso zzso Accompanying with the changes of zzso in the brains of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso forms zzso and zzso were significantly zzso whereas zzso B1 and zzso were obviously zzso while zzso zzso remained almost zzso Moreover, exposure of the zzso zzso zzso on the primary cultured cortical zzso cells induced similar changes of cellular zzso and some cell zzso zzso such as zzso and its zzso forms, zzso zzso Those results illustrate obviously zzso expressions of cell cycle regulatory proteins in the zzso zzso which may lead to the cell cycle arrest at M zzso Possibly due to the zzso of some key cell cycle events during prion infection, together with the fact that zzso are unable to complete zzso the cell cycle zzso in zzso zzso is definitely zzso which may lead to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
