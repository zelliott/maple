It is well known that zzso has the ability to prevent zzso However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully zzso We therefore investigated whether a Brazilian zzso ethanol extract affects zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 in skeletal muscle zzso In zzso zzso the extract at 1 zzso significantly promoted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Regarding the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso extract induced both zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso However, we could not define which zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso because both zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso effects to each zzso The main zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso C, zzso acid, and zzso promoted zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, these compounds activated both zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, only zzso increased zzso zzso activity under our experimental zzso Single oral administrations of zzso zzso at 250 zzso body weight, lowered zzso blood zzso levels in zzso zzso The extract promoted zzso zzso in skeletal muscle of rats and mice, but did not inhibit zzso activity in the small zzso under our experimental zzso It was confirmed that zzso extract promoted zzso of both zzso and zzso in rat skeletal zzso In conclusion, we show that Brazilian zzso has the potential to prevent zzso through the promotion of zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and that zzso is one of the candidates for active compound in zzso
