zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause the B cell zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso in humans and zzso zzso zzso in zzso In zzso and in zzso studies indicate that the zzso protein is essential for B cell survival, cell cycle zzso and proliferation in response to B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation leads to the zzso of zzso factor nuclear factor zzso which in turn regulates genes controlling B cell zzso We now demonstrate that a zzso zzso in zzso known to cause the zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso of zzso This zzso can be rescued by zzso with zzso zzso This zzso also interferes with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which normally targets the zzso inhibitor zzso for zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso couples zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso with this zzso mechanism may contribute to the B cell deficiencies observed in zzso and zzso
