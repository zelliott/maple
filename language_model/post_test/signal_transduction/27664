The class II zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is expressed on various zzso presenting cells zzso zzso fragments of peptides processed by zzso that match the zzso character of the zzso grooves formed by alpha and beta chains of class II zzso molecules are expressed on the surface of zzso and are recognized by T zzso Many class zzso zzso motifs reported to date follow the zzso zzso pattern zzso with A, B, C, D, and E zzso functioning to bind to zzso thereby designated as zzso On the contrary, the zzso zzso are recognized by T cells through the T cell zzso zzso zzso peptides with single zzso zzso at zzso zzso changed signals in T cells, leading to quantitative and qualitative zzso zzso changes in human T cell zzso zzso Certain zzso changed signals in zzso leading to the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of class II zzso molecules on zzso using zzso leads to zzso of zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso play differential zzso Thus, zzso molecules when recognized by zzso not only present zzso zzso to T cells but also transmit signals to zzso where the zzso and zzso of zzso molecules may play important zzso
