zzso zzso is an insect zzso fungus widely used as a zzso agent to zzso and control insect zzso The zzso zzso zzso and mediates disease transmission, however, little is known about genetic elements that control zzso Here, the cloning and characterization of a regulatory G zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The disruption of zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso production on zzso plates or from infected zzso The zzso zzso also demonstrated reduced zzso and zzso viability but zzso significantly faster than the wild zzso Although zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso sensitivity, the amount of zzso on the zzso surface and the level of zzso of the zzso protein gene zzso were zzso zzso toward insects was similar to that of the zzso or reverse zzso zzso and the zzso levels of zzso factor genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were unchanged in zzso zzso of a single zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso suggests that it functions differently than zzso proteins in other zzso However, there may be additional zzso proteins and zzso pathways that control colony development in zzso zzso
