zzso element zzso zzso expression is tissue specific and zzso zzso Here we report that zzso is unique within the family of zzso promoter element zzso factors since it is zzso by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso The kinetic of expression is characteristic of an early response zzso The induction is transient and cell specific, does not involve increased transcript stability, and does not require protein zzso zzso the subsequent decline in zzso expression requires de zzso protein zzso The induced transcript encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso and is generated from an alternative zzso zzso A cluster of four zzso in this promoter directs zzso zzso zzso binds to these elements and thereby zzso the activity of its own promoter, thus zzso a negative zzso zzso
