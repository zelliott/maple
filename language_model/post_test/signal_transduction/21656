Central nervous system zzso destruction in spinal zzso injury zzso is caused by a complex series of cellular and molecular zzso Recent studies have concentrated on signaling by receptors in the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso that mediate diverse biological outcomes ranging from inflammation to zzso From the perspective of basic science research, understanding how zzso signaling mediates these divergent responses is critical in clarifying events underlying irreversible cell injury in clinically relevant models of zzso From a clinical perspective, this work also provides novel targets for the development of therapeutic agents that have the potential to protect the spinal zzso from irreversible damage and promote functional zzso In this review, we discuss how the formation of alternate signaling complexes and zzso membrane zzso after zzso can influence life and death decisions of cells zzso through two members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
