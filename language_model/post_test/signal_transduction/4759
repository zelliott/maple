Human and mouse studies performed over the last decade have established that zzso helper T zzso cells are a zzso helper subset specialized in the provision of help to B zzso zzso differentiation is driven by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which turns on a program that guides T cells close to zzso areas where zzso cells first provide help to B zzso zzso zzso expression promotes the entry of zzso cells into zzso and zzso their zzso expression profile so they can support and select zzso center B cells that have acquired zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso box 3 protein zzso regulatory T cells and zzso natural killer T zzso cells can also co-opt the zzso zzso differentiation zzso to migrate into zzso zzso and regulate zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso helper cells drive a distinctive type of zzso zzso response to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso regulatory zzso cells exert a zzso function on zzso zzso zzso how zzso cells are functionally and zzso regulated and the factors that control the balance between zzso and zzso cells is likely to be critical for improved understanding of the zzso and progression of zzso and zzso of zzso center origin, and generation of effective zzso
