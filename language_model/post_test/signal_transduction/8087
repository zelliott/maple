zzso hormones, including zzso and zzso regulate systemic insulin sensitivity in accordance to existing zzso zzso zzso levels reflect existing fat mass and the zzso zzso regulates insulin action in zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, preserves insulin sensitivity via transient increments of zzso activity and its circulating levels seem to reflect the zzso capacity of zzso zzso Because zzso and insulin zzso in their zzso actions, it seems evident that inadequate zzso production causes systemic insulin zzso As a consequence, compounds that either increase zzso production or mimic its actions can be considered as an efficient strategy for improving insulin sensitivity in type 2 zzso We have previously shown that zzso and zzso exert opposing actions on zzso production, indicating that combined use of zzso and zzso is a more efficient strategy as compared to zzso zzso Here, we will provide additional arguments which stress the need for a fixed dose of zzso and zzso in order to preserve zzso zzso zzso Finally, after zzso critical zzso of insulin and zzso zzso putative pathways are proposed by which zzso and zzso zzso regulate systemic insulin sensitivity in accordance to existing fat zzso By amplifying insulin action downstream of zzso zzso exerts negative feedback on insulin signaling via zzso pathways that target zzso for zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso increments of zzso activity, on the other hand, may zzso zzso zzso leading to the preservation of insulin sensitivity in periods of increased zzso zzso Considering that zzso and zzso are zzso associated with zzso the proposed model provides a plausible explanation for the observation that zzso exerts strong negative feedback on systemic insulin sensitivity, while increasing zzso zzso
