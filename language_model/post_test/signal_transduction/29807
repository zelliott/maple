zzso zzso of the plasma membrane into zzso is a key feature of immune cell zzso and subsequent immune zzso zzso Here, we will review the high diversity of membrane zzso ranging from elementary zzso zzso envisioned as dynamic and small zzso (in the tens of zzso to relatively stable zzso membrane zzso which form the zzso zzso of T zzso We will discuss the relationship between these different types of plasma membrane zzso and how raft zzso and zzso interactions and cell biological processes cooperate to generate functional zzso that mediate zzso zzso
