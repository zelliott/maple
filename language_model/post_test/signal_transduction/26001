zzso a zzso zzso zzso is an essential signaling zzso in B cells and other zzso zzso Recently, its unexpected diverse functions were recognized in the regulation of cellular zzso innate immune recognition, vascular development, and zzso Despite its zzso role, only a few zzso proteins have been zzso To find new zzso proteins for zzso we performed a systemic in zzso zzso zzso using zzso fusion peptides to determine the zzso specificity surrounding the zzso zzso to be zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso surrounding zzso 178 of zzso a principal zzso zzso in B cell zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso at sites -5 to zzso were necessary for zzso by zzso zzso at site zzso was also influential in zzso and a substitution of Pro on site zzso to a basic zzso acid zzso zzso resulted in attenuated zzso On the basis of these results, a general consensus zzso motif for zzso was determined and several new candidate target proteins were identified in protein database zzso Of the candidate zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso resistance 1) was confirmed to be zzso by zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso using a full-length protein of zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso zzso upon the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that more zzso zzso can be found using an in zzso zzso approach and show for the first time that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso
