We have previously reported the association of tumor cell invasion with expression of growth factor zzso protein 7 zzso This zzso contains a zzso zzso 2 zzso domain and shares structural zzso with a cell migration zzso designated zzso found in zzso zzso In the present study, zzso expression was analyzed in human zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso in 14 of 31 zzso zzso as compared to the adjacent normal zzso zzso and this finding was significantly correlated with the presence of zzso zzso zzso We also identified that zzso protein in zzso zzso cells was zzso on zzso by zzso growth factor as well as attachment to zzso zzso proteins including zzso Such zzso zzso of zzso was regulated by zzso signaling that leads to the interaction with focal zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and reduced migration of zzso zzso cells into zzso Our results suggest a role of zzso zzso signal zzso in generation of an invasive cell zzso against zzso zzso and thus contributes to zzso progression of human zzso zzso
