zzso viral infections and inflammatory syndromes induce the zzso of T cells with characteristics of terminal differentiation or zzso However, the mechanism that regulates the zzso differentiation of these cells is zzso Human zzso zzso memory zzso T cells zzso and also zzso T cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso have many characteristics of zzso zzso These include the expression of surface zzso and zzso reduced zzso capacity, decreased survival, and high expression of nuclear zzso after zzso zzso A paradoxical observation was that although zzso zzso T cells exhibit defective zzso activity after zzso they have significantly longer zzso than central memory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso T zzso This suggested that zzso activity was actively inhibited in this zzso Because zzso zzso such as zzso inhibited zzso activity in T cells via a zzso zzso pathway, we investigated the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso zzso T zzso We found that the expression of both total and zzso zzso was highest in the zzso and zzso compared with that of other zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso T cells, significantly enhanced their zzso activity and survival after zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is directly involved in certain zzso characteristics of highly differentiated zzso T zzso In particular, zzso zzso T cells have features of zzso zzso that are regulated by active cell signaling pathways that are zzso
