zzso effects of agents known to intervene with signal zzso pathways zzso and protein zzso c zzso were examined in the zzso melanoma cell zzso The compounds examined zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso which interferes with membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a classic inhibitor of protein zzso zzso and zzso a zzso depleting agent, that might affect the zzso ratio on zzso The three agents were found to inhibit the proliferation of zzso melanoma zzso Only zzso as expected, induced a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso altered zzso zzso zzso They reduced membrane expression of zzso zzso while increasing its expression in the zzso Following zzso treatment a trend towards increased zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso is a target for the action of signal zzso zzso However, the relationship between growth zzso and altered zzso expression is not yet zzso
