The zzso is derived from the zzso segment of the embryonic zzso zzso 1 zzso Previous studies have shown that the early development and patterning of zzso requires zzso growth factor zzso zzso However, many of the zzso processes that shape zzso zzso take place later in embryonic development and during the first 2 weeks of zzso life in the zzso Here, we present a more comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of genes zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso during these later stages of zzso zzso We show that these genes are expressed in multiple cell types in the developing zzso in an astonishing array of distinct zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling functions throughout zzso development to regulate many processes that shape the formation of a functional zzso
