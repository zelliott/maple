zzso growth factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso play important roles in zzso protection from zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso factor 1 zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso production in the setting of zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso can increase zzso production through the zzso zzso We hypothesized that infusion of zzso zzso zzso would improve zzso functional recovery after zzso 

zzso male rat hearts were subjected to 15 minutes of zzso 25 minutes of zzso and 40 minutes of zzso Immediately prior to zzso zzso hearts received zzso infusions of vehicle or solutions of zzso 3, or 30 zzso zzso zzso function was recorded throughout the zzso zzso data were analyzed with zzso analysis of zzso adjusted with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso function was zzso All hearts had significant reductions in function at the beginning of zzso Hearts treated with zzso or 3 zzso zzso infusions exhibited greater recovery of left zzso developed pressure compared to zzso The zzso positive value of the first zzso of pressure zzso was greater in hearts treated with zzso zzso zzso compared to hearts treated with zzso No differences were observed in recovery of zzso pressure or the zzso negative value of the first zzso of pressure zzso 

zzso zzso zzso infusion improves zzso functional recovery after zzso
