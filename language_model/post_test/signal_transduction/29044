zzso signaling zzso is central to growth and metabolism and has a zzso role in zzso In zzso zzso reductions in zzso increase stress resistance and zzso effects that require the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso also zzso against zzso stress by zzso the zzso phase 2 zzso zzso Here we show that zzso not only opposes zzso but also directly zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso leads to zzso zzso nuclear zzso in the zzso and zzso target gene zzso zzso contributes to the increased stress tolerance and longevity resulting from reduced zzso and delays aging when expressed zzso Furthermore, zzso that is zzso active increases life span independently of zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso network regulated by zzso promotes longevity and is an important direct target of zzso
