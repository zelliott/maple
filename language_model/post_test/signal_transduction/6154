zzso zzso zzso zzso form the largest group of integral membrane zzso proteins and mediate diverse zzso zzso In addition to zzso via zzso zzso zzso can also signal by interacting with various small zzso to regulate downstream zzso zzso The small zzso zzso is structurally classified into at least five families: the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ran zzso They are zzso zzso with molecular masses over the range zzso zzso which function as molecular switches to control many zzso cell zzso Several studies have provided evidence of zzso between zzso and small zzso It is well documented that zzso zzso through zzso zzso can lead to the zzso of Ras and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can associate directly with zzso and zzso may also function as zzso for small zzso In this review, we zzso the recent progress made in understanding the interaction between zzso and small zzso focusing on understanding how the association of small zzso with zzso and zzso proteins may influence zzso zzso and zzso zzso
