zzso is a drug that has been shown to have an zzso property in zzso and in zzso Whereas zzso shows promise as a therapeutic agent for a variety of diseases including zzso liver zzso zzso fibrosis, and certain types of cancer, the mechanism of action remains zzso Using the tight skin mouse zzso model for zzso we evaluated the ability of zzso to inhibit spontaneous development of zzso zzso We found that administration of a low dose of zzso both in adult and newborn animals for 60 d prevented the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso was found to reduce the amount of collagen zzso by zzso This effect was due to a reduction in the promoter activity of the zzso collagen genes as treatment of zzso cultures with zzso M zzso reduced the level of zzso collagen message zzso by northern zzso and greatly reduced the activity of a reporter construct under control of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso In addition, analysis of transforming growth factor beta signaling pathways in zzso revealed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso of collagen protein and activity of the zzso collagen zzso Further we found that zzso blocked the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso after transforming growth factor beta zzso Apparently the zzso property was specific to zzso as there was no zzso effect on the zzso of zzso after stimulation with transforming growth factor zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso collagen synthesis and may elicit its effect via interference with the transforming growth factor beta signaling zzso
