The acquisition of functional competence represents a critical phase during zzso development of T zzso zzso reaching this stage represent cells which have been positively selected on the basis of major zzso complex zzso but which have also been zzso of potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso by negative zzso While the zzso window in which zzso are subjected to positive selection is now well zzso the precise zzso timing of negative selection, in relation to positive selection events, is less zzso Moreover, the underlying mechanism allowing zzso zzso to respond to zzso zzso zzso by zzso rather than death, remains zzso Here we have zzso the zzso timing of negative selection in relation to positive selection, using measurement of zzso zzso to zzso cell presentation of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso We show that zzso which have received initial positive selection signals, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso like their zzso zzso zzso sign zzso are susceptible to negative selection, indicating that induction of positive selection does not convey immediate resistance to negative zzso In contrast, newly generated zzso zzso sign zzso cells are not only resistant to deletion by zzso but respond to zzso zzso zzso by zzso indicating that the acquisition of functional competence occurs at the newly generated zzso zzso sign zzso zzso Finally, by using direct zzso infection of primary zzso zzso zzso we also show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso does not correlate with, nor convey resistance to zzso negative zzso Thus, our data suggest that although zzso has been implicated in resistance to zzso zzso the acquisition of resistance to negative selection occurs independently of zzso zzso
