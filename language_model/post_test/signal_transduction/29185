This study represents the first attempt to couple, by zzso experiments, the mechanisms of zzso and zzso communication concerning a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso G protein zzso in its zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways mediate the communication between the zzso protein interface and both the zzso binding site of the zzso and the zzso binding site of the G zzso The increase in zzso accessibility in the neighborhoods of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso is instrumental in favoring the penetration of the zzso of zzso in between the zzso ends of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso motif is predicted to be an important zzso of the zzso and zzso communication involving the zzso The zzso protein interface is predicted to involve multiple regions from the zzso and the G protein zzso However, zzso contacts with the zzso of the zzso seem to be the major players in the zzso motion of the zzso domain with respect to the zzso domain and in the formation of a zzso exit route in between the zzso and zzso loop of zzso The zzso from this study are of wide interest, as they are expected to apply to the whole zzso family, given also the considerable G protein zzso
