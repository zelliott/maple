zzso of translation factor activity plays a major role in protein zzso forms of synaptic zzso We examined zzso control across the critical period of Arc synthesis underlying consolidation of long term zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of intact, zzso zzso zzso induction by high frequency stimulation zzso evoked zzso of the zzso protein zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on a protracted time course matching the zzso of Arc zzso Local infusion of the zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso maintenance and Arc protein zzso blocked changes in zzso and zzso zzso state, and prevented initiation complex zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso of the zzso protein complex 1 zzso with zzso did not impair zzso maintenance or Arc synthesis nor did it inhibit zzso formation or zzso of zzso zzso nonetheless blocked zzso signaling to zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and inhibited synthesis of components of the zzso zzso Using zzso and in zzso zzso we show that Arc protein expression depends on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Arc translation is selectively blocked by pharmacological zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling was required for zzso zzso These results support a dominant role for zzso signaling in control of zzso initiation and Arc synthesis during zzso consolidation in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso signaling is activated but zzso for Arc synthesis and zzso The work, thus, identifies zzso control mechanisms uniquely tuned to zzso zzso consolidation in live zzso
