We investigate how the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential regulator of zzso contributes to the zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso invasion of human brain zzso zzso cells zzso through zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signaling and bacterial invasion were defined by zzso raft zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso bacterial invasion was zzso inhibited by two zzso agents, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso raft marker zzso was observed in zzso induced by zzso coli zzso and zzso The recruitment of zzso zzso and related signaling zzso including zzso and zzso to zzso enriched zzso zzso was increased upon treatment with zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso signaling and zzso invasion, was associated with zzso zzso and zzso bacterial zzso Furthermore, zzso invasion, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was specifically blocked by both zzso 

zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso coli zzso invasion of zzso
