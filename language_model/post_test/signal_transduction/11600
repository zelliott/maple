zzso is an unusual member of the zzso family of zzso factors which are involved in zzso zzso Due to a relaxed control by the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso We show here that zzso is zzso zzso upon zzso of T cells in a fashion similar to the zzso However, zzso degradation differs from that of zzso since it is not induced by zzso but only by T cell zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso degradation occurs in three steps: zzso after stimulation zzso is rapidly zzso at zzso acids zzso and zzso followed by zzso an zzso cut and, finally, zzso the complete degradation in the zzso Since zzso of the two zzso sites to zzso sites abolished zzso zzso in zzso and led to the stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a necessary prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso is a crucial regulator of zzso gene zzso Thus, the zzso degradation of zzso should be an important control mechanism of zzso zzso
