Several studies indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso function in the insulin signaling zzso Here we describe the discovery of a novel zzso zzso which we designated zzso zzso in which the first 16 zzso acids of the zzso domain are not zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso is most abundant in the liver, zzso and zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso induced reporter gene activity through the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was zzso by insulin treatment, by zzso treatment, and by zzso of zzso active protein zzso B zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso is a downstream target of both the zzso zzso insulin signaling zzso and an zzso protein zzso zzso
