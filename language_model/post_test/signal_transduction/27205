The human zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso plays a central role at both the early and late stages of the virus life zzso During viral zzso the zzso domain of zzso promotes membrane association, which is essential for the formation of viral zzso When viral infection occurs, the mature zzso zzso from the plasma membrane and zzso in the nuclear targeting zzso Thus, zzso contains a zzso membrane binding signal to govern its differential zzso zzso and biological zzso We previously identified a membrane binding signal within the zzso 31 zzso acids of the zzso domain of human zzso virus type 1 zzso consisting of zzso and a highly basic region zzso Zhou, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that exposure of this membrane binding signal is regulated in different zzso protein zzso Within full-length zzso the membrane targeting signal is exposed and can direct zzso as well as zzso proteins to the plasma zzso However, in the context of zzso alone, this signal is hidden and unable to zzso plasma membrane zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism for regulation of membrane zzso a series of deletions within zzso was generated by zzso removing zzso regions defined by the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso of the last alpha zzso zzso acids 97 to zzso of zzso was associated with enhancement of binding to biological zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso binding experiments indicated that the zzso region of zzso exerts a negative effect on the zzso MA membrane targeting domain by zzso the zzso zzso We propose that mature zzso adopts a zzso different from that of the zzso domain within zzso and present evidence to support this zzso It is likely that such a zzso change results in an zzso zzso switch which zzso differential membrane zzso
