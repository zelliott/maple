Some zzso zzso species are used for the empirical treatment of diabetes zzso but the zzso properties of zzso zzso have not yet been zzso zzso Here we report that an zzso extract of zzso zzso seeds zzso and its active principles zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and human subcutaneous zzso In zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso induced the zzso zzso by zzso respect to insulin, while zzso and zzso 30 zzso each, did it by 50% zzso and zzso zzso The simultaneous application of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells, on which zzso preparations exerted zzso effects with zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso respect to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso simultaneously applied zzso zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso in both zzso and human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that their zzso effects are zzso by this signaling zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso exerted only mild to moderate zzso effects on zzso and human zzso although the combined application of zzso and zzso markedly increased the zzso zzso in both cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso and its active principles zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and human zzso using the insulin signaling zzso
