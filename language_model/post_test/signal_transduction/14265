zzso receptors zzso sense microbial products and play an important role in innate zzso Currently, 11 members of zzso have been identified in humans, with important function in host defense in early steps of the inflammatory zzso zzso are present in the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are a family of receptors related to the innate immune response that contain an zzso domain known as the zzso zzso domain that recruits the zzso zzso adapters zzso zzso zzso and zzso The classical zzso results in the zzso of both nuclear factor zzso and zzso via the zzso complex, with two active zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The classical zzso zzso signaling zzso leads to the synthesis of inflammatory zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In humans, genetic defects have been identified that impair signaling of the zzso zzso and this may result in zzso zzso infections, as well as virus and zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the main mechanisms of microbial recognition and the defects involving zzso
