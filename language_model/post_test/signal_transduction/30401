zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso gene zzso Although primarily sensitive to zzso zzso signaling can be regulated by a number of stress factors including zzso stress, growth factors and molecules present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso is important for tumor zzso invasion and zzso zzso is predominantly zzso and the zzso acids zzso and zzso comprise zzso of collagen zzso The final step in collagen degradation is zzso by zzso the zzso zzso for zzso with Pro and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso wound healing in patients with inherited zzso zzso is associated with zzso features of zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in zzso Because zzso alpha is central to zzso we considered that zzso may zzso this zzso To test this hypothesis, we made expression zzso of human zzso and obtained stable zzso in zzso cancer cells zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased nuclear zzso zzso factor zzso zzso levels and elevated expression of zzso gene products, vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso of zzso response element zzso zzso We used an zzso degradation domain zzso reporter construct as a surrogate for zzso alpha as an in zzso zzso zzso Since this reporter is zzso by zzso mechanisms, the increased levels of zzso observed with zzso expression reflected the decreased zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the differential expression of zzso in 2 breast cancer cell lines showed zzso differences in zzso alpha zzso These findings show that metabolism of zzso by zzso plays a previously zzso role in zzso zzso
