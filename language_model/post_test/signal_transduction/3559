Many zzso bacteria use zzso zzso zzso as zzso signals to coordinate their collective zzso zzso evidence indicates that plants can respond to zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of plants reacting to these bacterial zzso In this study, we show that the treatment of zzso roots with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant root zzso The genetic analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso were insensitive to zzso or zzso in zzso of root zzso The zzso zzso of the sole zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no response to AHL promotion of root zzso whereas zzso zzso plants zzso either the wild type or a zzso active version of zzso zzso exhibited the exaggerated effect on root zzso caused by zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso after plants were contacted with both zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso This provides insight into the mechanism of plant responses to bacterial zzso zzso
