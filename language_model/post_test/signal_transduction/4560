The zzso zzso has been implicated in a variety of human zzso for its critical role in tumor growth, invasion, and zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso showed more than zzso selectivity for zzso compared with more than 150 zzso making it one of the most selective zzso zzso described to zzso zzso inhibited tumor cell zzso survival, zzso in zzso cell lines in zzso and showed marked zzso activity in tumor models harboring either zzso gene amplification or a zzso growth factor zzso zzso loop at zzso dose levels in zzso zzso efficacy of zzso was zzso and showed a strong correlation with zzso of zzso zzso downstream zzso and tumor cell zzso In human zzso models that express relatively high levels of zzso complete zzso of zzso activity by zzso only led to partial tumor growth zzso zzso in zzso The combination of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso zzso in the zzso model that also expresses activated RON zzso tumor cell zzso and resulted in enhanced zzso efficacy zzso compared with either zzso zzso or RON zzso alone zzso zzso also showed potent zzso properties in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso strongly induced zzso zzso growth factor zzso levels in zzso zzso tumors, indicating a possible zzso switching mechanism in tumor cell signaling as a potential resistance mechanism that might compromise tumor responses to zzso zzso zzso these results show the use of highly selective zzso of zzso and provide insight toward targeting tumors exhibiting different mechanisms of zzso zzso
