zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso zzso by early generated zzso cells in the marginal zone of the zzso It plays an important role in the migration of cortical zzso and the development of cortical zzso We recently discovered that zzso is required not only for the formation of cortical layers during development but also for their maintenance in zzso Thus, decreased zzso expression in a mouse model of zzso and in zzso patients was accompanied by a loss of zzso cell zzso called zzso cell zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso blockade of zzso in normal, adult mice resulted in zzso cell zzso zzso these findings point to a role for zzso in the formation and maintenance of a laminated cortical zzso How does zzso act on the zzso in the migration process of cortical zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso involves the zzso receptors zzso E zzso 2 and very low density zzso zzso the adapter protein zzso and zzso but it has remained unclear how zzso of the zzso zzso cascade controls zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso an zzso protein that promotes the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso renders zzso unable to zzso zzso thereby stabilizing the zzso zzso of zzso in the leading processes of zzso zzso anchors them to the marginal zone containing zzso Our results indicate that zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso is an important component of zzso function in the development and maintenance of cortical zzso
