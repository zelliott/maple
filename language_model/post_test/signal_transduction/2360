zzso of zzso cells from the zzso zzso leads to induction of programmed cell death, a process that has been termed zzso It has been reported recently that detachment of zzso cells from zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and speculated that these stress activated protein zzso play a zzso role in the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We report here that although zzso is activated by detachment of normal zzso cells, study of cell lines expressing activated signaling proteins usually controlled by Ras shows that stimulation of zzso fails to correlate with induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso protect zzso cells from zzso zzso without suppressing zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and dominant negative zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without protecting from zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso prevents zzso cell zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso a related zzso zzso is also zzso by detachment from zzso but zzso of this zzso with zzso zzso does not protect from zzso It is therefore unlikely that either zzso or zzso play a direct role in zzso programmed cell death in zzso zzso
