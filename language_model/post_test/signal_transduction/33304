Many species of electric fish emit sexually zzso electrical signals that are used in gender zzso In zzso mature females produce an electric organ discharge zzso that is higher in frequency and shorter in pulse duration than that of mature zzso zzso pulse duration is determined by zzso currents in the zzso and zzso influence zzso pulse duration by altering the zzso zzso of the zzso sodium zzso We examined whether zzso zzso the zzso zzso and, if so, whether it regulates zzso pulse duration by acting on the same zzso zzso current in the zzso We implanted zzso zzso with either empty zzso capsules zzso one capsule filled with zzso zzso low zzso or three capsules of zzso zzso zzso Twelve days after zzso zzso fish had plasma zzso levels approximately zzso zzso zzso or approximately zzso zzso zzso higher than zzso After zzso both zzso groups had higher zzso frequency and shorter zzso pulse duration than controls and their own zzso zzso Through zzso we identified zzso zzso receptors in the zzso of zzso indicating that these cells are directly responsive to zzso In addition, zzso studies showed that zzso affected the zzso zzso currents zzso the sodium zzso time constant was significantly lower in zzso fish than in zzso Thus, sexual zzso in the zzso signal results, at least in part, from zzso and zzso acting in opposite directions on the same zzso current in the zzso
