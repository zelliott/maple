zzso zzso requires zzso signals at the front and zzso signals at the back of cells, which regulate cell migration in a zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso release via zzso 1 zzso channels and zzso stimulation of zzso receptors contribute to the zzso signals at the zzso Here we show that zzso also contributes to the zzso signals at the back, namely by providing the zzso for zzso zzso zzso In resting zzso we found that zzso receptors are zzso distributed across the cell zzso In polarized cells, zzso receptors redistributed to the back where their stimulation triggered zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso which blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso stimulation and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that blocked zzso zzso zzso signaling impaired the polarization and migration of zzso in a zzso zzso field and resulted in enhanced zzso and zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso receptors require zzso to trigger zzso and zzso signals that zzso to fine-tune zzso responses at the front and back of zzso zzso channels thus link local zzso signals to the global zzso signals that orchestrate zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
