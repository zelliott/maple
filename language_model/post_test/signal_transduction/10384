zzso and zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso display regionally restricted expression patterns and are necessary for the formation of the limb skeletal zzso zzso genes zzso zzso factors, which are supposed to control the expression of a series of downstream target zzso whose nature has remained largely zzso Several genes were identified that are zzso expressed in relation to zzso gene zzso few studies, however, explored their direct regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso have been proposed as zzso targets, and recently, evidence was gained for their role in limb zzso The expression of the zzso gene in developing limbs was shown to correlate with the expression of zzso and zzso however, its direct regulation by these genes has never been zzso We have characterized the zzso promoter region and show that it contains multiple binding sites for zzso group 13 zzso zzso We found that one of these sites is bound in zzso by zzso and zzso and by zzso zzso in developing mouse zzso Moreover, we show that zzso and zzso activate zzso from the zzso promoter and that a zzso of the zzso binding site was sufficient to abolish zzso zzso the zzso zzso identified in patients displaying a novel zzso syndrome, does not bind to in zzso and fails to zzso the zzso zzso These results establish that zzso is a direct downstream target of zzso and zzso during limb development, thus providing further insight into the regulatory networks that control limb zzso
