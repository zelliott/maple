The expression of zzso protein tissue zzso 2 zzso is frequently zzso in multiple cancer cell zzso However, the exact role of zzso in cancer cells is not zzso We recently initiated studies to determine the significance of zzso in cancer cells and observed that sustained expression of zzso resulted in zzso transition zzso and promoted cancer stem cell zzso traits in zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso could serve as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming zzso and zzso zzso spread of cancer zzso 

Using various zzso zzso we analyzed the activity of zzso that is essential for promoting the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso inactive zzso zzso is as effective as zzso zzso zzso in inducing the zzso in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was completely incompetent in this zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso is deemed essential for promoting the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso is not essential for promoting its zzso functions and provide a strong rationale for developing zzso zzso to block zzso pockets of zzso Such zzso may have great potential for zzso the zzso zzso reversing drug resistance and zzso the zzso of cancer zzso
