Maintaining an appropriate balance between zzso of zzso zzso and T regulatory cells zzso is critical to maintain immune zzso and prevent zzso Through a common requirement for zzso the development of peripherally induced zzso is intimately linked to that of zzso cells, with the resulting lineages depending on the presence of zzso zzso such as zzso Currently very little is known about the molecular signaling pathways that control the development of zzso vs zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso is required for zzso induction of zzso expression and the zzso activity of zzso To investigate how negative regulators of the zzso zzso impact zzso development, we investigated whether zzso a zzso zzso that regulates zzso activity, also plays a role in the development and function of zzso zzso zzso maintained zzso capacity in zzso and in a T cell transfer model of zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso cells were significantly less able to cause colitis than were zzso zzso cells due to a profound zzso in zzso cell zzso both in zzso and in zzso The inability of zzso T cells to develop into zzso cells was accompanied by decreased zzso zzso of zzso and an increased capacity to differentiate into zzso cells under the influence of zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is essential for normal zzso cell development and that this zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
