zzso of skeletal muscle growth and metabolism with zzso availability is critical for zzso zzso To establish the role of zzso signaling in this process, we used muscle zzso zzso zzso to disrupt expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso In zzso mice, skeletal muscle masses and insulin responses were slightly affected by zzso but not zzso zzso In contrast, the combined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso severely reduced skeletal muscle growth and zzso signaling and caused death by 3 weeks of zzso zzso of zzso mice revealed zzso zzso reflecting the known requirement of zzso signaling for cardiac function zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and function of zzso skeletal muscle were accompanied by increased zzso zzso expression and zzso acid zzso zzso mice were resistant to injected insulin, and their isolated skeletal muscles showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice and isolated skeletal muscles was shifted from zzso to zzso production, accompanied by an elevated zzso ratio that increased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso Thus, zzso signaling via zzso is essential to terminate skeletal muscle zzso pathways in the presence of adequate zzso
