The purpose of this investigation was to determine if zzso zzso is dependent on the mode of resistance exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso Two groups zzso zzso 5 each) of Female Sprague zzso rats, approximately 12 weeks old, were zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso used to stimulate the right hind limb muscles via the zzso zzso The zzso anterior zzso muscle of Group 1 rats were exposed to three sets of ten zzso resistance zzso while the zzso of Group 2 rats were exposed to three sets of ten resistance zzso that involved zzso zzso zzso muscles served as zzso zzso The zzso muscle was harvested 6 h post exercise and then the rat was zzso Muscle samples were processed to compare zzso zzso between zzso A single bout of zzso zzso that involved muscle lengthening resulted in significantly zzso zzso zzso higher levels of zzso six hours post exercise compared to controls and zzso zzso The differences in total zzso six hours post exercise were not significantly different between zzso zzso suggest that signal zzso pathways activated by zzso exercise may differ zzso a zzso zzso zzso from that activated by lengthening zzso
