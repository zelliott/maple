Signal zzso in zzso and plants is often zzso by zzso zzso zzso Two zzso families of proteins are centrally zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso response zzso The zzso generally function in association with sensory elements that regulate their activities in response to environmental zzso A sequence analysis with 348 zzso zzso zzso reveals that this family consists of distinct zzso A comparative sequence analysis with zzso available receiver domain sequences of zzso response regulators demonstrates a significant correlation between zzso and regulator zzso These findings suggest that different zzso of zzso zzso systems have evolved independently of one zzso
