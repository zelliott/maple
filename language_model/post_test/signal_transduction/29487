The zzso zzso zzso is a natural contaminant in zzso and animal zzso and exerts zzso and zzso effects on various zzso zzso zzso causes cell injury, including zzso However, its precise regulatory mechanisms of action, particularly in stem cells and zzso are currently zzso Recent studies show that zzso has zzso effects on mouse embryonic stem cells and zzso and is associated with defects in their subsequent development, both in zzso and in zzso zzso with the embryonic stem cell line, zzso disclose that zzso zzso zzso via several mechanisms, including zzso generation, increased zzso free calcium levels, zzso zzso oxide production, enhanced zzso ratio, loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso c release, zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Additional studies show that zzso promotes cell death via zzso of the zzso complex and subsequent degradation of Ras and zzso further zzso zzso processes such as the zzso signal zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose a model for zzso cell injury zzso zzso in embryonic stem cells and zzso
