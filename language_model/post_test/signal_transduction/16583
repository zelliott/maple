zzso zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation and migration, which has been proposed to initiate the zzso zzso in coronary zzso zzso zzso is an zzso in zzso zzso and many other zzso Recently, it has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as zzso and cholesterol-lowering zzso In this study, we investigated its effects on zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso inhibited zzso DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in zzso as well as migration of the zzso zzso It also inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso factor zzso activity and the zzso increases in zzso zzso oxygen species zzso These results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso proliferation and migration are attributable to zzso of zzso generation and hence of zzso of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso has potential in the prevention of zzso and zzso
