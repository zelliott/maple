zzso information on zzso networks has been extracted by zzso analyses of gene expression data and zzso binding zzso However, a potential limitation of these approaches is their assumption on the common and constant activity level of a zzso factor zzso on all the genes in any given experimental zzso for example, any zzso is assumed to be either an zzso or a zzso but not both, while it is known that some zzso can be dual zzso Rather than assuming a common linear zzso model for all the zzso we propose using separate zzso models for various gene zzso the genes can be grouped based on their functions or some zzso zzso Furthermore, to take advantage of the zzso structure of many existing gene function zzso systems, such as Gene zzso zzso we propose a shrinkage method that borrows information from relevant gene zzso zzso to a zzso zzso and simulations lend support for our proposed zzso In particular, we find that the shrinkage method consistently works well under various zzso We recommend the use of the shrinkage method as a useful alternative to the existing zzso
