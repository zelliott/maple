zzso which plays an important role in zzso signal zzso has been studied extensively in children with growth zzso but there is scarce information regarding zzso 

We determined total and zzso zzso after zzso stimulation in zzso from children with idiopathic short stature zzso and control children with normal zzso 

We studied 15 zzso children (age zzso zzso zzso zzso with short stature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased growth zzso zzso a zzso response of zzso zzso to the zzso stimulation test and decreased serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 control children with normal stature (age zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined the levels of total and zzso zzso in the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso cultures obtained from a skin zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

We observed a reduction in nuclear zzso levels and a lower zzso zzso zzso ratio in 3 patients from the study group compared to the control zzso 

These results suggest that some children with zzso may exhibit a reduction in the nuclear content of their zzso zzso
