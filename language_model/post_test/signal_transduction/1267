The zzso significance of zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression in lung cancer and, more importantly, its ability to predict response to zzso therapies, are currently subjects of active zzso In a zzso zzso zzso confirmed a worse prognosis zzso zzso in eight studies using zzso although zzso values were generally selected arbitrarily by zzso Most applied clinical research on the zzso has been focused on the zzso of the zzso whereas less research has addressed the potential role of other mechanisms of increased signaling or of zzso zzso The emerging concept of zzso signaling reveals a multilayered network that allows for horizontal interactions and permits multiple zzso responses that may explain the specificity of cellular outcomes to zzso zzso New technologies such as zzso zzso and zzso will help to zzso the issue by providing information on how zzso signaling may affect the expression of genes and proteins in cancer zzso
