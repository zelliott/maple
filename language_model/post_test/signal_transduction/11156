The identification and exploitation of zzso that may predict response to zzso treatments has the capacity to revolutionize the way that patients with cancer are zzso In breast cancer, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are known to have a significant zzso value in determining sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso is known to affect clinical outcome and this information is often used to determine a patient's optimal treatment zzso However, the measurement of zzso and zzso alone is more complex than originally thought and the impact of the recently identified zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as well as several zzso and zzso forms, upon the choice of treatment remains zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression alone are unlikely to determine a patient's optimal treatment regimen, particularly when the amount of zzso between different zzso such as the zzso growth factor zzso pathway, is zzso In order to account for the complex zzso environment that occurs in breast cancer, zzso techniques are needed to analyze tumor zzso zzso The recent advances in zzso or zzso approaches has enabled molecular portraits of breast zzso to be painted, allowing zzso of response and prognosis to be identified and characterized more accurately than zzso In the future, patients could be treated according to the molecular portrait of their tumor zzso zzso maximizing the therapeutic benefit that each patient zzso
