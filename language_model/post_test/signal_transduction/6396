zzso zzso has been shown to have important roles in various zzso signaling zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso of a regulatory B zzso displayed zzso defects including zzso movement and delayed egg laying in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of a zzso A zzso showed exactly opposite zzso to those of zzso zzso providing an excellent genetic model to define zzso signaling zzso at the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is also important for normal zzso formation, which is required for maintenance of normal body size in zzso zzso interactions between zzso and several zzso including zzso and zzso which are known to be involved in zzso signaling pathways suggest that zzso indeed regulates locomotion and zzso egg laying through zzso and zzso Our results indicate that, along with zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso
