zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso period results in serious zzso of brain function, such as learning and zzso These zzso are largely zzso and the underlying mechanisms remain zzso In addition to hypothyroidism, zzso zzso may cause zzso a relatively subtle form of zzso hormone zzso zzso of zzso zzso also potentially zzso learning and zzso However, more direct evidence of the associations between zzso zzso and zzso of learning and memory should be zzso and the underlying mechanisms remain to be zzso Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on long-term zzso zzso a widely accepted cellular model of learning and memory, in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso - a zzso closely associated with synaptic plasticity and learning and memory - was also zzso zzso rats were treated with zzso deficient diet or zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso or zzso The results showed that zzso zzso caused by mild zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused by severe zzso zzso or zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso potential zzso slope and the population spike zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso was also observed in rats subjected to zzso zzso or zzso Our results may support the hypothesis that zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso causes damages to learning and zzso Our results also suggest that decreased zzso of the zzso signaling zzso may contribute to zzso of zzso caused by zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso
