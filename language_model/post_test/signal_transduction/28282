In the embryonic chicken skin, feather buds and the intervening zzso tissue form in a reiterated and sequential pattern that is dependent on interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso promoting and zzso signals such as zzso growth factors zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso respectively, direct the formation of this periodic zzso However, the zzso factors that mediate the response to these signals and transmit this information to downstream zzso genes are largely zzso Here we have explored the zzso zzso factors as candidate zzso zzso downstream of the described feather patterning zzso We show that several zzso members are expressed in the zzso and zzso of the developing feather buds and their expression is induced in embryonic chick skin by the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the chick skin leads to both feather loss and feather bud zzso suggesting that zzso proteins play a negative as well as a positive role in feather zzso Moreover, zzso regulates the expression of zzso and zzso molecules that are important for feather bud initiation as well as bud outgrowth and zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso factors serve to integrate and zzso feather patterning signals to downstream zzso zzso
