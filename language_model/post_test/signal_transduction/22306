zzso a mixed zzso zzso 3/4 zzso is a cerebral zzso widely used in Japan for treating zzso zzso However, little studies have been conducted on the zzso effects of zzso zzso in the zzso artery associated with zzso zzso The in zzso zzso properties of zzso were, therefore, investigated by comparing with known selective zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed in zzso zzso ring preparations from rabbit zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso more selectively relaxed the zzso than zzso zzso Similarly, selective zzso and zzso zzso showed higher selectivity for zzso zzso Furthermore, like selective zzso zzso the zzso by zzso accompanied by increase in zzso levels was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso Next, it was examined whether zzso oxide zzso signaling is involved in this zzso in zzso zzso The suppression of zzso signaling by an NO zzso inhibitor or a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso by a zzso inhibitor and reduced that by a zzso zzso while either suppression of the signaling had little influence on that by zzso These results suggest that zzso has the high zzso for zzso artery based on a mixed zzso and zzso and effectively zzso zzso arteries independently of zzso signaling because of its zzso compensated by either zzso or zzso depending on the state of zzso signaling zzso
