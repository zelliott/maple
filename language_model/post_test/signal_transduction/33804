The aims of this study were to determine whether chronic zzso withdrawal influences the development of zzso zzso zzso in female hearts, to investigate the mechanism zzso zzso is impaired, and to assess whether direct zzso of protein zzso C zzso can mimic zzso in female hearts with chronic zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso or bilateral zzso on zzso zzso female zzso zzso rats were zzso to subcutaneous zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Four weeks later, isolated, zzso hearts were subjected to 30 zzso of zzso followed by 120 zzso of zzso with or without three cycles of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was completely lost in the zzso zzso Western zzso revealed that in the zzso group, zzso failed to zzso zzso to the zzso fraction and that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso zzso replacement restored the zzso effect, the zzso and zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso In the zzso group, zzso with a zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso inhibitor before zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso is lost in female hearts with chronic zzso withdrawal and this is due, at least in part, to impaired zzso and zzso of zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso can fully restore the zzso effect in a manner analogous to zzso zzso
