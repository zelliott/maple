Although zzso zzso zzso are known to be principal inflammatory zzso zzso released from zzso mast cells, the signaling mechanisms involved in the synthesis of zzso remain largely zzso In the present study, therefore, we investigated the signaling zzso by which zzso zzso zzso synthesis after binding to its high affinity zzso zzso in zzso mast zzso We found that zzso zzso synthesis is completely abolished in zzso cells, a stable cell line expressing zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso conversely, synthesis was enhanced in cells expressing zzso a zzso active zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a key zzso of zzso signaling to zzso zzso Further analysis aimed at identifying zzso downstream of zzso revealed that zzso cells with a protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or infection with an zzso zzso harboring a dominant negative zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso blocked zzso zzso and impaired the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso otherwise zzso by zzso zzso Taken together these results suggest that zzso also plays a critical zzso role in the zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso acting downstream of zzso Finally, the zzso significance of zzso in the zzso signaling zzso was demonstrated in an zzso zzso in zzso mouse model, in which induced levels of zzso and airway responsiveness in lung airways were significantly diminished by prior zzso injection of a zzso zzso
