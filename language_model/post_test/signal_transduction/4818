The target of zzso complex 1 zzso is an essential regulator of zzso cell growth that responds to growth factors, energy levels, and zzso zzso The mechanisms through which the zzso zzso acid zzso signals to the zzso zzso zzso which activate zzso within the zzso zzso complex zzso or the structurally related zzso zzso complex, remain zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in a zzso zzso This interaction is necessary and sufficient to mediate zzso signaling to zzso and is disrupted by zzso of zzso in editing zzso zzso Thus, the zzso signaling module samples, via the zzso editing domain, the zzso of zzso zzso as a proxy for zzso zzso
