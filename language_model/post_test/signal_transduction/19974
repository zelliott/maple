Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso plays a key role in chronic inflammation and zzso The aim of this study was to characterize zzso a zzso zzso as a drug candidate targeting the zzso signaling zzso 

A zzso zzso stable cell line was constructed to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso human zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from healthy volunteers were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production and zzso of the zzso zzso were studied using zzso and Western zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso stable cells, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso production of zzso and zzso in both zzso cells and zzso In zzso cells, the suppression was partially caused by blockade of the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the nucleus via affecting the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a potential inhibitor of the zzso pathway, which blocks the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release, suggesting that the compound might be an zzso zzso
