We have presented evidence that zzso a 22 zzso low molecular weight zzso binding zzso becomes associated with the zzso in zzso zzso The initial incorporation is very rapid and occurs as fast as we can measure zzso Thus, some zzso is associated with the zzso as fast as it is zzso The remainder of the zzso is incorporated more zzso This zzso incorporation of zzso is similar to the incorporation of zzso into the zzso but no interaction between zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso of zzso by zzso protein zzso did not inhibit its association with the zzso We conclude that zzso is one of an increasing number of proteins that associate with the zzso during cell zzso The function of zzso in the zzso is unclear at this zzso However, it is possible to speculate on potential zzso There is growing evidence that low molecular weight G proteins participate in the formation of zzso zzso For example, zzso promotes the assembly of a zzso complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and this complex is important for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso a zzso of zzso forms a complex with zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso of zzso This zzso zzso may be important in zzso structure in zzso In zzso zzso which is membrane zzso may promote the assembly of a complex of proteins during cell zzso and may zzso this complex to the plasma zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
