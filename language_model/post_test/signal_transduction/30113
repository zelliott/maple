zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso has attracted considerable attention because of the involvement of zzso zzso in several zzso zzso Here, we focused on zzso zzso of inwardly zzso zzso current zzso in zzso zzso acutely zzso from rat zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso steps from a holding potential of zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso reduced zzso zzso as did selective stimulation of zzso zzso or zzso class receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso by zzso stimulation was attributable to decreased zzso activity because similar zzso was observed with zzso zzso whereas enhancing zzso activity increased zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso suppression of zzso occurred through a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso patches of zzso zzso zzso which zzso involvement of zzso signaling zzso we observed a zzso zzso zzso that was suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but was unaffected by zzso zzso of zzso suggesting direct interactions of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso suppresses zzso through two zzso zzso zzso of zzso and direct interactions of the zzso with zzso channels and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso indicates that ambient zzso would tend to increase responsiveness to zzso zzso when zzso zzso are near the resting membrane potential and may provide a mechanism by which zzso impacts higher cognitive zzso
