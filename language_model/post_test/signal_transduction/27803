We screened zzso zzso separated compounds of a diverse zzso library of zzso for their ability to inhibit the zzso activity of protein zzso zzso zzso Yes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso This screening yielded novel zzso for the protein zzso zzso zzso In the 1, zzso scaffold, the preferred zzso at position zzso was zzso or a zzso derived from a zzso or zzso used in building the zzso while the zzso at zzso introduced by zzso agents, was preferably aromatic in zzso The preferred ring structure introduced on the zzso ring of the scaffold by acid zzso was a zzso zzso zzso The lead compound, designated as zzso has a zzso ring at zzso and a zzso zzso at zzso The compound has an zzso of 73 zzso against zzso zzso to zzso lower than against other protein zzso zzso and zzso lower than against other zzso zzso The mechanism of binding of zzso to zzso is mixed against the zzso zzso with a zzso of 35 zzso and zzso against zzso with a zzso of 17 zzso Multiple zzso analysis of the lead compound in the presence of other competitive zzso demonstrated that the binding of the lead compound is zzso to the other competitive zzso The inhibitor was found to be nontoxic to the zzso zzso cells and inhibited the colony formation of zzso colon zzso cells that are dependent on zzso zzso
