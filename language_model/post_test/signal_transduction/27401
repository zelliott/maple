Numerous studies have established that stimulation of cell growth by members of the zzso growth factor zzso family of zzso is dependent upon an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, lacks a classical signal sequence for zzso thereby making it difficult to evaluate regulation of biological activity by this growth zzso Efforts in this laboratory have zzso molecular techniques of zzso and transgenic modeling to introduce zzso sequences zzso either an zzso or zzso form of zzso into primary zzso cells to examine trafficking and zzso of zzso Several lines of evidence obtained from these models provide a compelling argument that the stimulation of zzso cellular transformation is restricted to an zzso zzso pathway, involving protein zzso zzso and nuclear zzso In addition, an unconventional zzso zzso for zzso zzso has been identified that involves mechanisms associated with zzso zzso
