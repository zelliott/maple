The impact of zzso zzso on insulin production needs to be understood both to zzso the derivation of functional zzso for transplantation and to understand mechanisms controlling zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we present evidence that zzso to some common zzso constituents has a profound impact on the transcription, zzso and storage of insulin by human zzso The zzso zzso of fetal zzso to both collagen IV and zzso zzso significant zzso insulin zzso and a substantial zzso decline in insulin zzso zzso IV, but not zzso zzso comparable responses in adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates zzso insulin zzso and effectively preserves the insulin content of adherent zzso Using real-time zzso we demonstrate that zzso of both fetal and adult zzso to collagen IV and zzso also results in the marked suppression of insulin gene zzso Based on these findings, we contend that zzso zzso and signaling in response to certain zzso can have a significant negative impact on insulin production by primary human zzso Such responses were not found to be associated with cell death but may zzso zzso zzso
