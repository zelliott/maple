zzso is a unique member of zzso zzso zzso a regulatory zzso repeat zzso domain and functions in signaling pathways that control many cellular zzso We reported previously that zzso proteins directly associate with several zzso proteins and lead to zzso the interactions of zzso proteins with their client zzso Here, we identified protein zzso 5 zzso as a novel target of zzso zzso In zzso binding studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins specifically interact with zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso proteins activate zzso by using a synthetic zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced zzso of zzso However, zzso and permanently active zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso interaction, resulting the zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso The association of the zzso proteins with zzso provides a zzso regulatory mechanism for the zzso status of zzso proteins through the regulation of zzso zzso activity or zzso protein zzso
