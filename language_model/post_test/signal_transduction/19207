zzso of leaves and stem is a key trait for survival of zzso plants during shallow but prolonged floods that completely submerge the zzso However, natural floods at different locations vary strongly in duration and depth, and, therefore, populations from these locations are subjected to different selection pressure, leading to zzso zzso Here, we identified the signal zzso component that causes response variation in shoot zzso among two zzso of the zzso plant zzso zzso These zzso differed zzso in zzso zzso rates upon zzso with fast zzso found in a population from a river zzso and slow zzso in plants from a lake zzso Fast zzso zzso under water zzso carbohydrates and depends on the zzso of the plant hormones zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso We found that zzso levels and dynamics in shoots did not differ between the fast and slow zzso plants, but that the level of zzso zzso acid in zzso and hence zzso acid responsiveness of these zzso explained the difference in shoot zzso upon zzso Since this is the exact signal zzso level that also explains the variation in zzso shoot zzso among plant species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we suggest that natural selection results in similar modification of regulatory pathways within and between zzso
