The mechanisms by which the zzso of zzso zzso a protein essential to the actions of the zzso family of zzso zzso is translated into signals that zzso on the zzso zzso factors are not fully zzso The zzso structure of zzso has long implied the zzso of zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso however, evidence in this regard has been indirect and zzso In the current study we evaluated the capacity of zzso zzso to couple to G proteins zzso We found that zzso by virtue of what appears to be zzso activity, activates all members of the zzso family but does not activate members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is suppressed by zzso and other zzso of zzso signaling and is enhanced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is essential in the zzso of zzso in zzso because disruption of zzso to zzso with zzso toxin zzso the zzso of zzso by Sonic zzso and a zzso active form of zzso zzso However, zzso does not provide a sufficient signal because a truncated form of zzso although capable of zzso zzso does not effect zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by Sonic zzso can be achieved with a zzso active zzso The data suggest that zzso is in fact the source of two signals relevant to the zzso of zzso one involving zzso and the other involving events at zzso zzso independent of zzso
