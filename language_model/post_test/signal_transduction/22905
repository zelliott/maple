In human B cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known to activate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which in turn regulate many important B cell zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso activated the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that another zzso zzso is activated by both zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line and zzso B zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso and zzso zzso triggered through the B cell zzso whereas zzso of zzso and zzso through zzso was not zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso and partially inhibited zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso treatment, but did not affect zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso zzso signaling pathways were shown to be zzso in contrast to the zzso signaling zzso Thus, the B cell zzso and zzso recruit the zzso zzso and zzso pathways by using different upstream zzso
