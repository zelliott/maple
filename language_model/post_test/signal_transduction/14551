zzso Y zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso play a central role in stimulation of zzso They sense and integrate peripheral and central signals, including zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms of interaction of these hormones in zzso zzso are largely zzso This study explored the interaction and underlying signaling cross talk between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso in single zzso isolated from ARC of adult rats was measured by zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso of ARC zzso The zzso increases were inhibited by zzso of zzso C, zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso increases were suppressed by subsequent administration of zzso Fifteen of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso suppression of zzso responses was prevented by zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso did not prevent and mimic zzso suppression, zzso Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso neither zzso inhibitor nor genetic zzso deletion altered zzso suppression of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso effect of zzso zzso in rats was zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso increases zzso via mechanisms depending on zzso C and zzso zzso pathways in ARC zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso responses via a zzso zzso zzso This interaction may play an important role in regulating ARC zzso zzso activity and, zzso zzso
