The zzso zzso has been proposed to be a major player in plant zzso However, understanding the role of zzso in this process is far from zzso To address this problem, we conducted an analysis of the effect of zzso B zzso B), a potent zzso drug, on root zzso using various parameters that included detailed zzso zzso zzso of zzso sensitivity, and monitoring of zzso development after extended zzso zzso B treatment resulted in a promotion of root zzso after a 90 degrees zzso in three plant species zzso More significantly, the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso roots to gravity was enhanced after zzso zzso as determined from a comparison of presentation time of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso A short zzso zzso followed by extended rotation on a zzso zzso resulted in extensive zzso responses, zzso as zzso that often exceeded 90 zzso Application of zzso B to the cap or zzso zone of zzso roots resulted in the disruption of the zzso zzso which was confined to the area of localized zzso B zzso Only roots with zzso B applied to the cap displayed the strong zzso responses after extended zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso the zzso zzso in the cap leads to the persistence of a signal established by a previous zzso zzso zzso could function in root zzso by providing a mechanism to regulate the proliferation of a zzso signal originating from the cap to allow the root to attain its correct orientation or set point zzso
