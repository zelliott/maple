Although mood disorders have traditionally been zzso as zzso zzso considerable literature from a variety of sources demonstrates significant reductions in regional central nervous system zzso volume and cell numbers (both zzso and zzso in persons with mood zzso It is noteworthy that recent advances in cellular and molecular biology have resulted in the identification of 2 novel, zzso completely unexpected targets of zzso actions, discoveries that may have a major impact on the future use of this unique zzso in biology and zzso zzso zzso treatment has been demonstrated to markedly increase the levels of the major zzso protein zzso in rat frontal cortex, zzso and zzso Similar zzso increases in zzso are also observed in cells of human zzso origin and are observed in rat frontal zzso at zzso levels as low as approximately zzso zzso zzso is widely regarded as a major zzso zzso and genetic strategies that increase zzso levels have demonstrated not only robust protection of zzso against diverse zzso but have also demonstrated an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been demonstrated to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso known to regulate the levels of zzso zzso and zzso (both of which may play a role in the zzso observed in certain forms of Alzheimer's zzso zzso with the increases in zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso has been demonstrated to exert robust protective effects against diverse insults both in zzso and in zzso These findings suggest that zzso may exert some of its long-term beneficial effects in the treatment of mood disorders via underappreciated zzso and zzso zzso To date, zzso remains the only medication demonstrated to markedly increase zzso levels in several brain zzso in the absence of other adequate treatments, an investigation of the potential efficacy of zzso in the long-term treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders is zzso Additionally, we suggest that a zzso of the use of zzso in mood disorders may be zzso that the use of zzso as a zzso agent should be considered in the long-term treatment of mood disorders, irrespective of the zzso treatment zzso being used for the zzso
