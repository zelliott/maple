The basis for the hypersensitive response of zzso zzso to zzso stimulation was investigated in adult rat zzso isolated from normal and zzso zzso To assess potential zzso involvement in the response, normal and diabetic derived zzso were incubated with either zzso or zzso toxin prior to hormonal zzso zzso of zzso with zzso toxin resulted in a zzso response to zzso stimulation whereas zzso toxin did not affect the zzso of this signaling zzso To determine if the enhanced response of zzso zzso resulted from an zzso in zzso zzso zzso the cells were challenged with zzso After 3 zzso in primary culture, diabetic zzso exhibited a hypersensitive response to zzso stimulation relative to normal zzso However, after 24 zzso in culture, both normal and diabetic zzso responded zzso to zzso zzso The present data suggest that a zzso toxin sensitive zzso mediates the hypersensitive response of zzso zzso to zzso stimulation in diabetic zzso and this response which is present in zzso cells and is induced in zzso in normal zzso is primarily due to a zzso at a zzso zzso
