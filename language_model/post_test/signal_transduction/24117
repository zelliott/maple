The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso trafficking and play an important role in host immune zzso However, the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are not completely zzso In the present study, we examined the role of the membrane zzso zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso We observed a significant reduction in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso as compared with the zzso control zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein containing the zzso zzso domain of zzso was able to partially restore zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso into the zzso cells restored the zzso zzso to about zzso zzso had no significant effect on zzso or human zzso virus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells showed a slight enhancement in zzso zzso zzso activity as compared with the zzso zzso We also observed that zzso treatment enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso and induced its association with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso raft zzso zzso blocked the association between zzso and zzso and markedly abolished zzso zzso Comparisons of signaling pathways induced by zzso in zzso and zzso cells revealed that zzso might moderately regulate the zzso zzso of the focal zzso components the related zzso focal zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has also been shown to regulate zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso by modulating the activities of focal zzso components and the downstream zzso of the zzso zzso
