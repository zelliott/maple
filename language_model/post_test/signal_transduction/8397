zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is a nuclear zzso expressed in a large number of human zzso and plays important roles in breast cancer cell zzso Its association with zzso features and zzso signaling pathway, a crucial factor in embryonic and zzso development, in breast cancer has not been reported zzso In the present study, expression patterns, interaction and the correlations with zzso factors of zzso and zzso were investigated among patients with breast zzso 

Using zzso we performed a study on 70 zzso human breast tumors and compared the protein expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then analyzed between zzso level of these molecules and major zzso variables and zzso Furthermore, western zzso zzso analysis before and after zzso with zzso and zzso were performed on breast cancer zzso and cell lines to evaluate their protein level and molecular zzso 

We showed that zzso expression was of significant zzso value in the outcome of breast zzso which positively correlated with zzso status zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso grade zzso zzso zzso tumor size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso expression zzso zzso zzso whereas no correlation was seen between zzso and age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso survival zzso of the study population showed that high expression level of zzso significantly correlated with long-term zzso zzso interaction could also be demonstrated between zzso and zzso both in breast cancer cell lines and tissue zzso 

On the basis of these results, we suggested that zzso might serve as a future target for the development of novel treatments in breast zzso
