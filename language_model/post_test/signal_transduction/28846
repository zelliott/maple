zzso of zzso receptors zzso to the zzso region of muscle is zzso in part by zzso mechanisms, because the genes zzso zzso zzso are transcribed selectively in synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso is a synaptic signal and zzso zzso of zzso in muscle zzso Signaling by zzso is thought to involve the zzso factor zzso protein zzso a zzso of zzso which is a member of the zzso family, and zzso zzso of certain other zzso proteins outside the zzso zzso domain serves to stimulate zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso According to previous studies, zzso stimulates zzso of zzso at zzso 280 in the zzso region adjacent to the zzso domain, suggesting that zzso zzso might contribute to zzso zzso To determine the functional importance of the zzso region of zzso and whether its function is regulated by zzso we generated muscle cell lines in which the zzso zzso gene was deleted and replaced by zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We found that zzso can induce zzso in cells with zzso zzso zzso site, indicating that zzso zzso does not contribute to zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso occurs in cells missing the entire zzso region of zzso Because zzso signaling is not expected to alter the function of the zzso region, which remains in these cells, these results suggest that zzso or other interacting zzso rather than zzso directly, is targeted by zzso zzso
