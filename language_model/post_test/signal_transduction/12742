The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso induced changes in zzso metabolism was zzso In the simultaneous presence of the zzso zzso failed to stimulate the zzso zzso turnover of the major zzso The precursor zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso after pulse labeling in zzso zzso Thus, the reduction of the zzso zzso turnover did not appear to result from an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso exerted an zzso effect on the zzso liberation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso rise in the zzso level was reduced in the presence of the zzso Thus, these results provide evidence that the zzso zzso a zzso zzso C activity in the intact zzso
