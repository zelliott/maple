zzso of cell surface receptors plays an important role in regulating cell signaling zzso In some cases, zzso of an activated zzso zzso the signaling process, while in other cases the zzso of activated receptors on early zzso structures has been proposed to be essential for fully zzso signaling zzso zzso the movement of receptors and other signaling proteins through the zzso pathway, therefore, has a direct impact on cellular zzso The small zzso zzso is a crucial regulatory component of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso exchange factors zzso that generate the zzso zzso A large number of proteins have been identified that contain a specific, highly zzso domain zzso that zzso zzso exchange on zzso linking the regulation of cell signaling zzso with zzso zzso trafficking through the zzso zzso
