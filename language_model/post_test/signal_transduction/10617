zzso zzso induced by growth factor stimulation is caused by zzso zzso which is zzso by various signaling molecules including zzso We have shown that zzso which binds zzso zzso is one such zzso required for membrane zzso in mouse kidney zzso Here, we show that zzso directly binds to zzso The zzso expressed zzso region of zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggesting direct binding of zzso to zzso The binding was much weaker in muscle zzso A truncated zzso of zzso containing only the zzso region readily zzso with zzso supporting this zzso zzso zzso does not zzso with zzso unless cells are zzso with growth factors, suggesting the presence of a zzso regulatory mechanism for zzso activity in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lacking this binding domain zzso the membrane zzso induced by zzso growth factor stimulation in zzso zzso This zzso effect is also observed in membrane zzso induced by a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso with zzso These results suggest that the binding activity of zzso to zzso zzso is required for membrane zzso
