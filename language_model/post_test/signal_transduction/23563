zzso zzso zzso have been identified as low molecular weight zzso agents associated with occupational asthma and compromised pulmonary zzso zzso of adult onset asthma result, in part, from increased signal zzso by Type I zzso receptors zzso leading to release of zzso compounds including zzso from mast zzso Exposure to zzso typically occurs in the form of particles which are zzso Upon contact with water or biological zzso zzso form a series of soluble zzso one of which is zzso zzso zzso zzso which is structurally related to a common zzso oxide, that is zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate whether zzso may be initiating plasma membrane events associated with zzso of zzso signal zzso We show that exposure of zzso cells to zzso causes a zzso increase in zzso of zzso and, in addition, an increase in plasma membrane zzso packing as measured by the fluorescent probe, zzso zzso also increases zzso zzso in zzso membrane fragments, zzso zzso zzso which may facilitate zzso zzso To determine whether zzso effects on plasma membrane zzso packing were similarly observed in zzso zzso formed from zzso zzso the extent of zzso packing in the presence and absence of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso increased the surface area of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso decreased the surface area by zzso These results are consistent with zzso interacting with this class of membrane lipids and altering zzso zzso
