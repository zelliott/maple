The ability of zzso coli to use both nitrate and zzso as terminal electron zzso during zzso growth is zzso by the zzso zzso regulatory systems zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso responds only to zzso it expresses only zzso We have shown that although zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso is unable to regulate gene expression in zzso zzso zzso experiments have revealed zzso in zzso coli zzso that are essential for nitrate and zzso zzso zzso proteins revealed zzso of zzso that are important for zzso zzso
