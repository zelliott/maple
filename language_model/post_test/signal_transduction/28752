Clinical observations demonstrate that women with breast cancer often respond to subsequent zzso manipulation after resistance to initial hormonal therapy zzso As a zzso explanation for these findings, we hypothesized that human breast tumors can adapt in response to the pressure exerted by zzso therapy with development of hypersensitivity to zzso To understand the signaling pathways responsible, we examined zzso stimulation of cell proliferation in a model system and provided in zzso and in zzso evidence that long-term deprivation of zzso zzso causes zzso zzso Even though the zzso zzso alpha zzso is markedly zzso in zzso cells, the enhanced responses to zzso do not appear to involve mechanisms acting at the level of zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso a classical growth factor zzso and zzso rapid zzso effects that are enhanced in zzso zzso zzso binds to cell zzso zzso physically associates with the zzso protein zzso and zzso its zzso In turn, zzso binds zzso and zzso which result in the rapid zzso of zzso protein zzso These zzso effects of zzso produced biological effects, as evidenced by zzso zzso and by zzso changes in cell zzso The zzso pathways involved in zzso hypersensitivity suggest that zzso of the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso pathways might prevent the development of zzso hypersensitivity and allow more prolonged efficacy of zzso zzso
