We introduce here the concept of zzso networks which zzso like zzso networks, a zzso zzso framework that encodes the joint probability distribution for a set of random variables within a directed zzso zzso We show that zzso networks, when used in conjunction with appropriate statistical techniques, are very attractive for their ability to understand and analyze biological zzso zzso we consider here the use of zzso networks for zzso zzso in zzso zzso In such zzso an zzso network encodes zzso among variables zzso zzso can be trained to learn zzso relationships zzso zzso between them and then used to predict the biological response given the status of some key proteins or genes in the zzso We show that zzso networks offer efficient zzso for learning from observations without prior knowledge and thus provide a good alternative to classical zzso in zzso networks when zzso are zzso We illustrate our approach by an application to simulated data for a simplified signal zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso
