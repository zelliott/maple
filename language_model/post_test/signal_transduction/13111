To investigate the role of insulin signaling on zzso cardiac development, zzso and cardiac zzso we generated mice with a zzso insulin zzso knockout zzso using zzso zzso Hearts of zzso mice were reduced in size by zzso due to reduced zzso size and had persistent expression of the fetal zzso heavy chain zzso In zzso hearts, zzso zzso 1 zzso expression was reduced by about zzso but there was a twofold increase in zzso expression as well as increased rates of cardiac zzso zzso in zzso and increased zzso in isolated working zzso zzso acid zzso rates were diminished as a result of reduced expression of zzso that catalyze zzso zzso Although zzso rates of zzso zzso were reduced, insulin unexpectedly zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso performance in zzso and in isolated hearts was mildly zzso Thus, insulin signaling plays an important zzso role in regulating zzso cardiac size, zzso zzso zzso and the switching of cardiac zzso zzso from zzso to fatty zzso zzso may also zzso cardiac zzso metabolism through zzso mechanisms by zzso insulin receptors in other cell types within the zzso
