zzso zzso zzso has been a recognized herbal medicine across Northeast Asian countries for thousands of years and used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases through as yet undefined zzso In this study, we set out to determine whether the zzso effects of this plant are zzso to suppress zzso protein zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso fraction of TO zzso and zzso with zzso zzso oxide zzso release was determined by the zzso of zzso in the culture zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were evaluated via zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was also evaluated by reporter gene zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso In addition, the protective effect of zzso was evaluated by use of the zzso zzso shock model in zzso 

We found that zzso significantly suppressed zzso NO and zzso production without affecting cell zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein and their zzso zzso Also, zzso and zzso zzso were decreased by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso As a result, zzso inhibited zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso which is hypothesized as being due to the suppression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso improved the survival rate during lethal zzso by zzso the production of zzso in an animal model and our zzso analysis showed that a major component of zzso was zzso 

We demonstrate here the evidence that the zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso potentially zzso the zzso related to inflammation in zzso and in zzso and might be provided as a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory zzso
