zzso signaling in zzso coli involves transmission of both negative and positive zzso In order to examine mechanisms of signal processing, behavioral responses to dual zzso have been measured by using zzso zzso compounds, computer video analysis, and zzso deletion zzso Signaling from zzso and zzso two receptors that sense zzso acids and zzso was zzso In a zzso deletion zzso the zzso release of zzso a zzso zzso and of zzso a zzso zzso in separate experiments at pH zzso resulted in tumbling zzso or zzso zzso responses in zzso 50 and 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a single tumbling or zzso response, depending on the relative amounts of the two zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso coli, zzso release at pH zzso resulted in a zzso response that was attributed to zzso tumbling followed by zzso zzso In zzso zzso coli at more alkaline pH values the zzso signal was stronger than the zzso zzso resulting in a strong zzso response preceded by a diminished tumbling zzso These observations imply that zzso a single zzso zzso the binding of different zzso zzso generating a single zzso zzso zzso binding to different receptors can result in a zzso response with the tumbling response preceding the zzso zzso zzso however, zzso signals of different zzso derived from different receptors can also result in an apparently integrated zzso and zzso the different zzso responses to zzso at neutral and alkaline pH may contribute to zzso coli migration toward zzso
