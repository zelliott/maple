Most cellular systems, from zzso to genetic networks, have more than one zzso Examples involving networks include the zzso regulation circuits formed by zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso which function in both early and later zzso zzso Does the need to carry out more than one function severely zzso network zzso Does it imply zzso zzso among zzso That is, if one function is highly robust to zzso are other functions highly sensitive, and vice zzso Little available evidence speaks to these zzso We address them with a general model of zzso regulation zzso We show that requiring a regulatory network to carry out additional functions zzso the number of permissible network zzso zzso However, zzso of one function to regulatory zzso is zzso or zzso positively correlated to zzso of other zzso This means that zzso zzso generally do not arise in the systems we zzso As long as there are many alternative network structures, each of which can fulfill all required functions, multiple functions may acquire high zzso through gradual zzso zzso
