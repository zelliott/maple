The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso and is involved not only in cell transformation but also in tumor escape to zzso zzso Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms by which this signaling zzso zzso resistance to DNA damage remain most of the time to be zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso is activated in response to zzso I zzso After treatment, this signaling cascade induced the zzso of zzso and the binding of the zzso factor to the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in the processing of DNA damage after zzso I zzso These results suggest a model by which the zzso zzso of zzso prevents DNA damage and enhances cell survival in response to zzso zzso This survival zzso was inhibited by a combined treatment with a zzso zzso zzso and with zzso a zzso zzso directed against the zzso that is widely used in the treatment of zzso zzso We therefore propose that the benefit of zzso therapy relies on an increase of DNA damage generated by zzso I zzso
