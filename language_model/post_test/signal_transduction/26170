During the formation of neural circuitry, zzso are known to be guided to their specific targets by a relatively small arsenal of guidance zzso However, the molecular integration of this guidance information inside the zzso growth cone zzso is still zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which interacts with a complex molecular network via multiple zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso is required by both attractive and repulsive cues to control respectively zzso outgrowth and zzso of adhesive structures together with zzso zzso It was suggested that zzso might work as a versatile molecular zzso switching to different functions depending on its zzso zzso Two studies published recently by our group and Woo et zzso shed light on this issue: for the first time, these works report a detailed molecular analysis of zzso zzso and zzso pattern in primary zzso cultures in response to the repulsive cues zzso and zzso zzso Here we comment on the major zzso provided by these papers in the context of previous literature and we speculate on the future avenues of investigation opened by these zzso
