Using a concerted approach of zzso standard preparation, zzso access via zzso zzso pulse, zzso zzso and statistical data analysis, the metabolism dynamics in the aromatic zzso acid zzso has been zzso zzso and analyzed in different zzso zzso zzso coli zzso During the observation window from zzso s zzso up to 27 s after the zzso pulse, the dynamics of the first five zzso reactions in the aromatic zzso acid zzso was observed by measuring zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the zzso precursors zzso zzso and zzso the lumped zzso zzso pool as an alternative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that a sufficient zzso of the carbon flux into the zzso of interest is zzso respective metabolism dynamics can be zzso On the basis of the zzso pool zzso the standardized pool zzso were zzso and a simple, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite its simplifying system description, the criterion managed to identify the well-known zzso limitation in the zzso coli strain A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it also succeeded to identify zzso and zzso (in strain B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as promising zzso engineering targets to alleviate respective flux control in subsequent zzso producing zzso Furthermore, using of a simple correlation analysis, the reconstruction of the zzso sequence of the observed zzso was zzso The results underline the necessity to extend the focus of zzso pulse experiments by studying not only the central metabolism but also anabolic zzso
