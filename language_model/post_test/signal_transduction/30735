zzso zzso and other zzso exert important zzso actions in insects and other zzso including influencing zzso transport and zzso cellular immune defense zzso Although these actions are very well zzso we have no information on the mechanisms of zzso actions in insect zzso Here we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to test our hypothesis that zzso zzso gene expression in an insect cell line established from zzso zzso tissue of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We treated cells with either zzso or zzso for 12 or zzso then analyzed cell zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of the gels by zzso revealed substantial changes in protein expression in some of the protein spots we zzso These spots were processed for mass zzso analysis by zzso zzso which yielded in zzso protein identities for all 34 zzso The apparent changes in three of the proteins were confirmed by zzso zzso showing that the changes in zzso expression were reflected in changes in protein zzso The 34 proteins were sorted into six categories, protein actions, zzso zzso signal zzso protection, cell functions and zzso The findings support the hypothesis that one mechanism of PG action in insect cells is the zzso of gene zzso
