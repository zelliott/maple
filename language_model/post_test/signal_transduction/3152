zzso loss of zzso results in cancer zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso might therefore be an attractive option for cancer prevention and zzso We have generated several transgenic mouse lines with zzso expression elevated to varying levels by taking advantage of bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are viable and show reduced body size due to decreased cell number, with no effect on cell zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level results in healthy metabolism characterized by increased energy expenditure and reduced body fat zzso zzso derived from these mice show reduced zzso and zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso and are resistant to zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso zzso this zzso switch by regulating zzso and zzso pathways and zzso zzso two of the most pronounced zzso features of tumor zzso zzso and the Warburg zzso
