This article reviews literature up to zzso covering recent developments pertaining to zzso zzso signaling in various cell zzso A large amount of experimental evidence supports a mechanism involving specific zzso zzso proteins zzso as zzso factors between occupancy of a wide variety of receptors by many different zzso and zzso of zzso specific zzso C zzso Although many different zzso and zzso C zzso have been zzso and zzso successful zzso of the components has not been zzso zzso many questions concerning the specificity of zzso between particular receptors to a particular zzso and zzso C zzso remain zzso zzso C zzso isolated from the membrane and soluble zzso of the cell are directly activated by zzso and, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso is to stimulate zzso zzso breakdown at free zzso zzso zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso evidence supports the concept that zzso zzso the product of zzso zzso is responsible for the initial zzso zzso transient by zzso of zzso from a specialized zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been zzso that may zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gated zzso zzso Despite a growing understanding of the complexities of the metabolism of zzso zzso and a successful zzso of many zzso involved, including the zzso zzso that converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso as a putative second zzso remains zzso Multiple forms of protein zzso C have been described and the role is well established for a zzso the second product of zzso zzso as its zzso zzso Although protein zzso C has been shown to zzso and zzso the activity of several proteins involved in the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso the zzso significance of the protein zzso C in zzso cell function requires further zzso The extension of zzso of zzso zzso changes to single cells has shown that the occurrence of zzso zzso is a common zzso zzso of the zzso mechanisms causing this zzso response and its zzso significance represents an important challenge for future zzso
