We study spectral behavior of sparsely connected random networks under the random zzso zzso zzso without any connection among them form a network having perfect community zzso As connections among the zzso are introduced, the spacing distribution shows a transition from the zzso statistics to the zzso zzso ensemble statistics of random zzso zzso The zzso density distribution shows a transition to the zzso semicircular behavior for a completely zzso zzso The range for which spectral zzso measured by the zzso zzso statistics, follows the zzso zzso ensemble statistics depends upon the deformation of the network from the perfect community zzso The spacing distribution is particularly useful to track very slight zzso of the network from a perfect community structure, whereas the density distribution and the zzso statistics remain identical to the zzso zzso On the other hand the zzso statistics is useful for the larger deformation zzso Finally, we analyze the spectrum of a zzso interaction network for zzso and compare the spectral behavior with those of the model zzso
