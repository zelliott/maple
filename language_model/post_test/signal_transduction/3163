The established causes of zzso zzso include defects of the zzso zzso and zzso The latter condition is also characterized by severe zzso A recent case with short zzso zzso resistance, and zzso due to an zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso may interact with zzso zzso 

Here, we present a case of a short child with several zzso anomalies as well as zzso zzso and mild zzso associated with a mosaic de zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of one of the duplicated genes may be implicated in zzso zzso 

In zzso studies on blood zzso showed disturbed signaling of the zzso pathway, involving zzso and related zzso zzso studies on cultured skin zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso in response to zzso were zzso while the sensitivity to zzso in terms of zzso zzso was zzso An in zzso analysis of the duplicated genes showed that zzso and zzso are associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso blasts zzso was normal, but zzso expression in zzso and zzso was significantly higher than that in control zzso 

We conclude that the zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and disturbed zzso zzso and zzso zzso possibly due to zzso zzso zzso
