Although zzso is a well-known zzso factor, the cellular mechanisms of zzso toxicity are less zzso Up to now, the main focus of zzso toxicity has been on zzso and zzso Despite the significance of zzso in neurodegenerative diseases, little is known about their responsiveness to zzso In the present study, we found that zzso triggered zzso at zzso between 30 zzso and zzso zzso but zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso Most zzso cells showed an zzso of condensed zzso at the nuclear zzso zzso of the plasma zzso formation of zzso bodies and an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso suppressed zzso zzso Surprisingly, some zzso cells exposed to zzso displayed clear signs of zzso catastrophe, a type of cell death occurring during zzso In a further series of experiments, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso because zzso zzso zzso elevated the zzso zzso level, zzso blockade of the zzso zzso by zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or by the zzso inhibitor zzso increased the relative number of zzso cells, and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the effect of zzso and triggered zzso Taken together, our results indicate that distinct zzso of zzso trigger opposite zzso pathways in zzso zzso
