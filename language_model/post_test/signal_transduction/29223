Emerging data in myeloma and other zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso promote tumor progression by enhancing their growth and zzso By acting as key regulators of cell signaling via their interactions with multiple growth and zzso factors, zzso zzso mediate a shift in the zzso that supports the tumor as an zzso and promotes an aggressive tumor zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso provides a mechanism for zzso localized and dynamic zzso of zzso function thereby tightly regulating activities within the tumor zzso New data from animal models demonstrates that zzso zzso or the zzso that regulate zzso zzso are viable targets for cancer zzso This strategy of targeting zzso zzso may be particularly effective for attacking zzso like myeloma where extensive genetic chaos renders them unlikely to respond well to agents that target a single signaling zzso
