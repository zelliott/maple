As organisms zzso evolve to a new environment, selection results in the improvement of certain traits, bringing about an increase in zzso zzso may result from this process if function in other traits is reduced in alternative environments either by the zzso zzso themselves or by the zzso of neutral zzso elsewhere in the zzso Though the cost of adaptation has long been a fundamental premise in evolutionary biology, the existence of and molecular basis for zzso in alternative environments are not zzso Here, we show that zzso evolved under zzso zzso limitation show surprisingly few zzso when cultured in other zzso zzso under either zzso or zzso zzso However, while zzso clones consistently outperform their common zzso under carbon limiting conditions, in some cases they perform less well than their zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso can appear when resources are zzso To more deeply understand how adaptation to one condition affects performance in others, we determined zzso transcript abundance of zzso clones grown under diverse conditions and performed zzso sequencing to identify zzso that distinguish them from one another and from their common zzso We identified zzso in genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso which, when considered in the context of the expression data, help explain their adaptation to carbon poor zzso However, different sets of zzso in each independently evolved clone indicate that multiple zzso paths lead to the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso that evolve high fitness under one zzso condition also become more fit under other zzso conditions, but may pay a fitness cost when those same resources are zzso
