zzso growth factor beta zzso induced differentiation of human lung zzso to zzso is a key event in the zzso of pulmonary zzso Although the typical zzso signaling zzso involves the zzso family of zzso factors, we have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso differentiation of human lung zzso to zzso via a zzso zzso zzso also activates the zzso 3 zzso zzso B zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit human zzso differentiation of normal and idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso zzso by blocking zzso zzso at zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso inactive zzso zzso of zzso both inhibited zzso zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso for zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a structural analogue of zzso with an zzso center, also reduced zzso zzso of zzso while zzso another analogue that lacks an zzso center, did not; zzso that the activity of zzso and zzso is dependent on their zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso This zzso is independent of zzso and zzso but is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso a zzso that acts upstream of zzso Thus, zzso zzso inhibit zzso signaling by affecting two zzso pathways that culminate in zzso zzso Further studies of zzso zzso and small zzso molecules may lead to a new generation of zzso zzso
