zzso interference zzso in plants has long been known to produce a zzso autonomous signal capable of zzso target genes over great cellular zzso However, only recently have zzso small zzso been formally shown to comprise that mobile zzso Interestingly, some of these mobile small zzso play critical roles in plant development, forming zzso that regulate the activity of their targets in a zzso zzso These properties resemble features of zzso in animals, leading us to zzso that such zzso small zzso employ similar principles for the generation, stabilization and interpretation of their expression zzso Here we review our understanding of small zzso mobility in plants, evaluate their potential as zzso signals, and consider how the graded zzso patterns that zzso their zzso activity could be created and zzso
