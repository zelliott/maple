Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso This study explored the zzso effect of zzso on zzso induced liver zzso in rats and its zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso healthy male zzso rats were randomly assigned to six groups: normal zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three treatment groups of zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso We zzso changes in deposition of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso collagen type IV zzso zzso III zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The relative indicators of changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were raised significantly in the induced zzso group zzso zzso zzso vs normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso staging scores of middle dose group and high dose group were decreased zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively vs the induced zzso group), as was the average area of collagen in zzso liver, the zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver tissue zzso zzso The gene expression of zzso zzso was considerably decreased in the treated animals, as was the protein zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is effective in reducing the production and deposition of collagen in the liver tissue of experimental rats in ways which relate to modulating the zzso signal zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso
