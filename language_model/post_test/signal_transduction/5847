zzso zzso differentiation involves sexually zzso zzso decisions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation is initiated by a zzso wave of zzso expression that zzso supporting cell precursors zzso to become zzso rather than zzso zzso The initiation of zzso differentiation is less well zzso We identified two novel SCP zzso zzso and zzso whose expression is zzso during early zzso development, and altered in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso both genes were zzso at approximately E11 in a zzso wave, and then rapidly zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso wave, which is reminiscent of zzso expression in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso may have important roles in early zzso development, and are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso SCP differentiation occurs in a zzso wave with similar timing to that of zzso SCP zzso
