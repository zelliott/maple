Most zzso of the 26 S zzso are recognized only following zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso is one member of a family of proteins that possesses an zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso interact with 26 S zzso whereas zzso bind zzso zzso These zzso properties suggest that zzso proteins may shuttle zzso zzso to zzso Here we show that contrary to prediction from this model, the effect of human zzso on the degradation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is exclusively zzso Strong zzso is dependent on the presence of both zzso independent of the zzso and can be explained by competition between the zzso zzso and the zzso for binding to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso bind zzso zzso chains in strong preference to zzso or zzso zzso leading to selective zzso of the assembly and zzso of zzso zzso These results place constraints on the zzso by which zzso proteins promote zzso zzso and reveal new properties of zzso zzso
