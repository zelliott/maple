A variety of zzso and nuclear proteins can be modified on zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso although the effects of this modification on protein and cellular functions are not completely zzso The sugar donor for the zzso zzso that zzso this zzso modification is zzso zzso a product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the dynamics of the zzso modification are examined in the zzso context of zzso signal zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to stimulate a rapid and transient increase in protein zzso in both zzso and zzso imaging zzso using zzso zzso In high performance liquid zzso analyses of zzso zzso activity, short term exposure to an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leads to increased zzso zzso and then zzso zzso The zzso treatments also increase zzso and augment the aforementioned zzso zzso In functional zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso but has little effect on respiratory burst zzso Furthermore, zzso levels of zzso in the absence of zzso is sufficient to stimulate zzso These data demonstrate that zzso possess a functionally significant zzso zzso that is robustly induced by stimulation with zzso We propose that zzso plays an important role in rapid and dynamic zzso signal zzso especially with respect to zzso
