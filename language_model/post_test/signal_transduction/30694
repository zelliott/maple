zzso of zzso greatly improves zzso T cell function and zzso Previously, we showed that both zzso engagement and zzso blockade led to enhanced zzso T cell expansion, but only zzso signaling increased zzso To identify pathways associated with zzso survival, the gene expression of zzso zzso T cells isolated from mice treated with zzso and zzso was zzso This comparison revealed a potential role for zzso through increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso on T cells activated 3 days previously with zzso and zzso The zzso expression of zzso on zzso zzso T cells was tightly regulated and peaked approximately 4-6 days after initial zzso but before the beginning of T cell zzso zzso zzso during this window of zzso zzso was required for enhanced T cell survival and survival was associated with zzso zzso The findings from these observations were exploited in several different mouse tumor models where we found that the combination of zzso and zzso showed synergistic therapeutic zzso These results may lead to the zzso of the molecular pathways involved with zzso T cell survival that contribute to improved memory, and understanding of these pathways could lead to greater efficacy of immune zzso zzso in zzso zzso
