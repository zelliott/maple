In the study of zzso failures on complex networks, a key issue is to define capacities of edges and zzso as realistically as zzso This leads to the consideration of intrinsic edge capacity associated with laws governing flows on networks, which goes beyond the existing definitions of capacity based on the initial load as zzso by the zzso zzso Limited edge capacity (or zzso and high flux or attack can trigger zzso zzso which we find as characteristically different from those reported in the zzso In particular, there can be an abnormal zzso regime where zzso zzso the edge capacity can zzso increase the zzso of the zzso zzso Another striking finding is that zzso flow distribution tends to suppress the zzso process, in contrast to the current understanding that zzso can make the network more vulnerable to zzso We provide zzso zzso and analysis to substantiate these zzso
