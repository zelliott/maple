zzso sensor zzso from two zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso by genes zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso The sensor zzso were isolated, zzso characterized in solution, and their crystal structures were zzso In the zzso both sensor zzso form swapped zzso and show a zzso zzso The swapped segment consists of two zzso of about 45 zzso at the N zzso with the zzso located between the two zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the zzso contains a zzso zzso symmetry and the zzso is coordinated by an zzso His and a water zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the zzso contain a zzso zzso and surprisingly, the coordination of the zzso in each zzso is zzso zzso A zzso has zzso zzso and zzso B zzso has zzso zzso as found in the zzso zzso The structures of these sensor zzso are the first structures of zzso zzso containing zzso bound zzso zzso zzso electron zzso resonance and zzso zzso have revealed that the zzso groups of both sensor zzso are zzso and zzso in the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively, and that the zzso zzso involves a zzso zzso zzso zzso Both sensor zzso bind NO in their zzso and zzso forms but bind CO only in the reduced zzso The binding of both NO and CO occurs via an zzso zzso exchange process, and is fully zzso The reduction zzso of the sensor zzso differ by 95 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for sensors zzso and zzso zzso The swapped zzso of these sensor zzso and zzso zzso switch might be related to the mechanism of signal zzso by these zzso zzso
