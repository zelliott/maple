The binding of a zzso to a zzso zzso represents a first step in zzso zzso information to the cell in order to activate downstream zzso signaling zzso This report describes the de zzso engineering of cells with a zzso signal zzso motif that is developed from first zzso The signaling event is initiated with a zzso zzso that clusters an engineered zzso in the zzso The zzso presents a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso when organized in a zzso but not in the zzso zzso The example described here may represent a motif that can be used in synthetic biology for the engineering of cells with novel zzso
