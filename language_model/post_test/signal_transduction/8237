In this report we define the genes of zzso regulatory systems in rice through a comprehensive zzso analysis of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso genes were identified, including 5 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 type B zzso genes zzso and 5 predicted zzso regulators zzso zzso motif organization, gene structure, zzso analysis, zzso location, and comparative analysis between rice, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso clones of each gene were isolated from zzso zzso expression of each of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function in a zzso zzso zzso regions of individual zzso were used as zzso in expression profiling zzso This work provides a foundation for future functional dissection of the rice zzso zzso signaling zzso
