The zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso is an important regulatory mechanism in growth factor zzso Studies on zzso zzso have focused on pathways that increase or decrease zzso oxygen species levels and thereby affect zzso zzso The processes involved in zzso of oxidized zzso remain largely zzso Here the role of the zzso zzso system in zzso of oxidized zzso was analyzed using a combination of in zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking the major zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed increased zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso was reduced by zzso added zzso system zzso whereas zzso zzso remained zzso zzso reduced oxidized zzso in zzso but failed to reactivate oxidized zzso Interestingly, the alternative zzso zzso zzso also zzso oxidized zzso but not zzso zzso cells displayed increased zzso of zzso zzso and an enhanced zzso response, after zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso This effect was not observed in cells specifically lacking zzso Together these results demonstrate that the zzso system, including both zzso and zzso impacts zzso on the zzso of individual zzso with a preference of zzso over zzso zzso The studies demonstrate a previously zzso zzso for selective zzso control of zzso zzso zzso zzso
