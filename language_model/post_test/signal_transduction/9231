The term zzso bystander effect is used to describe zzso biological changes that manifest in zzso cells remaining within an zzso cell zzso Despite their failure to fit into the framework of classical zzso zzso bystander effects have entered the mainstream and have become established in the zzso vocabulary as a bona fide radiation zzso However, there is still no consensus on a precise definition of zzso bystander effects, which currently encompasses a number of distinct zzso zzso These effects are classified here into three zzso bystander effects, zzso effects and cohort zzso In this review, the data have been evaluated to zzso where possible, various features specific to zzso bystander effects, including their timing, range, potency and dependence on dose, dose rate, radiation quality and cell zzso The weight of evidence supporting these defining features is discussed in the context of bystander experimental systems that closely replicate realistic human exposure zzso Whether the manifestation of bystander effects in zzso is zzso limited to particular radiation exposure scenarios is zzso The conditions under which zzso bystander effects are induced in zzso will ultimately determine their impact on zzso zzso zzso
