In zzso many daily cycles are driven by a central zzso clock, which is based on the zzso rhythmic expression of clock zzso It is not clear, however, how peripheral cells are able to interpret the rhythmic signals zzso from this central zzso Here we show that cycling expression of the clock gene zzso in zzso zzso cells depends on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which occurs through the nocturnal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the impact of the zzso zzso simultaneously suppresses the expression of zzso and evokes an increase in the release of zzso zzso Our findings expose a mechanism by which two zzso signals interact within a zzso dimension to establish zzso precise and robust cycles of gene zzso
