zzso is an zzso antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as zzso bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and zzso The drug shows partial zzso activity at zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity at zzso zzso However, the precise zzso pathways remain zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso cells, in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the effects of zzso although, only zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso a zzso of zzso zzso blocked the effects of zzso Moreover, specific zzso of several common signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked the effects of zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that zzso significantly increased levels of the heat shock protein zzso in cultured zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso outgrowth were significantly attenuated by treatment with zzso zzso zzso but not by the negative control of zzso These findings suggest that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling via zzso zzso as well as their downstream cellular signaling pathways play a role in the promotion of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increases in zzso protein expression may form part of the therapeutic mechanism for this zzso
