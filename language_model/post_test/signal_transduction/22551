zzso of zzso receptors often causes enhancement of the zzso zzso signal triggered by zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of this synergistic zzso zzso we studied the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells increased the potency and the efficacy of zzso zzso production by zzso or zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso resulted in a similar increase in potency and efficacy of zzso or zzso In contrast, these stimuli did not affect the potency of direct zzso of zzso a truncated zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso signals whereas signals generated at the zzso level were still zzso This suggests that the zzso signal enhancement occurs at the zzso zzso Almost all possible combinations of zzso with zzso were equally effective in enhancing the signals of the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso indicating a very broad specificity of this zzso The enhancement of the zzso signal by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso was suppressed when the zzso zzso was replaced by a zzso fusion zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso as determined by zzso decrease in high affinity zzso binding and by zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings support the concept that zzso exchange between zzso and zzso receptors mediates this type of zzso zzso
