The effects of inflammatory zzso on zzso T cells have been studied using zzso zzso complexes on zzso thus avoiding the use of zzso whose functions may be affected by the zzso zzso but not zzso increased proliferation of zzso T cells in response to zzso and zzso which is consistent with effects on in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, proliferation of zzso T cells to zzso and zzso required zzso and zzso replaced zzso in stimulating an in zzso response to zzso These results support a model in which distinct inflammatory zzso act directly on zzso zzso and zzso T cells to provide a third zzso along with zzso and zzso to zzso activate differentiation and zzso zzso
