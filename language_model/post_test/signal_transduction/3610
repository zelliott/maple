In most individuals, injury results in zzso of peripheral zzso zzso zzso of the peripheral nervous zzso and amplification of central nervous system zzso pain pathways that serve as a zzso to continue harmful zzso however, this may not be the case in some zzso disorders that cause intellectual disability zzso Moreover, individuals affected by ID disorders may initiate zzso zzso to address irritating or painful zzso In normal individuals, a negative feedback loop decreases sensation of pain, which involves descending zzso zzso in the zzso that zzso spinal zzso zzso If spinal zzso zzso is impaired in these zzso disorders, an exaggerated painful stimulus may be required in order to engage descending zzso zzso 

Using electronic databases, we conducted a review of publications regarding the zzso of chronic pain or altered pain sensation in ID patients or corresponding zzso zzso 

There is a body of evidence indicating that individuals with fragile X mental zzso and/or zzso syndrome have altered pain zzso These findings in humans are supported by zzso studies using genetically modified mice zzso zzso consistent with the human zzso Thus, once zzso zzso is zzso the signal to stop may be zzso Several zzso disorders that cause ID are associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso disease zzso which can cause severe visceral zzso zzso affected by these disorders who also have zzso may zzso as a mechanism to engage descending zzso circuits to quell visceral zzso In keeping with this hypothesis, pharmacological treatment of zzso has been shown to be effective for reducing zzso zzso in some zzso zzso multiple lines of evidence suggest zzso zzso processing in zzso disorders that cause zzso 

There is evidence that pain pathways and pain amplification mechanisms are altered in several zzso models of zzso disorders that cause zzso We present hypotheses regarding how impaired pain pathways or chronic pain might contribute to zzso zzso Studies evaluating the relationship between pain and zzso zzso will provide better understanding of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in the ID population and may lead to more effective zzso
