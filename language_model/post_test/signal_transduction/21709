zzso of DNA double strand breaks zzso is critical for the maintenance of zzso zzso DNA zzso can be repaired by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires sequences zzso to the damaged DNA template in order to facilitate repair, zzso occurs through recognition of DNA zzso by a variety of proteins that process and rejoin DNA zzso by direct zzso Here we review two recent reports that zzso is zzso in the social zzso zzso zzso Certain components of the zzso zzso zzso that are absent in genetically zzso organisms such as zzso are present in zzso and we discuss potential directions for future research, in addition to considering this zzso as a genetic model system for the study of zzso in zzso
