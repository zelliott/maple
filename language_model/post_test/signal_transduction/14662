In lung zzso expression of zzso upon zzso zzso T cell zzso and presumably zzso zzso is a predictor of survival while that of zzso zzso is associated with a poor zzso In several models, zzso is abolished by zzso while it is facilitated by zzso We studied the regulation of zzso and zzso expression in zzso lung zzso zzso The effects of tumor necrosis factor zzso and regulators of protein zzso C zzso were tested because these have been shown to zzso cancer development and zzso zzso zzso expression of both zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced only expression of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso increased zzso zzso production and prevented its zzso by zzso In contrast, it decreased zzso or zzso zzso zzso The differential regulation of zzso and zzso expression was further zzso zzso zzso indicated that regulation of zzso promoter activity required two nuclear factor zzso response elements but not its zzso protein zzso binding zzso An zzso and a zzso recognition sites were necessary for full induction of zzso promoter activity by zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso response elements from the zzso promoter were of lower affinity than that from the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso was more potent than zzso to induce in a zzso dependent manner the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling cascade which controls zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso signaling and was a weak zzso of this zzso Thus, zzso did not sufficiently activate zzso to increase zzso through the low affinity zzso binding sites on zzso promoter and its zzso effect on zzso zzso signaling resulted in a reduced zzso zzso On zzso promoter, increased zzso through the high affinity zzso binding site occurred even with poorly activated zzso and the functional zzso response element compensated any loss of zzso zzso These data provide a zzso insight into the differential regulation of zzso and zzso expression by zzso in lung zzso zzso
