zzso are not passive bystanders in the process of hormonal signaling and instead can actively zzso hormonal zzso zzso hormone gains access to the zzso environment via membrane zzso and while zzso from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, zzso hormone signaling is modified via the action of the zzso Although the type 2 zzso zzso converts the zzso zzso to the biologically active zzso the type 3 zzso zzso converts it to reverse zzso an inactive zzso D3 also zzso zzso to zzso terminating zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with the capacity to produce extra amounts of zzso and thus enhances zzso hormone zzso In contrast expression of D3 results in the opposite zzso The zzso and zzso genes undergo zzso regulation throughout embryonic development, childhood, and adult zzso In addition, the zzso protein is unique in that it can be switched off and on via an zzso regulated zzso triggered by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso enhances local zzso hormone signaling and energy expenditure during zzso of brown zzso tissue by cold exposure or high-fat zzso On the other hand, induction of D3 in zzso and brain during zzso and zzso decreases energy expenditure as part of a zzso mechanism to slow down cell metabolism in the face of limited zzso zzso
