The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family zzso which are important in many zzso cellular processes including cell zzso and zzso zzso has multiple zzso sites which can affect its zzso zzso Among these zzso sites, the zzso 21 zzso zzso of zzso is a protein zzso A zzso recognition site within an zzso motif of the zzso terminal zzso domain of zzso In addition, zzso is critical for zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso of zzso blocks zzso zzso of zzso and alters its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cells lacking zzso family zzso zzso zzso led to decreased zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso resulting in reduced focal zzso zzso which slowed zzso dynamics and thus cell zzso These changes in cell zzso were reflected by the fact that cells expressing zzso zzso were severely deficient in their ability to assemble and zzso focal zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso of zzso within the zzso recognition site zzso zzso of zzso regulates its zzso zzso activity and controls focal zzso zzso and that this zzso of zzso is critical for zzso of signals arising from zzso zzso zzso
