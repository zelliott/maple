We previously showed that zzso a zzso oxide zzso decreased the levels and functions of zzso proteins by formation of zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether zzso can zzso the expression of zzso protein and associated zzso zzso signaling in zzso Treatment of A-10 and zzso zzso with zzso for 24 h decreased the expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso protein in a zzso manner; expression was restored toward control levels by zzso acid zzso and zzso acid, but not by zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were increased by approximately 50% and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and attenuated toward control levels by zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso II and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso the zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso decreased the expression of zzso proteins and associated functions in zzso through a zzso mechanism and may involve the zzso zzso signaling zzso
