zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso family currently in Phase III clinical zzso Despite its zzso the mechanism of potential cellular resistance to zzso and genes involved with it remains zzso We have used a zzso zzso zzso functional zzso screen combined with a lethal dose of zzso to discover zzso interactions with zzso Our screen has identified a collection of genes whose zzso by zzso led to zzso resistance including genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso transport zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso and genes known to interact with breast zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification of novel zzso of cellular resistance to zzso could lead to the identification of new or zzso drug zzso Their use as patient or treatment selection zzso could make the application of zzso zzso more clinically zzso
