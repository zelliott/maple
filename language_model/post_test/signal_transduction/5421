The zzso of the zzso alpha of zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso a critical regulatory event in controlling protein translation, has recently been found to mediate the induction of zzso However, the zzso of zzso downstream of zzso remain zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso is required for zzso of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso during zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso is also required for zzso signaling during zzso stress, suggesting that zzso of zzso may serve as an zzso of various cell stresses for zzso zzso On the other hand, although the zzso of zzso in response to zzso requires the zzso of zzso additional pathways relying partly on zzso flux may control zzso activity during zzso stress, as zzso zzso is zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso
