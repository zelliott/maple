The aim was to identify zzso zzso other than contraction, zzso during moderate zzso ( approximately 5 zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso to moderate and severe zzso was assessed by measuring rates of energy consumption and energetic status of cells maintained under these zzso We found that the rates of energy production were decreased during both forms of zzso zzso rates of energy production under moderate zzso were associated with reduced energy zzso through a zzso of zzso leak in the zzso Cellular protein synthesis and zzso zzso major zzso zzso were zzso only during severe zzso when oxygen zzso were low enough to induce energetic stress zzso defined as being any situation in which zzso zzso had fallen by zzso or zzso zzso Our results suggest that energetic stress is the signal responsible for this zzso
