DNA repair protects zzso against spontaneous or zzso DNA zzso zzso of this mechanism zzso a growing list of neurodegenerative zzso The zzso cell zzso zzso zzso causes the loss of zzso expression and is associated with the zzso zzso of zzso This PC zzso dramatically affects nuclear architecture and provides an excellent model to zzso the nuclear mechanisms involved in a whole array of neurodegenerative zzso We used zzso for zzso zzso and components of the DNA damage response, an in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso for zzso to analyze changes in zzso architecture and zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of zzso a DNA damage zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso a repressive mark, in extensive zzso of zzso are zzso hallmarks of zzso in zzso zzso These zzso modifications are associated with a large scale reorganization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso all of them key factors in PC zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso two components of the DNA repair pathway, fail to be concentrated in the damaged zzso zzso even though the expression levels of their coding genes were slightly zzso Although the mechanism by which zzso loss of function leads to PC zzso is zzso the progressive zzso of DNA damage in zzso territories zzso compromises global gene zzso and seems to trigger PC zzso and zzso
