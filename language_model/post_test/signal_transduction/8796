zzso receptors signal through both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are unique among the five zzso zzso as they do not form zzso receptors but modify the properties of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene locus resulted in a significant reduction in synaptic zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso caused complete loss of synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso The principal zzso were distributed away from zzso zzso and zzso active zzso There was also a profound zzso in the zzso properties of the remaining zzso zzso Despite this, zzso zzso zzso of the slow zzso current zzso which is dependent on zzso zzso was intact in zzso knockout zzso These results uncover a previously unknown obligatory role for the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso function and further demonstrate that zzso zzso participation in zzso signaling pathways does not require their classic role as zzso zzso
