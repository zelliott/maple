zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso on the cell surface signals focal zzso zzso leading to the intermediate adhesive zzso cell migration, zzso resistance, and collagen zzso zzso zzso 24 and 32 in zzso and zzso acids zzso and zzso in zzso have been shown through zzso and zzso approaches to be critical for zzso binding and zzso This study investigated the molecular and structural basis for these key zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of a validated zzso complex structure, we adopted steered molecular dynamics simulations to determine the effect of zzso of these key zzso on zzso binding and validated the simulation results with experimental zzso We further performed 30 zzso molecular dynamics simulations for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and studied the zzso and structural changes in zzso and zzso as the result of zzso of these critical zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso 24 and 32 to Ala in zzso and of zzso acids zzso and zzso to Ala in zzso results in a shortened zzso in the binding site, decreased hydrogen bond occupancy for zzso pairs that are located within or near the binding site, increased zzso flexibility of the binding site, a changed degree of zzso correlated motion between the zzso in the binding site and the other zzso in zzso and a changed degree of overall correlated motion between the zzso in the zzso These changes could directly contribute to the loss or weakened binding between zzso and zzso and the zzso effects on zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso from this study provide a molecular and structural insight into the role of these critical zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
