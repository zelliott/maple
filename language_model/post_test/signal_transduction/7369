The zzso and zzso pathways are ancient innate immune mechanisms for controlling invading pathogens that are linked by mutual zzso In addition to controlling the zzso zzso of the cell through zzso recycling, the zzso process of zzso is also responsible for the degradation of damaged zzso cells, and pathogens to protect the integrity of the zzso As a zzso pathogen recognition zzso zzso complex, the zzso both zzso and is induced by zzso through direct interactions with zzso proteins or through the effects of secondary zzso such as zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso 

While the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and regulation are largely unknown, much of the current knowledge has been established through investigation of the role of zzso in innate zzso Likewise, regulatory proteins in the zzso zzso family, which includes zzso zzso are able to stimulate zzso in response to the presence of a zzso 

Many of the newly uncovered links between zzso and zzso have raised new questions about the mechanisms controlling zzso function, which are highlighted in this zzso 

Our basic understanding of the mutual regulation of zzso and zzso will be essential for designing zzso for chronic inflammatory diseases, especially those for which zzso and zzso genes have already been zzso
