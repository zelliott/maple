Cancer is thought to be a disease associated with zzso Interestingly, normal aging is driven by the production of zzso and zzso zzso stress, resulting in the cumulative zzso of DNA zzso Here, we discuss how zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the tumor zzso zzso a form of zzso zzso which leads to zzso inflammation and changes in cancer cell zzso Thus, we present a unified model where aging zzso inflammation zzso and cancer metabolism zzso act as co-conspirators to drive zzso zzso in the tumor zzso Then, zzso in the tumor zzso provides zzso zzso and the necessary chemical building blocks, for accelerated tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso production acts as a zzso zzso and allows cancer cells to zzso a zzso how much of a zzso stimulus they receive, further driving tumor cell selection and zzso Surviving cancer cells would be selected for the ability to induce zzso more effectively in zzso zzso so they could extract more nutrients from the zzso via zzso If lethal cancer is a disease of zzso host zzso in the tumor zzso then cancer patients may benefit from therapy with powerful zzso zzso therapy should block the resulting DNA damage, and halt zzso in the tumor zzso effectively zzso off the fuel zzso for cancer zzso These findings have important new implications for personalized cancer medicine, as they link aging, inflammation and cancer metabolism with novel strategies for more effective cancer zzso and zzso
