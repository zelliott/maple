Two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recently identified as the most likely cause of zzso zzso zzso To assess the functional importance of either zzso acid position in the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were individually replaced by all other zzso zzso At position zzso only zzso and zzso led to zzso zzso zzso all other zzso acid zzso resulted in zzso zzso that lacked zzso activity or were zzso due to poor cell surface zzso In contrast, most zzso acid zzso at position 410 zzso zzso zzso zzso and affected zzso zzso expression not at all or only zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso or zzso exchange in the human zzso zzso also led to zzso activity when introduced into the zzso zzso zzso but showed little or no change in zzso zzso zzso when introduced into the rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso disease are zzso in all zzso members of this family of G zzso zzso However, when the equivalent of either the zzso or the zzso zzso was introduced into several other related zzso including the zzso zzso and the receptors for zzso zzso zzso hormone, zzso zzso I, and zzso the resulting zzso failed to induce zzso zzso These studies suggest that two zzso in the human zzso zzso 223 and zzso have critical roles in signal zzso but with different sequence zzso
