Growth factor zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins containing a zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso (between zzso and zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso Previous structural studies showed that the zzso zzso region binds as a zzso inhibitor in the zzso zzso domain of the insulin zzso to suppress insulin zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso The structure reveals that these two zzso along with the intervening zzso form an zzso zzso structural zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso binds to activated zzso which may serve as a timing mechanism for zzso of insulin zzso Our results illuminate the zzso mechanisms not only of zzso zzso and zzso but also of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso that share a structurally related zzso tandem zzso
