Although zzso trafficking processes can play a central role in the zzso function of a zzso these same processes can also limit the benefit of the protein when it is taken out of its zzso context and used as a protein zzso zzso the properties of certain protein drugs may be improved by manipulating their trafficking pathways to suit their therapeutic zzso A detailed consideration of the factors that govern how protein traffic is routed among different cellular destinations can be used to ascertain molecular design criteria for engineering a protein drug so as to alter its trafficking zzso in a beneficial zzso In this review, we zzso studies that have applied this approach to achieve the following three improvements in protein drug zzso zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso extension of zzso zzso factor, and zzso increase in cellular association of zzso
