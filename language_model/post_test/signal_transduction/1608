Renal transplant recipients treated with zzso A zzso and zzso zzso develop signs of zzso despite normal plasma zzso levels, suggesting a relative resistance of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso To examine the effects of zzso on human MR zzso function, we established the M cell model, zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso Upon zzso and zzso administration, zzso zzso levels and zzso binding in M cells remained unchanged zzso number of sites, approximately 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of green fluorescent zzso was not affected by zzso A major impact of zzso or zzso on the zzso resistance gene product in cellular zzso of zzso was also zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced to 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso of M cells for 3 d with zzso and to 71 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso with zzso These effects were both time and concentration dependent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and needed at least 2 d to zzso Such an zzso effect does not depend on the zzso part of zzso as zzso also reduced zzso activity of a zzso deletion zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso inhibit zzso zzso activity without affecting zzso zzso zzso binding properties, and zzso zzso zzso They suggest that zzso transport zzso in zzso graft recipients are in part induced by impaired zzso zzso
