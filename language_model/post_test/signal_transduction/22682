zzso functional differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso motor zzso is zzso For one zzso zzso release of neurotransmitter is typically zzso times higher for zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that differences in synaptic strength are determined by differences in synaptic calcium zzso zzso signals were measured with the injected calcium indicator zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso entry increased almost zzso with frequency for both zzso and was two to three times larger in zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso at 10 zzso exceeded zzso terminal zzso at 1 zzso yet zzso release was much higher for zzso terminals at these zzso zzso images of zzso revealed on average similar numbers of prominent zzso active zone particles zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and a two- to fourfold zzso ratio of active zones per terminal zzso This can account for the larger calcium signals seen in zzso zzso Thus, differences in synaptic strength are less closely linked to differences in synaptic channel properties and calcium entry than to differences in calcium sensitivity of zzso zzso
