While zzso of zzso zzso growth factor receptors is accompanied by zzso of zzso stimulation of receptors coupled to zzso has in some cases been shown to result in zzso of a zzso zzso rather than of zzso zzso Our finding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso for its zzso effect in vascular smooth muscle cells led us to search for the molecules which are being zzso zzso by this zzso To determine whether zzso zzso of zzso growth factor receptors results in zzso zzso of zzso we examined zzso of zzso by two such zzso Both zzso and zzso II are zzso in zzso cells, but only zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is associated with zzso of zzso on zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso by zzso II does not involve significant zzso zzso However, zzso is zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso Thus, there exists a divergence in the zzso zzso pathways of the zzso receptors relative to the zzso zzso zzso While both zzso and zzso II zzso zzso and activate zzso zzso activity, only zzso zzso zzso on zzso This zzso through disparate zzso pathways suggests one means by which the zzso receptors may zzso specificity in their zzso zzso
