The zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso promote zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso injury in zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso is activated by zzso and contributes to zzso transcription, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso differentiation protein 88 zzso is an adapter protein critical for many zzso functions, but downstream targets for zzso signaling in zzso are not well zzso We asked if zzso and zzso pathways are interconnected and if zzso contributes to adverse outcomes after zzso Here we show that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso enhances zzso in wild type zzso hearts but not in zzso hearts that are defective in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso hearts expression of zzso genes zzso zzso complement factor B zzso zzso death and zzso were significantly increased, but increases were significantly less in zzso hearts after zzso zzso zzso were defective in zzso zzso by zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso induced zzso gene expression was not deficient in zzso zzso Several zzso marker genes were zzso in both zzso and zzso hearts after zzso but zzso was significantly attenuated in zzso hearts, suggesting that zzso selectively affects expression of zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and mortality were significantly reduced in zzso compared to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso contributes to zzso zzso and is important for adverse zzso and inflammatory responses to zzso and zzso
