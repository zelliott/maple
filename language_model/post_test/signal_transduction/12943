zzso is an orphan zzso zzso zzso that is expressed almost exclusively in zzso cells and that is required for normal embryonic vascular zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso promotes zzso cell survival, but other studies have suggested that the zzso zzso has little to no activity, and zzso signaling pathways are zzso To begin to study zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein was produced in insect cells and found to be zzso in zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso domain protein in zzso suggesting that zzso might signal through zzso zzso zzso To study zzso signaling in a cellular context, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso resulted in zzso zzso and downstream zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso by zzso of zzso zzso to zzso suggesting that this zzso is an important zzso zzso binding zzso These findings are the first zzso demonstration of a signal zzso zzso and corresponding cellular function for zzso and the zzso effect of zzso is consistent with the results of previous genetic zzso
