zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that regulates a zzso network by forming zzso zzso with several growth factor receptors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate degradation of zzso but not other zzso zzso Here, we report that the role of zzso in modulating the zzso network extends beyond regulation of protein zzso The capacity of zzso to recruit zzso receptors into active zzso is limited by zzso which is zzso from zzso following zzso zzso We show that zzso binds a specific loop within the zzso domain of zzso thereby restraining zzso formation and zzso zzso These results define a role for zzso as a molecular switch regulating the zzso zzso network by limiting formation of zzso zzso zzso
