The mechanisms that govern zzso zzso into functional zzso a critical step in their stimulation by zzso poorly zzso We used zzso tracking to investigate the dynamics of zzso a zzso zzso that mediates oxidized LDL zzso by zzso We found that zzso motion in the membrane was zzso structured by the cortical zzso A zzso of receptors diffused within linear confinement regions whose unique geometry simultaneously facilitated freedom of movement along one axis while increasing the effective zzso zzso zzso within zzso enhanced the probability of zzso between zzso receptors and promoted their zzso zzso zzso that inhibited diffusion in linear confinement regions reduced zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and, following zzso addition, suppressed zzso signaling and zzso These observations demonstrate a role for the zzso in controlling signal zzso by structuring zzso diffusion within membrane regions that increase their collision zzso
