Respiratory zzso virus zzso is the leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract illness in children in the United States and zzso zzso infection of airway zzso cells zzso formation of zzso oxygen species zzso whose production mediates the expression of zzso and zzso involved the zzso responses of the zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso in zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor zzso gene expression in human airway zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso replication zzso zzso and zzso gene transcription, a response zzso by zzso zzso infection zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso responsive element zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso zzso zzso treatment blocks zzso zzso binding to both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso formation is required for zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Although protein zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not mediate this zzso Instead, zzso infection zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, which is restored by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso could be an important mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso are required for downstream zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso in zzso airway zzso zzso
