zzso plays a significant role in a variety of zzso zzso diseases, and it is recognized that it has zzso zzso However, the cellular mechanisms by which zzso zzso cells induce zzso are not well zzso In order to investigate the role of cells from zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso and multiple myeloma zzso in zzso on human bone zzso zzso cells zzso we analyzed the impact of factors zzso by zzso cells and by zzso cells on zzso zzso tube formation on zzso It was found that, in addition to the zzso of zzso factors zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso cells, zzso cells (but not zzso zzso induced a dramatic increase in expression of zzso and zzso on human bone zzso zzso cells zzso It would seem that this increase in zzso occurred via the zzso and zzso zzso since their respective zzso zzso zzso or zzso were responsible for a decrease of zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso receptors on zzso zzso cell migration was enhanced in a wound artificially produced in a zzso zzso culture, a phenomenon which was also zzso by the same zzso that reversed the increase in zzso zzso The present study suggests that, in addition to the classic zzso pathway, another mechanism related to an increased expression of zzso on zzso might exist in zzso zzso zzso
