Advances in research on zzso have zzso their importance in cell survival and cell death regulation in addition to their function in energy zzso zzso are further implicated in various zzso and zzso diseases, which are now assumed to be caused by zzso of zzso systems rather than pure zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the signaling mechanisms within zzso and between the zzso and its environment have gained interest as potential drug zzso Emerging zzso signaling systems with potential for exploiting them for therapeutic intervention include, among others, the zzso protein zzso of the zzso family, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Here, we discuss functions of these signaling systems in zzso their roles in aging processes and disease, and their potential to serve as therapeutic zzso
