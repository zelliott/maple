External zzso are body zzso specialized for internal zzso Their development can be divided into two zzso an early zzso phase and a late zzso sexual differentiation zzso In the early phase, the embryonic zzso of external zzso the zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical in both zzso Although zzso external zzso zzso represent the second most common birth zzso in humans, the genetic pathways governing early external zzso development and zzso formation are poorly zzso Proper development of the zzso requires coordinated outgrowth of the zzso derived zzso and extension of the zzso zzso within an zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso plays indispensable and distinct roles in each of the aforementioned three tissue layers in early zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is required in the zzso zzso to activate and maintain zzso expression and direct zzso zzso as well as to maintain zzso of the zzso Moreover, zzso is required in the zzso to promote cell zzso By contrast, zzso is required in the zzso to maintain tissue integrity, possibly through zzso zzso during zzso zzso The fact that both zzso and zzso zzso knockout animals develop severe zzso in both sexes raises the possibility that the deregulation of any of these functions can contribute to the zzso of zzso external zzso defects in zzso
