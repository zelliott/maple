Patients with zzso type 1 zzso a common zzso dominant tumor predisposition syndrome, develop benign zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso an aggressive form of zzso cell zzso that frequently arises from zzso zzso zzso advances have been made in defining the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso and zzso zzso including the identification of key tumor zzso gene zzso an improved understanding of the functions of these tumor zzso and the production of transgenic mouse models in which tumor zzso gene zzso zzso animals to the development of zzso and zzso It has also become apparent that zzso growth factor signaling zzso with tumor zzso zzso to promote zzso and zzso zzso In Part I of this zzso review, we consider findings demonstrating that zzso cells are the primary zzso cell type in zzso and zzso and that specific tumor zzso gene zzso promote the development of these zzso In Part II, which will be published in a later issue, we will review evidence indicating that inappropriate growth factor signaling contributes to this process by stimulating the zzso survival, and migration of zzso cells whose regulatory mechanisms have been crippled by a loss of tumor zzso zzso
