The present study was designed to determine whether zzso zzso zzso stimulates NO production in the zzso collecting duct cells of the inner zzso zzso and if this is zzso through zzso zzso Thin tissue layers containing zzso were dissected from zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso and NO production were measured in zzso by a zzso imaging system with the use of zzso zzso and the zzso form of the zzso dye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a rapid peak increase in zzso of 320 zzso 70 zzso within a few seconds and a sustained increase of 120 zzso 62 zzso The peak increase in zzso was followed by a significant increase of NO production zzso zzso 7 zzso This was similar to that produced by 20 zzso of the NO donor zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso The NO scavenger zzso zzso zzso or depletion of zzso by zzso with 5 zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso buffer abolished the NO response to zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso to produce NO in zzso
