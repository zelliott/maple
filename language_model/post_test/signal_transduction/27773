In 1980, zzso and zzso demonstrated that the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells in response to zzso is dependent on the anatomical integrity of the zzso zzso relaxing factor was identified 7 years later as the free radical gas zzso oxide zzso In zzso the zzso acid zzso is converted to zzso and NO by one of the three NO zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and cell proliferation appear to be, zzso the two major regulatory factors of zzso gene zzso However, zzso seems to be mainly regulated by zzso of its zzso zzso of specific receptors to various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso activity at least in part through an increase in zzso free zzso However, the mechanical stimulus zzso stress appears again to be the major stimulus of zzso activity, although the precise mechanisms zzso the zzso remain to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso (from zzso zzso to the zzso or zzso are probably involved in these zzso Although zzso plays a major zzso role in the control of zzso it has not so far been demonstrated that a zzso in zzso NO production could be responsible for high blood pressure in zzso In contrast, a zzso in zzso zzso is known to be promoted by several risk factors zzso smoking, diabetes, zzso and is also the consequence of zzso zzso streak zzso of the zzso Several mechanisms probably contribute to this decrease in NO zzso Finally, a zzso in NO generation contributes to the zzso of pulmonary zzso zzso of the mechanisms of zzso zzso activity and NO zzso will contribute to our understanding the physiology of zzso and the zzso of zzso dysfunction, and could provide insights for new therapies, particularly in hypertension and zzso
