zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is a component of the zzso signaling complex in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is involved in negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the zzso level of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso was also inhibited by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso suppressed zzso zzso induced by zzso of diverse zzso signals such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso one of the end point molecules in the zzso zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso zzso might be a target zzso upon which zzso zzso zzso study disclosed that zzso physically interacts with zzso zzso and that the binding domain of zzso is the death zzso domain zzso domain zzso acids zzso where zzso of the zzso death domain protein and zzso zzso The zzso zzso potential of zzso was also mapped to the zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso into the nucleus and decreased its zzso activity upon zzso zzso This study presents a novel function of zzso in addition to the previously known function as a component of the zzso zzso signaling complex, zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso retention of zzso zzso via physical zzso
