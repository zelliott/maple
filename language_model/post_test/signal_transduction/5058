zzso zzso is important for maintaining steady blood zzso levels during zzso and through zzso zzso The regulatory network that zzso hormonal and zzso signals serves to integrate these zzso cues and adjust zzso synthesis and zzso by the zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso 2 zzso as an zzso regulator of zzso zzso that responds to nutritional status and zzso zzso expression of zzso in the liver promotes zzso zzso production and zzso zzso intolerance in zzso obese zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of this factor improves systemic zzso zzso zzso is a target gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that zzso clock and energy zzso and is required for maintaining zzso zzso zzso during restricted zzso At the zzso level, zzso regulates zzso zzso metabolism through its induction of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly impair the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso Together, these studies delineate a novel zzso that links hormonal and zzso signals to zzso and zzso zzso
