Both insulin resistance and zzso have been reported to be independent risk factors for cardiovascular zzso However, little is known regarding insulin signaling in the vascular zzso in zzso zzso In this report, insulin signaling on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways were compared in vascular zzso of lean and obese zzso zzso rats in both ex zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso beta zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of obese rats was significantly decreased compared with lean rats, although the protein levels of zzso in the 2 groups were not zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso and their protein levels were decreased in the zzso of obese rats compared with lean zzso The association of zzso zzso to the zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso activities zzso by insulin in the zzso of obese rats were significantly decreased compared with the lean zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso pathway, was also reduced significantly in isolated zzso from obese rats compared with the lean zzso In zzso clamp studies, insulin infusion greatly increased zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso of lean rats, but only slight increases were observed in obese zzso In contrast, insulin zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso equally in isolated zzso of lean and obese rats, although zzso zzso zzso of zzso was higher in the obese zzso To our knowledge, these data provided the first direct zzso of insulin signaling in the vascular zzso and documented a selective resistance to zzso zzso (but not to zzso zzso zzso in the vascular zzso of obese zzso zzso
