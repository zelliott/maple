zzso a class B scavenger zzso is a zzso zzso for oxidized low density zzso zzso and may play a critical role in zzso foam cell zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso and zzso zzso enhanced expression of zzso The effect of zzso on zzso is due, in part, to its ability to activate the zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso activated zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso class of zzso zzso also increase zzso zzso We have now evaluated signaling pathways involved in the induction of zzso Treatment of zzso cells (a zzso zzso cell line) with protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso expression in a zzso manner, while protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso expression of zzso and blocked induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso decreased both zzso zzso and protein expression and blocked induction of zzso protein surface expression by zzso and zzso in human zzso as determined by zzso zzso had no effect on zzso of zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso These results demonstrate that two divergent zzso or zzso zzso zzso a common zzso to zzso of zzso gene zzso This zzso involves initial zzso of zzso with subsequent zzso zzso Defining these signaling pathways is critical for understanding and modulating expression of this scavenger zzso zzso
