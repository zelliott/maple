zzso zzso is a steroid recently identified to be zzso as doping zzso However, the knowledge on functions of this substance in humans or animal models is rather zzso zzso it was our aim to further characterize the pharmacological profile of zzso and identify potential adverse side zzso zzso was zzso the purity was confirmed and its biological activity was zzso The potency of zzso to zzso zzso dependent reporter gene expression was two orders of magnitude lower compared to zzso zzso binds with high affinity but zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso rats with zzso resulted in a stimulation of zzso seminal zzso and zzso zzso muscle, indicating zzso and anabolic zzso In the liver zzso in contrast to zzso zzso down regulates the expression of the zzso dependent zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that zzso is not a specific zzso zzso zzso exhibits a high binding affinity to all tested steroid hormone receptors and binds with highest affinity to the zzso Our in zzso data are indicative of an anabolic and zzso potency of zzso but the repression of zzso demonstrates that zzso also interferes with the zzso hormone zzso zzso it is conceivable that an intake will result in adverse side zzso
