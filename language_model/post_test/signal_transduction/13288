zzso toxin and zzso coli zzso zzso are structurally zzso proteins comprised of an zzso active zzso and five zzso that bind with high affinity to zzso receptors found on the surface of zzso zzso The zzso have long been thought of simply as trafficking vehicles that trigger entry and subsequent delivery of the zzso zzso into zzso Indeed, such is the capacity of the zzso to enter cells, that they have been developed as generic carriers for attachment and delivery of a variety of peptides into zzso zzso However, the zzso also appear to possess discrete zzso zzso that induce both zzso factor and cell zzso These are thought to be directly responsible for the potent zzso properties of the zzso and have resulted in their use as zzso and as agents to suppress inflammatory immune zzso The relationship between the zzso properties of the zzso and their capacity to act as trafficking vehicles has remained zzso In an effort to understand the structural requirements for these two functions, a set of zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso at position zzso have been generated and zzso zzso such zzso zzso retain an ability to bind with high affinity to zzso and to traffic into cells, but have entirely lost their capacity to activate immune cell zzso Thus, while binding via zzso appears to be sufficient to trigger cellular zzso it is not sufficient to activate signal zzso The zzso region is therefore speculated to be actively engaged in triggering zzso events, possibly via zzso interaction with other cell surface zzso
