The replication checkpoint signaling network monitors the presence of zzso zzso to DNA and coordinates an elaborate cellular response that includes ample zzso zzso Recent work has established two major groups of replication zzso genes in zzso zzso the DNA damage response zzso genes and G zzso cell cycle zzso zzso In both cases, zzso zzso is zzso via zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso that zzso in negative feedback zzso This zzso regulation enables zzso to be rapidly zzso once cells have dealt with the replication zzso The recent finding of a new class of zzso zzso named zzso zzso further zzso a mode of zzso regulation that prevents zzso of replication stress induced genes during G zzso zzso these findings highlight the need for mechanisms that tightly control replication zzso transcription, allowing rapid zzso zzso during replication stress but also avoiding long-term zzso of the induced protein product that may be zzso to cell zzso
