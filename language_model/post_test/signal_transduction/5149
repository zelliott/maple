zzso cells originate from the zzso zzso and maintain structural integrity of the zzso zzso bed and zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso or zzso injury, these cells undergo zzso or acquire an activated zzso and undergo zzso proliferation with excessive production of zzso zzso growth factors, zzso and zzso These soluble factors exert zzso and zzso effects on the cells or on other zzso cells, zzso zzso are primary targets of zzso zzso diseases such as zzso zzso or zzso diseases such as zzso zzso may also respond to injury that primarily involves zzso and zzso cells or to structural and genetic abnormalities of the zzso basement zzso Signal zzso and zzso stress pathways are activated in zzso and likely represent integrated input from multiple zzso Such responses are convenient targets for therapeutic zzso Studies in cultured zzso should be supplemented with in zzso studies as well as examination of freshly isolated cells from normal and diseases zzso In addition to ex zzso zzso studies in kidney cortex, cells should be studied in their natural environment, isolated zzso or even tissue zzso Identification of a specific marker of zzso should help genetic manipulation as well as selective therapeutic targeting of these zzso Identification of biological responses of zzso that are not zzso by the zzso system should help development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies to treat diseases characterized by zzso zzso
