It is suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso may lead to tamoxifen zzso resistance in the zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso Our previous results demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso expression and increases zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that a possible mechanism for developing zzso resistance could be the regulation of zzso and zzso family proteins through zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso or vehicles as control for 24 zzso Total zzso was extracted from zzso cells and real-time zzso was employed to identify the zzso expression in response to zzso To determine that the resistance to zzso cell killing after the zzso treatment was due to the zzso of the zzso pathway, low molecular weight DNA was isolated from cells of different treatments and zzso DNA fragmentation was zzso The zzso of signaling zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso analysis for the study of zzso signaling zzso To determine the involvement of zzso zzso in the survival effect of zzso the growth rate of zzso cell was measured by zzso cell proliferation zzso after treatments of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso or vehicles as control for 3 zzso The results of real-time zzso and cell proliferation zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso of less than zzso were considered statistically zzso 

Our results showed that in zzso cells zzso increased zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso expression which could be blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced zzso based on the observation of the suppression of DNA zzso variable increase in the expression of the zzso and zzso proteins and the decrease of the active form of zzso zzso whereas zzso blocked the zzso effects of zzso In the cell proliferation zzso zzso maintained zzso cell survival in the presence of zzso which could be blocked by zzso 

We confirmed the regulation of zzso by zzso in human breast cancer cells at both zzso and protein zzso We further demonstrated that zzso may play an zzso role in the induction of breast cancer cell zzso zzso resistance against zzso drugs on breast cancer zzso
