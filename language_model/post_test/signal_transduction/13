zzso alpha is an inhibitor of the zzso factor zzso and it is an essential component of the signaling pathways that lead to expression of inflammatory zzso These include zzso and zzso molecules associated with zzso presentation in an inflammatory immune zzso In this study, we report that zzso cells exposed to zzso induce peripheral tolerance by increasing zzso alpha zzso Exposure of zzso presenting cells zzso to zzso is known to impair their ability to zzso zzso and such impairment correlated with reduced zzso activity as indicated by significantly reduced nuclear levels of zzso an essential zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of increased nuclear zzso alpha in zzso by expression of small interfering zzso molecules zzso targeting zzso alpha transcripts prevented zzso impairment and the decline in nuclear zzso zzso Furthermore, such zzso alpha blockade also zzso with the zzso property of zzso zzso However, increased expression of zzso alpha in zzso independent of zzso exposure, reduced nuclear zzso levels and permitted tolerance induction by zzso Thus, our findings attribute a direct and significant role to zzso alpha in the zzso potential of zzso Increased zzso alpha expression in zzso may therefore offer a therapeutic approach to achieve zzso zzso
