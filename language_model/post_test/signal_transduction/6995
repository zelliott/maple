Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths zzso In recent studies, a crucial link has been discovered between the acquisition of zzso traits and zzso abilities in cancer cells during the zzso transition zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso expression of zzso the zzso regulator, in zzso zzso cells triggered zzso and resulted in the acquisition of a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cancer cell populations that were induced to zzso displayed an increased proportion of cells with the zzso marker, which is associated with zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso treatment reduced the zzso abilities and inhibited cell migration and invasion in zzso zzso zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso Moreover, we found that zzso inhibited zzso binding to the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso More interestingly, zzso significantly inhibited zzso invasion in zzso zzso zzso might be zzso to zzso therapy and could be a potential new therapeutic drug for zzso
