zzso aneurysm zzso is a common health problem with high mortality and no effective zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso members regulate various cellular zzso and zzso signaling has key roles in development, tissue zzso and zzso Interest in the role of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso has recently emerged, particularly since genetic studies demonstrated an association between gene zzso in components of zzso signaling and zzso However, paradoxical discoveries have implicated zzso zzso signaling in aneurysm formation, complicating the precise functional role for zzso in aneurysm development and zzso Furthermore, interventions targeting towards zzso signaling using zzso which may represent a suitable therapeutic option for zzso were subject to skepticism especially because of conflicting experimental results obtained from zzso zzso treatment without knowledge of the underlying zzso We propose a zzso aneurysm paradox, which would provide a good opportunity for the development of genetic mouse models of zzso These models would be used to clarify the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso which would translate into novel zzso therapies based on the new molecular zzso
