To investigate the molecular effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the oral zzso the zzso oral zzso cell line was cultured in the presence of zzso zzso Following confirmation of the presence of transcripts for the bacterial pattern recognition receptors in zzso cells, zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and components of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso analyses were performed showing that zzso was activated within 1 h of exposure to both zzso A significantly greater number of zzso nuclear zzso were apparent following zzso cell exposure to zzso as compared with zzso Gene expression analyses indicated that transcripts known to be regulated by the zzso pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso following 4 and 24 h of exposure to both zzso In addition, zzso zzso exposure resulted in differential regulation of transcripts for several zzso gene family zzso zzso with the zzso data, zzso results indicated that zzso induced a greater number of gene expression changes than PG following 24 h of exposure, zzso and 409 zzso zzso zzso genes were commonly zzso expressed by both zzso and represented biological processes commonly associated with zzso Gene expression analyses by reserve zzso chain reaction zzso of molecules identified from the zzso data sets, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed their differential expression profiles induced by the two zzso zzso and PG have clearly different molecular effects on oral zzso cells, potentially highlighting the importance of the composition of the plaque zzso in zzso zzso
