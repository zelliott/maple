zzso ensembles communicate with their remote and zzso target cells via an intermittent pattern of chemical zzso The lack of a zzso zzso of the underlying zzso mechanics of such zzso zzso systems has greatly hampered quantitative analysis of the zzso zzso and pathological regulation of the zzso and frequency components of seemingly randomly dispersed neuroendocrine zzso Here we present a zzso differential equation model of episodic zzso signaling in which random, but zzso variations in burst zzso superimposed on zzso hormone release are combined with a zzso zzso process responsible for the timing of scattered zzso zzso zzso timing and/or zzso can be modulated by underlying deterministic trends, zzso zzso variations in mean expected zzso burst frequency or zzso We illustrate the diversity of output of this model and suggest its use in zzso underlying properties of irregular biological signals in relevant hormone time zzso This representation of episodic zzso behavior combines zzso and deterministic elements inherent in the intermittent activity of a neuroendocrine zzso
