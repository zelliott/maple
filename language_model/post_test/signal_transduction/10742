The discovery of zzso receptors has substantially changed our knowledge of pathogen zzso 11 zzso receptors have so far been described in zzso These recognize distinct pathogen associated molecular patterns, as well as zzso zzso and small molecular synthetic zzso zzso have a zzso role in zzso immune responses and represent an important connection between the zzso and zzso zzso The role of the zzso in the recognition of pathogens renders them a key figure in the zzso of the immune response during surgical zzso However, emerging evidence points to a fundamental role in zzso zzso wound healing, zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso The aim hence was to review experimental data pertaining to the zzso of zzso zzso pathways in conditions associated with surgical zzso A systematic review of the literature was undertaken by searching the zzso database for the period zzso without language zzso The paper also analyses the possible therapeutic zzso of the zzso zzso pathways in surgical zzso
