Recent discoveries show that zzso cell death pathways are a pervasive mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, and zzso factor zzso is an important zzso of this mode of zzso zzso There are currently two known mechanisms underlying zzso release following zzso stress, zzso and zzso To test whether there is an interaction between zzso and zzso in triggering zzso release, we used the zzso toxicity model in rat primary cortical zzso Exposure to zzso resulted in zzso zzso and nuclear zzso and zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso Both zzso and zzso are involved with zzso processing as zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso death were attenuated by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso as zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso toxicity zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso zzso are linked via zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings link the two seemingly independent mechanisms triggering zzso zzso zzso
