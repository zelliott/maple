zzso muscles are richly zzso by zzso In zzso studies of cat zzso muscle have shown that there are 3 populations of zzso muscle zzso primary muscle zzso (1 degrees ), secondary muscle zzso (2 degrees ) and zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanical zzso properties of zzso muscle zzso in response to controlled length and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recorded from zzso root zzso were localized within an isolated zzso muscle space zzso Changes in zzso displacement and the zzso of zzso displacement were independently controlled with an electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso - 100 zzso to a displacement of 2,000 zzso and displacement zzso zzso at a constant zzso of 10 zzso parameters zzso the full range of rib zzso 

Both 1 degrees and 2 degrees muscle zzso were found evenly distributed within the zzso zzso were localized along the rib zzso The 1 degrees zzso had the greatest discharge frequency in response to displacement zzso followed by the 2 degrees zzso and zzso The 1 degrees muscle zzso also possessed the greatest discharge frequency in response to graded zzso changes, zzso spikes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso response of zzso spikes zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by 2 degrees muscle zzso at zzso spikes zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this study provide a systematic description of the zzso of the 3 types of zzso muscle zzso These zzso have discharge properties that zzso the magnitude and zzso of zzso muscle zzso
