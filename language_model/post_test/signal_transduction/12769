zzso zzso and other zzso zzso were found to inhibit zzso zzso by depressing zzso zzso as an zzso zzso and/or to stimulate zzso release in association with zzso C or zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso actions of a group of zzso represented by zzso were partially inhibited by the zzso of the cells with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso even when an about zzso membrane zzso was completely zzso Only the zzso part of the zzso actions was antagonized by zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at two to three orders of higher zzso than zzso also exerted the zzso actions, although they were entirely insensitive to both zzso and zzso zzso binding experiments with, zzso gamma S and zzso showed that zzso occupies both zzso and insensitive zzso sites, whereas zzso does only zzso zzso zzso Thus, lack of sensitivity of zzso action to zzso was associated with its inability to occupy the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso did not show any zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso remarkably enhanced the zzso actions of zzso or zzso Such zzso actions of zzso and others were sensitive to both zzso and zzso as were shown for a part of the zzso actions of zzso as well as the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso We conclude that an zzso zzso zzso which mediates the zzso action of zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso may not directly link to the zzso C or zzso system but enhance the system which links to a zzso zzso in an indirect or zzso zzso
