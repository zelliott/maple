zzso transported into fruits are mainly in the form of zzso in most fruit tree zzso but zzso takes the place of zzso in woody zzso zzso The transport of zzso across the plasma membrane from zzso space into cells is zzso by sugar zzso The fact that gene expression of sugar zzso is zzso just before and during sugar zzso suggests the participation of sugar zzso in sugar zzso of zzso The zzso zzso participate in four futile cycles that involve sugar transport between zzso zzso zzso and zzso The increase in SS zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities and zzso levels during maturation parallels the increase in sugar zzso indicates that the zzso zzso have important roles on sugar zzso in zzso The prerequisite for rapid zzso of sugar in fruit is restriction of zzso zzso and promotion of its zzso In woody zzso plants, the fact that zzso metabolism is also quite active in fruit suggests that zzso and zzso probably play similar roles in fruit zzso zzso as signal molecules regulate the expression of genes involved in sugar transport and zzso Sugar zzso metabolism and zzso are also regulated by natural environmental factors and cultural zzso The increase in sugar content of tomato fruit in acid zzso gene zzso plants provides promising prospect of genetic engineering as a potential effective technique in regulation of sugar zzso in zzso Thus, the sugar content of fruit is determined by both intrinsic and zzso zzso The future research works will be focused on zzso the mechanism of sugar signal and other intrinsic signals as well as zzso signals including zzso plant hormones and physical factors on sugar zzso metabolism and zzso and the zzso among zzso
