The application of titanium zzso zzso in joint zzso is a good choice in orthopedic zzso An elevated serum concentration of zzso has been shown in the patients with loosened knee zzso The precise actions of elevated zzso on the circulation remain zzso In this study the zzso zzso responses zzso by zzso in the zzso of rats 4 weeks after zzso zzso zzso and in cultured rat zzso treated with a soluble form of zzso for a period of zzso were significantly decreased as compared with zzso zzso isolated from rats with zzso zzso implants or zzso treated with a soluble form of zzso had enhanced protein expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso and enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso with a soluble form of zzso for zzso zzso increased zzso protein zzso zzso treatment of zzso with zzso for zzso effectively enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in the circulation may alter zzso function and reduce zzso
