zzso an extract from eight different herbal zzso has been developed to treat cardiovascular zzso This extract has a zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso vascular contraction through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso 

zzso zzso ring preparations were mounted in organ baths and subjected to contraction and zzso zzso of 20 zzso zzso light chains zzso and zzso zzso targeting zzso 1 zzso were examined by zzso We also measured the amount of zzso zzso as a marker for zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso ring zzso zzso relaxed vascular contraction induced by zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso in a decreasing zzso zzso relaxed zzso ring preparations zzso with sodium zzso zzso whether zzso was intact or zzso zzso with zzso for 30 zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso In vascular zzso zzso decreased the zzso level of both zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso decreased the amount of zzso zzso activated by zzso 

zzso zzso vascular contraction through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso may be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular diseases associated with zzso of zzso signaling zzso
