One major challenge in cancer research is to understand the complex interplay between the DNA damage response zzso zzso integrity, and tumor zzso To address these issues, we analyzed 43 zzso tumor zzso from 22 patients using single zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue expression of multiple zzso zzso including zzso and its interaction partner zzso The zzso profiles confirmed and extended known copy number zzso zzso at high resolution, showed zzso of zzso at nine common fragile sites, and revealed that most zzso tumors were zzso zzso The occurrence of many novel zzso zzso regions zzso was of potential functional importance in some tumors because zzso spanned zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also zzso deletion of the zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso signaling as evaluated by zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso family member X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was commonly activated in tumors with both moderate and high extent of accumulated zzso zzso the latter tumors showing a more frequent loss of zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso exhibiting the most complex zzso were associated with a high zzso index, abundant zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of clinical zzso evaluation of a tissue zzso zzso zzso showed that abundant zzso expression was associated with risk of progression to zzso disease zzso hazard ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and higher T stage zzso zzso analysis confirmed this association zzso in an independent cohort zzso but statistical significance was not reached in a zzso zzso Overall, our results are consistent with zzso zzso preceding the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with extensive zzso zzso were associated with zzso of zzso excessive zzso and robust zzso zzso the latter also zzso with the risk of disease zzso Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest that zzso likely contribute to zzso zzso
