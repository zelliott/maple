zzso zzso 1 zzso which is associated with early onset Parkinson disease, encodes a zzso zzso that is critical for maintaining zzso zzso Moreover, another Parkinson zzso zzso zzso functions downstream of zzso in protecting zzso and zzso zzso zzso In our fly genetic zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso successfully rescued zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso but unexpectedly, failed in zzso zzso In further genetic zzso deletion of zzso nullified the zzso zzso restoration in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso or its downstream target gene such as zzso or Thor markedly ameliorated zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso mediates the zzso protecting signal induced by zzso zzso with its zzso role, zzso expression prevented the zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Loss of zzso or zzso induced zzso zzso zzso which is very similar to that of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso deletion had no deleterious effect on the zzso zzso loss in zzso or zzso zzso supporting the idea that zzso zzso and zzso protect zzso zzso in a common zzso Overall, these results strongly support the role of zzso and zzso in preventing zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso loss, further suggesting that zzso and zzso function downstream of zzso and independently of zzso
