The zzso target of the zzso zzso signaling zzso functions in many cellular zzso including cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso Recent advances have demonstrated that differentiated zzso cells can be directly zzso into the zzso state by zzso of several zzso zzso zzso However, whether the zzso signaling zzso is involved in this zzso zzso process remains zzso Here, we provide evidence that an elaborate regulation of the zzso activity is required for the successful zzso of zzso cells to zzso The zzso of zzso cells collected from the zzso zzso in which the zzso activity is zzso is entirely zzso By taking advantage of the secondary zzso zzso stem zzso system, we demonstrate that either zzso the zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso or using high zzso of zzso to completely block the zzso activity in cells derived from zzso mice greatly zzso zzso cell zzso Secondary zzso induction efficiency can only be elevated by elaborately regulating the zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that the precise regulation of the zzso activity plays a critical role in the successful zzso of zzso cells to form zzso zzso
