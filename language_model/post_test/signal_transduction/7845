Recent studies provide evidence for reduced zzso zzso as a genetic zzso factor as well as suggesting an association of several single zzso zzso zzso in zzso that are associated with an increased zzso of zzso 

The aim of the current study was to assess the activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso in several animal models zzso of zzso efficacy and zzso liability and to use zzso zzso and knockout mice to begin to understand the zzso involved in the activity of zzso 

In rats, zzso antagonized both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited zzso avoidance responding zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, in knockout mice, their sensitivity to zzso at the higher doses zzso and zzso zzso was reduced, resulting in a zzso shift in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso is involved, at least in part, with the activity of zzso Only the highest dose of zzso zzso zzso produced a modest but significant degree of zzso 

zzso has a zzso profile similar to that of the zzso zzso and has low zzso symptom zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates the antipsychotic effects of zzso in zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso may play a role in the zzso and zzso of zzso
