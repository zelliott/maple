Over the past decades, the availability of large amounts of information regarding cellular processes and reaction rates, along with increasing knowledge about the complex mechanisms involved in these zzso has changed the way we approach the understanding of cellular zzso We can no longer rely only on our zzso for interpreting experimental data and evaluating new zzso as the information to analyze is becoming increasingly zzso The paradigm for the analysis of cellular systems has shifted from a focus on individual processes to comprehensive global mathematical descriptions that consider the interactions of zzso zzso and signaling zzso Analysis and simulations are used to test our knowledge by zzso or zzso new hypotheses regarding a complex system, which can result in zzso capabilities that lead to better experimental zzso Different types of models can be used for this purpose, depending on the type and amount of information available for the specific zzso zzso models are based on the zzso structure of the system and allow explorations of steady state zzso in the zzso zzso kinetic models provide a description of the dynamics of the system, they involve a large number of reactions with varied kinetic characteristics and require a large number of zzso Models based on statistical information provide a description of the system without information regarding structure and interactions of the networks zzso The development of detailed models for zzso cell metabolism has only recently started to grow more zzso due to the intrinsic complexities of zzso systems, and the limited availability of experimental information and adequate modeling zzso In this work we review the strategies, tools, current advances, and recent models of zzso cells, focusing mainly on zzso but discussing the methodology applied to other types of networks as zzso
