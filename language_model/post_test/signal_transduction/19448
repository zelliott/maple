zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso of zzso in the control of gene zzso Many zzso proteins are also targeted for zzso including zzso zzso zzso components such as zzso zzso and zzso Our studies in mouse zzso zzso suggested that a number of zzso genes that regulate zzso turnover are selectively regulated by zzso zzso of zzso activity with zzso A zzso zzso the induction of a zzso and zzso 12 zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso genes by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso Analysis of the zzso of cell zzso pathways demonstrated that zzso induced robust zzso and zzso zzso with delayed zzso compared to the zzso of zzso The zzso induction of zzso and zzso was dependent on such zzso zzso pathways and, importantly, zzso zzso completely blocked their zzso without affecting zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso implicated a role for class I zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso by zzso interference significantly zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression without modulating zzso zzso zzso with the effect of zzso zzso depletion of zzso also blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso these data confirm that zzso and in particular zzso are required for zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways by zzso and for the subsequent gene induction dependent on these zzso zzso
