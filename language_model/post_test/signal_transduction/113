zzso and maintenance of the zzso zzso requires the balanced activity of zzso proteins and zzso In this study we have addressed how the zzso zzso tracking protein zzso and zzso zzso regulate this process in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that mast accumulates at zzso early in zzso which is followed by a zzso streaming upon zzso zzso This leads to a reduction of mast levels at zzso during zzso and zzso that depends largely on the zzso minus zzso motor zzso zzso Surprisingly, we also found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, while restoring normal zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that mast and zzso have zzso roles in the local regulation of zzso zzso dynamics at zzso which are important for the maintenance of zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso
