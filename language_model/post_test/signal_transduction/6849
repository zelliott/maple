zzso zzso zzso complexes are zzso zzso cellular machines that zzso the energy of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The complexes interact with zzso factors at promoters and enhancers to zzso gene expression and contribute to lineage zzso zzso and zzso zzso clues to a role in tumor suppression for zzso complexes came over a decade ago when the gene zzso the zzso core zzso was found specifically zzso in nearly all pediatric zzso zzso In the last three years, zzso sequencing efforts have revealed an unexpectedly high zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso which are collectively zzso in zzso of all human zzso and approach the frequency of zzso zzso Here, we provide a background on these newly recognized tumor zzso complexes, discuss mechanisms implicated in the tumor zzso activity, and highlight findings that may lead to potential therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
