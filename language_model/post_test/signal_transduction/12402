The complex structure of the lung is developed zzso initially by zzso tube branching and later by zzso of terminal air zzso with accompanying coordinated growth of a variety of lung zzso and zzso zzso Groups of zzso factors, zzso growth factors and their zzso signaling regulators, as well as zzso zzso proteins are programmed to be expressed at appropriate levels in the right place at the right time to control normal lung zzso Studies of lung development and lung zzso to date have discovered that many of the same factors that control normal development are also key players in lung injury repair and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso family zzso signaling is a prime zzso Lack of zzso signaling results in abnormal lung branching zzso and zzso during development, whereas excessive amounts of zzso signaling cause severe zzso in the immature lung and zzso in mature zzso This leads us to propose the zzso hypothesis of regulatory signaling in lung development and injury repair that everything must be done just zzso
