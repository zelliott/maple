zzso of the zzso gene from two different zzso one active at the zzso of the hair cycle and the other specific for the zzso is responsible for generating a range of zzso pigmentation zzso We demonstrate that in zzso mice transcripts from both promoters are confined to the zzso zzso of hair zzso as predicted by classical transplantation zzso zzso from the hair cycle promoter are detected in the embryonic zzso plate but not in other regions of the body before birth, whereas zzso transcripts are detected in the zzso trunk of the zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso To investigate further the embryonic origins of adult pigmentation patterns, we carried out a detailed analysis of zzso expression in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is first expressed at zzso in neural zzso zzso cells of the second zzso arch, in anterior regions of the zzso buds and in a narrow stripe of zzso zzso By zzso a continuous layer of expression is observed in the upper cells of the zzso including cells of the developing zzso zzso and covering the entire zzso surface of the head and trunk and zzso surfaces of the zzso zzso and zzso This expression pattern reflects the domain of yellow zzso evident in adult animals and suggests that the zzso gene is regulated in part by factors responsible for establishing differences between the zzso and zzso surfaces of the body during zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso signaling zzso that can influence zzso production by hair zzso zzso when expressed by either zzso or zzso as suggested by zzso and transplantation experiments, we created transgenic animals in which zzso is expressed in zzso cells of the zzso These animals display stripes of yellow hairs corresponding to regions of zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso signals zzso to zzso yellow zzso and providing direct evidence that it functions in a zzso manner with a restricted radius of zzso
