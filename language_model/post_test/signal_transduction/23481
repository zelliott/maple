zzso zzso has been shown to promote zzso leading to heart zzso Recent studies have reported a correlation between diabetic zzso and zzso stress, suggesting that the zzso of advanced zzso end products zzso zzso the production of zzso oxygen species zzso In a clinical setting, zzso have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular zzso however, the relationship between zzso and cardiac zzso remains zzso This study sought to identify the role of zzso in cardiac zzso by treating zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 96 zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso significantly increased protein levels and cell zzso These effects were effectively blocked with zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso caused cell zzso via the zzso zzso We then treated cells with zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and employed the Odyssey infrared imaging system to detect zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this effect was blocked by zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso regulate zzso zzso via zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso are closely related to cardiac zzso and further identify a molecular mechanism underlying the promotion of diabetic zzso by zzso
