zzso is a zzso adapter protein that is expressed from the earliest stages of zzso zzso zzso becomes rapidly zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of dominant negative forms of zzso in zzso lines had also suggested a role for this adapter downstream of the zzso However, until recently, the relative significance of zzso compared to several other adapters in T cells was zzso Mice lacking zzso expression specifically in the zzso lineage together with zzso expression of dominant negative zzso in transgenic mice have revealed an essential and zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso defects in a zzso zzso line lacking zzso expression also suggest a role for zzso in mature zzso zzso While the requirement of zzso in zzso signaling is now established, precisely what signaling pathways downstream of zzso make this adapter unique are less zzso Although the zzso zzso of the zzso signal regulated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso could be one zzso zzso likely signals to other pathways in T cells that are not yet zzso A better molecular understanding of zzso function in the future could provide insights into how multiple adapters coordinate the various outcomes downstream of the zzso
