Homer 1 gene products are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission and zzso zzso other deficits, the Homer 1 knockout zzso mice show distinct zzso zzso such as anxiety and zzso zzso In addition, we recently reported that the global deletion of the Homer 1 proteins in mice leads to a conspicuous zzso zzso linked to zzso of the adrenal cortex, elevated zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso release in zzso and in zzso as well as a drastic increase in the zzso hormone zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso hormone was not changed in these zzso which is in line with our recent zzso suggesting that the central limb of the zzso axis zzso zzso zzso hormone levels and the zzso of its zzso in response to restraint zzso is not affected in the Homer 1 zzso zzso On the contrary, the zzso of both plasma and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso clearly indicates that the zzso primarily occurred in the adrenal zzso We propose that excessive steroid release may contribute to zzso and zzso zzso and that the Homer 1 gene products may be involved in the zzso of these stress-related mood zzso
