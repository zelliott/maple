In the zzso and zzso systems of zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso gene family they zzso the zzso coupled with the zzso (in particular the zzso alpha zzso and their projection to the zzso bulb are zzso Much information about this complicated system have been collected in different groups, but nothing is known about zzso In this work, the presence and distribution of zzso for different types of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in the zzso zzso and zzso bulb of the shark zzso zzso Only zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso and bulb, both in zzso and zzso Its distribution was partially similar to that found in other zzso it was localized in the zzso zzso zzso in numerous zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the stratum zzso and in the most of zzso in the stratum zzso No zzso was instead observed in the zzso zzso the second type of zzso zzso present in zzso zzso The projections of zzso zzso to zzso bulb probably zzso to the few zzso zzso which were negative to the zzso against zzso These data suggest, in zzso zzso different zzso zzso types send projections to the zzso bulb with a zzso distribution, as observed in other zzso
