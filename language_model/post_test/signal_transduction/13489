The contraction of skeletal muscle is regulated by calcium binding to zzso C zzso zzso consists of two zzso independent zzso each of which contains two metal zzso binding zzso zzso binding to the regulatory sites of the zzso domain triggers muscle contraction by a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso offers a means of zzso the links in this signal path between zzso and zzso zzso Such mapping is possible if the zzso shift the equilibrium between zzso and zzso states of the regulatory complex while maintaining the zzso between calcium binding and tension zzso zzso zzso zzso for yielding this information would be in positions remote from the zzso sites and from the site of development of zzso Analysis of the crystal structure of zzso and of the model of the zzso zzso has enabled us to identify two such zzso zzso 57 and zzso zzso In separate experiments we have replaced each of these zzso by zzso The resulting reduction in calcium affinity indicates that these zzso have a long-range effect on calcium zzso This result may reflect the formation of a salt bridge between positions 57 and 88 that is not present in the native zzso Moreover, the level of tension recovery when the zzso are incorporated into muscle suggests that the interaction between zzso and other muscle components has also been zzso Thus, these zzso may participate in the contraction signal zzso
