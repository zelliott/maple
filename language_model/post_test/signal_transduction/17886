We have taken a genetic approach to investigating zzso mechanisms governing cell zzso in the zzso leaf zzso Previously, we showed that the zzso zzso gene is required for the formation of zzso cell zzso as well as for properly polarized divisions of zzso subsidiary mother cells, and encodes an 8 zzso protein highly zzso in plants and zzso Here, we show that two additional Brick zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the same aspects of zzso cell zzso and zzso As shown previously for zzso analysis of the zzso shows that zzso and zzso are required for the formation of local zzso zzso associated with lobe outgrowth in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso double zzso shows that their zzso are the same as those of zzso single zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso acts non zzso over a short zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso act zzso to promote pavement cell lobe formation, but zzso acts non zzso and zzso partially non zzso to promote polarized subsidiary mother cell zzso Together, these observations indicate that all three zzso genes act in a common zzso in which each zzso gene has a distinct zzso Recent work demonstrating a function for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso implicates the zzso zzso in local regulation of zzso zzso in plant zzso
