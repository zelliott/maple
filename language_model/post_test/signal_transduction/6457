The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso causes a variety of acute and chronic zzso We identified a gene whose zzso results in zzso of zzso due to premature zzso of genes involved in zzso formation and coordinate repression of genes required for initial zzso This zzso zzso encodes a hybrid sensor zzso regulator with an unconventional arrangement of functional zzso zzso zzso profiling indicates that the zzso gene is required for expression of the Type III zzso system and other zzso factors and for repression of genes responsible for zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These disparate zzso are suppressed by zzso insertions in genes zzso the zzso signal zzso pathway, a highly zzso system involved in the control of diverse zzso zzso This study defines zzso as a zzso regulator of multiple zzso zzso that zzso genes required for acute infection and genes associated with chronic zzso
