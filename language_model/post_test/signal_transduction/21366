zzso human bone zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso type I zzso a zzso carrier with a porous structure, was reported to augment cellular activity of zzso zzso The zzso protein family has been suggested to play an important role in the zzso signaling zzso of zzso by its binding to receptors on target zzso However, there has been no study analyzing the downstream genes of the zzso induced zzso signal zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of immobilized zzso on gene expression of zzso signaling molecules on zzso zzso Our study showed two expression patterns of downstream genes of zzso zzso signal zzso zzso In the first pattern, zzso zzso 1, and zzso 5 genes showed high basic expression before the addition of zzso and the high level of gene expression continued for long period and decreased in the late stage when zzso was zzso In the second pattern, zzso 6, zzso 7, and zzso 8 genes showed low basic expression before the addition of zzso and a continuous increase from the beginning was followed by a decrease in the late stage when zzso was zzso Our results also showed that zzso signaling continued for prolonged period when zzso was immobilized to zzso type I zzso This study indicated that zzso zzso is an efficient method to increase bone zzso
