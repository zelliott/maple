The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso receptors for zzso growth factor 2 zzso Because zzso is a potent zzso of skeletal muscle cell proliferation and a strong inhibitor of zzso it is likely that changes in zzso and zzso expression will affect zzso as both, in part, regulate zzso zzso In the current study, expression zzso zzso containing either zzso or zzso were zzso into turkey zzso satellite cells resulting in the zzso of these zzso The amount of expression of each of these genes was measured by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The satellite cell cultures zzso zzso were unable to fuse to form zzso zzso after differentiation was zzso The zzso cells maintained a rounded zzso typical of cells during zzso In contrast, the satellite cells zzso with zzso formed larger zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso play zzso but different, roles in both muscle cell proliferation and zzso
