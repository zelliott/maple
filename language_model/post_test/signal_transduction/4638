zzso use biological signal zzso pathways to respond to environmental stimuli and the behavior of many cell types depends on precise sensing and transmission of external zzso A notable property of signal zzso that was characterized in the zzso zzso zzso cell and many zzso cells is the alignment of zzso zzso It was found that the dose response of the zzso matches closely the dose responses of the zzso This zzso alignment zzso renders equal sensitivities and zzso responses in different parts of signaling system and guarantees a faithful information zzso The experimental observations raise interesting questions about the nature of the information transmission through zzso signaling networks and design principles of signaling systems with this zzso Here, we performed an exhaustive zzso analysis on network zzso that zzso the zzso function in simple regulatory networks composed of two and three zzso The minimal circuits capable of zzso were examined with zzso zzso Several motifs that are essential for the zzso function of zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso space of robust zzso circuits revealed that, rather than zzso the network's zzso the function is primarily realized by zzso regulations on the controlled zzso that are constrained in limiting regions of zzso or zzso
