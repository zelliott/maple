We earlier demonstrated that zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso Furthermore, zzso data suggest that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso However, little is known about the regulation of zzso expression by zzso and the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso We here show that in zzso cells zzso expressing the long form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transient expression of zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein levels were zzso after 2-3 h of zzso treatment and remained elevated at 20 zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso signaling was blocked for more than 20 h after zzso thus zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect cell surface expression of zzso receptors as measured by zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso cells, forced expression of zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso Finally, zzso zzso with zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells is therefore a potential mechanism for zzso resistance, a characteristic feature in human zzso
