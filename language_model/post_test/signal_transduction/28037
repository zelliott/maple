There is evidence that tissue blood flow is regulated by retrograde transmission of signals initiated at zzso and zzso sites, and transmitted via the zzso to zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso as a model to test the hypothesis that normal zzso is required to enable adjustment of blood flow to match tissue zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was assessed by measuring calf blood flow at increasing zzso pressures, using an established small zzso zzso zzso protocol in ten women with zzso 17 normal pregnant controls and ten zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was assessed by measuring plasma levels of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso calf blood flow was significantly lower in zzso than in the other two groups zzso zzso In the zzso group, there was a fall in blood flow as zzso congestion pressure was raised zzso zzso No such change was observed in the other two zzso A significant inverse correlation was observed between the reduction in blood flow in zzso and the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The differences between the zzso women and the other two groups support the notion that the failure to sustain blood flow during a cumulative pressure step protocol in the zzso group might be influenced by interference with the retrograde transmission of signals via the zzso in these zzso
