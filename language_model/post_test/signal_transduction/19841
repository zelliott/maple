In biological systems, carbon dioxide exists in equilibrium with zzso and zzso The individual components of this equilibrium zzso zzso zzso and zzso which must be sensed to be able to maintain cellular and zzso zzso also function as signals to zzso multiple zzso zzso Yet, the molecular sensors for zzso remained unknown until zzso Here, we review recent progress in zzso molecular and cellular mechanisms for sensing zzso zzso and zzso
