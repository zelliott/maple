To determine whether chronic social stress can zzso zzso to normal zzso regulation by zzso zzso 

We analyzed the zzso relationship between plasma cortisol levels and peripheral blood zzso counts over 16 monthly assessments in 18 zzso zzso zzso to zzso social encounters with a stable set of zzso or continually varying social partners zzso zzso 

Animals socialized under stable conditions showed the expected inverse relationship between plasma cortisol zzso and circulating zzso zzso That relationship was significantly attenuated in animals subject to unstable social zzso zzso in zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso emerged within the first week of differential zzso persisted throughout the zzso study period, and were correlated with other measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso axis response to acute stress and zzso response to zzso zzso zzso of unstable social conditions on zzso sensitivity to cortisol regulation were not related to physical zzso 

zzso social stress can impair normal zzso regulation of zzso function by the zzso axis in ways that may contribute to the increased physical health risks associated with social zzso
