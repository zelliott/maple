zzso is a common zzso zzso component for the zzso 6 family of zzso functioning in, for example, zzso zzso and nervous zzso In this study, to investigate the zzso functions of zzso and to determine the pathological consequences of impaired zzso signals, we have generated transgenic mice expressing a zzso truncated form of mouse zzso zzso of this form of zzso in zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a downstream signaling zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, indicating that this form has a dominant negative zzso In spite of the impaired zzso signals, the development of zzso in the transgenic mice appeared normal in terms of surface marker zzso These mice, however, exhibited severe defects in zzso zzso production of most zzso zzso other than zzso after zzso with zzso zzso These results demonstrate in zzso that zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso
