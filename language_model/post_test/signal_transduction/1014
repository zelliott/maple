zzso lupus zzso zzso is an zzso disease in which the immune response to zzso results in exaggerated zzso T helper and diminished zzso T zzso zzso To determine the mechanisms underlying impaired T cell zzso functions, we have investigated the zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso The results demonstrate that diminished zzso protein zzso is the result of deficient type I zzso and type II zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of deficient zzso and zzso activities in zzso T cells is approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities are not associated with disease activity and appear to be stable over zzso Two disparate mechanisms account for these low zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, novel transcript zzso of the zzso alpha gene have been identified that are characterized by zzso zzso and zzso Most zzso are clustered adjacent to zzso motifs and CT zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling via the zzso zzso occurs in zzso T cells, and this is proposed to contribute to abnormal T cell zzso zzso
