We investigated the signaling events involved in the wound response of the marine zzso zzso zzso finding zzso oxide zzso production in relation to zzso The addition of zzso zzso to zzso of injured algae accelerated the zzso of NO production in the wounded zzso Similarly, the addition of an NO donor caused an increase in zzso zzso around the site of zzso By wounding or zzso zzso algae with an NO zzso zzso activity was zzso Based on the use of selected pharmacological zzso our results indicate that zzso production involves the upstream zzso of signaling events similar to those observed in the physiology of higher zzso
