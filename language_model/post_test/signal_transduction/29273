Human zzso zzso infection is a major cause of morbidity in zzso individuals, and zzso zzso infection is a leading cause of birth defects in zzso zzso with zzso viral strains alters zzso and zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso regulates cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso protein complex, zzso requires zzso before binding to receptors that zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso which is strongly induced in the zzso by injury and inflammation but has not previously been found in zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso infection zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, leading to zzso of zzso signaling through its zzso zzso and zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was also found to stimulate collagen synthesis through a mechanism dependent on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso of zzso infection in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and injured zzso zzso of the zzso demonstrating both its induction in zzso and zzso in zzso in zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso contributes to pathological changes and may impair zzso cell functions in zzso that are chronically infected with zzso
