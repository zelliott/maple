We recently reported that human zzso cells zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a second type of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso transcripts expressed by highly zzso zzso cells revealed that they predominantly express products of the zzso zzso Using stable zzso zzso we have analyzed the functional properties of two zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells, namely zzso and zzso which differ in their zzso zzso The zzso binding specificity for both zzso and human zzso zzso was found to be similar to that observed for zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells revealed a protein of around 40 zzso for zzso and a protein of around 32 zzso for zzso Signal zzso studies performed on zzso zzso cells indicated that this zzso is functional, zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso although the zzso zzso chain was not found to functionally associate with zzso In contrast, zzso zzso showed an impaired ability of this zzso to mobilize zzso but zzso of zzso was detected following zzso via zzso These studies demonstrate the functional activity of zzso zzso and suggest that the presence of zzso in addition to zzso on zzso cells may have functional zzso
