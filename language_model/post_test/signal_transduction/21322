The role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signals was examined in zzso The zzso zzso level increased within 1 zzso of HS at 37 degrees zzso After 3 zzso of zzso the zzso level reached a maximum zzso fold zzso Using the transgenic zzso plants that have zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso it was found that the level of zzso activity was zzso by the addition of zzso zzso at both zzso and HS temperatures and was zzso by the zzso C zzso zzso zzso The zzso calcium zzso concentration zzso increased during HS at 37 degrees C in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso Treatment with zzso prevented the increase of zzso to some zzso Above results provided primary evidence for the possible involvement of zzso in HS signal zzso in higher zzso
