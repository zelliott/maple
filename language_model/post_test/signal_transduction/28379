zzso necrosis zzso zzso is known to inhibit zzso gene expression in zzso cells, which are the main source of zzso in zzso In the present study we aimed to characterize the zzso mechanisms of zzso signaling to zzso gene in the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso was found to activate zzso which is one of the principal zzso zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso gene transcription, but zzso appeared not to target the zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso but not the zzso zzso binding sequences in the zzso promoter, seemed to be involved in the suppression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis revealed that the effect of zzso on zzso gene is transmitted by a zzso element zzso located at zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso evidenced for the presence of zzso proteins in the complex that binds to mouse zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso mediates the effect of zzso on zzso zzso targeting a zzso in the mouse zzso zzso
