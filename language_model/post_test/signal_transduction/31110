The zzso zzso is a highly accessible tissue in which to study the properties of adult stem zzso Global gene expression profiling has revealed new markers and regulators of the stem cell zzso Although stem cells have the potential to differentiate into multiple zzso their progeny follow a more restricted number of lineages in undamaged zzso as a result of local zzso zzso The response of the zzso to a particular signal depends on signal strength and zzso Recent advances in the field have led to zzso of the mechanisms by which stem cells are maintained and the pathways that interact with zzso zzso to specify lineage choice as cells leave the stem cell zzso This work has also yielded new insights into skin zzso zzso
