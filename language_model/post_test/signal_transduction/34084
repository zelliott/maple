zzso zzso are crucial for polar cell tip growth, and their zzso and dynamics are regulated by the actions of various zzso proteins zzso We explored the function of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in regulating the zzso dynamics in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso verified zzso functioning as an zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso bundle assembly and protecting zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly disturbed zzso tube growth and zzso with multiple tubes protruding from one zzso grain and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso of the tube zzso zzso expression of zzso induced an zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso that oscillated with growth period but in different zzso at the zzso zzso These results suggest that the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso trafficking to result in growth zzso zzso zzso revealed that the binding affinity of zzso to zzso was simultaneously regulated by both pH and zzso zzso showed a preference for zzso binding under low pH and low zzso zzso The potential functions of zzso as an zzso sensitive to pH and calcium in zzso zzso trafficking, zzso zzso and calcium circumstances to regulate zzso zzso tube growth are zzso
