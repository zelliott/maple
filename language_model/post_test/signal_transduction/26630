To zzso the biological functions of a zzso system zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the zzso template from zzso zzso strain zzso the zzso and zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso double zzso were performed by the suicide zzso zzso and determined zzso signal factor zzso zzso zzso in host rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso production and cell zzso 

zzso and zzso were cloned from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso deleted zzso Compared to the zzso strain zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso but zzso production was remarkably decreased in zzso The zzso production of these zzso was restored by introducing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experimental results indicated that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso loss of zzso in host rice, and decreased zzso level of zzso at zzso compared to that of zzso In L medium zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso sodium zzso 5 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso , zzso was growing at zzso pattern, but the zzso of zzso and zzso led to zzso cell zzso at the wall of the zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso at the bottom of the zzso But zzso only generated zzso zzso at the bottom of the zzso 

The zzso system zzso modulated zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso of zzso which was required for the zzso of zzso in host zzso
