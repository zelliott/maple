zzso oxygen species zzso signal zzso involved in cell growth, cell death, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are produced as a byproduct of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso It is estimated that zzso of the oxygen consumed during zzso is converted to zzso Besides zzso zzso 1 zzso also generates a significant amount of zzso in the zzso In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that zzso control zzso 1 zzso signaling and the loss of control of this signaling contributes to zzso We analyzed zzso expression in a zzso gene knockout zzso cell line and in the zzso zzso cell line in which zzso genes were restored by transfer of wild type zzso into zzso zzso Our study revealed, for the first time, that the zzso of zzso genes leads to zzso of zzso and that the transfer of wild type zzso genes restored the zzso expression to a level comparable to that in the parental cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso we found that zzso cells contained low levels of zzso zzso and that zzso levels reversed to parental levels in zzso cells when zzso expression was restored by transfer of wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso levels also increased the expression of zzso in parental zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was highly expressed in breast zzso and zzso zzso tumors and that its expression positively correlated with expression of zzso C zzso zzso by zzso Our study, described in this paper demonstrates the existence of cross talk between the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, our studies suggest that zzso control zzso zzso signaling and the loss of control of this signaling contributes to breast and zzso zzso
