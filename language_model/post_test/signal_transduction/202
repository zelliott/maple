zzso is a zzso zzso that operates alongside carbon zzso in zzso zzso Because most higher plant species zzso using only the zzso pathway, zzso has a major impact on cellular zzso particularly under high light, high temperatures, and zzso or water zzso Although the functions of zzso remain controversial, it is widely accepted that this zzso influences a wide range of processes from zzso zzso II function, and carbon metabolism to nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a major source of zzso in zzso zzso Through zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso makes a key contribution to cellular zzso zzso In so doing, it influences multiple signaling zzso particularly those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and programmed cell zzso The potential influence of zzso on cell physiology and fate is thus complex and wide zzso The zzso zzso and signaling functions of zzso are considered here in the context of whole plant biology, with reference to future challenges and human interventions to diminish zzso zzso
