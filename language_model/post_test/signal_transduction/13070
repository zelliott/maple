It is well established that zzso can induce zzso zzso suppression of zzso B virus zzso but the mechanisms involved are zzso Cell culture studies to characterize these mechanisms are zzso in part because zzso B virus replicates almost exclusively in zzso zzso To overcome this limitation we used a zzso zzso zzso B virus expression system, which leads to zzso viral replication even in zzso cell zzso In this experimental system zzso treatment specifically suppressed viral replication demonstrating that zzso activities against zzso B virus are not restricted to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso protein was recently reported to play a key role in the zzso action of zzso against zzso B zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso also suppresses zzso B virus replication in zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso is not essential for these zzso Taken together, our data imply that the experimental approach presented can also be adapted to established cell lines which are deficient in parts of the signal zzso zzso or other elements located further zzso providing important insights into mechanisms specifically suppressing zzso B zzso
