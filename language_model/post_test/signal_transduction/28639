zzso zzso is a widespread environmental zzso that has been linked with a variety of deleterious effects on human health, including increased cancer rates and zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso are zzso via the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso factor that regulates the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we examined the ability of synthetic derivatives of salicylic acid to affect zzso zzso signal zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso drug, caused a potent and long-lasting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the naturally occurring zzso salicylic acid had no effect on zzso zzso zzso inhibited the increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels that occurs on exposure to zzso zzso zzso of these genes was also inhibited by zzso but not by aspirin or salicylic acid, as demonstrated by zzso reporter zzso The zzso of the zzso family of genes is regulated by the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso element present in the promoter regions of these zzso As shown by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso completely blocked the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso responsive zzso Also, zzso substantially blocked the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso a commonly used zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso signal zzso and may be an effective agent in the prevention of zzso zzso
