zzso clinical observations and ongoing studies have shown significant zzso effect of external Qi of Yan zzso zzso which originated from traditional Chinese zzso In order to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of external Qi of Yan zzso zzso we have examined its zzso effect on zzso pancreatic cancer cells and its effect on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that external Qi of Yan zzso zzso dramatically inhibited zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso External Qi of Yan zzso zzso also inhibited zzso and zzso activities of nuclear zzso B, a target of the zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso Furthermore, a single zzso exposure of zzso cells to external Qi of Yan zzso zzso induced zzso accompanied by a dramatic increase of the zzso cell population, DNA zzso and zzso of zzso 3, 8 and 9, and zzso zzso zzso treatment with external Qi of Yan zzso zzso caused rapid zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso with external Qi of Yan zzso zzso induced transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and caused no zzso zzso These findings suggest that external Qi of Yan zzso zzso may zzso regulate these survival pathways in cancer versus normal cells and exert zzso effects zzso on cancer cells, and that it could potentially be a valuable approach for therapy of pancreatic zzso
