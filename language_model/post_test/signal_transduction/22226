zzso diet has been implicated as a major cause of insulin resistance and zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and insulin tolerance in high-fat diet fed zzso zzso were randomly assigned to orally receive vehicle or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso mice exhibited impaired zzso and zzso tolerance and elevated serum zzso levels compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso muscles, assessed as zzso incorporation was markedly diminished in high-fat fed mice compared to control zzso Treatment with zzso zzso the high-fat zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso differentiated zzso with zzso acid evoked insulin resistance as evidenced by lower levels of zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso in the zzso zzso by measuring the extent of zzso of zzso by zzso and impairment in cellular zzso zzso all of which were inhibited by zzso These results suggest a beneficial effect of zzso in insulin resistant zzso It is likely that these effects of zzso may be zzso by zzso downstream insulin zzso
