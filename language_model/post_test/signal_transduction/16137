zzso systems zzso their response sensitivity upon adaptation according to simple strategies that recur in processes as diverse as zzso zzso neural network responses, and zzso zzso Here, we study response zzso in zzso coli zzso where adaptation zzso tunes the zzso zzso response during searches for zzso Using in zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso on immobilized cells, we demonstrate that the design of this zzso signaling network follows the zzso detection zzso strategy, responding faithfully to the shape of the input profile irrespective of its absolute zzso Using a zzso zzso for free swimming cells, we confirm zzso zzso responses at the behavioral zzso By theoretical analysis, we identify a set of sufficient conditions for zzso in zzso coli zzso which leads to the prediction that the adaptation zzso is zzso with respect to the background input zzso Additional zzso experiments confirm that the adaptation zzso is zzso over an zzso range of background zzso These observations in a highly zzso bacterial system support the concept that zzso represents a robust sensing strategy for spatial zzso To our knowledge, these experiments provide a unique demonstration of zzso in any biological sensory zzso
