A zzso network is the sum of all chemical transformations or reactions in the cell, with the zzso being interconnected by zzso zzso Many zzso exist in numerous species while others occur only in a zzso We ask if there are relationships between the zzso profile of an zzso or the number of different bacterial species that contain it, and its zzso importance in the zzso zzso Our zzso hypothesis is that zzso profile is independent of zzso zzso To test our zzso hypothesis we constructed an zzso network from the zzso zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso We calculated three network zzso of zzso zzso the degree or the number of connections of a network zzso closeness zzso which measures how close a zzso is to zzso and zzso zzso measuring how frequently a zzso appears on all shortest paths between two other zzso 

zzso zzso profile zzso best with zzso zzso and also quite closely with degree, but poorly with closeness zzso Both zzso and closeness zzso are zzso measures of zzso importance and it is intriguing that they have contrasting power of predicting zzso profile in bacterial zzso We speculate that zzso in an zzso network may be reflected by zzso zzso but not by closeness zzso We also discuss factors influencing the correlation between zzso profile and zzso zzso 

Our analysis zzso the hypothesis that zzso profile of zzso is independent of zzso network zzso Our results show that zzso profile zzso better with degree and zzso zzso but less so with closeness zzso zzso that occur in many bacterial species tend to be those that have high network zzso We speculate that this phenomenon originates in mechanisms driving network zzso zzso zzso reflects zzso profile zzso This is because zzso networks often consist of distinct functional zzso and some are not in the zzso of the zzso zzso in these peripheral parts of a network might be important for cell survival and should therefore occur in many bacterial zzso They are, however, distant from other zzso in the same zzso
