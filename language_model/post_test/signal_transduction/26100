The zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso causes complex adaptations at the molecular and cellular levels altering the activity of different brain zzso The present study aims to verify the effects of single and repeated injections of zzso on zzso and zzso systems gene regulation in the zzso an area rich in zzso containing zzso Both acute and chronic zzso a day for zzso zzso zzso induced a marked increase in zzso zzso levels as well as in zzso response zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without causing any effect on zzso zzso zzso or zzso system (both zzso and its zzso genes zzso in this brain zzso The blockade of zzso receptors by zzso abolished the acute zzso increase in zzso Moreover, the zzso chronic administration of both zzso and zzso zzso induced a significant increase in all the zzso or zzso system genes expression and in zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest the involvement of zzso in the effects evoked by zzso in the zzso possibly via zzso and zzso cascade zzso since the zzso inhibitor zzso prevented the zzso zzso gene zzso and, zzso also through the involvement of zzso zzso zzso it is also possible to zzso a general inhibitor role of zzso in the effects evoked by zzso Moreover, these findings strengthen the hypothesis, already proposed, of a zzso role for both zzso and zzso
