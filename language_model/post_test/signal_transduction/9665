zzso a zzso zzso factor controlled by zzso zzso has been recently shown to regulate zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in these actions of zzso We have used a zzso analysis to identify zzso regulated genes related with zzso zzso One of such genes is zzso whose zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in cultured mouse zzso zzso induced an increase in the number of primary zzso and in the number of zzso synaptic zzso at 4 days in zzso The same changes were provoked by zzso of zzso In addition zzso of zzso by the use of zzso impaired such zzso and synaptic changes induced by zzso zzso in zzso These results reveal a previously unknown involvement of zzso in zzso and zzso and indicate that this protein is a key component of the zzso signaling zzso that controls zzso zzso
