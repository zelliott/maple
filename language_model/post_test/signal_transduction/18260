zzso zzso signal zzso protein couples zzso zzso signals with the zzso of the zzso zzso thus leading to cell differentiation and/or zzso We have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein zzso zzso whose similarity with zzso is zzso and with zzso and zzso is zzso zzso preserves the unique, complex structure of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to regions that are zzso rich, zzso rich and zzso zzso zzso is located on the X zzso in zzso zzso zzso and is expressed in all stages of development and in all zzso In zzso cells, zzso is zzso in response to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso region is associated with zzso zzso Thus, zzso probably plays a pivotal role as a signal zzso protein during fruit fly zzso
