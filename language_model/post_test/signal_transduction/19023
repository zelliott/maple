zzso zzso is a zzso zzso syndrome caused by loss of zzso a zzso involved in multiple signaling zzso Here, we propose a novel role for zzso in cultured zzso cells, namely the regulation of cell growth by contact zzso We show that zzso is zzso in zzso cells reaching zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells increases the expression of the zzso gene zzso and zzso key cell cycle regulator zzso such as zzso A, zzso zzso E and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso and thus zzso in zzso zzso cells can be inhibited by an zzso zzso blocking specifically zzso zzso interactions between adjacent cell zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso could participate in a molecular zzso linking zzso zzso to cell cycle control and may help further clarify the role of zzso in zzso cell biology and zzso
