zzso is a zzso zzso type 5 inhibitor that zzso zzso zzso following the zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso promotes the production of the zzso zzso carbon monoxide and zzso oxide, by stimulating the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso increased zzso expression and zzso zzso expression of zzso and NO synthesis by zzso The induction of zzso was unaffected by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the protein zzso G inhibitor zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso increase in zzso promoter activity was abolished by mutating the zzso responsive elements in the promoter or by zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the induction of zzso by zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso oxygen species zzso and blocked by zzso and zzso In contrast, the enhancement of zzso NO synthesis by zzso was prevented by zzso and the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and duplicated by zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that zzso stimulates the expression of zzso and zzso via the zzso and zzso pathway, zzso The ability of zzso to block the zzso of zzso while stimulating the synthesis of zzso gaseous zzso through the induction of zzso and zzso provides a potent mechanism by which zzso vascular actions of this drug are zzso
