zzso zzso refers to the modification by zzso zzso zzso products to form zzso zzso which for many years has been considered as a deleterious consequence of zzso zzso zzso lipids or zzso containing zzso zzso react readily with zzso to form Schiff zzso zzso zzso products containing zzso zzso are susceptible to zzso attack by zzso zzso or zzso zzso to yield Michael zzso overall corresponding to a large number of possible protein zzso The most common detection methods for zzso proteins take advantage of the presence of zzso zzso groups to add labels, or use zzso These methods have limitations in terms of specificity and identification of the modification zzso The latter question is zzso addressed by mass zzso which enables the characterization of the zzso zzso This has allowed the identification of zzso proteins in zzso and pathological zzso While in many cases zzso interferes with protein function, causing zzso of zzso activity and increased zzso there are a small number of cases where zzso results in gain of function or zzso For certain proteins zzso may represent a form of zzso zzso although more work is required to confirm the zzso relevance and mechanisms of such zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications in biology and zzso
