zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso storage disorder, caused by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and results in the zzso of zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso are poorly zzso Here we demonstrate increased zzso in zzso zzso mouse brains as evidenced by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso brain was found to be accompanied with enhanced zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso c zzso activity was significantly decreased in brains and cultured zzso from zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso were zzso abnormal and had a decreased membrane zzso These cells were more sensitive to zzso stress than wild type cells and this sensitivity was suppressed by zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso These results suggest zzso of zzso leading to zzso dysfunction in the brain of zzso
