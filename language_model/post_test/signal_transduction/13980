Birth zzso stress is an zzso response to a sudden transition process from maternal zzso zzso in zzso to autonomous pulmonary zzso outside the zzso Meanwhile, zzso stress has been demonstrated to be associated with various zzso recorded in zzso So, this research aimed to study the zzso stress and the development of zzso system in newborn zzso The measured variables include plasma zzso protein and DNA zzso injury, the activities of plasma zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso gene expressions at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after zzso Meanwhile, the nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso factor zzso and tumor protein 53 zzso were determined by western zzso The results showed that newborn zzso suffered seriously from birth zzso stress because of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso injury activated zzso signaling pathway, resulting in the expression of zzso genes and release of zzso zzso With the development of zzso system, the zzso balance gradually recovered on Day 7 after zzso In conclusion, birth caused zzso stress and the zzso balance gradually recovered with the development of zzso zzso
