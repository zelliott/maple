zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has being found in connection with several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in different organisms and experimental zzso We have analyzed the consequences of changing the levels of zzso expression in the development of the zzso wing, a convenient model system to characterize gene function during zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso and zzso conditions we find that zzso activity affects cell growth and viability in the zzso zzso These requirements are related to the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and are best detected when the larvae grow in a medium with low protein concentration zzso or are exposed to zzso zzso We also show that zzso display strong genetic interactions with different components of the zzso zzso pathway, and can interact directly with the zzso zzso and zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso has two independent functions during wing development, one related to the zzso of the zzso zzso in response to stress and other in the assembling or zzso of the zzso complex, being critical to zzso cellular responses to changes in zzso zzso
