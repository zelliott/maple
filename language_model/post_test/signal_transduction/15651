To maintain the length of zzso life in a woman, it is essential that most of her zzso primordial zzso are maintained in a zzso state to provide a continuous supply of zzso However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the zzso and zzso of primordial zzso is still in its zzso In this study, we provide some genetic evidence to show that the tumor zzso zzso sclerosis complex 2 zzso which zzso regulates zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso functions in zzso to maintain the dormancy of primordial zzso In zzso mice lacking the zzso gene in zzso the pool of primordial zzso is activated prematurely due to elevated zzso activity in zzso This results in depletion of zzso in early adulthood, causing premature zzso failure zzso Our results suggest that the zzso complex zzso suppression of zzso activity is indispensable for maintenance of the dormancy of primordial zzso thus preserving the zzso pool, and that zzso activity in zzso promotes zzso zzso Our results also indicate that deregulation of zzso signaling in zzso may cause pathological conditions of the zzso such as zzso and zzso
