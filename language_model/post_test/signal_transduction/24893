The ability to emit and receive signals over long distances is one of the characteristic attributes of zzso zzso Such communication can be zzso in different manners (by chemical compounds, light waves, acoustic waves zzso and usually is reflected in the zzso of the zzso zzso Recently, we reported that individual zzso zzso zzso zzso structures, can also communicate at long distance by means of volatile zzso which is produced by colonies in zzso separated by zzso of the zzso Here, we demonstrate that the colony that first reached the stage of intense zzso production zzso zzso production response in surrounding colonies regardless of their age, causing the zzso of their zzso zzso and, consequently, the mutual affection of their zzso Also an artificial source of zzso (but neither zzso nor zzso zzso can immediately induce the zzso production even in the colony starting its zzso stage of the zzso The repeated transition of zzso zzso colonies from the zzso phase to the phase of intensive zzso production is accompanied by dramatic changes in colony zzso and also in cell zzso and zzso Relatively smooth colonies in the zzso phase are formed by growing zzso After zzso zzso zzso decompose into zzso zzso cells, which rearrange themselves into ruffled zzso zzso The zzso of colony growth, that also exists between zzso colonies of different zzso could be important in establishing their optimal distribution in a natural zzso
