zzso 1 zzso protein zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins that play critical zzso roles in controlling zzso cell growth and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso zzso protein of 200 zzso zzso is a recently discovered binding partner of zzso Here we isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed that it mediates zzso zzso as a genetically downstream component in diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experienced severe mobility loss associated with zzso zzso defects and zzso The zzso zzso were also devoid of both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and fat body, while having no defects in zzso transport and projection in developing zzso Interestingly, moderate zzso of zzso accelerated both zzso growth and aging, accompanied by target of zzso zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso is a critical downstream component of zzso and specifically mediates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
