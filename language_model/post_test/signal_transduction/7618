Early growth response gene 1 zzso is a member of the immediate early gene zzso family of zzso factors and plays a role in memory zzso To identify zzso target genes in brain of Alzheimer's disease zzso model mice - zzso we applied zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso DNA sequencing zzso zzso zzso of genes associated with zzso binding revealed a set of related networks including synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane fusion and transmission of signals zzso by zzso zzso zzso binding is associated with significant enrichment of zzso zzso marks and appears enriched near genes that are zzso in the brains of zzso zzso Among the putative zzso targets identified and validated in this study are genes related to synaptic plasticity and transport of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and genes implicated in zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso We also demonstrate a potential regulatory link between zzso and its newly identified targets in zzso since conditions that zzso zzso levels in brain, such as a spatial memory test, also lead to increased expression of the zzso On the other hand, protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are significantly lower in the brain of adult zzso mice than in zzso wild type zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso regulates the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso transport and synaptic transmission that may be critical for zzso zzso
