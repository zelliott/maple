Common G zzso zzso zzso gene zzso that zzso zzso proteins with a distinct sequence may alter drug efficacy without always resulting in a disease zzso zzso genetic zzso harbor numerous zzso such as DNA insertions or deletions and zzso zzso that alter zzso expression and function, thereby contributing to zzso differences in disease zzso and drug zzso In this chapter, these zzso phenomena are reviewed with respect to a limited sampling of zzso systems, including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In each example, the nature of the disruption to zzso function that results from each zzso is discussed with respect to the regulation of gene zzso expression on cell surface zzso by zzso trafficking, zzso zzso or zzso of zzso function (by altering zzso zzso G protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite the breadth of zzso knowledge available, assessment for genetic zzso is only occasionally applied to drug development projects involving zzso or to zzso the clinical use of zzso zzso The continued effort by the basic science of zzso may draw the attention of drug discovery projects and clinicians alike to the utility of personalized zzso as a means to zzso novel zzso drug zzso
