The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is elevated in zzso zzso This study found that zzso signaling via zzso regulates expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso are elevated in cancer tissue compared with normal zzso and localized to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity, zzso and protein zzso and these effects were abolished by zzso of cells with zzso zzso or chemical zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso was elevated in response to 100 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso and increased zzso were present in zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso media from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso which could be abolished by zzso protein zzso of the zzso media or antagonism of zzso Finally, zzso tumors in nude mice arising from zzso with zzso cells showed increased zzso zzso compared with tumors arising from zzso cells or following treatment of mice bearing zzso tumors with zzso zzso In conclusion, our results show a novel zzso zzso that may regulate the inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso via zzso zzso
