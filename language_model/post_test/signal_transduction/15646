zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso proteins containing retinal as zzso zzso zzso II zzso triggers two very different responses upon light zzso depending on the presence or the absence of its zzso zzso zzso Whereas light zzso of the zzso complex activates a zzso cascade that zzso the zzso response, zzso alone acts as a zzso zzso Using zzso force zzso we zzso the stability of zzso and its complex with the zzso in the dark and under zzso By improving force zzso data analysis, we were able to reveal the zzso of occurring forces within the protein chain with a resolution of about six zzso zzso zzso regions in zzso G and F were affected differently, depending on the experimental zzso The results are generally in line with previous data on the molecular stability of zzso Interestingly, new interaction sites were identified upon light zzso whose functional importance is discussed in zzso
