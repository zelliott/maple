zzso receptors zzso play a clear role in the burst of inflammatory reactions and immune zzso However, for zzso the most elusive member of the zzso family, the functional role is still largely zzso It has been claimed that zzso does not signal zzso although the wide expression of human zzso indicates its important zzso zzso We demonstrate that in zzso cells, zzso zzso with human zzso zzso induced calcium zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso We confirmed this finding using human lung zzso and human zzso cells that express zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exposure of zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso coinciding with zzso zzso The effects of zzso were not dependent on zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso gene zzso Thus, we propose that zzso is able to signal autonomously to induce zzso release zzso by zzso zzso which contributes actively to inflammatory zzso
