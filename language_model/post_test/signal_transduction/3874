The zzso cartilage consists of resident zzso embedded within the zzso zzso which contains several components such as collagen and zzso acids zzso zzso is a major cell surface zzso for zzso and is zzso to zzso zzso Although zzso is present in cartilage, it is not clear if zzso adhere to zzso through zzso or whether such zzso changes the function of zzso We studied the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the effects of such zzso on zzso zzso zzso were performed using the human zzso zzso cell line zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso cells highly expressed zzso zzso zzso cells efficiently zzso to zzso without any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso of zzso cells to zzso was mainly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso to zzso increased the proliferation of zzso cells, independent of transforming growth zzso zzso but this was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso also induced zzso zzso expression and this was also inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a process also reduced by zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells effectively zzso to zzso through cell surface zzso The zzso was also involved in cellular signaling which induced cellular proliferation and expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso expression within the zzso Our results indicate that zzso on zzso plays an important role in normal and abnormal functions of cartilage through its zzso to zzso which zzso a variety of zzso signals to regulate zzso proliferation as well as zzso synthesis in cartilage zzso
