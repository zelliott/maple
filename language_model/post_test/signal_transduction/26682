Prevention of tissue damages at the site of zzso major zzso can be achieved if the zzso mice are zzso given zzso major zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cells zzso that had been exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso As previous studies allowed establishing that zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of the immune response towards a type 1 profile, we were interested in further exploring the role of zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso mice or zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso mice were given either zzso or zzso zzso bone zzso DC exposed or not to zzso zzso prior to zzso of zzso zzso zzso major zzso into the zzso zzso The results provide evidence that zzso signaling in the zzso DC is required to prevent tissue damage at the site of zzso major zzso as properly zzso zzso DC but not zzso DC were able to zzso zzso Furthermore, uncontrolled zzso major population size expansion was observed in the zzso and the zzso draining zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso DC, indicating the influence of zzso signaling in host DC to control zzso zzso In addition, no zzso damage occurred in zzso mice that were zzso zzso with zzso zzso DC doubly exposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso We discuss these findings and suggest that the zzso signaling zzso could be a key zzso to trigger when designing vaccines aimed to prevent damaging processes in zzso hosting zzso zzso
