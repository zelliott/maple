zzso in diseases caused by altered metabolism of zzso prion protein zzso can be averted by reducing zzso zzso To identify novel pathways for zzso zzso we analyzed cells that had adapted to the negative selection pressure of stable zzso of a zzso zzso zzso A zzso cell line was isolated that selectively and zzso routes zzso and various zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso cells revealed that a zzso in zzso zzso anchor synthesis leads to an zzso zzso signal sequence that directs both zzso retention and efficient zzso of zzso An zzso zzso signal was sufficient to impart zzso zzso but not zzso to a zzso zzso revealing an unexpected role for the mature domain in the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into the quality control pathways for zzso zzso proteins and identify zzso of the zzso signal sequence as a step in zzso zzso that is absolutely required for its surface zzso As each zzso signal sequence is unique, these results also identify signal recognition by the zzso as a potential step for selective small zzso zzso of zzso zzso
