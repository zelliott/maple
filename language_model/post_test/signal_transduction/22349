zzso is characterized by zzso inflammation and zzso zzso tissue has increasingly been recognized as an active zzso organ zzso so-called zzso Among these, zzso zzso but not yet extensively zzso been defined as a novel inflammatory marker in zzso The zzso underlying this zzso however, remains to be fully zzso The aim of the study is to determine whether zzso might affect zzso characteristics of human coronary artery zzso cells zzso 

zzso of zzso with zzso caused zzso of tissue factor zzso expression as demonstrated by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity was induced in a zzso manner, as shown by real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by oxygen free zzso through the zzso of the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and by suppression of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and BAY zzso 

These data confirm the hypothesis that zzso may contribute to zzso exerting direct effects on zzso by promoting zzso zzso thus, it represents an zzso zzso able to induce a zzso zzso in cells present in the vessel zzso
