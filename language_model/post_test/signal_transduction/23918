zzso zzso have a reduced in zzso life span before entering zzso zzso Although this has been thought to be zzso in the accelerated zzso of this disease, controversy remains as to whether zzso syndrome is showing the acceleration of a normal cellular zzso mechanism or the occurrence of a novel zzso zzso Here, we zzso the zzso pathways responsible for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after approximately 20 population zzso with most of the cells having a zzso content of zzso This was associated with zzso zzso and high levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells re-entered the cell cycle following zzso of a zzso zzso Similarly, production of the human zzso virus 16 E6 zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso being zzso and extended cellular life zzso zzso zzso expressing E6 did not zzso indefinitely but reached a second zzso lifespan barrier, termed zzso that could be zzso by forced production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The conclusions from these studies are that: zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso event; and zzso the intermediate lifespan barrier zzso is also a zzso event, although it appears to be independent of zzso zzso zzso resemble normal human zzso for both these zzso lifespan zzso with the strong similarity between the zzso zzso linking zzso to zzso arrest in zzso and normal zzso providing further support for the zzso in zzso syndrome causing the acceleration of a normal zzso zzso
