zzso receptors are highly expressed in the zzso The downstream signaling mechanisms associated with the zzso zzso zzso have been shown to involve the zzso of protein zzso C zzso the control of zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso But few studies examined the regulatory effect of zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso The present paper studied the regulatory effect of zzso receptors on the signaling of zzso D1 zzso one of zzso zzso by examining the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the D1 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at zzso sites using the zzso from the zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso alone had no effects on the zzso activity, but could amplify the D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also amplified the zzso analog of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not on the D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The conventional zzso zzso especially the zzso and the zzso zzso influx through zzso zzso channels might play key roles in the amplifying effect of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was the upstream event of the increase in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso receptors may amplify the D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso receptors - zzso (especially the zzso - zzso zzso channels - zzso - zzso and/or zzso signaling zzso
