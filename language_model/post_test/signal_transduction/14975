The zzso growth factors zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso exert important effects on growth, development, and differentiation through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The insulin zzso zzso is structurally related to the zzso and at high zzso the zzso can also activate the zzso in spite of their generally low affinity for the zzso Two mechanisms that facilitate cross talk between the zzso zzso and the zzso at zzso zzso have been zzso The first of these is the existence of an alternatively spliced zzso zzso that exhibits high affinity for zzso as well as for zzso A second phenomenon is the ability of hybrid receptors comprised of zzso and zzso zzso to bind zzso but not zzso To date, however, direct zzso of an zzso zzso by zzso at zzso levels has not been zzso We have now found that zzso can function through both zzso zzso of the zzso in spite of low zzso to specifically activate zzso to levels similar to those seen with equivalent zzso of insulin or zzso The specific zzso of zzso by zzso through the zzso does not result in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso but does induce delayed low-level zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and biological effects such as enhanced cell viability and protection from zzso These findings suggest that zzso can function directly through the zzso and that the observed effects of zzso on insulin sensitivity may be the result of direct zzso of insulin action by zzso zzso of the zzso in insulin target zzso
