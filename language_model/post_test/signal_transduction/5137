The zzso influence and zzso zzso between bone and energy metabolism is a recent finding, since the discovery that the product of zzso zzso increases pancreatic zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso the anabolic effect of insulin is crucial for zzso function, as suggested by severe zzso and increased zzso of fracture in zzso diabetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is commonly expressed in the zzso liver, muscle, and zzso zzso is also found in animal and human zzso Here we show that in human bone two insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso are differently zzso zzso human zzso predominantly express zzso whereas zzso is mainly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio significantly increases along the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso show an increased proliferation zzso In contrast, when zzso with and zzso zzso their proliferation rate is reduced, corresponding to a more differentiated zzso In conclusion, the fine regulation of the expression of different zzso of zzso during zzso differentiation confirms the important role played by zzso in bone zzso providing the basis for new perspectives on the various zzso of zzso zzso in bone zzso
