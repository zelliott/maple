In order for zzso zzso to fuse during zzso zzso zzso must generate forces that are sufficient to move the zzso zzso Nuclear movements during zzso rely on zzso proteins zzso many of which have been characterized extensively during zzso A useful model system to study zzso forces before nuclear fusion, or zzso is the mating zzso of budding zzso Dynamic zzso are guided to the mating projection zzso zzso when zzso proteins interact with polarized zzso zzso If two zzso tips are in proximity they may zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso oriented zzso plus ends interact and draw the zzso zzso The zzso proteins in the zzso mating zzso are zzso in zzso cells and may play a role in higher zzso zzso Thus, understanding the mechanism of plus end orientation and zzso in budding zzso will reveal mechanisms of zzso force generation zzso throughout zzso
