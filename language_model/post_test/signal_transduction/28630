The analysis of zzso pathways with mathematical models contributes to the better understanding of the behavior of zzso zzso This paper presents the analysis of a mathematical model for zzso zzso and metabolism in zzso zzso It is shown that the dynamic processes cover a broad time span from some milliseconds to several zzso Based on this analysis the fast processes could be described with zzso characteristic zzso A subsequent zzso analysis of the model parameters shows that the fast part of the system may act as a filter for the slow part of the system; the sensitivities of the fast system are zzso From these findings it is concluded that the slow part of the system shows some zzso against changes in parameters of the fast zzso zzso if a zzso shows no sensitivity for the fast part of the system, it will also show no sensitivity for the slow part of the zzso
