Cellular physiology and metabolism were monitored using a zzso real-time combination of zzso and zzso data to estimate zzso zzso in an established zzso zzso The utility of this approach towards zzso zzso operation was demonstrated for zzso cells cultivated in 15 L zzso zzso at 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso composition and dilution rates were changed to obtain several steady states with varying zzso and zzso zzso When cells were restored to initial culture medium and zzso rate conditions after being exposed to lower zzso and zzso zzso the zzso flux into the zzso cycle was increased zzso while the zzso flux through zzso was decreased zzso suggesting zzso zzso By appropriately altering cellular zzso zzso zzso can operate at lower zzso rates without significant zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso Changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso rates had significant effects on the calculation of other zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of these key zzso zzso highlighted the need for accurate and reliable real-time zzso Overall, rapid observation of zzso zzso can be a valuable tool for zzso development, monitoring and zzso The framework presented in this study offers a convenient means for zzso real-time zzso of zzso zzso and represents a step towards realizing the potential of zzso flux analysis for accelerated zzso zzso
