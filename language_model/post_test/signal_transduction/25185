The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso promotes cellular gene zzso following its zzso at zzso via recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in turn, appear to mediate target gene induction via their association with zzso zzso II complexes and via intrinsic zzso zzso activities that mobilize zzso zzso In addition to zzso a wide variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and growth factor addition, induce zzso zzso with zzso and zzso comparable to those induced by zzso Yet a number of these signals are incapable of promoting target gene zzso via zzso zzso per se, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory events either at the level of zzso complex formation or in the subsequent recruitment of the zzso zzso Here we characterize a zzso zzso zzso that behaves as a zzso zzso in zzso Like protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to stimulate target gene expression via the zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso studies reveal that zzso of zzso to zzso lowers the zzso for zzso zzso and thereby zzso high levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with its zzso activity, zzso zzso strongly promoted differentiation of zzso cells in concert with zzso doses of nerve growth zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso is sufficient for cellular gene zzso and that additional zzso modifications of zzso or zzso are not required for recruitment of the zzso apparatus to the zzso
