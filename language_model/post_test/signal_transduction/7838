The emergence of zzso resistant varieties of zzso zzso zzso zzso has led to a search for novel drug zzso An in zzso comparative analysis of zzso pathways of the host Homo sapiens zzso zzso and the pathogen zzso zzso have been zzso zzso from the zzso pathways of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso database were compared with proteins from the host zzso zzso by performing a zzso search against the zzso database restricted to the zzso sapiens zzso The zzso threshold zzso was set to zzso zzso which do not show similarity to any of the host zzso below this zzso were filtered out as potential drug zzso Five pathways unique to the pathogen zzso zzso when compared to the host zzso sapiens have been zzso Potential drug targets from these pathways could be useful for the discovery of zzso zzso Potential drug targets were also identified from pathways related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso energy zzso vitamin and zzso zzso pathways and zzso zzso Of the 161 distinct targets identified from these zzso many are in various stages of progress at the zzso Genome zzso However, 44 of the targets are new and can be considered for rational drug zzso The study was successful in listing out potential drug targets from the zzso zzso zzso involved in vital aspects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell wall zzso This systematic evaluation of zzso pathways of host and pathogen through reliable and conventional zzso approach can be extended to other pathogens of clinical zzso
