zzso zzso is among the most prevalent and zzso of zzso zzso The resistance of zzso zzso to zzso zzso antibiotics is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso production of zzso zzso proteins zzso Despite their distinct modes of resistance, expression of these proteins is controlled by similar regulation systems, including a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Resistance is triggered in response to a zzso binding event between a zzso zzso and the zzso sensor domain of zzso by zzso of the binding signal to an zzso zzso domain capable of zzso zzso This study describes the first crystal structures of the sensor domain of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso The structures show that the sensor domain resembles the zzso class D zzso but is rendered a zzso protein due to the formation of a very stable zzso Surprisingly, zzso changes upon zzso binding were not observed in our structures, supporting the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso signal into the zzso is zzso by additional zzso interactions of the sensor domain with an adjacent zzso loop in zzso
