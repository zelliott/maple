Cellular production of zzso zzso is controlled by the concerted actions of zzso zzso and terminal PG zzso on zzso acid in response to zzso zzso Recently, we showed in an zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production through zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso activity and zzso signaling but it is unclear how each zzso contributes to PG zzso zzso cells were zzso with either zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso The PG production and zzso and PG zzso expression were zzso Surprisingly, zzso and zzso produced zzso but not zzso This corresponded to induction of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein levels did not zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling by zzso resulted in the delayed zzso of zzso The combined effect of zzso and zzso signaling were prolonged zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso activity, zzso activity, or zzso signaling blocked zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso blocked zzso induction of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso blocked zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso These findings demonstrate a coordinated induction of zzso and zzso by zzso that proceeds through zzso and zzso signaling zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso
