We have previously shown that calcium zzso zzso of Ramos human B cells is preceded by the induced expression of early response zzso zzso a requirement for new gene expression in this mode of programmed cell zzso We have found in the present studies that zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso D, are also potent zzso of zzso in the same Ramos cell zzso These drugs trigger zzso through apparently early gene zzso zzso Although different mechanisms for induction of zzso exist in Ramos cells, enforced zzso of zzso protects cells from zzso induced in response to different agents, demonstrating that zzso blocks a final common zzso for programmed cell death in the Ramos cell zzso
