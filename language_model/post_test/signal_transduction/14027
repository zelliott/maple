zzso heart function requires generation of a regular rhythm by zzso zzso cells and the zzso of this spontaneous heart rate by the zzso input to match zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that ensure consistent zzso of cardiac zzso and fine tuning of this process by zzso system are not completely zzso Here we examined the contribution of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which mediates the negative zzso effect of zzso zzso to the regulation of the cardiac zzso zzso Using isolated heart preparations and zzso recordings we show that the zzso signaling zzso controls the zzso and firing pattern of the zzso zzso and determines zzso of cardiac rhythm in a manner independent from the zzso zzso zzso of the major regulator of this pathway, zzso in mice results in irregular cardiac zzso and increases zzso to zzso zzso We further identify several human subjects with zzso in the zzso gene and show that the loss of function in zzso zzso with increased heart rate zzso These findings identify the essential role of the zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of cardiac zzso rhythm and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
