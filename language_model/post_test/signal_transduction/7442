zzso communication has proven to be even more complex than previously thought since the discovery that zzso zzso serve as containers of biological information on various zzso zzso zzso zzso are classified into zzso zzso or zzso bodies, originating from different zzso zzso The cellular machinery controlling their formation and zzso as well as the mechanisms regulating their zzso release, remain zzso much zzso zzso zzso have been found in zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso Their zzso potential has raised significant interest in the cardiovascular field because the zzso composition and zzso content are specific signatures of cellular zzso and zzso More than simply cell dust, zzso zzso are capable of transferring biological information to neighboring cells and play an active role in inflammatory diseases, including zzso and zzso The molecular interactions regulating these effects involve specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, or delivery of genetic information to target zzso zzso their mechanisms of action will likely open new therapeutic zzso
