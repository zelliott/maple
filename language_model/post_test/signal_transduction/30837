zzso regulation of T and B zzso immune responses plays a critical role in the control and zzso of zzso zzso This review is focused on the adapter zzso zzso and its regulation of zzso through its impact on both T and B zzso immune zzso Whereas zzso zzso is an important negative regulator for B zzso zzso immune responses through its function in zzso and zzso zzso recent studies have shown that zzso is also a key positive signaling component for zzso signaling pathway, critical for zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso The dual functions of zzso are evident in zzso mice that displayed B zzso zzso zzso (including dramatic increase in peripheral B cells, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso disease in association with Lupus zzso but showed resistance to zzso zzso and zzso Such seemingly opposite functions of zzso in zzso and zzso signaling are orchestrated by different zzso in zzso Whereas zzso interacts with the zzso through the zzso zzso domain, zzso is recruited to zzso and zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso through the zzso binding site in zzso Such delicate regulatory mechanisms may provide a common vehicle to promote balance between host defense to pathogens and tolerance to zzso
