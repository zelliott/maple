zzso zzso gene zzso is activated in kidney cells in zzso and in zzso cells exposed to zzso or zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso is a nuclear factor that binds to the zzso zzso of the EPO gene at a site that is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is induced by zzso or zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso We report that treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso induced zzso activity and EPO zzso expression with zzso similar to the induction of zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso by each of these stimuli was inhibited by zzso indicating a requirement for de zzso protein zzso zzso appears to induce zzso by zzso iron as induction was inhibited by zzso of zzso ammonium zzso zzso administration to mice zzso increased EPO zzso levels in the zzso As previously shown for zzso and zzso treatment, zzso also induced zzso activity in zzso cells, suggesting the existence of a common zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso induction in different cell zzso
