A zzso zzso has been identified that significantly reduced the amount of an zzso zzso signal for a zzso fusion zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was located immediately upstream of an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso This zzso signal was also produced by zzso coli, and production was abolished in a strain containing a zzso zzso of zzso Products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were individually tested for the ability to activate zzso Only zzso was capable of zzso the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to activate the zzso fusion was abolished by zzso at pH zzso which converts zzso to zzso However, the activity of the native signal in zzso medium was not decreased by treatment at pH zzso In contrast, zzso medium prepared from cells grown at pH zzso exhibited a zzso to zzso activity, relative to pH zzso Additional genes regulated by the zzso signal and zzso were identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The response to the zzso signal in zzso coli was dependent on zzso a positive zzso that requires zzso as a zzso In zzso coli, a zzso zzso formed zzso at an accelerated rate compared to the wild type, suggesting a zzso role for this zzso zzso
