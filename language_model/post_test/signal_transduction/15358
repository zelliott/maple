zzso giant larvae zzso plays a critical role in establishment of cell polarity in zzso zzso While zzso signaling has been implicated in the regulation of the zzso and activity of zzso it remains unclear whether specific zzso zzso are zzso Here we show that zzso triggers the release of zzso from the cell zzso into the zzso with the zzso decrease in zzso zzso The observed changes in zzso zzso were independent of zzso zzso zzso which is known to influence zzso zzso In zzso cells, both zzso and zzso triggered zzso and molecular changes characteristic of zzso zzso whereas depletion of their functions prevented zzso and zzso bottle cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso partially rescued bottle cell formation in zzso injected with a dominant negative zzso zzso These results suggest a molecular link between zzso and zzso that is essential for zzso zzso during zzso zzso
