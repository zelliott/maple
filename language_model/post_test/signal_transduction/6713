zzso zzso possesses zzso potential, however, little is known about the effect of this drug in models of zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed zzso to compare the zzso capacities of some zzso zzso in the models of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell death, zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso to identify the zzso steps underlying its zzso zzso zzso to test the effect of various zzso against zzso cell damage in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell cultures and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and St or zzso The data showed the zzso zzso effect of zzso over other tested zzso against zzso and zzso cell damage in primary zzso and in zzso zzso This effect was shown to be zzso but connected with zzso of DNA zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso was blocked by pharmacological zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways as well by inhibitor of zzso zzso Interestingly, the protective effects of all tested zzso were demonstrated in primary zzso cells against the zzso cell zzso The obtained data suggests the zzso cells as a common target for protective action of various zzso whereas in relation to zzso cells only zzso possesses such properties, at least against zzso and zzso cell zzso Moreover, this zzso effect of zzso is zzso and engages the regulation of survival pathways zzso and zzso
