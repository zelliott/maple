The zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso plays an important role in inflammation and cancer, is activated by a variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso Although previous studies suggest that zzso can induce zzso the mechanism of this zzso remains zzso In this study, we identify the components of the zzso zzso in human zzso cells required to regulate zzso zzso zzso analyses with zzso cells indicate that association between zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso is the critical step in the formation of the zzso linking zzso to zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso activity and DNA binding activity in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of either one of the two zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso or zzso slightly reduced zzso activity relative to that of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of either a zzso zzso incapable of binding to zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant increase in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells displayed higher zzso zzso content, suggesting that zzso regulates zzso zzso through its zzso domain, which zzso a negative regulatory effect on zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso association is critical for linking zzso to zzso zzso activity via the zzso signaling axis in zzso cells and that zzso acts as a dual regulator of zzso zzso
