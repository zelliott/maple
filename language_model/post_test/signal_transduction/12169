The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are zzso in response to increased mechanical force or zzso rate in cultured zzso cells or isolated blood zzso All three zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso additionally zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Although these zzso might contribute to subsequent zzso of zzso during dynamic exercise, the specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are zzso We determined the impact of 50 zzso of treadmill running on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso - a target of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso Compared to arteries from sedentary mice, zzso zzso activity was greater in vessels from zzso animals and was associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso but not at zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso To confirm this, zzso was performed in the presence of vehicle zzso or zzso zzso Compared to results from sedentary mice, vascular zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso during zzso were prevented by zzso but not vehicle treatment, whereas zzso increases in zzso and zzso zzso were similar between zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso increased during exercise after zzso treatment relative to values obtained from sedentary animals, but the zzso was blunted by approximately 50% compared to results from zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso contribute zzso to vascular zzso zzso zzso during zzso and that zzso is sufficient to activate zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso
