The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso regulates the production of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso are effective in animal models of arthritis and are currently being developed in zzso arthritis zzso However, little is known about the upstream zzso that control the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In zzso studies previously identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the primary regulators of zzso zzso and zzso To investigate a potential role for zzso and zzso in zzso we evaluated their expression and regulation in zzso zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Digital image analysis showed no significant differences between zzso and zzso with regard to expression or zzso However, zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso zzso and was localized to the zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso tissue zzso confirmed the increased expression of zzso zzso in zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were low in zzso zzso but were rapidly increased by zzso and tumor necrosis zzso although zzso levels only modestly zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso These data are the first documentation of zzso and zzso zzso in human inflammatory zzso By forming a complex with zzso in zzso tissue and zzso these zzso can potentially be targeted to regulate the production of zzso zzso production in inflamed zzso
