The present study is designed to investigate the effect of zzso with zzso zzso on zzso cell death induced by zzso This study investigated whether zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso followed by 12 h recovery, can protect zzso cells against death induced by subsequent exposure to zzso for 72 zzso The result showed that zzso with zzso zzso partly blocked the decrease in zzso zzso zzso reduction induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso could generate a small quantity of zzso oxygen species zzso which activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, then the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso which subsequently protected zzso cell against death resulting from zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso could protect zzso cells against hypoxic zzso
