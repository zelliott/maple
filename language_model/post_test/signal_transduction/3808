Although zzso zzso are thought to arise from the zzso surface zzso layer, the possibility that they develop from zzso remnants within zzso zzso merits further zzso zzso genetic studies suggest that zzso zzso low zzso potential tumors, and zzso are not part of a disease zzso but do represent separate disease zzso Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular genetic changes associated with zzso zzso tumor development can be summarized in a working genetic model for zzso zzso which can provide a framework for further zzso Certain molecular changes, such as zzso expression and zzso in DNA zzso levels, are associated with both tumors of low zzso potential and zzso but not with zzso zzso in the zzso gene and the development of multiple losses of zzso are specific for the zzso zzso The nature of the specific zzso affected by the latter losses in a given tumor dictates its zzso zzso
