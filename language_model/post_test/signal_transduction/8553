zzso cell division is intensely studied because it can generate cellular diversity as well as maintain stem cell zzso zzso cell division requires zzso zzso alignment with intrinsic or zzso polarity cues, but zzso detail of this process is zzso Here, we develop a method to construct cortical polarity in a normally zzso cell line and use this method to characterize Partner of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We identify a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso that requires zzso zzso to recruit zzso large zzso zzso in zzso and promote partial zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain has no function alone, but placing the zzso in zzso to the zzso gives zzso precise zzso zzso This zzso cortical zzso zzso is suitable for rapid identification of the zzso zzso and zzso acids regulating zzso orientation or cell zzso
