zzso patterning of the neural tube has a crucial role in shaping the functional organization of the zzso It is well established that zzso zzso plays a key role in specifying zzso cell types throughout the zzso and major progress has been made in zzso how zzso zzso works in this zzso zzso In addition, other molecular zzso including zzso zzso acid and zzso growth factor zzso have been identified as important molecular cues for zzso patterning of the spinal cord, zzso and zzso Here, we discuss recent advances in this field, highlighting the emerging interplay of these zzso pathways in the molecular zzso of zzso patterning at different zzso levels of the zzso
