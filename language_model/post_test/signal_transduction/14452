The zzso of zzso events between zzso signaling pathways is one main challenge in biological zzso The complexity of protein networks, composed of different zzso requires novel strategies and techniques to reveal relevant zzso Here, we established a zzso zzso strategy for systematic single, zzso and triple zzso and we measured the residual zzso and proteins zzso by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso protein zzso respectively, as a prerequisite for data zzso Our results show that the parallel zzso of at least three different genes is feasible while keeping both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The technique was validated by investigating the interplay of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its downstream targets zzso and zzso in cell zzso This experimental approach combines multiple gene zzso with a subsequent quantitative validation of reduced protein expression and is a major advancement toward the analysis of signaling pathways in systems zzso
