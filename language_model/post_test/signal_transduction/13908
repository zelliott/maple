The zzso zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which plays a key role in zzso brain zzso Using zzso cultures and a rat model of zzso stroke, we show that zzso plays an initial role in zzso during the zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of active zzso during zzso precedes zzso brain damage and is associated with secondary zzso of zzso zzso Application of a zzso zzso zzso that is resistant to degradation and binds to zzso zzso protects cultured zzso from zzso injury and reduces zzso brain damage when injected up to 6 h after the zzso zzso genetic deletion of zzso in mice leads to sustained zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain injury and neurological deficits after zzso Administration of the zzso zzso at the onset of zzso not only prevents the sustained zzso zzso zzso but also reduces zzso brain damage in zzso zzso zzso The findings indicate a zzso role of zzso and suggest a potential role of the zzso zzso in stroke zzso
