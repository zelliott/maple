We have previously shown the zzso levels of zzso and zzso proteins zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso and not of zzso in the hearts and zzso of spontaneously and zzso induced zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso and blood pressure was restored toward zzso levels by zzso treatment, suggesting a role for zzso zzso II in the enhanced expression of zzso protein and blood zzso This study was undertaken to investigate whether 1 kidney 1 clip zzso zzso rats that exhibit enhanced levels of zzso II also express enhanced levels of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso rats were zzso The expression of zzso was determined at protein levels with zzso techniques, using specific zzso for different zzso of zzso The levels of zzso and zzso proteins were significantly higher in zzso from zzso zzso rats than in control zzso zzso levels were zzso The zzso effect of low zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly enhanced in zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso which specifically interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II on zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso activity in zzso from control and zzso rats to varying zzso however, the zzso were significantly lower in zzso rats than in control zzso These data suggest that zzso from zzso zzso rats exhibit enhanced expression of zzso proteins and associated zzso
