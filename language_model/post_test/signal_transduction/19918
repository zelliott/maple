zzso can regulate signal generation and transmission by zzso multiple receptors and signaling zzso especially in zzso zzso and cerebral zzso zzso zzso an even larger variety of cellular properties in zzso yet has been reported to do so by only D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases or zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we test the possibility that zzso operates differently on retinal zzso cells, because the zzso cell layer binds D1 and zzso zzso zzso and displays changes in signaling components other than zzso under zzso that should release zzso In adult rat retinal zzso cells, based on zzso recordings, zzso imaging, and zzso we find that 1) spike firing is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso (an zzso that does not activate zzso D1 receptors or alter zzso levels in other zzso 2) D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso counteract these zzso 3) these zzso also block zzso rises in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso and 4) the zzso rise is markedly reduced by removing zzso zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso activates a zzso in adult zzso retinal zzso that is distinct from classical D1 and zzso zzso and that zzso can activate mechanisms in addition to zzso and zzso protein zzso to zzso retinal zzso cell zzso
