In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso controls multiple zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso through modification of zzso zzso factors can be lethal or result in severe growth zzso In this work, the important role of zzso in zzso regulation during growth on the zzso carbon source zzso is further zzso The data show that the zzso of zzso suppresses the growth zzso of the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso results in enhanced proliferation and biomass yield when cells are grown on zzso as sole carbon source, and increases zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the suppression of zzso and the enhanced proliferation and biomass yield are only observed when zzso is zzso and not in strains containing the zzso active zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso results in a combination of general zzso of respiratory growth capacity and an increase in zzso zzso zzso which together, complement the zzso requirements of the zzso zzso The data therefore provide new evidence for the role of zzso as a powerful zzso of metabolism during growth on a zzso carbon zzso
