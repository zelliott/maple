The zzso zzso have a critical role in innate immunity through killing of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso zzso is stored in zzso zzso zzso zzso together with other zzso proteins and zzso zzso During passage in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso subjected to zzso zzso and retrieval from zzso zzso to become targeted to zzso zzso for final processing and zzso zzso zzso precursor was found not to be processed to mature zzso and not to be targeted for storage but instead zzso or zzso This indicated that the zzso of the zzso precursor was a prerequisite for the final processing and zzso targeting of zzso When the zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso with a normally zzso zzso the zzso retention of the zzso was prolonged compared with that of the native zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso precursor may also mediate the normally long zzso of zzso Both mature zzso and zzso zzso contained complex zzso side chains indicating that zzso and, thus, mature zzso has passed the zzso zzso stack where complex zzso are formed, and exited at zzso like other proteins targeted for zzso zzso
