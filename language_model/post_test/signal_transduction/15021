The zzso zzso is known to play a role in cell structure and serve as a scaffold for a variety of active molecules in processes as diverse as zzso and cell zzso The literature on the role of zzso in signal zzso however, is marked by zzso We have investigated a well-studied signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso and found a connection between the stability of zzso and the regulation of zzso signaling in zzso zzso When zzso are stabilized by zzso zzso there is a strong induction of zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso Although there was no additive effect of zzso and zzso on zzso activity suggesting a shared mechanism of zzso zzso strongly induced the zzso reporter in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso while zzso did zzso Both zzso and zzso induce the degradation of zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso induction of zzso activity was blocked by zzso of zzso acting at different sites in the signaling zzso Both zzso and zzso strongly induce known zzso zzso target zzso On the other hand, if zzso are zzso by zzso then the induction of zzso by zzso or zzso is greatly zzso Taken together, we zzso that the activity of zzso is at the level of the zzso zzso zzso This phenomenon may indicate a new level of signaling organization in cell biology, actively created by the state of the zzso and has ramifications for therapies where zzso regulating drugs are zzso
