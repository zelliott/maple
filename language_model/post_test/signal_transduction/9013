zzso are bone forming cells that are responsible for bone growth and zzso They are derived from bone zzso zzso stem cells through a series of processes including commitment, zzso expansion, terminal differentiation and cell zzso zzso and bone formation are regulated by hormones, growth factors, zzso mechanical loading and zzso zzso can sense these external cues, zzso the signals through various signaling pathways and regulate the expression of specific zzso to determine the cell zzso In this review, we aim to update our current understanding of the signaling pathways that control different steps of zzso zzso with special focus on how signaling events control cell fate through regulating gene zzso
