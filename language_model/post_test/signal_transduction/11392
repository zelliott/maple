zzso oxide zzso signaling zzso regulates metamorphosis in two solitary zzso and a zzso We present evidence for a similar role in the sea zzso zzso zzso NO commonly signals via soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso activity in some zzso cells, including zzso depends on the molecular zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso this may be so in zzso larvae as zzso zzso larvae containing juvenile rudiments were treated with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all instances, drug treatment significantly increased the frequency of zzso zzso a NO zzso suppressed the zzso properties of zzso and zzso a natural zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso activity in cells in the lower lip of the zzso mouth, the zzso hood, the gut, and in the tube feet of the zzso zzso zzso zzso coincided with zzso zzso zzso removal of the oral hood or the zzso hood did not induce zzso but larvae lacking these structures retained the capacity to zzso in response to zzso We propose that the production of NO zzso regulates the initiation of metamorphosis and that a sensory response to environmental cues reduces the production of zzso and consequently zzso to initiate zzso
