The currently available treatment of cancer patients is based on the use of zzso drugs and/or of zzso zzso which have potent zzso activity, but also cause clinically relevant side effects, since they affect cellular targets that are common to both cancer cells and normal zzso zzso In the past 20 years, the discoveries on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development and progression have prompted the search for agents which are more selective for cancer cell molecular zzso The possibility of combining conventional zzso drugs with novel agents that specifically interfere with key pathways controlling cancer cell survival, zzso invasion and/or zzso spreading has generated a wide zzso This could be a promising therapeutic approach for several zzso First, since the cellular targets for these agents and their zzso of action are different from those of zzso drugs, it is possible for their combination with chemotherapy without zzso Second, zzso in the expression and/or the activity of genes that regulate zzso signals not only can directly cause zzso of cell growth, but also may affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy and zzso In this review, we will discuss the zzso bases of the combination of molecular targeted drugs with conventional medical cancer treatments and the available results of the first series of clinical trials in cancer zzso
