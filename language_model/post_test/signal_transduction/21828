We previously demonstrated that insulin stimulates vascular zzso growth factor zzso synthesis and zzso via zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from humans and from zzso lean zzso zzso zzso We also showed that this effect is attenuated in zzso from zzso obese zzso zzso zzso As it is not known whether the effects of insulin on zzso involve zzso of zzso zzso zzso we aimed to zzso zzso whether insulin zzso zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso the insulin zzso pathways zzso and zzso the role of insulin zzso 

Using zzso zzso taken from humans and zzso rats and cultured in zzso the following were zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 zzso and zzso zzso 4, 6 zzso effects exerted by insulin on zzso content in both nucleus and zzso measured by Western zzso zzso insulin effects on zzso zzso activity on the zzso zzso measured by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso involvement of the insulin zzso molecules in these insulin actions, by using the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso N terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso target of zzso and by detecting the insulin zzso molecules by Western zzso 

In zzso zzso from humans and zzso zzso rats cultured in zzso insulin increases the zzso content in zzso and nucleus via zzso and zzso mechanisms, and zzso zzso activity on the zzso zzso The zzso increase of zzso is blunted by the translation inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso It is also reduced in zzso zzso rats, which present an impaired ability of insulin to induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These results provide a biological mechanism for the impaired collateral vessel formation in zzso
