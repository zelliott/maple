Plants are zzso organisms that have developed the capacity to detect slight variations of their zzso They are able to perceive these environmental signals and to zzso them by signaling pathways in order to trigger zzso zzso zzso signaling elements play a central role in these pathways in zzso A key element is zzso acid zzso which can be produced by two zzso In the first one, zzso are zzso by zzso D zzso to release zzso In the second one, PA is produced through the activity of zzso C zzso to produce zzso zzso which is then zzso by zzso zzso zzso The amount of PA in the cell is regulated by PA zzso which zzso PA to produce zzso zzso considered as a second zzso as zzso zzso play a dual role in cell signaling by regulating the amount of zzso zzso another essential second zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso and zzso and are considered as second zzso zzso In this review, we present recent data regarding the specific features of these zzso signaling pathways in plant compared with other zzso
