zzso is a critical early cellular event in the development of zzso kidney disease zzso in humans and zzso In the zzso transgenic model of zzso both zzso and proliferation are zzso driven and are independent of zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of recent evidence implicating the zzso zzso in zzso zzso we investigated the potential interaction of these pathways in zzso We first evaluated the expression of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso This analysis showed that the level of zzso expression was elevated zzso in the zzso zzso indicating a potential zzso suicidal zzso We next crossed the zzso mice with zzso mice zzso in zzso The zzso had comparable zzso zzso zzso and proliferation rates and a zzso zzso in all zzso zzso irrespective of the zzso zzso Our study proves that zzso zzso can be independent of the zzso zzso in zzso and implicates the existence of a novel zzso zzso zzso
