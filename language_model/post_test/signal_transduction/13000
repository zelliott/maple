Surface expression of B cell zzso receptors zzso containing zzso and zzso generates signals required to transit discrete zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso components collaborate to initiate signals is still zzso The expression of zzso in zzso mice is zzso lower than in other zzso Here, we demonstrate by gene targeting that a point zzso which changes a zzso to a zzso in the zzso constant region, is responsible for this zzso In zzso experiments show that zzso receptors bearing this zzso while expressed zzso are deficient in zzso These findings reveal a direct involvement of the zzso light chain zzso in B cell signaling and development beyond the requirement of light chains for zzso zzso
