zzso zzso the proliferation of lung zzso in zzso and in zzso However, the zzso interactions between zzso and expression of tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain zzso 

zzso human lung zzso zzso were cultured in a hypoxic chamber or exposed to zzso zzso DNA synthesis was measured using zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso was measured using real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso 

DNA synthesis was increased by moderate zzso zzso zzso but was decreased by severe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso synthesis without affecting zzso zzso whereas severe zzso and zzso increased synthesis of both zzso and zzso zzso protein expression was decreased by severe zzso and zzso Gene zzso of zzso and zzso promoted DNA synthesis at ambient oxygen zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso lessened the decrease in DNA synthesis due to severe zzso or zzso zzso zzso gene zzso prevented increased DNA synthesis in moderate zzso zzso protein expression was significantly increased by zzso gene zzso and was decreased by zzso zzso gene zzso 

These results indicate that in zzso severe zzso leads to cell cycle arrest via the zzso pathway, but that moderate zzso enhances cell proliferation via the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, our results suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso for zzso in cultured zzso zzso
