The zzso protein is a zzso zzso involved in the induction of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of the protein exhibits four zzso segments zzso that form a zzso bundle embedded in the plasma zzso The zzso domain of 250 zzso acids zzso fused at the zzso end of zzso possesses the zzso acid sequence signature of zzso zzso This membrane zzso suggests that zzso and the zzso domain are responsible for signal reception and signal zzso zzso With the use of zzso display experiments, we highlight zzso an interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso loop connecting zzso and zzso This interaction does not occur in the presence of zzso This result suggests that binding of the zzso to zzso might entail the release of the interaction between zzso and zzso causing a motion of the zzso bundle and transfer of the information to the zzso of the zzso In addition, zzso zzso CD, and zzso transform zzso zzso experiments indicate that in contrast to the behavior of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not induce a drastic zzso change in zzso zzso zzso
