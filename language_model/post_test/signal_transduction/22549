Until recently, studies to characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso had to be done in zzso zzso zzso In these cells, detection of any zzso exchange activity requires prior acid zzso Furthermore, most of these experiments used zzso pH changes to measure zzso zzso Because changes in zzso only approximate zzso exchange activity, and may be zzso by zzso in zzso capacity and/or zzso contributions to pH regulation, we have used zzso zzso zzso to cell zzso to measure activities specific to zzso or zzso Furthermore, we performed these zzso under zzso zzso conditions to avoid bias from this zzso experimental zzso Both brush border zzso when expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the C2 zzso domain and are regulated by second zzso in the same way they are regulated in zzso zzso in zzso calcium and zzso inhibit both zzso while zzso zzso affects only zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso involves changes to both zzso and zzso In contrast, the same two second zzso inhibit zzso by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C alters both zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting a zzso regulatory zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso in zzso cells, are zzso active and are zzso regulated by signal zzso zzso
