The zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways interact at multiple zzso in cancer, including at zzso complexes, suggesting an increased likelihood of zzso and innate resistance to any therapeutic effects of single zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of combining the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with the dual zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso dosing in nude mouse zzso models of human lung zzso zzso cell lung zzso and zzso zzso was well tolerated and produced increased zzso efficacy relative to the respective zzso zzso analysis documented zzso zzso zzso associated with increased zzso and zzso expression in tumor tissue from the combination group, where key genes such as zzso that are under zzso functional control were also zzso Our work offers a strong rationale to combine zzso and zzso in clinical trials as an attractive therapeutic zzso
