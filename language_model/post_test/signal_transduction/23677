zzso act as scaffolding proteins for several G zzso zzso signaling molecules to regulate their zzso zzso the zzso zzso in smooth muscle, drives the formation of zzso The precise role of zzso and zzso as scaffolds for G zzso zzso signaling and contraction in gastrointestinal muscle is zzso Thus the aim of this study was to examine the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso studies demonstrated the selective expression of zzso and zzso receptors in gastric smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso activity, induced zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso (at zzso and zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso (at zzso and muscle contraction, and inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso and zzso and muscle contraction in response to zzso were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso small interfering zzso zzso Similar zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity and muscle contraction in response to zzso and gastric zzso in zzso was obtained in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso receptors was blocked by zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in response to other zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and substance P was also attenuated by zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso signaling by zzso receptors and contributes to enhanced smooth muscle zzso
