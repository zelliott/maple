We generated influenza A viruses expressing zzso zzso proteins unable to activate zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus strain was attenuated and caused reduced zzso For the zzso zzso zzso virus strain, the inability to stimulate zzso had minimal impact on replication or zzso zzso zzso revealed subtly distinct zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso We zzso that specific zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso rather than simply the total level of active zzso is important for virus replication and zzso
