We reported recently that zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso arrested human zzso breast cancer cells in zzso phase of the cell cycle and zzso induced zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso arrest observed by another group has not been accompanied by zzso zzso we decided to prove to which extent components of tissue culture media could affect the primary action of zzso For this purpose we compared the efficacy of the zzso treatment on zzso cells cultivated in medium with and without zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cell proliferation strongly depended on the presence of zzso red that has been recognized previously as a weak zzso Exposure of zzso cells cultivated in zzso zzso medium to zzso resulted in a strong zzso arrest and zzso However, the zzso and zzso action of zzso was strongly diminished in cells maintained in medium containing zzso zzso The ratio of the zzso cell population after 12 h zzso was reduced by approximately zzso in the latter and correlated with the lack of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso was delayed in the presence of zzso zzso These results clearly evidence that the efficacy of the therapy of zzso breast zzso by zzso zzso is diminished in the presence of zzso compounds and indicate that zzso and zzso could interfere with the zzso zzso the exposure of cancer patients to the zzso mimics should be avoided at least during chemotherapy by zzso zzso
