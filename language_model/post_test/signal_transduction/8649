Evidence provided by both clinical and zzso studies regarding a central involvement of the zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso in vascular disease continues to zzso zzso is zzso as a consequence of zzso of the ubiquitous zzso zzso factor zzso which is activated in response to diverse inflammatory stimuli including zzso zzso low density zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso may maintain and amplify inflammatory responses in the zzso if zzso for the zzso is zzso zzso binding by circulating advanced zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein released by activated zzso results in the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and further zzso of zzso This leads to zzso of zzso molecules for circulating zzso as well as further zzso of zzso zzso In addition, these zzso may zzso and reduce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso reducing its zzso effects and possibly compromising control of vascular tone zzso In addition to zzso and vascular diseases associated with diabetes, recent data from studies in transgenic mice zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggest a role for zzso in the zzso of pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso zzso antagonism also prevents proliferation and migration of pulmonary zzso smooth muscle cells in response to zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may be of key importance in pulmonary vascular zzso and/or zzso Further study of the role of zzso in inflammation seems likely to yield, not only promising zzso but key insights into the zzso of vascular disease as zzso
