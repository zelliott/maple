Type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in the zzso of several zzso Although it promotes the growth of zzso zzso cells, a direct role of zzso in zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a unique type of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cases harbor the zzso zzso which generates the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we explored a possible role of zzso in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are widely expressed in zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso we identified novel zzso functional interactions between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso decreased the zzso induced zzso and zzso arrest, and decreased proliferation and colony formation of zzso zzso cell zzso These effects could be explained by zzso of cell survival regulatory proteins downstream of zzso zzso Our findings improve current understanding of the biology of zzso and zzso and have significant therapeutic implications as they identify zzso signaling as a potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso and possibly other types of zzso zzso
