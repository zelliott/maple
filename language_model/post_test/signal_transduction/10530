The zzso of the zzso zzso cartilage zzso zzso and ultimately undergo zzso zzso cell zzso being replaced by zzso zzso results consolidate zzso zzso zzso zzso factor as the pivotal downstream zzso in the early response of zzso cells to mechanical zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso factor family, as zzso in bone zzso and zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso response of functionally loaded zzso zzso cartilage, and the subsequent initiation of cartilage maturation and zzso zzso zzso female, zzso zzso rats were assigned to two groups: one group was fed a soft diet and the other a hard zzso At day 21 after zzso experimental animals from both groups were killed at 6, 12 and 48 hours and their zzso zzso The zzso cartilage of both groups was zzso using specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the data revealed zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in all stages of differentiation of zzso derived from the zzso zzso cartilage of animals fed on a hard zzso Moreover, the involvement of these proteins significantly increased with time in both zzso Since the aforementioned proteins play key roles in zzso phenomena of bone and cartilage zzso influencing pivotal cellular functions such as zzso differentiation and zzso the results of the present study suggest that zzso zzso zzso sense functional loading changes and respond by induction of proteins associated with biological phenomena that ultimately influence the growth of the zzso zzso
