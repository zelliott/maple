zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is a member of the zzso group of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 is a potent zzso of zzso and the use of zzso zzso or zzso gene deletion each protect against brain injury in zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso or its mechanism of action in zzso brain zzso The aim of the present study was to compare the vulnerability of zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso mice to cerebral zzso injury zzso using zzso zzso combined with transient zzso The degree of neural tissue loss in zzso zzso mice was substantially reduced compared with zzso mice zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of injury was observed in the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso injury increased zzso zzso and activity, with zzso as the major zzso zzso in zzso zzso animals there was no difference in the zzso of the upstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso lead to increased zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which was attenuated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 deletion also decrease zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled with a zzso of zzso levels, linking zzso to zzso These findings zzso zzso involvement in neural cell loss resulting from cerebral zzso in the developing zzso
