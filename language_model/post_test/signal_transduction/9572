Adult zzso cells are required for zzso cardiac zzso After zzso injury, they are zzso undergo zzso transformation zzso and migrate into the injured zzso where they generate various cell types, including coronary smooth muscle cells and cardiac zzso zzso which contribute to cardiac zzso To understand what drives zzso zzso we used an in zzso model for human adult zzso zzso These cells have an zzso zzso and markedly express the cell surface marker vascular cell zzso marker zzso In culture, zzso cells spontaneously undergo zzso after which the zzso cells now express zzso Both zzso cells before and after zzso express the zzso marker, zzso tumor 1 zzso Adding transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso loss of zzso character and zzso the onset of zzso differentiation in human adult zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso activity and can be inhibited by soluble zzso We also show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the process of zzso in human adult zzso cells, through zzso regulation of zzso growth factor zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso These data provide new insights into the process of zzso in human adult zzso cells, which might provide opportunities to develop new strategies for zzso zzso cardiac zzso
