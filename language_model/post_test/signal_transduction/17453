zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetically zzso zzso Thus far, the disease gene has been identified as the zzso domain containing 7 zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the clinical and genetic characteristics of a zzso generation Chinese family with zzso 

The clinical data and the zzso DNA of a Chinese zzso family were collected following the provision of informed zzso All coding zzso of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso and then zzso zzso zzso activated zzso 2 zzso zzso was used to investigate whether this novel zzso zzso influenced zzso signaling zzso in the human embryonic kidney zzso T cells zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified in all affected zzso zzso female carriers were zzso in these zzso and the affected males were zzso consistent with zzso zzso This zzso is a substitution of zzso for zzso zzso analysis showed that this novel zzso influences zzso signaling in human zzso zzso zzso 

This study widens the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso This zzso was shown to activate zzso zzso signaling in zzso however, the quantity of activated zzso was obviously decreased compared with the wild type zzso Taken together, our data strongly support the hypothesis that the identified zzso zzso influences zzso zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso This zzso may be related to the zzso of zzso zzso
