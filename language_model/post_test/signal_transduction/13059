zzso zzso proteins control the zzso zzso that precedes nuclear access of the zzso zzso zzso Here we observe that a partial zzso of the zzso promoter can be detected in zzso zzso double zzso cells using zzso Delta E zzso or following Delta 1 zzso despite an apparent abolition of the production and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso signaling is also inhibited by an active zzso inhibitor in the low zzso range and is not inhibited by an inactive zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso However, experiments using a zzso fusion protein indicate that the zzso activity does not release zzso and is therefore unlikely to proceed via an zzso zzso These data reveal that a novel zzso mechanism plays a partial role in zzso signal zzso
