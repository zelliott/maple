zzso of motor zzso is a well-documented feature in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso and related motor zzso diseases zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso of these diseases remains zzso One possibility is that the affected motor zzso only succumb to zzso once they have exhausted functional zzso If true, blocking zzso should zzso no therapeutic zzso To directly investigate this idea, we tested whether zzso deletion in the mouse zzso of zzso X protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso family proteins that together represent an essential gateway to the zzso zzso pathway, would protect against motor zzso zzso We found that zzso deletion of zzso and zzso in a mouse model of familial ALS not only halted zzso loss, but prevented zzso zzso symptom zzso weight loss, and paralysis and extended zzso These results show that motor zzso damaged in ALS activate the zzso zzso zzso early in the disease process and that zzso signaling directly contributes to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso represents a possible therapeutic strategy for preserving functional motor zzso in ALS and other zzso
