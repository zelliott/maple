In the present study, effect of zzso zzso 25 and zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso oxide zzso was evaluated for its anti-anxiety activity in stressed mice employing elevated plus zzso open field test, zzso test and social interaction zzso zzso stress induced by zzso for zzso enhanced an zzso behavior and increased plasma zzso levels in zzso Only the highest dose zzso employed of zzso attenuated the zzso zzso behavior and decreased plasma zzso zzso There was no significant zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to explore the probable mechanism of anti-anxiety activity of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso per zzso and in combination did not affect the locomotor activity of stressed and zzso mice as compared to their respective control zzso Thus, zzso produced anti-anxiety activity in stressed mice through zzso zzso
