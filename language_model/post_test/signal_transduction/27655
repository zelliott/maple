DNA molecules containing zzso zzso in particular base contexts zzso zzso are excellent zzso in zzso but their effects on human cells have been less zzso zzso cells zzso form the link between the innate and the acquired immune system and may influence the balance between T helper 1 zzso and zzso immune zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso factor zzso on different classes of zzso human zzso For primary zzso precursor cells isolated from human blood, zzso zzso alone were superior to zzso in promoting survival and maturation zzso zzso as well as expression of class II zzso and the zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso peripheral blood zzso precursor cells responded to zzso DNA which zzso with zzso but these zzso showed little response to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not respond to zzso but they were highly sensitive to zzso suggesting an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso sensitivity in different zzso of zzso Compared with zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso showed enhanced functional activity in the mixed zzso reaction and induced T cells to zzso increased levels of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the ability of specific zzso motifs to strongly activate certain zzso of human zzso to promote zzso immune responses, and support the use of zzso zzso trials for zzso against cancer, allergy, and infectious zzso
