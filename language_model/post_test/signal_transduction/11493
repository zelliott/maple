Because some proteins can facilitate cell division or the expression of many genes zzso it comes as no surprise that the expression of very important gene products is a tightly controlled zzso Although gene expression is often thought of in terms of complexes of zzso factors binding to promoter zzso some studies indicate that zzso DNA sequences may also regulate gene zzso zzso examines recent work by zzso and colleagues demonstrating that sequences within the first zzso of the zzso gene help to regulate zzso expression under different zzso
