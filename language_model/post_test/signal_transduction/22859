zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso family, regulates gene expression in response to various zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso of the dual specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso family, through zzso on zzso zzso 183 and zzso zzso 185 zzso The zzso functions of the zzso pathway, however, are not completely zzso A major obstacle is the lack of specific and activated zzso components that can stimulate the zzso zzso in the absence of any zzso Here we show that fusion of zzso to its upstream zzso zzso resulted in its zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso fusion protein showed significant zzso activity, which was comparable with that of zzso activated by many stimuli and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was zzso by zzso in the fusion protein on both zzso and zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso fusion protein was highly specific for the zzso zzso and did not activate either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso fusion protein was sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso activity in the absence of any zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso fusion protein was predominantly located in the nucleus of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso fusion protein is a zzso active zzso zzso which will facilitate the investigation of the zzso roles of the zzso zzso
