zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso factor that zzso seed zzso by regulating the expression of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso genes either directly or zzso It is not yet known, however, whether zzso regulates seed zzso solely through zzso and zzso Here, we used zzso zzso zzso analysis to identify zzso novel zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the molecular function of zzso as a zzso regulator, most of the identified binding sites are located in gene promoter zzso zzso site analysis shows that zzso binds to its target sites mainly through the zzso motif in zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso regulate a large number of genes mainly through zzso during seed zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso data indicates that zzso regulates 166 genes by directly binding to their zzso Many of the identified genes zzso zzso regulators involved in hormone zzso while some zzso zzso involved in cell wall zzso Interestingly, zzso directly regulates many zzso regulators of hormone signaling and indirectly regulates many genes involved in hormone zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso zzso seed zzso not just through zzso and zzso but also by zzso hormone signals and modulating cell wall properties in zzso zzso
