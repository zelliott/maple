Muscle zzso cells migrate from the lateral zzso into the developing zzso zzso where they undergo patterning and differentiation in response to local zzso Sonic zzso zzso is a zzso zzso made in the zzso limb bud that affects patterning and development of multiple zzso including skeletal zzso However, the zzso and zzso functions of zzso during limb muscle formation have remained zzso We found that zzso affects the pattern of limb zzso zzso acting through adjacent zzso zzso However, zzso plays a zzso role in maintaining cell survival in the zzso and initiating early zzso of the zzso program in the zzso zzso At later zzso zzso promotes slow muscle differentiation zzso In addition, zzso signaling is required zzso to regulate directional muscle cell migration in the zzso zzso We identify zzso cell transforming gene 1 zzso as a downstream target and zzso of zzso signaling in that zzso
