The protein zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso which is zzso in patients with multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso Although zzso acts as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso it is required for zzso transformation in mouse zzso zzso possesses these zzso functions probably because it can both positively and zzso regulate gene zzso as well as interact with a multitude of proteins with diverse zzso Here, we review the recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso with different binding partners reveal that zzso is a key scaffold protein that functionally zzso with various partners to regulate gene zzso and interplay with multiple signaling zzso
