Acute intermittent zzso zzso elicits a form of spinal respiratory plasticity known as zzso long-term zzso zzso zzso requires spinal zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of new zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso 2A zzso zzso elicits a distinct zzso to zzso motor zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso instead requires new synthesis of an immature zzso zzso Since zzso increases zzso zzso levels, we tested the hypothesis that new synthesis of zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso Furthermore, given that signaling mechanisms zzso from zzso are unknown in either zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso requires zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso rats, an zzso zzso at cervical level 4 was used to deliver drugs near the zzso motor zzso Since zzso was blocked by spinal injections of small interfering zzso targeting zzso zzso but not zzso zzso only new zzso synthesis is required for zzso zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso whereas a zzso inhibitor zzso had no zzso Thus, zzso zzso requires zzso (not zzso signaling zzso When zzso was injected zzso zzso development was halted but not zzso suggesting that zzso is critical for the development but not maintenance of zzso Thus, there are clear zzso distinctions between zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso versus zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso
