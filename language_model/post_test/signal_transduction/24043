To investigate the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso via three signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso cells from normal zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso 

Laboratory for Research in zzso Sciences, Department of zzso and zzso zzso Hospital, zzso zzso 

Ten normal zzso and 10 women with zzso zzso disease zzso treated in an assisted reproduction zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso acting via protein zzso C zzso to zzso growth factor zzso acting via protein zzso zzso zzso and to zzso acting via protein zzso A zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso and zzso zzso in both groups and apparently did not affect zzso zzso zzso growth factor did not change significantly neither zzso nor zzso zzso but dose zzso decreased zzso ratio and increased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and increased zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso zzso production was zzso related to the ratio of zzso regardless of cell zzso 

In this preliminary study, similar and divergent patterns have emerged in the regulation of zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio may have an important zzso effect on zzso zzso
