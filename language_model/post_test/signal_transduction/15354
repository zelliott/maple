zzso zzso is a very potent zzso agent, but its use is limited by its zzso irreversible zzso Despite intensive research efforts, the mechanism of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso so very limited means are available for its prevention or effective zzso Recent studies have revealed that a therapeutic dose of zzso can activate zzso in zzso that is zzso by the zzso system zzso and that the zzso degradation of a number of pivotal cardiac zzso factors and/or survival factors is enhanced by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso UPS zzso may represent a new mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso recent experimental studies suggest that zzso zzso promotes cardiac zzso during zzso This review surveys the current literature on the impact of zzso on the UPS and the potential mechanisms by which UPS zzso may compromise the heart during zzso zzso
