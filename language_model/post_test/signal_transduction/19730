The large yellow zzso zzso zzso is an economically important marine fish in China suffering from severe outbreaks of infectious disease caused by marine bacteria such as zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in great economic zzso However, the mechanisms involved in the immune response of this fish to bacterial infection are not fully zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to such zzso bacteria, we used zzso deep sequencing technology to investigate the zzso and comparative expression profiles of the large yellow zzso infected with zzso zzso 

A total of zzso reads were obtained and assembled into zzso scaffolds in zzso responses of the zzso zzso large yellow zzso Via zzso to the zzso database, we obtained zzso identified zzso In total, zzso zzso zzso were classified into Gene zzso and zzso zzso were found in 20 zzso zzso These genes included representatives from almost all functional zzso By using zzso zzso 1996 zzso expressed genes zzso value zzso zzso were detected in comparative analysis of the expression profiles between zzso zzso fish and control fish, including zzso remarkably zzso genes and 489 remarkably zzso zzso zzso differences were observed in genes involved in the inflammatory zzso zzso infection affected the gene expression of many components of signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes zzso factors involved in T cell zzso zzso signaling were also revealed to be regulated by infection in these zzso 

Based on our results, we conclude that the inflammatory response may play an important role in the early stages of zzso The signaling zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways are regulated by zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, genes zzso factors involved in zzso signaling were revealed to be zzso by infection, indicating that zzso signaling was suppressed at this early zzso These results revealed changes of multiple signaling pathways involved in immunity during zzso zzso infection, which will facilitate our comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response to bacterial infection in the large yellow zzso
