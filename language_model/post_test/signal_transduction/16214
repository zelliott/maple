zzso zzso contributes to the progression of heart failure by affecting zzso cellular function and zzso In our investigation of the zzso regulation of cardiac gene zzso we found several zzso pathways involved in pathological cardiac zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso regulates expression of multiple fetal cardiac genes through the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the heart results in cardiac dysfunction and sudden zzso death accompanied by zzso of a number of fetal zzso including those zzso fetal zzso channels, such as the zzso zzso zzso In the pathological zzso factor of activated zzso zzso signaling pathway, transient zzso potential zzso channel, zzso C, member 6 zzso is a key component of a zzso regulatory zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso significantly ameliorates this pathological process in a mouse model of cardiac zzso Moreover, we recently showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of serum response factor zzso mediates zzso signaling by linking the small zzso zzso dynamics signaling zzso to cardiac gene zzso zzso our studies have revealed the zzso network involved in the development of cardiac dysfunction and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of heart zzso
