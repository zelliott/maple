Recent studies have shown that beta zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in the zzso zzso zzso transient and contraction in cardiac zzso are zzso from the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso level and are not accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso an acceleration in relaxation, or a reduction in zzso zzso zzso Thus we hypothesized that the beta zzso zzso of cardiac zzso zzso zzso may be zzso by either a zzso mechanism or a zzso zzso zzso To directly distinguish between these two possibilities, the responses of the zzso zzso current zzso Cai zzso and contraction to beta zzso as well as to beta zzso stimulation were examined in rat zzso zzso in the presence or absence of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As expected, the positive zzso effect induced by an zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso or a beta zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso was completely blocked by zzso More importantly, the responses of zzso Cai zzso and contraction to beta zzso stimulation by zzso zzso zzso or zzso plus a selective beta zzso zzso zzso were also entirely abolished by zzso (in the zzso zzso or zzso (in the bath zzso In zzso zzso cells, although the response of zzso was not altered, the beta zzso increase in contraction zzso was markedly enhanced and accompanied by a hastened relaxation, resulting in a tight association between zzso and zzso These results indicate that beta zzso zzso of cardiac zzso zzso requires zzso The zzso of beta zzso zzso production and regulation of zzso and zzso zzso functions is attributable to a functional zzso of the zzso signaling due to an zzso of beta zzso zzso and/or zzso
