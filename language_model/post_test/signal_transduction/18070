We investigated the effect of oxygen on the expressions of respiratory genes zzso in the nuclear and zzso zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased the transcript levels of zzso but not zzso respiratory zzso The effects of zzso red (an inhibitor of zzso zzso from zzso and/or zzso on plants under hypoxic conditions suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso of a zzso signaling zzso for expression of the alternative zzso zzso gene zzso but not for expressions of genes involved in the zzso respiratory pathway, in zzso
