zzso stimulation of pancreatic zzso increases the cellular reduced zzso zzso content, but the specific role of zzso zzso state in zzso insulin release zzso remains zzso The role of zzso zzso state has been assessed (as reflected by the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso insulin release using a recently established zzso zzso zzso line zzso zzso exposure to the zzso precursor vitamin zzso acid zzso 100 zzso was used to promote a more oxidized state in the zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked a zzso rise in the zzso zzso ratio which was zzso related to the extent of zzso zzso suppressed the zzso rise in the zzso ratio and zzso reduced zzso by zzso It also zzso by zzso the average zzso rise in zzso free zzso concentration zzso assessed by zzso zzso from single zzso The latter effect was not accounted for by a reduction in the activity of zzso zzso channels, zzso as both high zzso and zzso zzso rises remained insensitive to zzso zzso zzso did not affect insulin release evoked by any of the zzso agents, indicating that steps in the zzso zzso cascade zzso to zzso influx are insensitive to changes in the zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is partially controlled by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the impairment in zzso caused by a shift toward a more oxidized state in the zzso originates from an attenuated zzso zzso The latter is likely zzso by the influence of zzso zzso state on specific zzso pathways zzso shuttle systems and/or the zzso zzso leading ultimately to enhancement of the activity of zzso zzso zzso
