Costello syndrome is a pediatric genetic disorder linked to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The disease is characterized by multiple zzso zzso as well as predisposition to zzso Our recent observation that heart tissue from patients with Costello syndrome showed a loss of the zzso zzso zzso inspired our present study aimed to explore a functional involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as an impaired zzso zzso balance, as a downstream zzso of zzso zzso in Costello zzso Here we demonstrate a loss of zzso as well as a reduction in zzso zzso and protein zzso in primary zzso from Costello syndrome zzso We go on to show that expression of zzso zzso in normal zzso can repress zzso zzso whereas interference with zzso zzso signaling in Costello syndrome zzso elevated zzso zzso thus identifying zzso as a zzso regulated target gene of zzso zzso zzso we show that forced expression of zzso in Costello zzso could rescue the proliferation and zzso defects associated with zzso zzso signaling in these zzso Our results indicate reduced zzso expression and zzso zzso imbalance zzso the effects of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso of Costello zzso Thus, our work identifies zzso zzso zzso as a downstream vulnerability in zzso zzso zzso which might be zzso exploited in future treatments of not only Costello syndrome and other zzso but also human zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso
