zzso zzso treatment of zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso transient zzso zzso breakdown, production of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and rapid decrease of zzso surface zzso A comparison between the actions of zzso and other agents that affect these signal zzso pathways demonstrated a distinct mechanism for zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso both zzso C activity and protein zzso but had no effect on either cellular zzso levels or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and caused a significant decrease in surface display of zzso Both of these processes were blocked by zzso cells with the protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso These results demonstrate that zzso stimulates zzso turnover and zzso a rapid decrease of zzso surface expression by processes that do not activate zzso zzso or zzso zzso They further demonstrate that the mechanism for zzso decrease of zzso is distinct from the zzso zzso processes zzso by zzso zzso
