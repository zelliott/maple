Many insects exhibit excellent capability of visual learning, but the molecular and neural mechanisms are poorly zzso This is in contrast to zzso of information on molecular and neural mechanisms of zzso learning in zzso In zzso learning in insects, it has been shown that zzso zzso zzso signaling critically zzso in the formation of protein zzso long-term memory zzso and, in some insects, zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso signaling also plays roles in zzso zzso In this study, we examined the possible contribution of zzso signaling and zzso signaling to zzso formation in visual pattern learning in zzso zzso that had been subjected to zzso conditioning to associate a visual pattern with water reward exhibited memory retention 1 day after zzso whereas those subjected to zzso conditioning exhibited zzso memory retention but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso a protein synthesis zzso into the zzso prior to zzso conditioning blocked formation of zzso memory, whereas it had no effect on zzso memory formation, indicating that zzso memory can be characterized as protein zzso long-term memory zzso zzso of an inhibitor of the zzso producing an NO or zzso prior to zzso visual conditioning blocked zzso formation, whereas it had no effect on zzso memory zzso Moreover, injection of an NO zzso zzso analogue or zzso analogue prior to zzso conditioning induced zzso zzso of zzso by an NO donor was blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso producing zzso but zzso induction by a zzso analogue was not impaired by zzso an inhibitor of NO zzso The results indicate that zzso signaling is downstream of NO signaling for visual zzso zzso We conclude that visual learning and zzso learning share common zzso zzso for zzso zzso
