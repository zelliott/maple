Certain forms of coronary artery disease do not respond to treatment with zzso channel blockers, and a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso forms of coronary zzso has been zzso however, the signaling mechanisms involved are zzso We tested the hypothesis that a component of zzso coronary smooth muscle contraction is zzso zzso and involves zzso of protein zzso C zzso Cell contraction was measured in smooth muscle cells isolated from zzso coronary artery, zzso was measured in zzso loaded cells, and the zzso and particulate zzso were examined for zzso activity and zzso with zzso zzso zzso using Western zzso zzso In zzso solution (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a transient increase in zzso zzso zzso followed by a maintained increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso abolished the maintained zzso zzso but only partially inhibited zzso cell contraction to zzso The zzso component of zzso contraction was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso C and zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso to the particulate fraction that was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso but not that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a direct zzso of zzso caused zzso cell contraction, with no increase in zzso and zzso of zzso that was inhibited by zzso C, but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso which stimulates zzso influx, caused zzso cell contraction and increase in zzso zzso zzso that were inhibited by zzso but not by zzso C, and did not cause zzso of zzso or zzso In zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso solution, zzso caused zzso cell contraction, with no increase in zzso and zzso of zzso that were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, a significant component of zzso contraction of coronary smooth muscle is zzso zzso and involves zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and may represent a signaling mechanism of zzso zzso forms of coronary zzso
