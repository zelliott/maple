zzso of human B cell development is maintained by a complex network of zzso and surface expressed zzso zzso in this process may result in the expansion of zzso B cell precursors in B lineage acute zzso zzso zzso ALL cells share surface zzso with normal early precursor B zzso We have studied here the role of zzso zzso zzso on zzso precursor B cell line growth and survival, and the zzso of its effects by signals involved in normal early B cell zzso Four ALL cell lines representative of the early steps of B cell differentiation are shown to express surface zzso zzso zzso and to undergo zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso This effect is strongly enhanced when zzso but not zzso cells, are zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso cell death induced by zzso zzso in combination with zzso is increased upon zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression is not influenced by zzso or zzso stimulation in either zzso or zzso cell zzso These results indicate that signals involved in normal early B cell development can zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso precursor B zzso
