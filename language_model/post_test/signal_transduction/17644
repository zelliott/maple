zzso zzso of the European zzso zzso zzso have been used as experimental model to characterize the effects of zzso and zzso on either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly reduced zzso output from cells zzso in zzso zzso columns and challenged with zzso with a maximum zzso of zzso reached at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso output was also reduced by zzso although a significant zzso of about zzso was achieved only at 10 zzso zzso 5 zzso The possible influence of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated, since this system is known to play a pivotal role in the regulation of fish liver zzso breakdown and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both heavy metals significantly reduced the zzso zzso levels in isolated zzso zzso in good agreement with the reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in liver membrane zzso A competitive zzso with respect to zzso was shown by zzso and zzso which significantly reduced the affinity of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso was zzso zzso in zzso conditions, and increased to zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso may impair a crucial zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso control of zzso zzso but also in several other routes of hormonal regulation of liver zzso
