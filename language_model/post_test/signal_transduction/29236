Exposure to ethanol during development zzso severe brain damage, resulting in a number of zzso zzso including zzso and mental zzso Potential targets of zzso zzso include zzso factors and their signal zzso zzso In the present study, rat zzso were given ethanol at the dose of 5 g zzso via zzso from zzso day zzso 5 to 8, and zzso expression of nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso was zzso with attention to signal zzso on zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso was decreased by ethanol while those of zzso or zzso were not zzso Brain weights were decreased and the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased while zzso and zzso remained zzso These results suggest that zzso and its related signal pathways involving zzso zzso and zzso are potential targets of zzso zzso zzso
