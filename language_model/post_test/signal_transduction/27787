The plant hormone zzso is central in the regulation of growth and development, however, the molecular basis for its action has remained zzso In the absence of a molecular model, the wide range of responses zzso by zzso have been difficult to zzso Recent advances using molecular genetic approaches in zzso have led to the isolation of a number of key genes involved in zzso zzso Of particular importance are genes involved in zzso polar zzso transport through the zzso In addition a model for zzso signal zzso zzso on regulated protein degradation, has been zzso
