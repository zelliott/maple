zzso cell surface receptors are zzso suited to coordinate cellular differentiation and tissue assembly during zzso as they can mediate both signaling and zzso We show that zzso regulate gene expression in the intact developing zzso by identifying two genes that require zzso function for their normal expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined the relative roles of zzso zzso versus signaling in the regulation of these zzso target zzso We find that zzso zzso is not required between the zzso cells and the surrounding visceral zzso for zzso target gene zzso In addition, a zzso protein that lacks zzso function, but maintains the ability to zzso can substitute for the zzso zzso and regulate zzso target zzso This zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a control zzso zzso domain fusion does not alter zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain is sufficient to initiate a signaling zzso that regulates gene expression in the developing zzso
