zzso membrane proteins are a class of proteins that are targeted zzso to various zzso and integrated by a single segment of zzso zzso acids located near the C zzso Although the zzso of zzso proteins in specific zzso compartments in plant cells is essential for their biological function, the molecular targeting signals responsible for sorting these proteins are not well zzso Here, we describe the zzso of four closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are small zzso proteins that play an essential role in many cellular zzso including zzso zzso Using a combination of in zzso and in zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso and -C are targeted exclusively to the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is targeted specifically to zzso outer zzso Comprehensive zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that their C zzso including zzso zzso zzso and tail regions, contained several unique zzso and zzso characteristics that defined zzso targeting zzso zzso targeting of zzso was zzso by a combination of zzso zzso acids along one face of the zzso an enrichment of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso and a zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso targeting of zzso depended primarily upon the overall length and zzso of the zzso although an zzso motif in the tail was also a targeting zzso zzso the results presented provide significant insight into the early zzso events required for entry of zzso proteins into either the zzso or zzso targeting zzso
