zzso is a key player in the process regulating zzso axis formation in the sea zzso zzso zzso early within an oral organizing zzso it is required to specify both the oral and zzso zzso territories by driving an zzso gene regulatory zzso A model for zzso axis zzso has been proposed relying on the self zzso of zzso and the diffusion of the long-range zzso zzso resulting in a sharp restriction of zzso activity within the oral zzso Here, we describe the expression pattern of zzso and zzso its function in the process of secondary axis zzso zzso expression starts at the zzso stage immediately after that of zzso is rapidly restricted to the zzso oral zzso then shifted toward the right side after zzso zzso with previous work, neither the oral nor the zzso zzso are specified in zzso in which zzso is zzso zzso when zzso function is zzso most of the zzso is converted into oral zzso through zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a restricted territory of zzso depleted zzso caused a zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso into one zzso at the zzso stage in zzso depleted zzso blocked zzso expression in the whole zzso consistent with the highly zzso character of zzso in other zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso axis formation and suggest that zzso acts as a long-range inhibitor of zzso zzso in the sea zzso zzso
