Various theories try to explain the development and progression of zzso however, no single theory can explain all aspects of this zzso Gene expression profiling studies might reveal factors that explain zzso in disease development and zzso which can serve as specific zzso for zzso and novel drug zzso We have recently showed that the zzso genes were predominantly clustered in stress and detoxification, providing a zzso explanation for the zzso stress and chronic inflammatory response in zzso 

This review zzso zzso to zzso the published data, with the aim of identifying pathways consistently regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso the findings of specific zzso which are involved in the process of zzso stress and zzso 

We identified gene array and zzso studies whose data were accessible in zzso 

A major finding is the increased expressions of several markers including heat shock zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which might be involved in the process of zzso zzso zzso sterile zzso The study reviews a convergence in the main zzso process, where the zzso inflammation occurs possibly through the zzso zzso 

In conclusion, a zzso zzso of both the zzso stress zzso and the zzso pathways is generated when the process becomes chronic zzso signal zzso
