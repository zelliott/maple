The tumor necrosis factor zzso family of zzso and their receptors regulates many areas of zzso zzso Specifically, this zzso family plays crucial roles in regulating myriad aspects of immune development and zzso zzso of zzso interaction or downstream signal zzso components in the zzso family often leads to pathological zzso Historically, members of the zzso zzso family zzso were thought to exist as zzso zzso chains prior to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso then zzso the zzso of the receptors and zzso of downstream zzso However, recent evidence indicates that many zzso exist as zzso zzso on the cell zzso zzso assembly of zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso assembly domain zzso which resides within the membrane zzso zzso domain of the zzso Growing evidence indicates that zzso zzso association regulates cellular responses to zzso zzso especially in cells of the immune zzso Thus, targeting zzso assembly may offer new possibilities for therapeutic intervention in different pathological conditions involving zzso zzso
