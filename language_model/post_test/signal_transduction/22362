In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are model basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, that have the opposite cell expression pattern in zzso clusters during zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso of zzso zzso in specific cells within zzso clusters by zzso signaling is programmed by a zzso and zzso DNA zzso code containing binding sites for the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso Here we show the novel result that the zzso promoter contains a similar zzso code of zzso and zzso A binding sites but contains a different zzso site architectural code that does not mediate zzso during zzso zzso thus programming a cell expression pattern opposite that of zzso in zzso zzso
