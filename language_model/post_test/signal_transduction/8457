When zzso by zzso zzso cells respond through a combination of zzso and spatial zzso These responses come about because of the interaction of a large number of signaling zzso The complexity of these systems makes it hard to understand without a means of systematically generating and testing zzso Computer simulations have proved to be useful in testing conceptual zzso Here we outline the steps required to develop these zzso
