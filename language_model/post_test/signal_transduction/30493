zzso cancer zzso via the zzso of numerous genetic zzso with loss of zzso and zzso function representing key events in the development of zzso zzso In addition, components of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso are frequently zzso providing potential zzso zzso We have previously described the generation of zzso human zzso cells with disabled zzso or zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the relative responses of normal, zzso and zzso human zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The proliferation of normal human zzso cells was dependent on signaling via the zzso and zzso pathways and was abolished zzso by zzso of zzso or downstream zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in only transient zzso which was most likely zzso via zzso with the zzso zzso These responses were maintained in cells with disabled zzso function, whereas cells with loss of zzso function displayed reduced sensitivity to zzso and zzso cell lines were the most zzso to zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso cells acquire zzso to zzso of zzso signaling pathways as a result of zzso zzso This has important implications for the use of zzso zzso for zzso cancer therapy, as combination treatments with conventional chemotherapy or zzso may protect normal cells and enable better selective targeting of zzso zzso
