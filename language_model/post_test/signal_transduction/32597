The tumor zzso zzso plays a key role in inducing zzso arrest and zzso following DNA zzso The zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays an important role in regulation of gene expression at both zzso and zzso zzso Since a cross talk between zzso proteins and zzso had already been established, we investigated whether and how zzso function was modulated by zzso We analyzed zzso function in several cell lines derived from zzso and zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso after zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso arrest were impaired in zzso cells upon conditions that zzso zzso acquired a zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso on zzso was defective in zzso cells, consistent with an impaired zzso induction of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso by mouse zzso were diminished in zzso cells after DNA damage induced by the zzso drug zzso or gamma radiation but not by zzso zzso Furthermore, the specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the induction of zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso to a higher degree in zzso cells than in zzso zzso These novel findings suggest that zzso enhances zzso zzso function and zzso zzso in cell signaling zzso by a specific type of DNA damage that leads to zzso zzso possibly through a zzso zzso zzso
