How zzso signaling proteins traverse tissue during animal development, through or around tightly packed cells, remains an incompletely resolved zzso Signaling protein movement is regulated to create zzso control zzso impose zzso or provide zzso Signaling can be controlled by the rate of signal production, zzso active zzso zzso along the path, or by the properties of the zzso zzso zzso may move by diffusion outside cells, attached to zzso cells, attached to carrier zzso through cells by zzso along cell zzso or in released membrane zzso Recent findings about the movement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling proteins have helped to clarify the molecular mechanisms used to ensure that zzso signals carry only good zzso
