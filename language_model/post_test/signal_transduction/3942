The molecular basis for the well known synergistic biological effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso gamma zzso is still poorly zzso This report demonstrates that expression of zzso factor 1 zzso also known as zzso factor 2 zzso is zzso induced by these zzso The induction is a primary zzso response that occurs rapidly without a requirement for new protein zzso zzso is zzso by a novel composite element in the zzso promoter that includes an zzso site zzso overlapped by a zzso site for nuclear factor zzso B zzso These sequences are bound strongly by signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso However, the binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso element in zzso seems to be mutually exclusive and zzso zzso induction of zzso is likely to be an important early step in regulatory networks critical to the zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso element may mediate synergistic zzso induction of zzso by other pairs of zzso that together activate zzso and zzso family zzso Other genes are likely to contain this motif and be regulated zzso
