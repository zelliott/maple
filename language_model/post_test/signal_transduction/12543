zzso may be involved in affecting zzso processes in multiple zzso It is conceivable that interfering with zzso normal role in contributing to zzso resting membrane potential, via its effects on the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso inward zzso zzso channels zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso may facilitate zzso Another aspect of zzso function may be its role in the zzso signaling of nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, nerve growth factor, zzso appears to be dependent on zzso zzso This zzso zzso signaling may subsequently lead to zzso of zzso genes as well as zzso of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso root zzso In fact, multiple articles have described the clinical use of zzso leading to pain, a phenomenon referred to as zzso zzso pain syndrome zzso Thus, it appears that zzso functions may zzso actions which promote or dampen zzso zzso A greater understanding of the physiology of zzso especially as it relates to modulating zzso may lead to the development of novel zzso targets in attempts to zzso alleviate patient zzso
