To investigate The modulating role of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the expression of tumor necrosis zzso in zzso cells and its role in zzso injury in severely burned zzso 

zzso adult healthy male zzso rats were randomly divided into three groups (8 rats in each zzso sham group, burn group, and burn with zzso zzso A rat model of zzso burn injury covering zzso total body surface area zzso was zzso The specific inhibitor of zzso zzso in 10 zzso was given to the rats in the burn with zzso group at 15 minutes and 12 hours after zzso The serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured at 24 zzso hours zzso The zzso zzso expression in the liver was determined by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, and the expression levels of zzso and zzso in the liver were determined by Western zzso zzso 

The serum levels of zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso zzso in liver cells were significantly higher in burn group than those in sham and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso or zzso but there was no difference between the two latter zzso It was indicated by Western zzso results that there was no difference of zzso expression in rat liver among the three groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression ratio among sham, burn and burn with zzso groups was zzso The zzso expression was significantly lower in burn with zzso group than that in burn group zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference compared with that in sham group zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso activated zzso in rat liver after severe burn injury enhances the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso
