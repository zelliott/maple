The bone zzso zzso influences whether a given B cell zzso zzso or zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso of primary zzso B zzso precursors can be regulated either positively or zzso by zzso Several zzso lines that support zzso outgrowth suppressed the spontaneous zzso of zzso cells by as much as zzso zzso contact with zzso cells more effectively protected zzso than did zzso zzso or a collection of zzso zzso In contrast, one unique zzso cell clone actually induced zzso zzso and a second line appeared zzso A survey of adherent cell lines suggested that expression of zzso molecules is widespread but not zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggested that these interaction molecules do not deliver short-term survival signals to B cell zzso Of particular interest, direct interaction with zzso zzso cells minimized the negative regulatory effects of zzso and a zzso but not zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that the effect of negative regulators depends upon the context in which these signals are zzso As molecules that influence B zzso are better zzso it will be important to consider the role of each in combination with other zzso
