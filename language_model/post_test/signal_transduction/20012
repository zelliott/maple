zzso syndrome zzso may occur when graft volume is less than zzso of the standard liver volume, and it zzso as retarded growth and failure of the zzso and more zzso However, its zzso is poorly zzso and few effective interventions have been zzso 

The present study aimed to delineate the critical role of zzso stress in zzso and protective effects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on graft function, growth, and survival in the recipient zzso 

Small size graft liver transplantation zzso was performed to determine the survival, graft injury, and zzso zzso was administered in zzso recipients zzso 

zzso zzso zzso levels were sustained higher in zzso recipients, which were correlated with an increased zzso cell count and zzso necrosis in liver zzso zzso content, gene expression of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso and DNA binding activity of nuclear zzso in the zzso were increased significantly in zzso recipients compared with zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and nuclear zzso were increased in zzso All these changes were zzso reversed by the administration of zzso with an increase in serum zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso incorporation demonstrated that graft zzso was much more profound in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso Finally, the survival of recipients with zzso treatments was significantly zzso 

zzso zzso stress with zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso contributes to zzso graft failure, retarded graft growth, and poor zzso zzso effectively reversed the zzso changes in zzso graft zzso
