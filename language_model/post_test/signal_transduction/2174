This study addresses the role of zzso zzso influx in the regulation of zzso in inflammatory zzso In zzso zzso which do not possess zzso zzso channels, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to stimulate zzso zzso influx and to trigger zzso of primary zzso An efficient triggering of zzso by zzso required the presence of zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso zzso influx through zzso did not trigger zzso zzso was unable to stimulate zzso in the absence of zzso free zzso concentration zzso zzso However, a second signal generated by zzso zzso with zzso zzso influx to trigger zzso and led to a left shift of the zzso relationship in zzso zzso The synergistic zzso signaling cascade was long-lasting, involved a zzso zzso G protein and a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso influx is crucial for the efficient triggering of zzso in zzso zzso but, as opposed to zzso influx through zzso zzso channels in zzso it is not a sufficient stimulus by itself and requires synergistic zzso zzso
