zzso zzso T cells zzso extensively but fail to differentiate when they are transferred into zzso recipients that express zzso or transgenic zzso on all zzso class zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso family member expressed on activated zzso T cells, enables the zzso T cells to accumulate as differentiated zzso cells and kill the host zzso The donor T cells from zzso animals express high levels of zzso alpha zzso and acquire the ability to zzso zzso when zzso with zzso and zzso zzso promotes differentiation by 48 h in T cell zzso before changes in zzso expression or cell recovery become zzso We found that a zzso zzso or zzso in zzso or zzso failed to influence zzso of differentiated donor cells, and found larger changes in expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes than in survival zzso zzso of differentiated zzso zzso T cells is initiated directly through zzso but some zzso donor cells can gain zzso function as bystanders to zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso T cell differentiation to zzso function is an important effect of zzso engagement under conditions of ubiquitous zzso zzso
