It is well established that zzso is active in the zzso and plays a key role in several zzso disorders but the exact role of immune cells remains zzso Thus, in the present study we investigated whether zzso are zzso in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso zzso death was significantly reduced following exposure to mixed zzso or zzso T zzso containing either activated or zzso zzso zzso media from zzso zzso but not boiled zzso media, was protective against zzso toxicity indicating soluble zzso zzso the observed zzso with zzso zzso indicating zzso as the likely zzso A role for zzso was established as the zzso was abolished in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways with pharmacological zzso of these pathways mimicking the protective effect of zzso Similarly, zzso were zzso against zzso deprivation zzso cell death with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways zzso These data indicate that zzso are zzso under our experimental conditions and we suggest that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are involved but further studies are required to investigate whether similar mechanisms zzso the actions of zzso in zzso experimental models of zzso This article is part of the Special zzso entitled 'The zzso zzso of zzso zzso
