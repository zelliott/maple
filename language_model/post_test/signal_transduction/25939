Directed evolution of zzso such as DNA, zzso and proteins containing high diversity has emerged as an effective method to obtain molecules for various zzso In the recent past, proteins from zzso have attracted attention as they mimic zzso with respect to binding potential and provide further potential zzso In this regard, we have attempted to explore a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso proteins are small zzso zzso structurally well zzso zzso stable and resistant to zzso that presents them as promising candidates for directed zzso 

We have engineered a snake zzso that belongs to the zzso family by zzso the zzso in the zzso involved in binding with zzso receptors and employing zzso display to obtain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso candidates were highly specific for zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso were identified in an zzso dependent cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso yielded peptides of about one-third the molecular mass of the original zzso without significant loss of activities and, zzso lead to the identification of the zzso responsible for zzso 

This study shows zzso protein is amenable to introduce zzso acid changes in the zzso that enable preparation of a high diversity library that can be zzso to obtain zzso against zzso We believe this is the first report of protein engineering to convert a zzso to zzso zzso other than the parent zzso the identification of an zzso from zzso zzso the construction of zzso mimic of zzso and the successful size reduction of a zzso zzso
