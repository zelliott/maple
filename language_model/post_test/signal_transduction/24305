The long zzso and stability of human serum zzso zzso make it an attractive candidate for fusion to short-lived therapeutic zzso zzso (Human Genome Sciences zzso zzso Rockville, zzso beta is a novel zzso protein derived from a gene fusion of zzso zzso ) and zzso In zzso zzso beta displays zzso and zzso activities and triggers the zzso response element zzso signal zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso independent genes in zzso cells revealed that zzso beta and zzso induce the expression of an identical set of 30 zzso including 9 previously not zzso In zzso monkeys administered a dose of 50 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or 300 zzso zzso zzso beta demonstrated favorable zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso plasma clearance at zzso zzso was approximately zzso lower than that of zzso and the terminal zzso was zzso h compared with 8 h for zzso zzso zzso beta induced sustained increases in serum zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso At a zzso dose equivalent to one-half the dose of zzso zzso beta zzso comparable zzso responses and significantly higher zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso The enhanced in zzso zzso properties of zzso when fused to serum zzso suggest a clinical opportunity for improved zzso zzso
