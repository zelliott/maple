We have conducted an analysis of genetic zzso in spontaneous zzso melanoma cell line zzso and its two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso melanoma cell lines zzso zzso and zzso We found that unlike human zzso the zzso melanoma cell lines did not have zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso 11 or zzso However, there were distinct patterns of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes in the two melanoma zzso In the spontaneous zzso melanoma cell lines, expression of zzso and zzso tumor zzso proteins was lost as a consequence of a large deletion spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso melanoma cell lines expressed zzso but had zzso zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that genetic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso pathways can cooperate in the development of zzso zzso
