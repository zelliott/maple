zzso is a zzso zzso acid binding protein linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To learn more about the normal biological and abnormal pathological role of this zzso we turned to zzso zzso and its zzso zzso We report that zzso functions in the zzso zzso to regulate longevity and the zzso stress response downstream from the zzso zzso factor zzso However, although zzso zzso are zzso chronic zzso of zzso expression is toxic and decreases zzso zzso zzso in zzso or the related zzso binding protein zzso activate the unfolded protein response and generate zzso stress leading to the zzso zzso of zzso expression with negative effects on zzso function and zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that chronic induction of zzso zzso by cellular stress may zzso zzso and decrease zzso
