To study the common molecular mechanisms of various viruses infections that might result in zzso cardiovascular diseases in zzso period, changes in zzso expression levels of zzso cells infected by zzso virus zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso were analyzed using a zzso system representing zzso human zzso 99 genes were found to exhibit differential expression zzso zzso and 19 zzso Biological process analysis showed that 33 signaling pathways including 22 genes were relevant significantly to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of these 33 biological zzso 28 belong to zzso biological processes and 5 belong to zzso biological zzso Gene zzso indicated that the 5 zzso biological processes including regulation of cell growth, collagen zzso organization, zzso zzso cell zzso and regulation of cell shape, and seven zzso or zzso genes zzso zzso rich zzso zzso regulator 1), zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso protein zzso zzso zzso type zzso alpha 1), zzso zzso type zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso are significantly correlated to zzso zzso and zzso infections in zzso zzso The results obtained in this study suggested the common molecular mechanisms of viruses infections that might result in zzso cardiovascular zzso
