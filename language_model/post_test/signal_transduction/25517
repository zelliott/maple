When cells undergo zzso they can stimulate the proliferation of nearby cells, a process referred to as zzso cell zzso The stimulation of proliferation in response to tissue damage or removal is also central to zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso has emerged as an important regulator of growth during normal development and zzso from zzso to zzso Here we show that induction of zzso in the zzso wing zzso disc stimulates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso in surviving and nearby cells, and that zzso is required for the ability of the wing to zzso after genetic zzso of the wing zzso zzso of zzso activates zzso through the zzso zzso pathway, and direct zzso of zzso zzso signaling also promotes zzso zzso in the wing zzso We also show that depletion of zzso tumor zzso zzso including lethal giant larvae and discs large, or zzso of zzso activates zzso through zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is necessary, but not zzso for the disruption of zzso polarity associated with loss of lethal giant zzso Our observations identify zzso signaling as a zzso of zzso zzso activity in wing zzso discs, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell proliferation and disc zzso
