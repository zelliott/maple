zzso zzso A levels in serum, zzso fluid, and zzso fluid of zzso cancer patients suggest a role for this zzso hormone in disease zzso We zzso that zzso A plays a role in zzso tumor biology, and analyzed zzso zzso signaling in zzso and the expression of zzso signaling zzso molecules in zzso zzso A regulation of zzso and zzso and the effects of zzso the activities of these molecules (with pharmacological zzso on cellular proliferation were assessed in the cell line, zzso zzso A activated zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso A zzso cellular proliferation and repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso To validate in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso A and zzso zzso was performed, and the correlation between zzso levels of these markers and survival was evaluated in benign zzso zzso borderline zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of tissue zzso revealed that zzso expression in zzso did not correlate with survival or zzso but expression was elevated in zzso cells from zzso when compared with benign zzso zzso zzso zzso was more intense in zzso active zzso cells and exhibited a polarized zzso in benign zzso that was absent in zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso correlated with better survival for zzso patients zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which zzso A may mediate zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso to stimulate cellular zzso
