During tissue zzso and zzso cells must zzso while zzso generating daughters that contribute to the growing zzso How zzso achieve this precise balance between proliferation and differentiation is, in most instances, poorly zzso This is in part due to the difficulties in zzso the mechanisms that zzso tissue patterning from those that regulate zzso In the zzso zzso lateral line zzso zzso proliferation is predominantly zzso to the leading zzso As cells emerge from this zone, they periodically zzso into zzso that subsequently zzso from the zzso and differentiate as zzso Despite this zzso loss of cells, the zzso maintains its size through zzso cell proliferation until it reaches the zzso In this study, we identify a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso factor zzso and show that its activity is required to maintain proliferation in the zzso pool of cells that sustains the zzso as it zzso migration, zzso and zzso In absence of zzso the leading zone becomes depleted of cells during its migration leading to the collapse of the zzso into a couple of terminal zzso We show that this zzso resembles the process by which the zzso normally ends its migration, suggesting that suppression of zzso zzso is required for termination of zzso production in the zzso Our data support a model in which zzso sustains proliferation of leading zone zzso maintaining the zzso size and defining zzso deposition zzso
