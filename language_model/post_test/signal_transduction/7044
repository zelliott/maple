zzso are zzso structures used by tumor cells for degradation of the zzso zzso to promote invasion zzso zzso formation and function are regulated by zzso pathways and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exchange factor zzso which is an zzso of zzso family zzso is zzso expressed in many pancreatic zzso where it promotes tumor cell survival and migration zzso zzso We have now determined that zzso is also a potent regulator of zzso degradation by pancreatic tumor cells as depletion of zzso by zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso This requires the exchange function of zzso toward the zzso zzso which is required for zzso assembly zzso zzso In addition, we have determined that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are both required for, and, unexpectedly, sufficient for, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which mimics its activated state, is a potent zzso of zzso formation through zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso of other zzso zzso such as zzso Thus, these data identify a novel mechanism by which zzso can enhance the zzso and invasive potential of cancer zzso These data suggest that zzso promotes the zzso processes underlying tumor cell migration and further, under conditions of zzso zzso zzso that zzso is a central regulator and major driver of invasive zzso zzso by pancreatic tumor zzso
