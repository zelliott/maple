zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an essential step in cellular signaling by growth hormone zzso and multiple other hormones and zzso zzso zzso has a total of 49 zzso which, if zzso could serve as zzso sites for zzso zzso 2 zzso or zzso binding zzso signaling zzso Using a zzso zzso screen of a rat zzso zzso library, we identified a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso designated zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso which contains the zzso domain, specifically interacts with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso to a significantly greater extent with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in a far Western zzso In zzso cells, zzso stimulates the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso both in zzso as assessed by binding of zzso in cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso fusion zzso and in zzso as assessed by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso promoted a transient and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, further suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso being a zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso when zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso in response to gamma zzso a zzso that activates zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso recruits zzso and its associated signaling molecules into a zzso complex, thereby initiating some as yet unidentified signal zzso zzso These pathways are likely to be shared by other zzso that activate zzso
