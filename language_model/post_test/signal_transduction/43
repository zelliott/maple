Silicon is the second most abundant mineral element in soil, it has important role in alleviating various environmental stresses and enhancing plant resistance against zzso but the exact mechanism by which zzso mediates pathogen resistance remains zzso One of the resistance mechanisms is related to silicon deposition in leaf that acts as a physical barrier to hinder pathogen zzso But more evidence show that silicon can induce defense responses that are functionally similar to systemic acquired resistance, zzso plants can significantly increase zzso zzso activities and the production of zzso compounds such as zzso metabolism product, zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso can activate the expression of zzso genes and may play important role in the zzso of plant stress signal such as salicylic acid, zzso acid and zzso
