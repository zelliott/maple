zzso zzso zzso exert zzso effects by reducing local zzso production from zzso in zzso women with zzso breast zzso Previous reports have shown that zzso zzso generated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can also reportedly be generated from zzso zzso zzso pooled in the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways have thus been proposed as a mechanism of zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether these pathways are functional in clinical breast zzso To investigate this issue, we assessed the zzso activities of zzso in 45 zzso human breast zzso using the zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso and zzso expression levels of the zzso target zzso zzso zzso as indicators of ex zzso and in zzso zzso activity, zzso We also determined zzso expression levels of zzso type 1 zzso and zzso zzso type 1 zzso type 1; zzso which produce zzso from zzso and of steroid zzso zzso and zzso zzso type 1 zzso type 1; zzso which produce zzso or zzso from zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were positively correlated with ex zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were positively correlated with in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso expression levels of these zzso zzso in association with high in zzso zzso activity were particularly notable in zzso zzso Analysis of the expression levels of zzso zzso revealed positive correlations between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso as well as the zzso zzso could contributes to zzso zzso especially zzso These pathways might function as an alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso
