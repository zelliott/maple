zzso and zzso zzso genes are known to play an essential role in zzso zzso zzso Here we show that these zzso genes are also expressed within the developing zzso where they zzso control development of the female zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso in the zzso single zzso is largely normal, additional zzso of zzso zzso genes results in a shortened style and an zzso swollen zzso narrowing onto an zzso zzso In particular, the zzso does not form properly and lacks a zzso zzso Loss of zzso function enhances the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso indicating a functional overlap between zzso and these genes in regulating zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso development of zzso zzso double zzso shows enhanced sensitivity to a polar zzso transport zzso and the expression pattern of the zzso zzso gene zzso is altered compared to zzso Our observations imply that zzso and zzso zzso genes control zzso patterning through interference with zzso zzso and zzso
