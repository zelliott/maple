The field of zzso interactions has witnessed several recent zzso such as the molecular details of zzso gene zzso identification of zzso factors, and the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso Other zzso such as the cloning and characterization of R zzso appear zzso zzso to zzso systems are emerging in the world of zzso zzso for example, zzso channels formed by zzso zzso similarities of zzso genes to zzso genes of zzso zzso and plant signal zzso via calcium and protein zzso We remain, however, largely ignorant of many zzso of signaling in zzso zzso We know little about how microbial signals are perceived by plants or how subsequent signal zzso occurs within plant cells and are probably unaware of many of the zzso signals to which plants respond or of zzso signals to which bacteria and zzso zzso Contributions from those working on the zzso molecular biology, and physiology of bacteria, zzso and plants will be required to address these zzso The many zzso zzso interactions in addition to the zzso interaction remain relatively zzso zzso and molecular approaches are being initiated to investigate the signaling that is likely to zzso interactions such as those between zzso zzso and plant roots and between zzso bacteria and plant leaf zzso The importance of these interactions to plant growth and development makes it likely that they will figure more prominently at future zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
