Twisted zzso zzso is a zzso protein that regulates zzso signaling in the zzso space through its direct interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies in zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso can act both as an zzso and as a zzso We have analyzed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are viable but of smaller size and display mild zzso abnormalities and zzso We provide evidence that zzso interacts genetically with zzso When only one copy of zzso is present, a requirement of zzso for embryonic development is zzso zzso compound zzso die at birth and display zzso first zzso arch and eye zzso The results show that zzso functions to promote zzso signaling during mouse head zzso
