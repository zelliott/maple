It is known that some local zzso inhibit the growth of budding zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of local zzso action, we isolated and characterized zzso that were zzso to zzso and at the same time, zzso for zzso They were collectively called las zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the LAS zzso zzso was found to be identical to zzso which had been independently discovered as a member of the zzso complex 1 zzso zzso is a widely zzso zzso binding protein containing the zzso domain, zzso repeats and zzso repeats, but its function remains zzso Like the zzso zzso the zzso zzso were found to have a zzso in cell wall integrity and to show sensitivity to zzso Furthermore, zzso is required not only in zzso zzso pathways such as translation initiation control and zzso of zzso and zzso but also for the normal distribution of the zzso zzso which has been regarded as a zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso was suppressed by either zzso of zzso or by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso were found not to be effective for suppression of the zzso of the same zzso These observations along with the facts that zzso and high temperature zzso affected the zzso zzso suggest that zzso is not a target of zzso and that the zzso step may be one of downstream branches of the zzso zzso zzso with the broad cellular functions exerted by the zzso pathway, we found that zzso was associated with zzso and was localized at zzso the plasma membrane and small zzso
