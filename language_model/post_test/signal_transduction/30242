zzso zzso is a prominent feature of zzso injury that involves dramatic changes in zzso cell zzso together with increased zzso zzso activity, and release of inflammatory zzso We have recently demonstrated that stimulation of the zzso zzso G zzso zzso by NO or zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso dynamics and zzso in rat zzso in zzso In this work, we show that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso regulates zzso cell zzso by inducing a dramatic reorganization in the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and the permeable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promote a rapid zzso at 30 zzso and zzso increase in size, zzso and zzso and zzso formation in rat brain cultured zzso These zzso changes involve an augment and zzso of zzso and result in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso particle zzso are prevented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and involve zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso does not induce NO zzso Type 2 zzso or tumor necrosis zzso expression and is able to decrease zzso zzso induction of these inflammatory zzso The zzso changes and the decrease of zzso zzso expression produced by zzso in cultured zzso are also observed by zzso in zzso cultures from rat zzso These results suggest that stimulation of the zzso zzso in zzso could play a beneficial role in the resolution of zzso by removing dead cells and decreasing levels of zzso zzso
