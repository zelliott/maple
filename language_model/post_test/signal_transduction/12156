zzso and zzso are novel zzso zzso that act on internal zzso zzso modifications within zzso zzso zzso and regulate their interactions with various signaling zzso including zzso zzso Although the zzso are zzso zzso there is limited information available about how the zzso contribute to their zzso and signaling zzso In this study, we found that both human zzso were zzso as zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso to form zzso linked zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The mature zzso were zzso into zzso zzso as well as retained on the cell zzso Although the zzso center resides in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was indispensable for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso regions of the zzso were essential for zzso activity but not for zzso zzso Using zzso sequencing, we identified zzso zzso zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso of these sequences resulted in zzso forms of zzso The zzso zzso retained zzso zzso However, they were unable to zzso zzso zzso which may be due to their defective zzso into zzso zzso on the plasma zzso
