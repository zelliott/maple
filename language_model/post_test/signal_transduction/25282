zzso cells participate in immune regulation and zzso integrity by generating a range of biologically active zzso In the zzso little is known about the potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso a potent antibiotic, and thus a potential zzso zzso although it is not known if it is zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

We show, by zzso zzso chain reaction, the presence of zzso zzso zzso in human model zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso and colon biopsy zzso The zzso chain reaction product was cloned and zzso and is identical to that of zzso isolated previously from the human zzso zzso 

As analyzed by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso occurs in a markedly polarized manner toward the zzso surface and is enhanced by inflammatory zzso including tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso increase over control zzso zzso release is also zzso by zzso of protein zzso C zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso zzso protein is zzso in zzso zzso zzso collected from normal adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a model zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exhibits an zzso activity against at least one major zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso does not influence zzso barrier integrity as assessed by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

These results establish that human zzso zzso expresses and zzso zzso zzso a zzso that may significantly contribute to the protection against attack from inflammatory cells and zzso zzso as well as against microbial zzso
