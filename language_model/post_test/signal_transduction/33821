zzso of zzso compound eye employ a G zzso signaling zzso that zzso single photons into transient electrical responses called zzso zzso zzso Although most of the molecular components of this zzso are already known, the zzso understanding of the mechanism of QB generation has remained zzso Here, we present a quantitative model explaining how QBs emerge from zzso zzso dynamics of the signaling zzso The model shows that the cascade acts as an zzso and zzso device and explains how zzso achieve reliable responses to light although keeping low background in the zzso The model predicts the zzso behavior of zzso that enhance or suppress signaling and explains the dependence on external zzso which controls feedback zzso The results provide insight into zzso questions such as zzso response efficiency and the adaptation of response to high zzso zzso The zzso analysis enabled by modeling zzso provides a foundation for understanding G protein signaling pathways less amenable to quantitative zzso
