zzso zzso zzso have a single zzso zzso segment that is usually assumed to play a passive role in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso However, zzso within some of these zzso and recent studies with the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso receptors have indicated that interactions between TM zzso do contribute to stabilization of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso One consequence of the importance of these interactions is that short zzso peptides corresponding to these zzso should act as specific zzso To test this hypothesis, we constructed expression zzso zzso short fusion peptides encompassing native or zzso TM zzso of the zzso zzso and insulin zzso In human cell lines zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso we observed that the peptides are expressed at the cell surface and that they inhibit specifically the zzso and signaling zzso of their zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with peptides chemically zzso zzso of action involves zzso of zzso of the receptors as shown by the lack of effects of zzso zzso zzso completed by density zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings stress the role of TM domain interactions in zzso zzso function, and possibly for other zzso membrane zzso
