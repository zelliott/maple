The zzso are a group of inherited disorders of the hands characterized by shortened zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso type B zzso zzso in zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, cause zzso type C zzso whereas zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso cause zzso type zzso zzso There is considerable degree of zzso overlap between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we demonstrate that all three components are involved in zzso induced regulation of zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso independent zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is required for this zzso Within that complex zzso gets zzso by zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and by zzso a zzso zzso Both pathways however, are needed for zzso differentiation as demonstrated in zzso zzso The functional interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso was genetically confirmed by the presence of zzso effects in crosses of zzso zzso and zzso deficient zzso These results indicate for the first time a direct interaction of zzso and zzso receptors and provide evidence for zzso of the zzso and zzso triggered zzso
