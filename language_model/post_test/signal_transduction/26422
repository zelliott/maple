zzso form a diverse group of zzso molecules that include zzso zzso zzso and zzso They play several important roles at cellular and zzso zzso zzso acids are the major building blocks for the synthesis of zzso which are mainly used for energy zzso zzso together with zzso and zzso represent the major structural components of biological zzso zzso can also have important roles in zzso functioning as second zzso and as zzso There is increasing evidence that cancer cells show specific zzso in different aspects of zzso zzso These zzso can affect the availability of structural lipids for the synthesis of zzso the synthesis and degradation of lipids that contribute to energy zzso and the abundance of lipids with zzso zzso Changes in zzso metabolism can affect numerous cellular zzso including cell growth, zzso differentiation and zzso This review will examine some of the zzso in zzso metabolism that have been reported in cancer, at both cellular and zzso levels, and discuss how they contribute to different aspects of zzso
