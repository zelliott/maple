Plants encounter numerous zzso and pathogens in the natural zzso An appropriate response to attack by such organisms can lead to tolerance or resistance mechanisms that enable the plant to zzso Many studies concentrate on the zzso pathways that enable plants to recognize and respond to attack, and measure the downstream effect in either zzso or molecular zzso At the whole plant level, ecologists examine the fitness costs of attack not only for the plant but also over a range of zzso zzso The links between these differing levels of study are beginning to be addressed by the adoption of molecular approaches in more ecologically relevant zzso This review will describe the different approaches used by ecologists and cell biologists in this field and will try to address the question of how we can explore the response to, and consequences, of attack by multiple zzso
