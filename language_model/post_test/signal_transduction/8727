Venezuelan zzso encephalitis virus zzso is an important human and veterinary pathogen causing sporadic zzso outbreaks of potentially fatal zzso The type I zzso zzso system plays a central role in controlling zzso and other zzso infections, and zzso evasion is likely an important zzso of whether these viruses zzso and cause disease within their zzso zzso are thought to limit the induction of type I zzso and zzso genes by shutting off host cell zzso zzso which in the case of zzso is partially zzso by the viral zzso zzso However, more specific strategies by which zzso inhibit type I zzso signaling have not been zzso zzso of cells infected with zzso and zzso zzso particles zzso demonstrate that viral infection rapidly zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso factor zzso in response to both zzso and zzso This effect was independent of host zzso and expression of viral zzso suggesting that zzso uses novel mechanisms to interfere with type I and type II zzso zzso Furthermore, at times when zzso zzso was efficiently zzso zzso infection did not limit zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso after zzso treatment but did inhibit zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso suggesting that zzso interferes with zzso zzso by the type I and II zzso complexes through distinct zzso Identification of the viral requirements for this novel zzso zzso will further our understanding of zzso molecular zzso and may provide insights into effective zzso vaccine zzso
