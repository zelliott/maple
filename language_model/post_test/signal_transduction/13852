zzso zzso zzso are important zzso of gene zzso and other biological zzso zzso is one of the least characterized zzso and is the only member of the class IV zzso zzso Our studies examined the events that control the expression of the zzso zzso We show that zzso growth factor zzso rapidly reduces the abundance of zzso zzso when added to zzso zzso cells, which are zzso zzso Reduction required zzso and protein zzso but not zzso or zzso activity, and resulted from accelerated turnover of the zzso zzso Reduction was transient in cells receiving zzso alone but sustained in cells receiving both zzso and zzso zzso which together promote zzso traverse and S phase zzso Plasma alone did not appreciably reduce zzso zzso zzso nor did zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, or zzso zzso zzso accumulated in zzso cells zzso the cell cycle due to zzso growth zzso or serum zzso Of note, zzso zzso did not accumulate in a spontaneously transformed zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) that does not density zzso The zzso promoter was active in zzso but not clone 2 zzso zzso in clone 2 cells did not result from zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the cell cycle progression of both transformed and zzso zzso Our studies identify the zzso transcript as a zzso target and show that zzso zzso abundance zzso zzso with zzso zzso
