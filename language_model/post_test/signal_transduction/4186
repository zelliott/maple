We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso containing the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso grew zzso for several weeks and subsequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso We now show that, in contrast, zzso zzso cells grow progressively in several combined zzso mice, including zzso and zzso III mice, which lack T cells expressing either zzso beta or zzso zzso Furthermore, depletion of gamma delta T cells with a specific zzso made possible the progressive growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso of zzso mice while depletion of alpha beta T cells allowed tumor growth in 50% of these zzso zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso cells prevented the outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso zzso This protective immunity was zzso by in zzso treatment with an zzso delta zzso further indicating that gamma delta T cells play an important role in tumor rejection by zzso zzso A gamma delta T cell line, zzso was established from zzso zzso zzso mice by repeated zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso When tested against a broad spectrum of target cells, zzso zzso several zzso zzso lines, but did not lyse other tumor lines, suggesting that the zzso recognized by zzso has a limited zzso Our data demonstrate that gamma delta T cells, and, to a less extent, zzso alpha beta T cells, mediate an immune response against zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso
