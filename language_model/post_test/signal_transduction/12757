The characteristics of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, were compared with those of a zzso zzso lacking all but 19 zzso acids of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso precursor that was processed to 190 zzso Each zzso cell expressed zzso receptors which bound zzso with a zzso of about zzso zzso Analysis of zzso binding yielded zzso zzso zzso the major part of the binding sites had a zzso of 6 zzso zzso was not zzso The receptors expressed in zzso cells were zzso after binding of zzso and zzso degradation of zzso with similar efficiency as zzso receptors in human zzso The zzso zzso also zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso precursor and was processed to 120 zzso with a slightly faster rate than the zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso generally had around zzso zzso zzso with a zzso for binding of zzso of 3 zzso The zzso zzso which did not zzso a zzso response, zzso degradation of zzso albeit less efficiently compared to the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso it was zzso only to a limited extent and not zzso in response to zzso zzso These findings indicate a role for the zzso part of the zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
