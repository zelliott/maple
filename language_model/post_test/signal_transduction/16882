Identification of the processes and zzso responsible for the large genetic variation in milk production among dairy cattle has proved zzso One approach is to identify a biological process potentially involved in milk production and to determine the genetic influence of all the genes included in the process or zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso A family 5 zzso is relatively abundant in milk, and has been shown to regulate protein synthesis and act as a growth factor in zzso cells in zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in the zzso zzso or if the zzso present in the bovine zzso gene are associated with zzso and milk production traits in dairy zzso Given the high economic value of increased protein in milk, we have tested the hypothesis that zzso or genes in the zzso zzso are associated with milk production zzso First, we constructed a zzso zzso based on upstream and downstream interacting genes reported in the zzso We then tested zzso in close proximity to the genes of this zzso for association with milk production traits in a large dairy cattle zzso 

The constructed zzso zzso consisted of 11 zzso Association analysis between zzso in 1 zzso regions surrounding these genes and milk production traits revealed that more zzso than expected by chance were associated with milk protein percent zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant association with other traits such as milk fat content or zzso 

These results support a role for the zzso zzso in milk production, specifically milk protein percent, and indicate that zzso in or near these genes explain a proportion of the variation for this zzso This method provides a novel way of understanding the underlying biology of zzso with implications for milk production and can be applied to any zzso or gene set to test whether they are responsible for the variation of complex zzso
