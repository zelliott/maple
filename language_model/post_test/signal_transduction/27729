The zzso of growth hormone zzso zzso and the state of the zzso tissue reserves are closely zzso zzso exerts zzso actions on the zzso tissue and low body weight enhances zzso of zzso while obesity is associated with reduced levels of zzso and blocked release of zzso when challenged by all zzso The zzso of the regulation exerted by the zzso tissue on the zzso growth zzso axis are not fully zzso but in the last few years two relevant factors have zzso fatty acids zzso and the zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso integrate a classical feedback loop and a rise in zzso blocks zzso zzso This action is zzso zzso and exerted at the zzso level with no evident zzso zzso A pharmacological reduction in zzso enhances zzso of zzso and eliminates the zzso blockade of obesity and zzso zzso The discovery of zzso has expanded our knowledge of the way in which the zzso tissue zzso in some neuroendocrine zzso zzso is associated with elevated levels of serum zzso while zzso and zzso lead to low zzso In zzso rats, the pattern of zzso zzso is eliminated with a near absence of spontaneous peaks, but the administration of zzso by the zzso zzso route restores the altered zzso When fed rats receive zzso zzso zzso the normal pattern is reversed to an absence of zzso reminiscent of the zzso zzso These results are the first demonstration that, at least in experimental animals, zzso is a relevant factor in zzso zzso zzso has no direct zzso action and its action at the zzso level appears to be zzso by zzso Y, being the final step in a reduction in the zzso zzso On the other hand, the action of zzso on zzso levels seems to be tenuous in humans, but in the near future it will be possible to investigate the action of zzso on human zzso As the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in humans is unlike that in the zzso a crucial point for zzso will be the actions, if any, and the mechanisms by which zzso zzso in zzso regulation in humans, as well as its zzso in disease zzso
