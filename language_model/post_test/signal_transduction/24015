Five zzso zzso zzso were identified by using a zzso screen for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed hormone zzso only in roots, whereas zzso and zzso displayed zzso in both roots and zzso The genes corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso were isolated using a zzso cloning zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso which encodes a component of the zzso protein zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso a dominant zzso resulted from a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso was caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso factor gene zzso The simultaneous loss of functional zzso and zzso nearly completely abolished the zzso response in zzso zzso and adult plants were highly susceptible to infection by the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso double zzso were able to fully suppress zzso signaling caused by zzso suggesting a synergistic interaction among these gene zzso Unlike previously known root zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not affected in their response to zzso and showed a normal response to zzso zzso mapping studies indicate that zzso and zzso zzso to previously unidentified zzso zzso genes that may control zzso processes functioning at the intersection of the zzso and zzso response zzso
