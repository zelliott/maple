zzso are released by zzso zzso via zzso extensions called zzso which require profound changes in the zzso and zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that the zzso pathway, a well-known regulator of zzso zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso formation zzso zzso is expressed at a high level during the entire zzso differentiation including human zzso zzso zzso stimulates its activity but at a higher extent in immature than in mature zzso zzso of a zzso or a spontaneously active zzso leads to an increase or a decrease in zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect is zzso through the main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of which also increases zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or ROCK in zzso leads to a decrease in zzso light chain 2 zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso zzso also decreases zzso zzso while increasing zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso is regulated by both ROCK and zzso zzso and plays an important role in zzso zzso by controlling zzso and zzso
