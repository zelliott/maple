zzso is a unique and vital zzso zzso of the liver that is formed by the zzso and modified down stream by zzso and zzso properties of the zzso duct zzso zzso zzso of zzso consists of organic and zzso zzso of considerable zzso The zzso unit consists of a zzso network which is formed by the zzso membrane of adjacent zzso and sealed by tight zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso conduct the flow of zzso zzso to the direction of portal blood flow and connect with the canal of zzso and zzso ducts which progressively increase in diameter and complexity prior to the entry of zzso into the zzso common zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is determined by both zzso zzso and independent transport systems which are localized at the zzso membrane of the zzso and largely consist of a series of zzso zzso cassette transport proteins that function as export pumps for zzso zzso and other organic zzso These zzso create zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso that provide the driving force for movement of fluid into the zzso via zzso Species vary with respect to the relative amounts of zzso zzso and independent zzso flow and zzso zzso which is highly regulated by hormones, second zzso and signal zzso zzso Most zzso of zzso zzso are now characterized at the molecular level in animal models and in zzso zzso zzso serve to illuminate many of their zzso
