The biological activities of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso have been widely zzso However, comparatively little is known about how zzso expression is zzso Here, we examined the basis for zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in peripheral blood zzso cells following zzso zzso to activate the T cell zzso zzso and zzso signaling through zzso strongly enhanced zzso zzso zzso To define zzso elements important for zzso gene regulation, we cloned zzso zzso of zzso sequence upstream of the zzso start zzso This putative promoter was active in zzso T cells following zzso and zzso zzso and its activity was inhibited by zzso A and zzso zzso The promoter was also active in zzso T cells, which we have shown to zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso or Ras enhanced zzso promoter activity, and studies in zzso lines deficient in specific zzso signaling pathways provided supporting evidence for a role for zzso To delineate the zzso minimal promoter, we created a series of zzso zzso and identified a region between zzso and zzso that was sufficient for zzso promoter zzso Interestingly, two zzso sites were located within this region, which bound to zzso and zzso in nuclear extracts from zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of these sites dramatically reduced both specific DNA binding and reporter gene activity, and zzso zzso zzso showed occupancy of zzso at this region in zzso Together, these data show that zzso is the crucial sensor of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso
