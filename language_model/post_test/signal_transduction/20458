The molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and zzso are still poorly zzso In recent years, the zzso transition zzso a traditional phenomenon revealed in embryonic development, has been gradually accepted as a potential mechanism underlying cancer progression and zzso Many cell signaling pathways involved in development have been shown to contribute to zzso An increasing number of genetic and zzso elements have been discovered, and their zzso relationship in zzso remains to be zzso In addition, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that zzso plays a critical role in different aspects of cancer zzso such as zzso stem cell traits, and zzso However, there are some disagreements and debate about these studies, which raise critical questions worthy of further zzso zzso these questions will lead to a more complete understanding of cancer zzso Due to the close relationship of zzso to cancer zzso and zzso targeting zzso or reversing zzso is likely to lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of human zzso
