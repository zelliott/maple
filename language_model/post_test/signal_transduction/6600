During central nervous system zzso development, zzso precursors zzso in zzso zones and then migrate throughout the zzso to adopt their final destinations and differentiate into various types of mature zzso zzso Although several growth factors promoting the proliferation and/or differentiation of zzso precursors have been identified, very little is known about the nature of signals that guide zzso cell migration in the zzso zzso we have investigated whether zzso growth factors and/or zzso zzso molecules may mediate the migration of two major zzso cell types, type 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that, in a zzso chamber zzso type 1 zzso move toward zzso and zzso zzso zzso migration toward zzso is inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso migrate toward zzso growth factor zzso which also functions as a zzso for these zzso Using a new method to simultaneously zzso migration and DNA zzso we also demonstrate that zzso zzso can migrate toward zzso even when DNA replication is inhibited with an zzso zzso Thus, migration of different types of zzso cells can be induced in zzso by specific signaling zzso which are present in the developing brain and may stimulate migration of zzso cells prior to zzso zzso
