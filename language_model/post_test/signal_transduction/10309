zzso are a normal constituent of the female zzso tract and their numbers increase in the late zzso phase of the zzso cycle prior to zzso Several zzso are produced in female zzso tract zzso In particular zzso zzso factor zzso a potent zzso of zzso is zzso in high zzso by female zzso tract zzso We previously observed that zzso zzso strongly with zzso zzso in enhancing zzso of zzso Thus we investigated whether zzso of zzso with zzso would prime subsequent zzso to zzso in the absence of zzso Surprisingly, a zzso pulse of zzso severely diminished zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso when cells were incubated without zzso they retained zzso migration but lost zzso zzso These changes in zzso did not correlate with expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso was greatly reduced in zzso that no longer migrated to zzso and was diminished in cells that no longer migrated to zzso zzso which is reported by some to exert an zzso effect on zzso did not change the effects of zzso These data suggest that zzso function may be altered by zzso such as zzso through zzso of zzso and independently of surface zzso zzso
