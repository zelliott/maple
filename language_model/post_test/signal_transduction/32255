Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose pathology has been linked to the zzso and deposition of the zzso zzso zzso in neural zzso A truly effective therapeutic agent remains zzso and attention has recently turned to the use of natural products as effective zzso compounds, directly targeting zzso Although a wealth of in zzso and in zzso evidence suggests these compounds or their derivatives might be zzso a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which they act remains largely zzso Using zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the association of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso Through 90 simulations totaling zzso zzso we found that treatment of zzso peptides with zzso largely does not affect secondary structure content, unless a large zzso excess of zzso is zzso However, in simulations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected the zzso and zzso structure of zzso even at low zzso that have been used zzso Thus it appears that despite the inability of zzso to fully block zzso zzso or zzso formation, we observe structures with altered zzso and zzso zzso which may represent zzso zzso that have been proposed zzso The simulations presented here add important new details to the mechanism of these zzso
