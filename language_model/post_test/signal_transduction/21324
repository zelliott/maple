The growth of both tumors and zzso zzso may be influenced by signals from the vascular zzso In the present investigation we show that zzso zzso zzso cells from pancreatic zzso can stimulate zzso proliferation through zzso of zzso growth factor zzso This zzso could be induced by soluble signals from the zzso such as vascular zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso During pregnancy, the pancreatic zzso display a highly zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso cell proliferation precedes zzso proliferation in pregnant zzso zzso growth was closely associated with zzso cell zzso and prominent expression of zzso was observed in zzso zzso on d 15 of pregnancy, zzso coinciding with the peak of zzso zzso In zzso our results suggest the existence of an zzso axis within adult pancreatic zzso which is of importance for adult zzso zzso
