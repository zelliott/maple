zzso therapy zzso is an zzso approach utilizing a zzso zzso and visible light zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, which cause tumor zzso Given that the zzso zzso is under consideration for zzso treatment of zzso cancer we used zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cancer cell line to identify zzso expressed genes with therapeutic zzso This study reveals that the expression of several genes involved in various zzso zzso zzso cell death, zzso zzso inflammation and zzso is strongly affected by zzso and zzso the coordinated induction of a cluster of genes involved in the unfolded protein response zzso after zzso zzso stress and in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cells after zzso zzso or zzso unraveled that the induction of an important subset of zzso expressed genes regulating growth and invasion, as well as zzso mechanisms against zzso stress, is governed by this zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso blocked autonomous regrowth and migration of cancer cells escaping zzso cell zzso This analysis identifies new molecular zzso of the cancer cell response to zzso opening attractive avenues to improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
