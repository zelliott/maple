Biological actions of insulin are zzso by the insulin zzso a member of a large family of zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso by the insulin zzso follows a paradigm for zzso zzso Many zzso zzso molecules contain multiple modular zzso that mediate zzso interactions and participate in the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso are also a prominent feature of zzso zzso zzso pathways are difficult to dissect because branching paths emerge from downstream zzso and several upstream zzso zzso upon single branch zzso Thus, insulin action is determined by complicated zzso networks rather than simple linear zzso Interestingly, many zzso molecules downstream from the insulin zzso are also activated by a plethora of zzso zzso mechanisms that generate specificity are zzso In this review we discuss recent advances in the zzso of specific zzso insulin zzso pathways related to zzso zzso one of the most distinctive biological actions of zzso We also present examples of potential mechanisms underlying specificity in insulin zzso including interactions between multiple branching zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of key zzso and zzso of signal frequency and zzso
