zzso zzso play a role in the initiation and maintenance of labor, acting via specific zzso or zzso receptors on zzso zzso response to addition of zzso may be determined by the type and concentration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding studies suggest a zzso distribution of receptors between zzso lower segment, and zzso and that zzso regulated changes in expression occur with advancing gestation and zzso These receptors have now been cloned and zzso allowing molecular zzso Current dogma suggests functional zzso of the pregnant human zzso occurs with the lower segment displaying a zzso zzso throughout gestation changing to a zzso zzso at labor to allow passage of the fetal head whereas the upper segment has a zzso zzso throughout most of gestation to accommodate the growing fetus and adopts a zzso zzso for expulsion at zzso Studies to determine the role of PG receptors in this phenomenon are currently zzso
