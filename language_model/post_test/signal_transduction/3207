zzso zzso the most frequent genetic cause of zzso kidney disease in children and young adults, is characterized by a variable number of zzso zzso associated with cortical zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso signaling zzso involved in the production of zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso is zzso 

We administered a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso mouse model zzso zzso zzso from 3 to 6 weeks old, and the zzso were examined at 6 weeks of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels, the degree of zzso fibrosis, zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso zzso genes and zzso levels for transforming growth factor in the zzso were zzso Effect of an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor on zzso zzso was also zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso were increased in the zzso mouse model zzso zzso successfully decreased zzso zzso levels, the degree of zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso However, the zzso did not prevent zzso expansion, abnormal cell proliferation and acceleration of zzso and did not influence zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso reduced both zzso expansion and zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso but not zzso expansion, cell proliferation and zzso in zzso model zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways independently affect zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
