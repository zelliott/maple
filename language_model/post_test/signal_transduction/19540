The zzso zzso possesses powerful zzso factors, which can zzso terminally differentiated germ cells zzso or zzso cells within a few cell zzso Although it has been suggested that use of zzso transcripts may enhance the generation of induced zzso stem cells, the zzso factors in zzso are zzso and even the identified proteins composition of zzso is very zzso In the present study, 7,000 mouse zzso at different zzso zzso including the zzso zzso stage, the zzso II zzso stage, and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso We successfully identified zzso proteins present in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso through zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results of the zzso analysis indicated that different protein compositions are correlated with zzso characteristics at different zzso zzso For example, specific zzso factors and zzso zzso factors are more abundant in zzso zzso which may be crucial for the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso These results provided important knowledge to better understand the molecular mechanisms in early development and may improve the generation of induced zzso stem zzso
