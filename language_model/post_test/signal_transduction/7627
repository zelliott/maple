High concentration of zzso zzso zzso which cause zzso in zzso induce the hormone zzso targets and exert zzso effects in cultured breast cancer zzso however, no studies investigated whether these effects might be reproduced in tumor specimens in zzso Our aim was to evaluate the effects of zzso supplementation on the zzso index zzso zzso and gene expression profile of zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso samples were collected from 33 patients, most of whom zzso presenting zzso zzso before and after a short term zzso supplementation zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso zzso dimension remained stable in ultrasound zzso A slight reduction in zzso zzso was zzso however in only zzso zzso samples an zzso low zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Gene expression from 15 matched zzso samples was analyzed by zzso zzso Plus zzso zzso zzso and 15 genes were zzso in zzso tumors, including zzso and zzso which were previously shown to be regulated by vitamin zzso However, these results were not confirmed in another four breast cancer zzso 

zzso supplementation is neither sufficient to zzso elicit an zzso response nor to induce the hormone zzso signaling zzso in breast cancer zzso
