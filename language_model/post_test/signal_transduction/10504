In adult primary visual zzso zzso zzso spines are more persistent than during zzso zzso zzso factor zzso increases synaptic strength, and its levels rise during cortical zzso We therefore asked whether zzso zzso signaling through its zzso zzso regulates spine persistence in adult zzso This question has been difficult to address because most methods used to alter zzso signaling in zzso affect cortical development or cannot distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso We zzso these problems by employing transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative zzso fusion protein in sparse zzso zzso of the adult zzso and zzso producing a zzso zzso In adult zzso expression of dominant negative zzso resulted in reduced mushroom spine maintenance and synaptic zzso accompanied by an increase in long and thin spines and zzso In contrast, mushroom spine maintenance was unaffected in zzso indicating that zzso plays fundamentally different roles in structural plasticity in these brain zzso
