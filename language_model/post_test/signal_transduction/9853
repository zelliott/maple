The zzso Nerve Growth Factor zzso is essential for the maintenance and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso represent one major zzso population affected and progressively zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso interest has grown for zzso as a potential therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative disorders linked to aging, particularly for zzso However, no evidence was available, to zzso in a zzso manner, deficits in zzso zzso to the broader zzso in the Alzheimer's zzso besides zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso zzso transgenic zzso obtained by the zzso zzso protein knock out strategy, allowed demonstrating a direct zzso link between zzso deprivation and zzso zzso Since then, extensive zzso studies on the zzso model provided a new twist to the concept that zzso in zzso transport and zzso play a crucial role in sporadic Alzheimer's zzso leading to the hypothesis of zzso zzso as an upstream driver for sporadic zzso The results obtained with the zzso zzso mice highlight the fact that the particular mode of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso expressed in the brain, selectively interfering with mature zzso versus zzso zzso plays a major role in the mechanism of zzso and could lead to new insights into the mechanisms of human sporadic zzso Here, we will review zzso the renewed zzso imbalance hypothesis for zzso and zzso the mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative zzso of zzso zzso zzso
