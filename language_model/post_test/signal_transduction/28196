The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso protein is an zzso cell zzso for the outer core zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding leads to zzso bacterial zzso initiation of zzso nuclear zzso cellular zzso and eventual zzso of the infected cells, all of which are critical for innate immune resistance to infection with this zzso Lack of this reaction in zzso patients zzso their zzso to chronic zzso zzso zzso In this study we tested whether these zzso cell responses are dependent upon the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and the zzso raft marker zzso zzso zzso at sites of zzso zzso contact and zzso zzso localized to low density zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso canine kidney zzso cells, and zzso zzso infection increased the levels of zzso in these zzso as determined by Western zzso zzso expressing zzso did not have zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell surface cholesterol via zzso treatment of the cells inhibited zzso entry into zzso In addition, zzso treatment of both human and canine zzso cells inhibited cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso raft zzso of zzso is required for signaling in response to zzso zzso zzso Such signaling is needed for the coordination of innate immunity to zzso zzso lung infection, a process that is defective in zzso
