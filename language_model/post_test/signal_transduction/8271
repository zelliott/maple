Rhythm generation mechanisms are very important for genetic network functions as well as for the design of synthetic genetic zzso A significant attention to date has been focused on the synchronization of zzso genetic units, which results in the production of an unified zzso In contrast to this we address the question: what mechanisms of zzso communication can be responsible for zzso in globally coupled genetic zzso Here, we show that an zzso zzso communication system that provides zzso between synthetic genetic zzso will inherently lead to zzso and the appearance of several zzso zzso zzso if the time evolution of the genetic network can be split in two zzso time zzso We investigate in detail a variety of zzso regimes in a genetic population and show the possibility for multiple element zzso between zzso as well as the possibility of generating complex zzso with different return times in one limit zzso
