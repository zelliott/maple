zzso zzso is a recently described zzso involved in the amplification of inflammatory responses and zzso A hallmark feature of zzso is its ability to induce expression of other zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso with tumor necrosis zzso zzso to zzso expression of many target zzso particularly zzso Despite the many observations of zzso signaling zzso observed to date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that zzso this zzso In the zzso cell line zzso we have found that zzso and zzso exhibit potent zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that at least part of the functional cooperation between zzso and zzso occurs at the level of zzso gene zzso Both the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso sites in the zzso promoter are important for cooperative gene zzso but zzso does not appear to be the direct target of the combined zzso zzso analysis using the zzso mouse zzso chip identified zzso as another gene target of combined zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso family members are known to control zzso we examined whether enhanced zzso expression is involved in the cooperative zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso we show that zzso (or the related zzso factor zzso is essential for expression of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso (and, to a lesser extent, zzso could substitute for the zzso signal at the level of zzso zzso Thus, zzso family members, particularly zzso appear to be important for the functional cooperation between zzso and zzso
