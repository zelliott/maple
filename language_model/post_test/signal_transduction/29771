The zzso gene is a site of mouse zzso zzso virus zzso integration in zzso zzso and zzso protein has been identified independently as a zzso zzso of the zzso translation initiation factor zzso In addition, the protein can interact with two other zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso The role of zzso in zzso is nonetheless currently zzso Here, using zzso zzso we show that zzso is localized in part to the nucleus, while other zzso components are zzso zzso human zzso but not their transformed counterparts, showed reduced nuclear zzso zzso in some cells, and this reduction was zzso in early S zzso This variation in zzso may indicate regulated shuttling between cellular compartments and would be consistent with the presence of a nuclear export signal as well as a nuclear zzso signal in the protein zzso Loss of regulation of zzso zzso may therefore be a significant feature of zzso in human zzso
