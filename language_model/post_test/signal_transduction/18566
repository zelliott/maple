zzso zzso C zzso zzso is an important zzso signaling zzso in primary zzso zzso implicated in acute and chronic inflammatory as well as zzso zzso In behavioral experiments inflammatory zzso produce zzso zzso only in male zzso The mechanism underlying this sexual zzso is zzso We show that the hormone environment of female rats changes the zzso signaling in the peripheral sensory zzso This change is maintained in culture also in the absence of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso leads to zzso zzso in cultured zzso root zzso zzso zzso derived from male but not from female zzso zzso of zzso to male zzso zzso produces a switch to the female zzso namely zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso interferes downstream of the zzso with the signaling zzso leading from exchange protein activated by zzso zzso to zzso The interfering action is fast indicating a zzso zzso zzso has a dual effect on zzso If applied before zzso or zzso zzso zzso abrogates the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso applied alone leads to a brief zzso of zzso Also in zzso the activity of zzso depends on the stimulation zzso In male rats, zzso injection of an zzso zzso or zzso alone zzso mechanical zzso through a zzso zzso In contrast, injection of zzso preceding the zzso of zzso completely abrogates the zzso mechanical zzso Our results suggest that gender differences in zzso do not reflect the use of generally different zzso Instead, a common set of signaling pathways can be modulated by zzso
