Recent studies have identified a role for zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso as an zzso signal for tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso by bone zzso zzso cells, although the features of that zzso zzso have not been zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso synthesis in zzso cells occurs within zzso zzso common zzso zzso cells and that the majority of that activity resides in a component of zzso zzso cells that are not mature T cells, B cells, or zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells defined by expression of zzso zzso zzso using flow zzso were selectively associated with a zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso In zzso culture of zzso cell sorted zzso and zzso cells with zzso amounts of zzso zzso resulted in significantly higher levels of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells compared to zzso cells, with no appreciable change in zzso production from zzso zzso These findings are the first to demonstrate zzso production by zzso zzso cells, and they demonstrate that zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso They also indicate that zzso regulation of zzso zzso within the zzso most likely operates through an intrinsic network of zzso production and use between different types of zzso cells, and they suggest that local zzso may be an important zzso regulator of zzso zzso by zzso
