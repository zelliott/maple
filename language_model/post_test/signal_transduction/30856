zzso targeting of zzso precursor proteins to zzso requires zzso functions of zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso is a major import zzso that recognizes zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a specialized zzso that recognizes zzso inner membrane zzso The zzso domain of zzso appears to function as a zzso in cooperation with zzso but how its zzso specificity differs from that of zzso remains zzso To reveal possible differences in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso if any, we deleted the zzso domain of zzso or zzso in zzso in zzso by introducing zzso sites for a tobacco etch virus zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso segments of zzso and zzso Then zzso without the zzso domain of zzso or zzso were analyzed for their abilities to import various zzso precursor proteins targeted to different zzso zzso in zzso The effects of deletion of the zzso zzso on the import of different zzso proteins for different import pathways were quite similar between zzso and zzso Therefore zzso and zzso are apparently involved in the same step or sequential steps along the same zzso of targeting signal recognition in zzso
