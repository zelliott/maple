Smokers regulate their smoking behavior on the basis of sensory stimuli independently of the pharmacological effects of nicotine zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A better understanding of sensory mechanisms underlying smoking behavior may help to develop more effective smoking zzso zzso stimulation by nicotine makes up a considerable part of the flavor of tobacco smoke, yet our understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for zzso detection of nicotine remains zzso We used zzso methods to characterize the nicotine sensitivity and response mechanisms of zzso from zzso zzso In view of substantial differences in the zzso zzso repertoire between zzso and human zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso we studied zzso human zzso sensory zzso zzso cultured human zzso cells zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso and human zzso responded to zzso with a concentration dependent influx of calcium and zzso of zzso zzso Some rat zzso displayed some zzso with zzso responding to either zzso alone or to zzso Freshly zzso and primary cultured human zzso zzso were less zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the responses of rat or human zzso to zzso zzso clamp recording of rat zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that nicotine activates a zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso receptors on zzso Further, because the zzso mechanisms of zzso appear generally similar to those of humans, this animal model is an appropriate one for studies of nicotine zzso
