The frequency of pancreatic zzso replication declines dramatically with age, potentially contributing to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in old zzso Previous studies have shown the involvement of zzso factors in this phenomenon, particularly the decline of zzso genes and zzso of zzso Here, we demonstrate that a systemic factor found in the circulation of young mice is able to increase the proliferation rate of old pancreatic zzso Old mice zzso to young mice have increased zzso replication compared with zzso old mice or old mice zzso to old zzso In addition, we demonstrate that old zzso transplanted into young recipients have increased replication rate compared with cells transplanted into old zzso conversely, young zzso transplanted into old mice decrease their replication rate compared with young cells transplanted into young zzso The expression of zzso zzso did not change in zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of other zzso We conclude that systemic factors contribute to the zzso decline of old pancreatic zzso
