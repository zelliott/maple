zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are a family of zzso factors which are used by many zzso and cell growth factors for initiating gene zzso They are activated by zzso zzso through the zzso domain of zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso to the nucleus and activate zzso by binding to specific recognition zzso Different zzso activate different zzso of zzso and other signaling zzso We have made use of green zzso protein zzso fusion proteins to zzso the zzso zzso and trafficking of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso stimulation and have zzso in detail zzso trafficking in living zzso Analysis of zzso fusion proteins allowed the determination of time zzso of zzso trafficking in individual living zzso zzso is indistinguishable from its zzso protein displaying strong activity as zzso zzso as well as the same time zzso of transport to the nucleus and retreat to the zzso After prolonged exposure to zzso zzso is no longer retained in the nucleus and relocation to the zzso is zzso zzso with the same type of zzso does not lead to repeated nuclear zzso of zzso zzso is not subject of zzso as zzso with another type of zzso allows immediate zzso of previously activated zzso However, zzso with the same type of zzso can be achieved when the primary stimulus is removed after a short induction zzso This method of visualizing signal zzso reveals a considerable zzso with respect to the extent of zzso shuttling within a zzso cell population, indicating that competence for zzso zzso response is restricted to a cellular zzso whereas other cells respond zzso retarded or not at zzso
