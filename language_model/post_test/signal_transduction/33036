We evaluated zzso pathways responsible for the zzso of the small zzso protein zzso zzso in rat pancreatic zzso zzso zzso were incubated with or without zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and crude zzso were used for Western zzso When a zzso zzso was used, a single band at the location of 21 zzso was zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dose zzso increased the amount of zzso zzso with a peak increase occurring at 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not increase the zzso of the zzso band, suggesting that stimulation of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Although an increase in zzso did not require the presence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso abolished the appearance of the zzso band in response to zzso and zzso The zzso protein inhibitor G protein zzso (10 zzso and the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso markedly reduced zzso bands in response to zzso The protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dose zzso increased the zzso of the zzso band, which were inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso (1 zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso A (6 zzso inhibited the zzso band in response to zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (6 zzso had no zzso zzso was zzso with zzso suggesting association of zzso with zzso zzso in mass of this complex were observed with zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso dose zzso inhibited zzso zzso evoked by a zzso concentration with an zzso of zzso zzso at 1 zzso We concluded that the small zzso protein zzso zzso exists in pancreatic zzso and appears to be involved in the mediation of pancreatic zzso zzso evoked by zzso and zzso zzso pathways are involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso via zzso protein and zzso
