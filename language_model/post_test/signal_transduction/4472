The zzso zzso zzso initiation network zzso regulates zzso zzso is the first zzso in the core zzso we have screened genetically for zzso regulators by zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our screen yielded a zzso in zzso one of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have characterized this gene and its zzso zzso which we have named zzso and zzso zzso We find that zzso is the major form of protein zzso type 2A zzso in zzso zzso A double zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso indicating that the two gene products have at least one essential overlapping zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes are essential for survival only at low zzso The zzso zzso divides at a reduced cell size and displays zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso analysis implicates zzso as an inhibitor of the zzso initiation zzso We also isolated a zzso zzso of zzso the major protein zzso type 2A zzso zzso implicating this zzso as a regulator of the zzso initiation zzso
