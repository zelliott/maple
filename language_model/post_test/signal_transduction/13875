zzso zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso function as the important signaling zzso which promote the lateral root development of zzso zzso In this study, interestingly, application of zzso (the membrane permeable zzso zzso promoted the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the decrease of zzso zzso also inhibited the effect of zzso on the lateral root zzso Thus, zzso maybe act as a downstream signaling of zzso zzso which is involved in the lateral root development of zzso We further found that zzso affected zzso modulating polar zzso zzso When the zzso zzso level was zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso transport and the zzso zzso transport was zzso Moreover, zzso was insensitive for zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso protein plays an important role in zzso and zzso modulating the lateral root development of zzso
