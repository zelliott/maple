Low zzso exercise capacity is a risk factor for diabetes and a strong predictor of zzso yet some individuals are zzso and unable to improve exercise capacity through exercise zzso To test the hypothesis that resistance to zzso exercise training zzso zzso disease risk, we used selective breeding for 15 generations to develop rat models of low and high zzso response to zzso Before exercise training, rats selected as low and high zzso had similar exercise zzso However, after 8 weeks of treadmill training, low zzso failed to improve their exercise capacity, whereas high zzso improved by zzso zzso low zzso to zzso training exhibited pronounced zzso dysfunction characterized by insulin resistance and increased zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso zzso with disease zzso Low zzso had impaired zzso zzso in zzso however, zzso capacity was intact and increased normally with exercise training, demonstrating that zzso are not limiting for zzso adaptation or responsible for zzso dysfunction in low zzso Low zzso had increased zzso signaling and altered transforming growth zzso zzso characterized by zzso of a novel zzso zzso site on zzso Using this powerful biological model system, we have discovered key pathways for low exercise training response that may represent novel targets for the treatment of zzso zzso
