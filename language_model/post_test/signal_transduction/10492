The zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso and plays a central role in zzso and differentiation in the human zzso pathogen zzso zzso but the signals and receptors that trigger this zzso were zzso We identified seven putative proteins that share identity with known G zzso receptors zzso One zzso zzso shares limited sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and also shares structural similarity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced capsule production and mating zzso similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppressed both zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis provides further evidence that zzso functions upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was shown to physically interact with zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane and zzso was found to trigger zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso levels showed that zzso zzso still respond to zzso but not to certain zzso zzso such as zzso zzso acids might serve as zzso for zzso and could contribute to engage the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso acids represents a zzso coincidence detection system shared in other zzso zzso
