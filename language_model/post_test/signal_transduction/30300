It is well known that the zzso growth factor zzso axis is an important regulator of zzso growth and in recent years, it has been suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso may, in part, mediate this effect by promoting proper zzso development and zzso In other zzso zzso effects on zzso proliferation and differentiation are primarily zzso via zzso binding zzso interaction of zzso with the type 1 zzso zzso and therefore here, we review the zzso expression and zzso role, of each of the zzso axis components and discuss the cellular mechanisms through which these effects are zzso
