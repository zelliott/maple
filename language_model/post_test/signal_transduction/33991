This study investigated the possible interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso in zzso gastric zzso and zzso since previous studies have shown that both zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in a large proportion of zzso zzso along the gastrointestinal zzso Neither HO zzso by zzso zzso zzso nor zzso with CO or zzso affected zzso zzso - zzso relaxations induced by zzso zzso zzso nerve stimulation or zzso NO - under normal zzso zzso However, zzso reversed the zzso effect of the zzso generator zzso on zzso zzso relaxations in both zzso When gastric zzso muscle strips were depleted of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso relaxations were also affected by zzso however, zzso could not substitute for the loss of zzso zzso when this specific zzso zzso was zzso In zzso muscle zzso the combination zzso plus zzso nearly abolished zzso zzso activity and, zzso did not allow studying zzso relaxation in these experimental zzso In conclusion, this study does not establish a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso gastric zzso and zzso under normal zzso zzso However, the antioxidants zzso might play an important role in the protection of the zzso neurotransmitter against zzso zzso
