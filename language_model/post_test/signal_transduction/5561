zzso biology, the science of engineering complex biological systems with novel functions, is increasingly fascinating researchers across disciplines who gather to design functional biological zzso in a rational and systematic zzso Although initial success stories were based on zzso zzso and lower zzso cells, the design of synthetic zzso gene circuits is becoming increasingly popular because it promises to foster novel therapeutic opportunities in the zzso zzso Here, we discuss the latest generation of zzso synthetic biology devices assembled to form complex synthetic gene networks, such as regulatory zzso logic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug discovery tools, and zzso zzso zzso We further highlight how such circuits could be interconnected to achieve zzso control networks such as synthetic zzso communication systems in animals or synthetic zzso with dynamic zzso zzso
