zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso in human colon zzso Studies have suggested a potential link between zzso and zzso in zzso however, the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso dissemination in human colon cancer is not well zzso Thus, we aimed to determine whether zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso in human colon zzso 

zzso interference technology was employed to detect effect of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso in zzso human colon cancer zzso We also evaluated the ability of zzso short hairpin zzso to inhibit zzso production and zzso invasion in a zzso mouse model by using zzso zzso imaging and gelatin zzso 

We found that zzso short hairpin zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso significantly limited the production of zzso and colon cancer zzso in a zzso mouse zzso Mice that received zzso cells had progressively enlarging zzso and more zzso zzso and these animals did not survive as long as mice that received zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso may be useful targets for the treatment of zzso zzso in colon zzso
