zzso of the innate and acquired immune systems plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases and conditions such as zzso insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso with additional roles in regulation of cell proliferation and zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso can respond to zzso signals and induce loss of zzso mass through induction of zzso cycle zzso zzso of zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso was shown to trigger the decline of zzso zzso protein levels in pancreatic zzso lines, which could be reversed by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was also found to interfere with this degradation which may be associated with zzso cycle zzso Moreover, zzso effects of zzso on zzso growth were supported by gene zzso of zzso which could inhibit zzso activity in response to zzso zzso zzso These results support a role for zzso in zzso mass loss in zzso surplus and raise the possibility that zzso signaling may be involved in zzso phase cycle arrest through zzso degradation of zzso zzso
