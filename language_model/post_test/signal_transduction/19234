zzso acid zzso is the major active compound of zzso a zzso or orange zzso exuded from zzso zzso tree in Southeast zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso exhibits potent zzso effects by inducing cell cycle arrest or zzso in many types of cancer cell lines and blocking zzso via zzso of vascular zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso are critical steps in the progress of zzso and zzso after zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso has an zzso effect on the proliferation and migration of zzso and its possible zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso on the proliferation induced by zzso and zzso was measured by using Cell number counting zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the cell cycle progression and viability zzso by zzso and zzso were also analyzed by flow zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the migration zzso by zzso was measured by zzso chamber zzso The effect of zzso on the Cell cycle regulatory molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its downstream signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by western zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso activity was measured by using zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and the capacity of zzso binding with zzso and zzso were also zzso 

We found that zzso significantly inhibited zzso migration and DNA synthesis in primary cultured rat zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after stimulation of 50 zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso induced zzso phase arrest in the cell cycle progression of zzso No obvious necrosis or zzso was found with zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso cell cycle regulatory zzso were significantly suppressed by zzso treatment in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the activities of downstream zzso signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also inhibited by zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso through zzso the activity of zzso directly, rather than indirectly via binding zzso 

The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso proliferation and migration may be zzso through multiple signal pathways controlled by zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso
