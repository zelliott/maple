Human zzso zzso are widespread pathogens involved in zzso diseases, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular zzso During evolution, zzso of human zzso receptors were integrated into the zzso zzso In addition to binding zzso zzso these viral G zzso receptors zzso have acquired the ability to signal in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso signaling properties of zzso modify the functions of the expressing cells and lead to transformation and escape from immune zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso with zzso zzso receptors represent other ways for zzso to modify zzso signaling and cellular zzso As such, these viral receptors seem to play a prominent role during viral zzso and life cycle and thus represent innovative zzso zzso
