zzso the regulation of human gene expression requires knowledge of the zzso genetic zzso which consists of the binding zzso of zzso factors zzso and the zzso code by which zzso binding sites are assembled to form zzso zzso zzso Using a novel zzso method, we determined the DNA binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which mediate zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso To identify zzso zzso elements regulated by these pathways on a zzso scale, we developed a zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso We show that zzso can be used to identify zzso and zzso target genes and to predict activated zzso based on changes in gene zzso zzso validated in transgenic mouse zzso revealed the presence of multiple zzso enhancers in mouse zzso and zzso zzso which has implications for zzso growth control and zzso specificity of zzso
