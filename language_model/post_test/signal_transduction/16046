Our previous study showed that zzso with zzso zzso led to protection against hypoxic injury via a zzso zzso in zzso Whether the protection of zzso against zzso is effective in zzso is zzso The present study is aimed to verify the role of zzso in acute zzso zzso using zzso mice as an in zzso model and further investigate the underlying zzso Mice zzso with or without zzso for 1 h were exposed to acute zzso hypoxic condition for 6 h and then the survival time, the survival rate, the zzso of zzso barrier zzso the zzso analysis in zzso and cortex, and the zzso level of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The results showed that zzso significantly increased the survival time and the survival rate of zzso zzso zzso with zzso markedly attenuated acute zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the cellular damage extent of the zzso and the zzso induced by zzso for 6 h was also attenuated by zzso with zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso rather than zzso and zzso was involved in the protection of zzso against acute zzso zzso In zzso zzso enhanced the survival capability of mice and decreased acute hypoxic damage to the brain, which may be associated with the effects on zzso and zzso
