zzso cells are instrumental in innate immune responses, in particular for the early production of gamma zzso zzso and other zzso necessary to control certain zzso zzso and viral zzso zzso zzso zzso functions are controlled by a fine balance between distinct receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, little is known about zzso receptors on zzso cells and their corresponding zzso Several studies have shown that zzso zzso isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract activate human zzso cells and are potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso cell zzso was shown for zzso zzso zzso In this study the cellular mechanisms of in zzso zzso cell zzso by zzso bacteria were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells, including expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso required cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso retained their capacity to induce zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso completely failed to induce zzso cell zzso unless bacteria were zzso This suggests that zzso of bacteria provided additional zzso signals on accessory cells that may differ from those induced by tumor necrosis factor and zzso zzso of zzso molecules by zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function of zzso zzso Our data suggest an important role for accessory zzso signals in the process of zzso cell zzso by zzso zzso
