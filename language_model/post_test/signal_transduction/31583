zzso is a zzso zzso capable of generating zzso that release zzso from zzso stores, including zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso A number of studies have led to the controversial proposal that zzso mediates an alternate zzso for zzso insulin release and contributes to the zzso of zzso It has recently been shown that zzso mediates zzso zzso by insulin in human pancreatic zzso In the present study, we report altered zzso zzso and reduced responsiveness to insulin, but not zzso in zzso zzso In keeping with the zzso role of insulin zzso zzso zzso were significantly more susceptible to zzso compared with zzso isolated from zzso zzso This finding correlated with disrupted zzso architecture and reduced zzso mass in zzso mice, both in the context of a normal lab diet and a high-fat zzso Nevertheless, we did not find robust differences in zzso zzso in zzso or zzso signaling in zzso in zzso mice on the zzso genetic background, in contrast to previous studies by others of zzso knockout mice on the zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso plays a role in novel zzso signaling pathways but does not directly control zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso
