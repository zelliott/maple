zzso protein zzso zzso has been identified as a regulator of gene transcription, increasing zzso proteins of zzso metabolism as well as zzso expression in skeletal zzso In mice, zzso knockout of zzso a component of the upstream zzso of zzso prevents zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in skeletal muscle, and the increase in zzso II protein that is normally observed with chronic zzso zzso of zzso Since previous reports show a zzso response element in the promoter region of the zzso II zzso we hypothesized that the zzso element zzso binding protein zzso family of zzso factors could be targets of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso and rat liver and muscle zzso zzso zzso at the same site as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was also found to zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso but not zzso Treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso reporter with zzso increased zzso activity approximately zzso over a zzso time zzso This increase was blocked with compound C, an zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso in incubated rat zzso muscles resulted in an increase in both zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso and related proteins are direct downstream targets for zzso and are therefore likely involved in zzso some effects of zzso on expression of genes having a zzso in their zzso
