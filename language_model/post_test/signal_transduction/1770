A large response range can be observed in both behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to environmental zzso This variation can arise from central mechanisms such as those involved in the shaping of general response tendencies zzso or involves only one or the other output system zzso zzso zzso zzso The participation of genetic factors in this zzso is demonstrated by family and twin studies in humans, the comparison of zzso strains and selection experiments in zzso Those zzso strains zzso for specific traits of stress zzso are invaluable tools for the study of the molecular bases of this genetic zzso Until recently, it was only possible to study biological differences between contrasting zzso such as neurotransmitter pathways in the brain or hormone zzso properties, in order to suggest structural differences in candidate zzso The increase of the power of molecular biology tools allows the systematic screening of significant genes for the search of molecular zzso More recently, it was possible to search for genes without any preliminary functional hypothesis zzso differential zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The approach known as quantitative trait zzso zzso analysis is based on the association between zzso anonymous markers and the zzso value of the trait under study in a segregating population (such as zzso or zzso It allows the location of zzso regions involved in trait zzso and ultimately the identification of the zzso zzso zzso in a first step, those studies skip the zzso zzso of intermediate mechanisms, but the knowledge of the zzso responsible for trait zzso will point out to the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso Since variations in stress-related responses may be related to numerous pathological conditions such as behavioral and mood disorders, drug abuse, cardiovascular diseases or zzso and production traits in farm animals, these studies can be expected to bring significant knowledge for new therapeutic approaches in humans and improved efficiency of selection in farm zzso
