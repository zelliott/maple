zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso for growth factors of the zzso zzso zzso cells express a zzso and a soluble zzso of this zzso the latter being mainly considered as a negative regulator of zzso zzso We previously reported that the soluble form is deposited in the zzso zzso produced by zzso cells in culture and is able to promote cell zzso and migration through binding to zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso domain II of zzso which contains the binding zzso for the growth factors, is involved in the interaction with zzso zzso To identify domain regions involved in zzso zzso we designed 12 peptides zzso mimicking the domain II surface and tested their ability to inhibit zzso zzso cell zzso to soluble zzso and directly support cell zzso One zzso endowed with both these properties was identified and shown to inhibit zzso cell migration toward soluble zzso as zzso This zzso directly binds zzso zzso but not zzso inducing zzso cell zzso formation in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso scanning zzso of the zzso defined which zzso were responsible for its zzso activity and zzso zzso
