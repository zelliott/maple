zzso zzso is zzso by different types of cells and acts by binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In this study, the expression and functional role of zzso and its signaling components were investigated in pancreatic zzso zzso By zzso median zzso levels of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso higher, respectively, in zzso zzso compared to normal pancreatic zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were expressed in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso serum levels were significantly increased in zzso patients compared to healthy controls and chronic zzso zzso patients, with an area under the zzso curve of zzso and zzso zzso At a zzso level of zzso zzso the specificity of zzso to differentiate zzso from controls and zzso patients was zzso and zzso with a sensitivity of 80 and zzso All 5 evaluated pancreatic cancer cells lines expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was expressed in only zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso was strongly induced by zzso and significantly increased zzso in zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso in zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso In addition, zzso slightly zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso in zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso is induced by zzso and zzso in zzso and might therefore serve as a potential tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso increases zzso of some pancreatic cancer cells and might influence zzso suggesting that blocking this zzso might have a therapeutic zzso
