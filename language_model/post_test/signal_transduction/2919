The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso channel that releases zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and plays a variety of roles in cell zzso This zzso was discovered as a zzso regulated zzso known as zzso which was absent in zzso zzso zzso The zzso has three different zzso in zzso and each zzso is composed of different zzso The affinities of the zzso core of the three zzso of the zzso for zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso region of each zzso is responsible for its zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso core leads to a zzso change, resulting in direct interactions of zzso (in zzso (in zzso and 3) in the zzso zzso region with the loop region of zzso zzso The zzso region and zzso zzso which associate with nearly 20 signaling molecules are located at the areas near the channel zzso The area including zzso region and zzso portion are regarded as hot spots for the regulating opening and closing of the channel zzso A zzso of the zzso known as zzso zzso binding protein released with zzso zzso that interacts with the zzso core domain of the zzso was zzso zzso not only regulates zzso release by binding to the zzso core domain but also regulates the zzso balance by binding to various zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most of the associated proteins bind to these areas and regulate zzso channel zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso structure, which has vacancy inside the zzso with zzso surface zzso The unique zzso structure of the zzso is convenient for zzso with many zzso zzso zzso the zzso serves as a signaling zzso which forms zzso complex with various zzso
