zzso through the zzso growth factor family zzso of zzso is essential for normal zzso embryonic zzso At a cellular level, many details of the molecular basis of the signal zzso process have been uncovered, but our knowledge of the identity of the downstream zzso of the zzso signal in the developing zzso remains zzso We have used two independent approaches to begin to identify downstream targets of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a gene trap approach and zzso zzso zzso using mouse embryonic stem zzso cells as a cellular system representative of an early window on the developing zzso Both approaches led to the identification of a number of targets of zzso zzso and we provide data to show that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response protein zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all zzso regulated following zzso zzso Independent gene zzso of zzso previously indicated a role for the gene in zzso zzso 126 (1999) zzso and we present transcript data implicating a number of the newly isolated zzso target genes in different embryonic zzso
