zzso beta zzso peptides are related to the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso The search for therapeutic strategies that lower these peptides has mainly focused on the zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso factor specificity protein 1 zzso is vital for the regulation of several genes involved in zzso including zzso and the beta site zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso We have previously reported that zzso acid promotes the degradation of zzso protein zzso in pancreatic human cancer cells and mice zzso This study examines the ability of zzso acid to reduce zzso levels, and thereby decrease zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso acid was administered by oral zzso to zzso mice at variable zzso and for different time zzso zzso have shown that zzso acid was able to down regulate brain protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso These findings demonstrate that interference with upstream zzso pathways can lower zzso zzso associated with zzso and thus zzso acid represents a novel approach for the development of a therapeutic intervention for zzso
