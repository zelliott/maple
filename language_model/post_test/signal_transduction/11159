The zzso factor of activated zzso zzso signal zzso zzso regulates the expression of a plethora of genes in the zzso zzso calcium overloading occurs in zzso zzso zzso and this fulfills the condition needed for zzso of this zzso We therefore investigated the zzso zzso in zzso tissue in a zzso model of zzso 

zzso was induced in eight adult pigs by rapid zzso zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso were performed on zzso left zzso tissue obtained 6 weeks after zzso of the zzso zzso for 4 weeks, and zzso without pacing for 2 zzso In the zzso group, the left zzso dimension increased significantly zzso zzso 4 zzso vs 31 zzso 4 zzso respectively, p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased significantly in pigs with zzso zzso zzso 8) when compared to control pigs zzso zzso 6) zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso released, p zzso zzso We found that both zzso and zzso the downstream zzso of zzso increased significantly in the zzso in zzso tissue using zzso zzso of zzso and zzso into the zzso was also demonstrated in zzso tissue zzso using zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso further demonstrated that nuclear extracts from zzso tissue had a significantly larger binding capacity for zzso zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso activity was increased in zzso with subsequent zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of this signal zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
