Mouse zzso zzso zzso cells undergo zzso in response to high density and zzso We have derived a zzso zzso that zzso zzso in response to high density, but without requiring exposure to zzso The new zzso retains the capacity to differentiate into skeletal muscle and zzso cells in response to zzso and zzso zzso However, upon zzso these Oct zzso cells, termed zzso because they zzso cardiac muscle, exhibit increased zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso cardiac zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso 4, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso 4, a known zzso of zzso zzso zzso as determined by rhythmic beating and zzso zzso However, zzso is severely inhibited when zzso cells are zzso in the presence of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso interaction is required before zzso cells can undergo a zzso response to zzso zzso A concurrent increase in the expression of zzso suggests one possible process underlying the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso cells offers an opportunity to explore new aspects of cardiac zzso
