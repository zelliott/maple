The zzso zzso zzso motif zzso plays a central role in zzso signal zzso in zzso cells by zzso responses leading to proliferation and zzso An initial signaling event following zzso of the B cell zzso zzso is zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso a zzso family zzso zzso To zzso the structural basis for recognition between the zzso zzso and activated Lyn zzso the structure of an zzso zzso bound to Lyn was determined using zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso The bound zzso structure has an irregular zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso data into the active site of the closely related zzso zzso strongly favors zzso binding in an orientation similar to binding of zzso zzso protein zzso rather than that of insulin zzso zzso zzso The model of the complex provides a rationale for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggests that zzso binds only the active zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso unlike the zzso zzso which can bind the inactive zzso
