The zzso proteins zzso and zzso are associated with an zzso dominant disorder known as zzso sclerosis complex zzso zzso and zzso function as a zzso to inhibit cell growth and zzso Another zzso zzso zzso target of zzso is regarded as a central controller of cell growth in response to growth factors, cellular energy and zzso zzso Recent breakthroughs in zzso research link the zzso zzso protein to the zzso signaling zzso It has recently been shown that zzso has zzso protein zzso activity towards the Ras family small zzso zzso zzso zzso enriched in zzso and zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso via stimulation of zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso and zzso have pivotal roles in zzso growth factors, zzso and energy sensing signals to zzso zzso These discoveries lend new insight into zzso zzso
