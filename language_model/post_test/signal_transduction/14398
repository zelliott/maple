A mathematical model of zzso cell calcium zzso and zzso oxide synthesis under flow conditions is zzso The model is coupled to two important environmental stimuli for zzso zzso the zzso zzso stress exerted on the cell membrane by the blood zzso and the binding of zzso zzso in the zzso to cell surface zzso These stimuli are closely linked to zzso flow conditions and are, in general, zzso zzso allowing the cellular response in different regions of the zzso to be zzso This is used to indicate which areas of the artery wall experience reduced zzso of zzso oxide, which is a major factor in the onset of zzso The model thus directly addresses the key issue of the zzso zzso and its underlying zzso mechanisms, between zzso of zzso and regions of low wall zzso stress zzso Model results show that zzso levels of free calcium and zzso zzso oxide zzso are lower in zzso cells adjacent to a region of zzso flow than in cells adjacent to regions of fully developed zzso zzso This will lead to deficient levels of zzso oxide in the zzso zone and hence a potentially elevated risk of developing zzso zzso This is consistent with the observed spatial correlation between zzso and regions of disturbed blood flow and low zzso and provides a mechanism for the zzso of the disease to sites such as zzso zzso and zzso
