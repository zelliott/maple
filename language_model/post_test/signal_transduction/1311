In response to zzso zzso zzso stress, cells launch zzso and protective responses, but can also activate cell death zzso A 54 zzso integral zzso membrane protein called zzso was identified as a zzso protein in zzso zzso We report that zzso is present in zzso in the developing and adult brain, and that it is regulated in zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso stress increase zzso levels, whereas higher doses decrease zzso levels and induce zzso The decrease in zzso protein levels following a lethal zzso stress occurs prior to zzso dysfunction and cell death, and is zzso by zzso which generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site in zzso enhances its zzso function during zzso zzso While suppression of zzso induction by zzso interference zzso neural cells to zzso induced by zzso stress, zzso of zzso promotes survival by a mechanism involving stabilization of zzso zzso levels, preservation of zzso function and suppression of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 12 are reduced by zzso whereas induction of major zzso zzso is zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso overload under conditions of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso release is attenuated by zzso suggesting a role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso By stabilizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions, zzso serves a zzso function under conditions of zzso zzso
