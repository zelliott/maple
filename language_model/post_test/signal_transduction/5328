The analysis of zzso signaling was greatly enhanced by the advent of gene zzso which allows the selective zzso of a single zzso Although this gene zzso approach is often zzso in many cases, the zzso resulting from gene zzso might not provide a complete picture of the function of the corresponding zzso If a protein has multiple functions within a single or several signaling zzso or zzso other proteins in a complex, the zzso consequences of a gene knockout may manifest as a combination of several different zzso In these cases, gene targeting to zzso zzso subtle point zzso might provide more accurate insight into protein zzso However, to be zzso such zzso must be carefully based on structural and zzso zzso
