The zzso growth factor 20 zzso and zzso zzso B zzso genes are associated with Parkinson Disease zzso risk and both are in the zzso zzso zzso we investigated the joint effect between zzso in the zzso and zzso genes for evidence of interaction contributing to zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso for zzso six for zzso were zzso in zzso families and analyzed using conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were found in females between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The risk zzso for each zzso identified from zzso zzso C, zzso T and zzso A, are consistent with previous zzso Using indicator variables for the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso AA showed significant interaction zzso zzso zzso compared with the reference group zzso zzso with zzso zzso Using an zzso model for the risk zzso zzso and zzso showed significant interaction zzso zzso zzso We found similar interaction results between zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso in zzso and zzso show evidence of statistical zzso which emphasizes the importance of considering them jointly in genetic analysis of zzso and illustrates potential patterns of biological interaction contributing to zzso zzso
