zzso signaling is an zzso zzso pathway, which is fundamental for zzso development and zzso In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this zzso beyond embryonic development, indicating that zzso also displays a critical function in the mature brain of zzso and zzso This zzso appears to be involved in neural zzso regulation, zzso zzso synaptic plasticity and zzso In addition, zzso appears to be zzso regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms by which zzso displays these functions in the mature brain are not fully zzso but are currently the subject of intense zzso In this review, we will discuss old and novel zzso targets and molecular zzso that contribute to zzso function in the mature brain and will zzso recent findings that explore the two zzso of zzso signaling in brain physiology and zzso
