In zzso fibrosis, the zzso of the zzso protein causes reduced zzso zzso zzso As recently proposed, beside its role of zzso channel, zzso may regulate the activity of other channels such as a zzso zzso zzso Using a calcium imaging system, we show, in zzso infected Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso that zzso can act as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso exposure to zzso or zzso produced an increase in zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso infected with an zzso zzso or infected with an zzso zzso The transient zzso increase produced by zzso or zzso could be zzso by zzso of zzso with zzso (20 zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso had no significant effect on zzso in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso response to zzso in zzso infected zzso Taken together, our experiments provide evidence for zzso zzso by zzso released from the cell and regulation of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso
