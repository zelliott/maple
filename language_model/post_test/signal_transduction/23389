zzso zzso zzso is frequently elevated in a variety of human zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in stem cell maintenance and its zzso zzso has been shown in several types of cancer including lung zzso Here, we show, for the first time, that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso in lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso We found that zzso protein level was reduced after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was demonstrated after the zzso of zzso in lung cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso led to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso forced zzso of zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso led to a reduced proportion of zzso zzso cell zzso Thus, we report that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently reduces a cancer zzso cell population in human lung cancer zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso may be beneficial to the lung cancer patients with activated zzso zzso
