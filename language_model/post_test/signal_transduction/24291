zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in obesity both in humans and zzso demonstrating a crucial role for zzso zzso in the regulation of energy zzso Because even zzso of the zzso gene can cause obesity in humans and mice, subtle changes in zzso numbers or signaling are likely to impact upon the regulation of food intake and energy zzso Little is known about the zzso regulation of zzso zzso Using zzso cells, we show for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso zzso We then addressed the possible mechanisms underlying the zzso using zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso human zzso zzso of zzso cells that express zzso zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso hormone, resulted in impaired zzso formation to a second challenge of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells, which was partly inhibited by zzso with a specific protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partly inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso whereas it did not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso and zzso in the zzso tail are potential sites for zzso and zzso zzso and may play an essential role in the recruitment of zzso to the activated zzso Our data demonstrate that, through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso thereby providing novel insights into the regulation of zzso zzso
