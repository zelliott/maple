The regulation of systemic and local zzso zzso is crucial to the clearance of infections and the successful resolution of inflammation without progress to tissue damage or zzso inflammatory zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and highly zzso zzso we have previously shown that zzso zzso 4 signaling is a potent zzso zzso but a poor zzso of zzso In the presence of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso however, zzso becomes a potent zzso survival zzso zzso zzso has been identified as an important zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is produced in abundance by zzso zzso We now show that zzso fails to activate highly zzso zzso or enhance their survival, but in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso might become responsive to zzso but were unable to demonstrate zzso Moreover, zzso failed to prevent zzso + zzso zzso zzso In studies of zzso mice, we found that zzso was still able to mediate zzso survival, and zzso survival was enhanced by the addition of zzso zzso Thus an important paradigm of zzso regulation needs to be viewed in the context of a cellular network in which actions of zzso on zzso are indirect and zzso by other zzso
