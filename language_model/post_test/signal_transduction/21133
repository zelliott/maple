zzso formation in zzso is initiated by zzso of an zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso High zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso however, this overabundance of transcripts appears to be not sufficient for manifestation of the full zzso potential of zzso In addition, several zzso acid exchanges cause the zzso zzso to be highly active, resulting in a strong zzso zzso even without growth factor zzso Besides the zzso itself a zzso signal zzso seems to be a critical part of the transformation zzso zzso experiments in transgenic fish indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is contributing to the zzso specificity in development of zzso melanoma in zzso
