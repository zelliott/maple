zzso growth factor 10 zzso signaling through zzso zzso 2 zzso is required for lung zzso While studies indicate that zzso and zzso are also important at later stages of lung development, their roles in early branching events remain zzso We addressed this question through conditional zzso of both genes in mouse subsequent to lung zzso zzso of zzso in lung zzso resulted in smaller zzso with a reduced number of zzso zzso of zzso in lung zzso resulted in disruption of zzso and small zzso zzso that arose arbitrarily along the main zzso In both zzso there was an increase in cell zzso Also, the expression patterns of key signaling molecules implicated in branching zzso were altered and a zzso lung marker was expanded zzso Our results indicate that both zzso and zzso are required for a normal branching program and for proper zzso patterning of the zzso
