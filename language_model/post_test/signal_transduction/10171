Resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Dijon zzso is zzso by the resistance gene zzso and a zzso locus zzso In zzso zzso elicits a hypersensitive response zzso which is accompanied by increased expression of zzso zzso genes and high levels of salicylic acid zzso We have previously shown that zzso resistance to zzso is dependent on zzso signal zzso and that increased levels of zzso zzso enhanced resistance to zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and resistance are dependent on zzso A dark treatment immediately following zzso zzso suppressed HR, resistance and zzso of the majority of the zzso zzso However, the absence of light did not affect either zzso elevated levels of free zzso or the expression of zzso Interestingly, in the dark, transgenic plants zzso zzso showed zzso but zzso of zzso coupled with high levels of zzso zzso resulted in pronounced zzso zzso with these results is the finding that zzso application of zzso prior to zzso zzso partially overcame the requirement for zzso Light was also required for N zzso zzso and resistance to zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it is an important factor which may be generally required during defense zzso
