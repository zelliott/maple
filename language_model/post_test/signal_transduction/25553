The zzso zzso plays a key role in liver development, zzso and zzso Among human zzso tightly linked to abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso presents with the highest rate zzso of zzso zzso HB is the most common zzso tumor of the liver in zzso This embryonic tumor differs from zzso zzso by the absence of viral zzso and underlying liver disease, and by distinctive zzso patterns evoking zzso the zzso precursors of zzso and zzso Recent studies of the molecular zzso of zzso have led to identify two major tumor zzso resembling early and late zzso of prenatal liver development and presenting distinctive zzso zzso It has been shown that the molecular signature of zzso signaling in zzso is mainly imposed by liver context, but differs according to zzso zzso Finally, the differentiation stage of tumor cells strongly influences their invasive and zzso properties, therefore affecting clinical zzso
