zzso is a key zzso of zzso signaling that regulates cell fate determination in various zzso To investigate the function of zzso in mature B cell zzso we generated mice that selectively lacked B cell zzso expression using conditional zzso zzso of zzso led to the loss of marginal zone B zzso cells with a zzso increase in zzso B zzso in contrast, B1 cells in the zzso cavity were zzso Lack of zzso caused no defects in B cells zzso survival, plasma cell differentiation or zzso It is therefore likely that zzso signaling regulates the lineage commitment of mature B cells into zzso versus zzso zzso In addition, in mice with zzso B cells, had no obvious changes in zzso production in response to zzso zzso or chicken zzso In contrast, these mice exhibited increased mortality rates after zzso bacterial infection, which indicates that zzso cells play pivotal roles in the clearance of these zzso
