zzso synaptic connections often involves the zzso withdrawal of zzso zzso We describe an in zzso role for temporally patterned electrical activity, zzso calcium channels, and zzso in modulating the response of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso during synaptic zzso zzso affecting the zzso zzso the zzso B zzso zzso the zzso zzso calcium channel zzso or the zzso zzso sodium channel zzso each result in zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts genetically with both of the channel zzso The zzso zzso is enhanced by the zzso zzso and is suppressed by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso bouts of electrical activity in the zzso The zzso suppression of zzso contacts also depends on the downstream zzso of zzso These results indicate a role for patterned electrical activity and zzso calcium zzso acting through zzso in modulating a retrograde signal during the refinement of synaptic zzso
