zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and has been shown to contribute to multiple steps in the zzso of lung zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso the expression of zzso a cell zzso zzso which has been implicated in cell migration, in lowly invasive zzso lung cancer cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis and promoter activity zzso suggested that zzso directly zzso zzso gene zzso Block of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso attenuated zzso increase of zzso We also found that zzso activated zzso zzso downstream zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso However, only zzso signaling zzso inhibitor zzso but not zzso signaling zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed the induction of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso by zzso increased adhesive and invasive abilities of zzso cells which could be effectively inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso to promote zzso of lung cancer zzso
