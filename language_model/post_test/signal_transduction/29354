The role of zzso zzso C zzso signaling in the zzso zzso volume regulation in zzso root cells of zzso zzso was zzso At the onset of zzso stress, zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso blocked zzso zzso formation in zzso cells and their zzso volume regulatory zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso formation and zzso volume regulation were not zzso In these cells the zzso zzso is zzso as zzso sequesters the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These phenomena were unaffected by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso production via the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso but zzso which zzso zzso triggered zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso formation and inhibited the mechanism regulating the volume of the zzso zzso zzso partly relieved some of the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso turnover via zzso assists zzso formation and zzso of the mechanism regulating the zzso zzso zzso and the massive disorganization of zzso that is carried out at the onset of zzso treatment triggers the zzso of this zzso
