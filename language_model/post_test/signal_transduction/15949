Early zzso acid zzso zzso synaptic transmission and correlated zzso activity are fundamental to network zzso however, their regulation during early zzso development is poorly zzso zzso oxide zzso is an important retrograde zzso at zzso zzso and it was recently shown to play an important role also at zzso zzso in the adult zzso The zzso zzso and network effect of this signaling zzso during early development are so far zzso but its disruption at this early age is known to lead to profound zzso and functional zzso Here, we provide functional zzso zzso zzso NO signaling zzso not only zzso but also zzso synaptic transmission in the mouse zzso during the early zzso zzso We identified the precise zzso zzso of key elements of the underlying molecular cascade using zzso at the zzso electron microscopic zzso As predicted by these zzso data, zzso calcium imaging in acute slices revealed that this zzso machinery is involved also in the control of zzso network activity zzso We suggest that the retrograde zzso system is zzso suited to fulfill a general zzso regulatory role and may effectively fine-tune network activity during early zzso development, while zzso transmission is still zzso
