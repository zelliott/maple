Although the zzso model for T cell zzso states that a zzso through the zzso and a zzso zzso are required for optimal zzso it is now clear that the requirement for zzso can be zzso under certain zzso We previously reported that this is the case for zzso zzso T cells in zzso In the present study we tested the effect of zzso when delivered after zzso has been zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso transgenic mice were zzso in zzso by using immobilized zzso zzso zzso molecules alone as zzso This signal was then stopped after different lengths of time, and zzso zzso as zzso was given either immediately or after a time zzso We found that zzso can zzso a short zzso when added zzso Moreover, a time lag between the two signals does not abolish this zzso If the strength of zzso but not its zzso is increased, then the time lag between the delivery of signals 1 and 2 can be zzso without loss of zzso Together, our results indicate that the two signals do not need to be delivered zzso to get optimal T cell zzso We suggest that the zzso T cells can reach a transient zzso state after being zzso with zzso alone, characterized by the cell's ability to respond to separate and delayed zzso
