zzso domain containing 6 zzso zzso the zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso The zzso repeats of zzso protein zzso recognizes zzso zzso at zzso zzso to zzso is zzso a known zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso as well as binding of zzso by zzso The structure of zzso in complex with zzso zzso containing the zzso site, in the presence of zzso reveals a zzso protein structure and suggests a model for zzso binding to zzso In addition, structural modeling of the zzso zzso repeats bound to zzso zzso provides insight into the molecular basis for zzso of zzso binding by zzso zzso Together, these findings provide a structural explanation for a key cellular signaling zzso centered on zzso zzso zzso which is generated by zzso and recognized by zzso and incorporate a zzso switch of adjacent zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso is structurally similar to the zzso large zzso zzso Given the restriction of zzso to plant species, this particular appearance of the protein zzso zzso has been zzso well zzso
