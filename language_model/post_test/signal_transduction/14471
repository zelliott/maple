zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso brain development are well zzso Their involvement in the zzso of zzso synaptic structure and physiology is also zzso However, less is known of their effects on brain development and their function in adult zzso nervous zzso Here, we report on the characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and their role in learning and zzso In zzso zzso for zzso expression showed a uniform distribution of expression of both genes across the developing zzso and adult zzso However, in zzso labeling with zzso fusion proteins indicated that the zzso and zzso proteins were zzso localized to cell body regions in the mushroom bodies and the developing zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso In adults, zzso protein was localized to regions of synaptic contacts in zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso lobe of the mushroom zzso The latter two regions are involved in zzso learning and memory in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins into the brains of adult zzso 1 h before zzso conditioning of the zzso extension zzso significantly reduced memory 24 h zzso Experimental zzso in the group injected with zzso was apparent 1 h zzso Experimental zzso was also induced by zzso injections with zzso suggesting a role in zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso molecules function to regulate the formation of memory in zzso
