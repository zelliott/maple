zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds protect zzso from zzso zzso At least part of the zzso action of zzso lies in induction of zzso zzso which, along with other phase II zzso serve as a defense system against zzso zzso Here, we found that, by using fluorescent tags and zzso zzso zzso are taken up zzso into zzso and bind in a zzso manner to zzso a negative regulator of the zzso factor zzso By binding to zzso zzso prevent zzso zzso of zzso and, thus, enhance zzso zzso into the nucleus of cultured zzso zzso In turn, zzso binds to zzso elements of the zzso promoter to induce zzso zzso zzso with this notion, zzso induction of an zzso reporter construct is prevented if the zzso elements are zzso We show that zzso are zzso both in zzso from zzso zzso and in zzso in a model of cerebral zzso injury zzso Our results suggest that zzso prevent zzso by zzso the zzso zzso Because zzso accumulate zzso in zzso they may provide a category of zzso compounds, distinct from other zzso compounds such as zzso which activates the zzso element in zzso zzso thus represent a therapeutic approach for stroke and neurodegenerative zzso
