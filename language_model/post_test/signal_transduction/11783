zzso of temperature, contraction frequency, and zzso pressure on zzso zzso release were investigated in isolated rat hearts zzso in zzso or working zzso A reduction of temperature from 37 C to 27 degrees C caused a decrease of zzso release by zzso indicating its marked zzso zzso zzso zzso An increase of zzso contraction frequency from 300 to zzso in zzso hearts did not cause a significant change in the zzso zzso An zzso of left zzso filling pressure of working hearts from 8 to 18 and 28 zzso was associated with zzso and zzso increase of the zzso zzso This zzso release of zzso was inhibited in a low calcium zzso zzso medium or by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso or zzso zzso had similar zzso action against the zzso increase of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is primarily regulated by mechanical stretch or zzso of the zzso wall, while the zzso contraction frequency is less important as a zzso stimulus for the zzso The zzso zzso zzso may require an influx of calcium through the zzso zzso zzso It was also suggested that zzso release from the zzso zzso leading to an zzso of zzso zzso may be included in the zzso processes of zzso release by mechanical zzso
