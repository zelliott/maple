B cell tolerance can be maintained by functional zzso or zzso wherein B cell zzso receptors zzso remain capable of binding zzso but are unable to zzso zzso Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso are unknown, some models of B cell zzso are characterized by disruption of zzso zzso signaling events, and by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is manifest by a reduced ability to zzso membrane zzso with the zzso zzso zzso To begin to explore the possibility that zzso is the consequence of zzso zzso we analyzed a panel of B zzso zzso expressing constant amounts of zzso zzso receptors and varied amounts of a zzso with identical zzso but bearing zzso that render it incapable of interacting with zzso This analysis revealed that zzso of zzso receptors prevented zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso by competent zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Data indicate that zzso of zzso receptors (as few as approximately zzso of total) with zzso receptors significantly affects the ability of competent receptors to zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may zzso the zzso zzso of zzso B zzso
