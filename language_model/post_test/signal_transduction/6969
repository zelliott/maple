zzso is an important mechanism for regulating innate immune responses to viral zzso zzso of zzso 63 zzso zzso chains to the zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif protein 25 zzso leads to the zzso of zzso and stimulates production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the linear zzso assembly complex zzso stimulates the zzso degradation of zzso thereby zzso the zzso signaling zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso preventing the zzso degradation of zzso Through protein zzso and mass zzso analysis, we identified zzso as an interaction partner of zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso zzso by specific small interfering zzso markedly enhanced the zzso of zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso but not its zzso inactive zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso leading to its zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso enhanced the zzso and zzso production of type I zzso and suppressed zzso virus zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso resulted in decreased zzso production and markedly enhanced viral zzso Together, these data identify zzso as a critical regulator of the zzso and zzso zzso immune response, thereby highlighting the intricate regulation of innate immune zzso
