The novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cellular zzso zzso expression has been detected in prostate cancer cells, although the significance of the zzso zzso in human prostate cancer has not been zzso We examined zzso expression in zzso cases of prostate cancer and 20 cases of benign zzso zzso zzso by zzso and compared the results to clinical zzso We demonstrated that zzso expression is increased in prostate cancer as compared to benign zzso zzso Strong zzso expression zzso with the presence of zzso zzso and less zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, among the patients with high zzso score of zzso zzso zzso has an additional zzso value in zzso zzso zzso experiments confirm its ability to induce proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasion in prostate cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso expression drastically increased zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso report zzso suggest that the zzso promoter is zzso by zzso and zzso shift zzso further suggests the involvement of zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso B, binding site in the zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed to enhance zzso activities up to zzso Taken together, our results establish zzso as a key zzso zzso associated with prostate zzso As the zzso interaction is highly specific, it represents a potential target of zzso
