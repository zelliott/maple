zzso zzso zzso is one of the most effective zzso drugs and is widely used for the treatment of zzso cell zzso zzso However, its efficacy is often limited due to the development of zzso Although several factors implicated in zzso resistance have been identified, the resistance mechanisms in detail are not fully understood zzso In the present study, we have examined the implication of survival signaling pathways in zzso zzso induced zzso of Ras and its downstream zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cell zzso suggesting that this zzso drug activates survival signal zzso in addition to zzso zzso In zzso zzso in culture, which we have established, the protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso were drastically elevated compared to parent zzso and zzso and zzso signals were zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor for zzso and zzso an inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso to zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso signal zzso may play a considerable role in zzso resistance in zzso
