The zzso zzso is master gene overseeing zzso of wide number of zzso and is critical for maintenance of zzso zzso The zzso expression of genes involved in cellular zzso is zzso in patients with inflammatory zzso diseases zzso zzso is a zzso zzso endowed with a zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated whether zzso activates zzso in primary human colon zzso cells and human colon zzso and assessed whether this zzso zzso the effect of tumor necrosis factor zzso on expression of zzso and zzso zzso Present results demonstrate that primary colon zzso cells express zzso and that their exposure to zzso zzso the expression of genes involved in cellular zzso Exposure to zzso reduces the expression of zzso zzso as well as expression of its target zzso This zzso effect was prevented by that zzso with zzso zzso down the expression of zzso in colon zzso cells by an zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects exerted by zzso on cell exposed to zzso Finally, ex zzso exposure of colon zzso obtained from zzso colitis patients to zzso increased the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso In aggregate, these data illustrate that zzso increases the expression of zzso and zzso genes involved in the metabolism and zzso of zzso and zzso the effects of zzso in zzso zzso cells and colon zzso These zzso effects of zzso could contribute to the maintenance of the zzso barrier integrity against zzso and products generated by zzso zzso
