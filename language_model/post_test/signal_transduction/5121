The three zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso confined in specific zzso compartments in cardiac cells, have distinct roles in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso Recently, evidence has emerged that implicates zzso in modulating zzso zzso during cardiac stress, including after zzso zzso As long as they remain in a coupled state the zzso mostly zzso zzso zzso through both zzso and independent zzso We review the evidence provided from the zzso of genetic mouse models as well as from in zzso cell experiments zzso the zzso zzso involved in the zzso regulation that justify new therapeutic interventions on the zzso axis to zzso the development of heart zzso
