The zzso zzso factors mediate the zzso signal in development and zzso zzso cell zzso can be caused by zzso of either zzso or zzso Though zzso and zzso have identical or very similar DNA binding zzso some of their activities are zzso some are clearly zzso We analyzed target gene zzso of zzso and zzso active zzso zzso by global expression profiling in an zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Four hundred zzso genes zzso or zzso at least twofold were zzso zzso target gene profiles correlated well with the biological activities of these zzso factors in hair zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of largely overlapping sets of target genes was zzso by both factors, repression occurred predominantly in response to zzso Also, significant quantitative differences in response to zzso and zzso were found for a small number of activated zzso Since we have not detected a putative processed zzso zzso these results point to specific but indirect target gene repression by zzso via preferential zzso of one or more negative zzso
