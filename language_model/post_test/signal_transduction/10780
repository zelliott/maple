zzso protein zzso plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso mediates zzso signal zzso is not fully zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso T cells with a fusion protein composed of full-length zzso and the death domain of zzso zzso In these cells, zzso zzso for zzso and directly associates with zzso in zzso zzso complexes following zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso was fully restored by zzso in these zzso In contrast, expression of a fusion protein composed of zzso a component of the zzso zzso complex, and the death domain of zzso zzso cannot restore zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that the role of zzso is to specifically recruit zzso to the zzso zzso complex, whereas the forced recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso complex is insufficient for zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has a high degree of zzso with zzso zzso unlike zzso also fails to restore zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso recruitment of zzso plays a specific role in zzso zzso
