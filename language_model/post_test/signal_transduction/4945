zzso influx into cells is responsible for initiating the cell death in zzso tissue after hypoxic zzso Changes in zzso calcium with subsequent increased expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso are hypothesized to cause cell death after hypoxic zzso In the present study we have examined the zzso changes of zzso expression in zzso injury of spinal zzso zzso zzso In this study we used western zzso real time zzso zzso and zzso to examine changes in protein and gene expression of zzso after spinal zzso injury zzso in the zzso zzso zzso showed increase in the expression of zzso at zzso during zzso injury of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed zzso increases in zzso of zzso after zzso of hypoxic injury of white zzso By double zzso zzso zzso was localized on zzso and zzso in the white matter of the spinal zzso After treatment with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso there is a significant reduction in the expression of zzso indicating the role of these molecules in zzso zzso Further removal of zzso calcium does not have significant effect on zzso expression and zzso of zzso which was further confirmed by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso with quantitative analysis showed that treatment with inhibitor significantly reduced the cellular zzso stress suggesting zzso is responsible for increased cellular zzso zzso In zzso we provide evidence that zzso gene and protein expression in zzso and zzso is markedly increased after hypoxic zzso Further zzso zzso zzso zzso expression after hypoxic zzso Therefore we propose that zzso of zzso zzso would reduce the cellular zzso load and thereby have a zzso zzso
