The zzso zzso are zzso signaling proteins that are zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso family of genes has four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Relatively little is known about the biological functions of the zzso 3, and 4 zzso and they are considered in this review only zzso The zzso proteins play essential roles in the nervous system, heart, and zzso There is also evidence for involvement of zzso signaling in the development and function of several other organ systems, and in human disease, including the zzso of schizophrenia and breast zzso There are many zzso zzso raising the question zzso so many zzso Study of mice with targeted zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated that zzso differing in their zzso region or in their zzso growth factor zzso domain differ in their in zzso zzso These differences in function might arise because of differences in expression pattern or might reflect differences in intrinsic biological zzso While differences in expression pattern certainly contribute to the observed differences in in zzso functions, there are also marked differences in intrinsic characteristics that may tailor zzso for specific signaling requirements, a theme that will be emphasized in this zzso
