zzso competes with zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and decreases NO zzso This study investigated regulatory mechanisms of zzso activity in zzso cells and its role in zzso 

In human zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, reaching a zzso increase zzso at 1 zzso for 24 zzso The effect of zzso was prevented by zzso zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which inhibit zzso or by the ROCK zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso active zzso or ROCK zzso enhanced zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and the effect of active zzso zzso was inhibited by the ROCK zzso Neither zzso nor the active zzso zzso affected zzso II protein level, the only zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, a significantly higher zzso II activity zzso not the protein zzso and zzso protein level zzso were observed in zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso (1 zzso despite a significantly higher zzso expression in zzso of zzso mice, evoked a more pronounced contraction, which was reverted to a greater zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso (20 zzso compared with the zzso animals zzso zzso 

zzso enhances zzso activity via zzso in human zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso activity is involved in zzso zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso may represent a novel therapeutic possibility for zzso
