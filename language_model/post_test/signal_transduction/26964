One day of zzso leads to a significant suppression of zzso zzso zzso in adult male zzso monkeys that is evident within the first 4-6 h after a missed zzso Restricting food intake may suppress the central drive to the zzso axis via zzso signals occurring during the transition from a zzso energy storing state to a zzso energy zzso state or via signals associated with the zzso zzso imposed by withholding zzso To distinguish between these two general types of signals, we chose the experimental strategy of providing monkeys with a great excess of calories on the day before zzso zzso zzso on the day before zzso in order to maintain them in a metabolically fed state on the following day when they were zzso without preventing the psychological stress associated with zzso We reasoned that if zzso signals are responsible for causing the zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso on the day before zzso would prevent the zzso suppression of zzso zzso Eight adult male zzso monkeys with zzso zzso zzso were studied on three zzso on a day of normal feeding zzso approximately 30 zzso of monkey zzso at zzso h on the day of the zzso on a day of zzso after a day of normal zzso and on a day of zzso after a day of zzso zzso one meal of 100 zzso on the day before the zzso zzso zzso zzso on a day of zzso after a day of normal feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured from zzso zzso was significantly zzso P zzso zzso compared to a day of normal feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, on a day of zzso after a day of zzso there was no significant difference in zzso zzso measured from zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to a day of normal zzso zzso the day before zzso prevented the normal zzso suppression of plasma zzso zzso and delayed the normal zzso decline in plasma insulin zzso zzso did not prevent the display of agitated behavior that we have previously documented in monkeys when they are zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso which suppresses normal zzso zzso after brief periods of zzso is related to the zzso status of the body during the transition from a fed to a zzso state, rather than a function of the psychological state imposed by withholding zzso
