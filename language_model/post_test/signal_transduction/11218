zzso serve as receptors for repulsive zzso guidance molecules zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two separated Ras zzso protein zzso zzso C1 and zzso Recently, we reported that the zzso family small zzso zzso associates with zzso and the zzso complex stimulates zzso activity of zzso inducing growth cone collapse in zzso zzso in response to zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso exhibits the GAP activity remain zzso In this report, critical roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso GAP activity and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso containing the C1 domain interacts with the zzso region containing the C2 domain, and zzso zzso this zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in parallel with zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in the presence of zzso triggers the zzso GAP zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso causes zzso zzso of the zzso rendering the zzso zzso active in the presence of zzso and zzso contraction of zzso cells and zzso of zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso opens the two zzso GAP zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso GAP activity and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
