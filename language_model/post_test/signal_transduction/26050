zzso smoke is one of the risk factors for gastric cancer and nicotine has been reported to promote tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions are hallmarks of many zzso including gastric zzso Here, we used an zzso array platform covering a panel of 95 human zzso to examine the expression profile in zzso gastric cancer zzso We found that zzso and zzso were zzso upon nicotine zzso zzso with zzso or zzso significantly zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso or zzso expression exhibited a similar zzso effect on cell proliferation as zzso zzso zzso degradation and nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso zzso or specific inhibitor zzso markedly suppressed zzso cell proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso sites were located in both zzso and zzso gene zzso elements and we showed that nicotine enhanced the binding of zzso to the promoters of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling in response to nicotine was zzso by the action of zzso E receptors zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso impaired the zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso and zzso and cell zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso are directly regulated by the zzso factor zzso and yet zzso cell proliferation is zzso via zzso zzso Perhaps this study may shed light on the development of zzso drugs to improve the zzso in zzso
