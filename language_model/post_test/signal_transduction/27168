zzso brain activity is essential for normal brain zzso We are studying spontaneous activity in zzso at several complexity zzso at the microscopic level by analyzing the role of zzso channels, at the zzso level by analyzing the zzso impulse activity, and at the zzso level by zzso studies of mean electric fields of cortical network zzso We have focused on the role of a subset of zzso zzso in the zzso of small size zzso zzso 10 zzso The analysis of spontaneous impulse trains in these zzso both isolated and in zzso show zzso that impulses vary in zzso the magnitude depending on the input zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may play a role in the information processing of the brain, and zzso that single zzso channel events can trigger zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso can function as cellular random zzso The possible role of random generators are investigated by simulating spontaneous activity in a cortical network model, based on a simplified description of the architecture of the zzso area of zzso The simulations show that such random generators can induce zzso zzso in cortical zzso These findings highlight the role of zzso for the global zzso of the brain, and stress the importance of the study of channel zzso for brain zzso
