Although zzso therapy has dramatically improved the treatment of breast cancer therapeutic resistance and zzso recurrence occurs, even in zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and understanding the molecular mechanisms which zzso zzso resistance is therefore important if future therapeutic strategies are to be zzso Members of the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso families have been implicated in breast cancer development and zzso Our results demonstrate that culture of zzso cancer foundation - 1 zzso cells with zzso results in reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen in zzso Furthermore, our tissue zzso expression data demonstrates that zzso expression is increased in tamoxifen resistant breast zzso To confirm that zzso of zzso reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen we used an zzso zzso system and a zzso active zzso of zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen and zzso but did not lead to zzso of zzso demonstrating that zzso does not feedback to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which have been implicated in tamoxifen resistance in breast zzso Furthermore, our data indicates that zzso of zzso C gamma is a zzso event regulating zzso and zzso zzso and that its zzso reduces sensitivity to zzso zzso we zzso that zzso could play an integral part, not only in breast cancer development but also in resistance to zzso
