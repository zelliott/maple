zzso zzso is one of the major regulatory mechanisms involved in zzso cellular events, including cell zzso zzso and zzso Because many zzso of biology are regulated by protein zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso activity forms the basis for many different types of zzso The disease relevance of protein zzso and zzso has led many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to zzso significant resources in lead discovery programs for these two target zzso The existence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso development of zzso for the rapid screening for novel and specific compound zzso We describe here a zzso molecular zzso platform that is compatible with zzso zzso zzso screening systems and can be applied to virtually all zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso The zzso has a zzso format, utilizing the differential zzso sensitivity of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In addition to screening individual zzso the zzso can be zzso such that zzso pathways are zzso in zzso to identify compounds that specifically interact with inactive zzso zzso of this zzso format to the zzso scale allows for the rapid and accurate compound screening of a host of zzso and zzso targets, thereby zzso the hunt for new leads for these target zzso
