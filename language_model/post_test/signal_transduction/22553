zzso zzso factor zzso and bone zzso protein zzso 2 signal via different zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated that simultaneous stimulation of fetal mouse zzso cells with these distinct types of zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation in a zzso zzso Here we show that zzso spontaneously emerge in zzso without zzso added zzso and zzso in the culture of zzso cells for a much longer zzso This spontaneous zzso differentiation is completely impaired when zzso cells deficient for zzso a signal zzso zzso component for zzso are zzso We also show that zzso and zzso as well as related zzso and respective zzso molecules are expressed in fetal mouse brain and cultured zzso zzso Taken together with our previous finding that prenatal mouse brain deficient for zzso exhibits a severe reduction of zzso it is suggested that zzso acts zzso with zzso in zzso to induce zzso differentiation in mouse developing zzso
