zzso sympathetic zzso death is determined by functional interactions between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A key question is whether zzso promotes zzso by directly zzso or modulating zzso activity, or by stimulating cell death independently of zzso Here we provide evidence for the latter zzso Specifically, experiments presented here demonstrate that the presence or absence of zzso does not alter zzso activity or zzso and zzso downstream survival signaling in primary zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice indicate that the zzso absence of zzso substantially zzso zzso sympathetic zzso from zzso death in zzso Thus, zzso zzso death regardless of the presence or absence of zzso zzso These data therefore support a model where developing sympathetic zzso are zzso to zzso by an ongoing zzso zzso zzso and one of the major ways that zzso promotes zzso survival is by zzso this ongoing death zzso
