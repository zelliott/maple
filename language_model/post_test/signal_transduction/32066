The present study assessed the potential functions of zzso zzso on inflammatory arthritis and zzso shock models using zzso transgenic zzso zzso The potential signaling zzso for the zzso necrosis factor zzso axis was analyzed in zzso 

zzso zzso mice were generated under control of a ubiquitous zzso Two disease models were used to examine in zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis developed using a single injection of zzso zzso or zzso into the knee zzso and zzso shock induced with zzso injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered simultaneously with zzso in some zzso Using zzso cells, in zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso or zzso inflammatory protein 2 zzso production were assessed with or without zzso for nuclear factor zzso B zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso 

Single injection of zzso but not zzso resulted in development of severe zzso with substantial zzso cartilage degradation in knees of the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in inflamed zzso was highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso mice were more zzso to zzso zzso than the zzso control mice 48 hours after zzso challenge; but blockade of zzso by zzso protected from zzso zzso In cultured bone zzso cells derived from the zzso mice, zzso zzso accelerated production of zzso upon stimulation with zzso Of note, zzso added zzso alone zzso zzso cells to express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso which are specific zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso and zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso 

These results show that zzso contributed to the development of inflammatory arthritis and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling with zzso appeared indispensable for zzso the zzso axis in zzso However, zzso alone induced zzso production in zzso cells through zzso of inhibitor zzso B zzso and zzso zzso Further studies on the potential involvement of zzso axis will be beneficial in better understanding the pathology of zzso arthritis and infectious zzso
