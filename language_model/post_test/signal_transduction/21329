zzso mechanisms underlying zzso reduction of bone formation have not yet been fully zzso In zzso zzso has been suggested to be involved in mechanical signaling in zzso However, the roles of zzso in zzso during the bone response to mechanical stimuli have not yet been zzso The purpose of this paper was to examine the roles of zzso in zzso bone loss in zzso Tail suspension was conducted for 2 zzso using zzso to zzso zzso zzso knockout mice zzso and zzso zzso zzso Bones were subjected to two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso Loss of half zzso gene zzso zzso bone loss in zzso and cortical zzso zzso reduction in mineral zzso rate and bone formation rate in cortical bone as well as zzso bone was exacerbated in zzso mice, compared with zzso zzso Bone zzso parameters were not significantly affected by unloading or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in bone were reduced by 50% in zzso whereas unloading in zzso mice did not further alter zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels were reduced by zzso regardless of zzso gene zzso These data demonstrated that full zzso gene dosage is required for maintaining normal function of zzso in mechanical unloading or zzso zzso Finally, we propose zzso as a critical target gene in unloading to alter zzso activity and bone formation in zzso
