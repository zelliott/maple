Best described outside the nervous system, zzso are structural proteins that form zzso functional zzso at the plasma membrane that cluster related signaling zzso zzso proteins include G zzso receptors and G zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as protein zzso zzso channels and various other signaling zzso Not surprisingly, a wide array of biological disorders are thought to be rooted in zzso zzso In addition, zzso traffic and cluster zzso receptors to zzso zzso between the zzso receptors zzso and zzso with zzso appear critical in many zzso cell types, zzso disruption of normal function may zzso many forms of breast zzso Recent findings suggest zzso may also play an essential role in membrane zzso zzso function in the nervous zzso Not only are they expressed in zzso and zzso but different zzso zzso also appear necessary to generate distinct functional signaling zzso With membrane zzso receptors responsible for the efficient zzso of a multitude of zzso signaling zzso which in turn influence a wide variety of nervous system functions, zzso proteins are poised to act as the central coordinators of these zzso
