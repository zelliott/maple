Very little is known about zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso by the nuclear zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso have been reported to play a role in assembly of the zzso 54 S zzso In the present study zzso screens of a collection of respiratory deficient zzso zzso have enabled us to identify a third gene essential for expression of zzso zzso This gene codes for a member of the zzso family of zzso which we have named zzso in keeping with the earlier zzso zzso in zzso cause the zzso of the 15 S zzso zzso previously shown to have an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso grown at the zzso and restrictive temperatures, combined with zzso with zzso zzso indicate that zzso is required for assembly of the 30 S but not 54 S zzso zzso The respiratory deficient growth zzso of an zzso zzso zzso is partially rescued by zzso of the zzso constituent located at the zzso exit site of the 54 S zzso The rescue is accompanied by an increase in processed 15 S zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso jointly regulate assembly of the small zzso by modulating processing of the 15 S zzso zzso
