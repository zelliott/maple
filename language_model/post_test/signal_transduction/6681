The findings reported zzso indicate that insulin rapidly zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso in its target zzso by two fully zzso zzso One of these mechanisms involves a zzso zzso zzso zzso which probably serves to couple the insulin zzso to a zzso zzso C, which, in turn, leads to the release of zzso and zzso zzso of de zzso PA zzso The second mechanism is PC zzso which is zzso zzso Both mechanisms serve as important sources of zzso during insulin action, and zzso appears to be activated by zzso derived from both zzso Although zzso may be derived from each of these zzso zzso it is clear that zzso zzso will only be derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings may help to explain why some, but not all, insulin effects are inhibited by zzso toxin and are therefore apparently dependent upon zzso zzso Whether or not other zzso are important in other zzso zzso pathways during insulin action, zzso PC zzso remains to be zzso
