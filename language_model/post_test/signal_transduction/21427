The study investigated the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso in four zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso colon cancer cell zzso zzso induced zzso in all the cells in a zzso manner; however, zzso and zzso cells were more susceptible than their knockout counterparts zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso cells as a model, zzso analysis revealed four zzso events: fragmentation of zzso zzso zzso increase in concentration of a more basic zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso and decrease in concentration of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso A zzso in response to zzso treatment was confirmed using Western zzso zzso zzso was zzso which was evidenced by zzso and zzso in active form of zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso were entirely zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso Likewise, partial zzso of zzso expression using small interfering zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso A zzso and zzso Furthermore, the lower zzso sensitivity of the knockout cells zzso and zzso correlated with the relatively reduced processing of zzso and zzso A zzso Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of zzso and its zzso of zzso A in zzso signaling triggered by zzso in the colon zzso cells, which can be activated in the absence of zzso or zzso
