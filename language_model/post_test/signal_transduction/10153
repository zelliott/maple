Once nuclear envelope zzso have been removed from isolated zzso around zzso of zzso cell zzso is retained within the nuclear zzso which calculations suggest may occupy zzso of the volume of this zzso zzso It is now acknowledged that zzso zzso largely ignored for the past 40 years, provides zzso for zzso signaling zzso However, given its zzso it likely also has other as yet incompletely defined zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso distinct and highly saturated molecular species compared with that of the whole zzso Moreover, this unusual composition is subject to tight zzso maintenance even under conditions of extreme dietary zzso presumably reflecting a functional requirement for highly saturated zzso zzso Recent application of new zzso technologies exploiting tandem zzso zzso mass zzso in conjunction with zzso stable isotope labeling have permitted us to probe not just molecular species compositions but zzso zzso acquisition and turnover with unparalleled sensitivity and zzso What emerges is a picture of a dynamic pool of zzso zzso subject to autonomous regulation with respect to bulk cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso of zzso zzso contrasts with import of zzso zzso zzso However, irrespective of the precise zzso relationships underpinning zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling from these parental zzso zzso cell growth and division indicating a pivotal control zzso This in turn defines the manipulation of zzso zzso zzso acquisition and metabolism as intriguing potential targets for the development of future zzso zzso
