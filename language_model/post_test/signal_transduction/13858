The restricted zzso translation of maternal zzso which is crucial for correct cell fate zzso in early zzso zzso zzso is regulated primarily through the zzso Although genetic screens have identified many zzso expressed cell zzso zzso proteins zzso their in zzso targets and the zzso by which they regulate these targets are less zzso These zzso are translated in zzso and zzso to one or a few zzso in a zzso and temporally dynamic fashion unique for each protein and each zzso Here, we characterize the zzso regulation of zzso supplied zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso essential for two separate zzso interactions in early zzso A zzso reporter that includes only the zzso zzso is zzso zzso properly in zzso and early zzso and then correctly translated only in the known zzso signaling zzso We show that the zzso translation pattern of this reporter is regulated zzso by a set of nine zzso supplied zzso These nine proteins all directly bind the zzso zzso in zzso and function as positive or negative regulators of zzso translation in zzso The net zzso zzso for the zzso zzso reporter is determined by competitive binding between zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso along with the distinct zzso zzso patterns of these zzso We propose that the zzso of maternal zzso contains a zzso code that determines the topography of associated zzso zzso positive and negative zzso zzso
