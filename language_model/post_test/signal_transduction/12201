The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in focal zzso zzso Sixty specific zzso male zzso rats were randomly divided into two groups: a model group zzso and a control group zzso In the zzso group, zzso was induced by unilateral zzso and a single tail vein injection of zzso (5 zzso Ten rats were sacrificed every 2 weeks in each zzso The expressions of smooth muscle alpha zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso and zzso were examined using zzso techniques, and Western zzso was used to examine the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso protein zzso of activated zzso zzso and zzso were also measured by real-time quantitative reverse zzso A steady and significant increase in the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were observed in zzso rats over the whole experimental zzso Increased zzso and zzso levels in zzso rats were observed by week 6, whereas increased levels of zzso and zzso were noted by week zzso At the zzso levels, zzso zzso and zzso were significantly increased in zzso rats in week 2, whereas zzso zzso showed a significant decrease by weeks 2 and 4, followed by an significant increase in week zzso zzso increased zzso levels were noted in week 2, followed by a steady and significant decrease in weeks 4 and zzso zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were noted at all time zzso We conclude that the zzso signaling zzso may play an important role in the pathological process of rapid focal zzso zzso in the rat zzso
