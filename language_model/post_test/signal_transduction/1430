We studied the mode of action of the synthetic zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso to a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso envelope protein zzso as well as to envelope proteins of the human T cell leukemia virus I and zzso Previous studies have established that zzso zzso to zzso zzso inhibited zzso tumor toxicity in melanoma cells and proliferation in zzso zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso did not bind to zzso nor did it affect the number of zzso zzso their binding zzso or their ability to zzso zzso However, zzso inhibited production of zzso by zzso zzso cells treated with zzso or with zzso zzso zzso The potent protein zzso C zzso zzso also inhibited zzso responses, while zzso a weak inhibitor of protein zzso C, did zzso zzso zzso C activity in the zzso fraction prepared from zzso cells was found to be inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso All of these findings are consistent with the idea that zzso zzso zzso responses by interfering with signal zzso through a protein zzso C zzso
