The assembly of signaling molecules surrounding the zzso family of zzso receptors remains poorly zzso Recently, the membrane protein zzso was found in complexes with zzso zzso zzso binds cholesterol and several signaling molecules potentially linked to zzso function, zzso zzso family zzso although zzso has not been directly implicated in zzso zzso Here we report that depletion of zzso by zzso methodology in kidney zzso cells zzso the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso resulting in loss of focal zzso sites, zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells also zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso complexes could be zzso by zzso peptides in both zzso zzso cells and human vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso of complexes by peptides in intact smooth muscle cells blocks the association of zzso family zzso with zzso zzso and markedly zzso their migration on zzso We conclude that zzso signaling necessary for normal zzso zzso function requires zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso may operate within zzso sites to organize zzso zzso zzso in proximity to zzso promoting efficient signal zzso
