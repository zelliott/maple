The precise role of transforming growth factor zzso signaling in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is not yet fully zzso Here, we report generation of an zzso zzso and zzso knockout mouse model by crossing zzso zzso I zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso By applying tamoxifen to oral cavity of the mouse to induce zzso zzso we were able to zzso delete zzso in the mouse head and neck zzso On tumor induction with zzso zzso zzso of zzso conditional knockout zzso mice zzso zzso zzso developed zzso in the head and neck area starting from 16 weeks after zzso However, no tumors were observed in the control zzso A molecular analysis revealed an enhanced proliferation and loss of zzso in the zzso layer of the head and neck zzso of zzso zzso mice 4 weeks after tamoxifen and zzso zzso The most notable finding of our study is that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated in zzso that developed in the zzso zzso mice on zzso of zzso signaling through zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso of zzso pathways may contribute zzso with zzso of zzso pathways to promote head and neck zzso in these zzso Our results revealed the critical role of the zzso signaling zzso and its zzso with the zzso zzso in suppressing head and neck zzso
