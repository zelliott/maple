zzso is one of the three classic germ layers in the early mouse zzso with the capacity to develop into both the central nervous system and zzso Because it is a transient phase of development with few molecular zzso the early zzso is the least understood germ layer in mouse embryonic zzso In this work, we studied the differentiation potential of isolated zzso tissue in response to zzso signaling at various zzso stages zzso zzso and zzso and identified a transient region in the zzso side of the zzso at zzso that possesses the ability to become neural or zzso zzso in response to the absence or presence of zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso signaling could direct the zzso zzso zzso cells towards zzso lineages during differentiation in zzso in zzso Our work not only improves our understanding of zzso layer development in early zzso but also provides a framework for zzso differentiation towards zzso zzso
