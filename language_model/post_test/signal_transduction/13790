zzso zzso zzso during sleep, such as occurs in zzso sleep zzso zzso leads to degenerative changes in the zzso and is associated with spatial learning deficits in adult zzso In both patients and zzso models of zzso the disease is associated with suppression of growth hormone zzso zzso which is actively involved in the growth, development, and function of the central nervous system zzso Recent work showed that zzso zzso therapy attenuated zzso deficits zzso by zzso during sleep in zzso Here, we show that administration of the Growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deficits, anxiety, and depression in mice along with reduction in zzso stress markers such as zzso and zzso and increases in zzso zzso zzso DNA binding and zzso of insulin growth zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with a zzso zzso zzso during intermittent zzso did not affect any of the zzso deleterious effects in zzso Thus, zzso zzso administered as the zzso of a zzso zzso may provide a viable therapeutic intervention to protect zzso brain regions from zzso zzso zzso Sleep zzso characterized by chronic intermittent zzso zzso is associated with substantial cognitive and behavioral zzso Here, we show that administration of a zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso stress, increases both zzso nuclear binding and downstream expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and cortex, and markedly zzso water maze performance deficits in mice exposed to intermittent zzso during zzso
