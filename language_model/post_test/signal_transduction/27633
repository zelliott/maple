The zzso zzso protein zzso expressed in a highly zzso zzso rat zzso zzso has been implicated in cell surface changes contributing to zzso zzso is present in the cells in a plasma zzso and zzso signal zzso particle containing zzso and is zzso on zzso zzso analyses and affinity zzso with zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed direct binding of the zzso but not the zzso zzso domain to zzso This association was confirmed by zzso of partially zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso Further, a zzso fusion protein bound full length zzso from either zzso or zzso insect zzso The zzso fusion zzso but not zzso was zzso by zzso or insect zzso zzso but not by a zzso negative zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was almost completely abolished by a zzso excess of the zzso domain of zzso and a parallel decrease in zzso zzso of zzso was zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is zzso as a consequence of its specific association with zzso via its zzso zzso These observations suggest a mechanism by which zzso proteins may contribute to zzso maturation or zzso through binding and zzso of zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso to sites of association of zzso with the plasma zzso
