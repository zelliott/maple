Upon zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso beta zzso associates with zzso 1, zzso zzso and a 64 zzso zzso To determine the relative role of each of these associated proteins in zzso zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso unable to bind any of them and a panel of zzso zzso that could bind only one of the zzso zzso F5 zzso failed to activate zzso 1, zzso or Ras and was unable to trigger DNA zzso zzso association of F5 zzso with either zzso 1 or zzso restored Ras zzso and a zzso zzso Surprisingly, even though binding of the 64 zzso protein almost fully restored Ras zzso it did not rescue the zzso ability to trigger DNA zzso Thus Ras zzso is insufficient to trigger zzso DNA zzso and zzso 1 and zzso are independent downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso
