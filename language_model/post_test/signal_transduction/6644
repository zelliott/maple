We have used a zzso human basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso to study its effects on cell zzso gene expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso rat zzso and zzso rat zzso zzso Basic zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso by measuring incorporation of zzso in zzso cells (40 zzso basic zzso increased zzso above the control value by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but inhibited zzso in zzso cells at all doses (85 zzso zzso of control with 40 zzso basic zzso zzso zzso concentration was increased in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of control with 40 zzso basic zzso as was zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of control with 40 zzso basic zzso but zzso zzso in zzso cells was not significantly affected by any dose of basic zzso zzso zzso was reduced by basic zzso in both zzso and zzso cells (40 zzso zzso giving 80 zzso zzso of the control value in zzso and 67 zzso zzso of the control value in zzso zzso despite increased levels when zzso cells were zzso with 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso cells were zzso by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso were increased by 40 zzso basic zzso zzso zzso 6 and 330 zzso 51% of control values zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
