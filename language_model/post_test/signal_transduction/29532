Previous studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a critical role in the development and patterning of many zzso derived zzso We have investigated the role of Sonic zzso zzso in formation of the prostate zzso by examining the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with earlier work reporting an essential role for zzso in prostate zzso we have found that zzso zzso fetuses display abnormal zzso development and fail to form prostate zzso zzso however, we have discovered that this prostate zzso could be rescued by three different zzso zzso zzso zzso culture in the presence of zzso and administration of zzso zzso to pregnant mice, indicating that the prostate zzso in zzso zzso is due to insufficient levels of zzso Furthermore, we find that the zzso of zzso zzso signaling by treatment with zzso does not block prostate formation in zzso culture, but instead produces zzso defects consistent with a role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso Taken together, our studies indicate that the initial zzso of the prostate proceeds independently of zzso but that zzso or other zzso zzso may play a role in subsequent events that pattern the zzso
