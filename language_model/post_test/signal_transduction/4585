To investigate the role of liver X receptors zzso on zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into four experiment groups: zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso for 8 hours, then treated with zzso (1 zzso zzso hours later, zzso zzso was performed on zzso cells, the surface area of zzso cells was analyzed with zzso Image J software, and the synthetic rate of protein in zzso cells was detected by zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso was measured by quantitative zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression of zzso was also detected after zzso gene zzso 

The surface area of zzso cells, zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso incorporation in zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly higher than those of control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso Compared with zzso group, the surface area of zzso cells, zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso incorporation were significantly decreased in zzso + zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso After zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso using the specific zzso the zzso expression of zzso in zzso + zzso group was zzso zzso zzso which was similar as that in zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso an zzso of zzso could inhibit zzso induced cardiac zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression by zzso is zzso zzso
