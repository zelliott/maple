Cancer initiation and progression have been attributed to newly discovered zzso of zzso highly zzso drug-resistant tumor cells termed cancer stem zzso Recently, we and others reported a new zzso plasticity wherein highly zzso drug-resistant cell populations could arise not only from pre-existing cancer zzso populations but also from cancer cells lacking these zzso In the current study, we hypothesized that this newfound zzso plasticity may be zzso by zzso and zzso zzso pathways previously implicated in zzso zzso and drug zzso Using zzso zzso zzso dye exclusion and zzso activated cell sorting zzso of cancer cell lines, we identified and tracked cancer zzso side populations zzso of cancer cells characterized by high zzso and drug zzso We found that pharmacological zzso or genetic depletion of zzso and zzso markedly reduced the spontaneous conversion of zzso population zzso cells into cancer zzso SP cells, whereas zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso to SP zzso zzso signaling was zzso through downstream zzso of zzso which led to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pharmacological or genetic zzso of zzso or zzso dramatically impacted conversion of zzso to zzso Further zzso zzso effects on zzso equilibrium were dependent upon its interaction with zzso a zzso family zzso These studies provide a zzso model wherein zzso signaling mediates zzso plasticity in and out of a zzso highly zzso zzso zzso targeting this zzso has unique potential for overcoming the therapy resistance and disease progression attributed to the cancer zzso zzso
