Because of the zzso role in zzso development, this study was conducted to analyze the retinal zzso in zzso wearing a spectacle zzso a well-established means of inducing zzso zzso to identify gene expression zzso and to develop novel zzso hypotheses about zzso zzso 

zzso white zzso zzso wore a unilateral spectacle lens of zzso or zzso D for 6 hours or 3 zzso With total zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken gene zzso were used to compare gene expression levels between zzso and zzso control eyes zzso zzso 6 zzso for each zzso zzso zzso signal zzso were evaluated by analysis of zzso using a false discovery rate of zzso as the statistical zzso zzso zzso expressed genes were validated by zzso 

Very few zzso transcripts were zzso expressed after plus lens zzso In contrast, approximately zzso transcripts were zzso expressed under each of the minus lens conditions, with minimal zzso For each condition, low zzso typified the altered zzso zzso regulated genes under the minus lens conditions included many potentially zzso signaling molecules and genes whose protein products have roles in intrinsic retinal zzso zzso 

Plus or minus lens wear induce markedly different, not opposite, zzso in zzso gene zzso The initial retinal responses to zzso are quite different from those when the eye growth patterns are well established, suggesting that different mechanisms govern the initiation and persistence or progression of zzso zzso The gene lists identify promising signaling candidates and regulatory pathways for future study, including a potential role for zzso rhythms in zzso zzso
