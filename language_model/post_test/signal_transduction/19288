Evidence indicates that diets enriched in zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but zzso mechanisms are zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso supports the integrity of the zzso zzso In tumor cells of zzso zzso zzso is generally zzso This may result in zzso of zzso and lead to progression of zzso Our studies have shown that the zzso zzso species, zzso acid zzso increases zzso expression in prostate zzso of zzso knockout zzso zzso and human prostate cancer zzso We have now determined that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso were delivered to zzso and zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso small interfering zzso In the presence of control zzso both zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso whereas zzso zzso blocked zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling linked to zzso zzso zzso involved the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso A diet enriched in zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and Bad in zzso of zzso zzso Similar results were observed in human prostate cancer cells in response to zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso signaling was zzso by zzso zzso These findings define a mechanism by which zzso suppression of zzso of zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso in prostate zzso
