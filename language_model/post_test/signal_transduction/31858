zzso zzso zzso cells of the human zzso invade the zzso zzso and zzso arteries to establish an efficient exchange of key molecules between maternal and fetal zzso zzso invasion is zzso regulated in zzso both positively and zzso by a variety of factors at the zzso interface to maintain a healthy zzso zzso One such factor, zzso a transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso migration, and zzso independent of zzso We reported that these zzso actions were zzso by its binding to multiple zzso zzso zzso including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso The present study explores the mechanisms underlying zzso antagonism of zzso zzso stimulation of zzso differentiation of zzso using our zzso cell line, zzso We observe that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration and zzso tube formation on zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and the zzso is blocked in both cases by zzso zzso selective zzso zzso we show that both zzso and zzso pathways contribute independently to zzso zzso migration and zzso tube zzso zzso zzso the vascular zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and this zzso is blocked by zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso migration and zzso differentiation by interfering with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso dual impediment of zzso differentiation of the zzso and zzso may have implications for zzso of zzso a zzso zzso disorder in zzso
