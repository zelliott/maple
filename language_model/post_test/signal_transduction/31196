Liberation of zzso from membrane zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso upon cell zzso is considered the key step in generation of zzso factor zzso a potent zzso zzso recognized as the most zzso zzso of inflammatory events triggered by bacterial zzso Here, we report on the role of zzso in the disturbances in zzso zzso synthesis evoked by the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cells of zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso generation, was subject to suppression by a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso changes in zzso synthesis and zzso generation were countered by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso reduction in zzso synthesis was countered by zzso an inhibitor of zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso The blockade of zzso caused also zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and amplification in the zzso capacity of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso generation, while the inhibitor of zzso had no zzso The findings are the first to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso synthesis involves zzso zzso zzso that leads to zzso in zzso production and zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso is a critical prerequisite for the zzso zzso zzso
