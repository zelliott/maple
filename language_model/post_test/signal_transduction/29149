The high affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a decoy zzso for zzso zzso zzso and has an zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been considered as a therapeutic target for zzso and tumor zzso However, the mechanism of zzso expression in zzso is zzso 

The mechanism of zzso expression was examined using cultured rat zzso zzso zzso mechanical stretch induced zzso zzso expression in rat zzso Treatment with zzso II, which plays a pivotal role in mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in rat zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso through zzso zzso Furthermore, mechanical stretch and zzso II treatment caused zzso zzso from rat zzso which was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression through mechanical stretch, zzso II treatment and zzso treatment was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso depletion through zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso for zzso was observed in the zzso of zzso biopsy specimens from the failing human heart, but not in autopsy specimens from control zzso 

zzso might act in an zzso and zzso fashion to zzso zzso expression in zzso
