In most zzso plant species, recognition of zzso is controlled by a single zzso termed the zzso In zzso genetic dissection of the zzso has revealed the presence of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 11 zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that determines the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso encodes a small zzso protein that determines the zzso specificity of zzso zzso encodes a zzso form of zzso protein similar to the zzso domain of zzso Recent zzso studies have revealed that zzso functions as the sole zzso for its zzso zzso zzso zzso Their interaction zzso the zzso of zzso which is expected to trigger the zzso cascade that results in the rejection of zzso This so-called zzso complex interaction and zzso zzso occur in an zzso manner, and this specificity is almost certainly the basis for zzso zzso
