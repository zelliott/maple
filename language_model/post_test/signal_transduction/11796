zzso hormone zzso stimulates characteristic zzso increases in zzso calcium concentration zzso and in zzso hormone zzso release in cultured zzso with an early peak followed by a prolonged plateau in both zzso Analysis of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and of zzso release at zzso intervals in zzso zzso cells revealed increases in both responses within a few seconds of exposure to zzso The maximum zzso of zzso occurred within 20 zzso and the peak zzso release in 35 zzso the total duration of the spike phase for both zzso and zzso release was zzso zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, the zzso peak in zzso was reduced by about zzso and the plateau phase was zzso zzso the magnitude of the acute phase of zzso release was reduced by zzso and that of the second phase by about zzso Recovery of the plateau phase of zzso release occurred within 25 zzso after addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In a zzso manner, the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso reduced the zzso current measured by zzso recording in zzso zzso and abolished the zzso zzso component of zzso zzso The selective calcium channel blocker, zzso decreased the magnitude of the zzso current and reduced the plateau phase of zzso release by zzso conversely, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso consistently enhanced the zzso of both zzso current and zzso zzso zzso These data reveal a close zzso correlation between changes in zzso and zzso release during zzso action, with zzso zzso during the spike phase and zzso influx through zzso and insensitive sets of zzso calcium channels during the spike and plateau zzso In addition, analysis of the zzso of the zzso and zzso responses to a wide range of zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso is consistent with amplification of the zzso signal in zzso zzso
