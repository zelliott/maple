It is now dogma that zzso zzso arise from cells of the zzso zzso However, data are accumulating suggesting that a relationship exists between B zzso (B zzso and OC zzso Although the exact nature of this relation is unknown, it takes at least two zzso First, molecules that regulate zzso growth and development have striking effects on OC lineage cells particularly at early stages of zzso Second, the possibility exists that zzso cells can give rise to zzso cells zzso in zzso and in zzso Recent data zzso at the least, that a regulatory relation exists between B zzso and zzso 

zzso is a member of the zzso family that encodes the paired box zzso zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso lineage cells extending from early zzso zzso cells to mature B zzso Mice made deficient in zzso have a zzso arrest of the zzso lineage at the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could be induced to form zzso by treatment with zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are severely zzso missing more than zzso of their bone zzso This is the result of a three- to fivefold increase in the number of zzso in bone, whereas the number of zzso is indistinguishable from zzso 

The analysis of a variety of zzso in mice supports the hypothesis that B cells and zzso develop in zzso that their development is regulated in a zzso manner; and that in the zzso state, zzso arise from zzso zzso
