Positive selection is a critical T cell zzso checkpoint that is driven by zzso zzso zzso positive selection toward the zzso lineage occurs in the absence of zzso One explanation for this zzso is that zzso establishes the zzso signaling threshold that must be overcome for positive selection to zzso In the current study, this possibility is explored through the use of zzso zzso transgenic mice that express a zzso zzso with zero, one, or three zzso and an zzso class II zzso or zzso class I zzso zzso zzso Using this system, we demonstrate that in the absence of zzso zzso are able to mature into the zzso lineage with reduced zzso signaling potential compared with that required to drive the maturation of zzso zzso We also demonstrate that maturation into the zzso lineage is enhanced under conditions of reduced zzso signaling potential in the absence of zzso
