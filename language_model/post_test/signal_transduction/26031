Recent studies reported that zzso was involved in the zzso of early brain injury after zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether sodium zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso by modulating growth factors and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were operated on with the zzso zzso zzso zzso animals were treated with vehicle, 3 zzso and 10 zzso zzso and evaluated regarding zzso and brain zzso The expression of growth factors such as mature zzso zzso factor, zzso growth zzso and vascular zzso growth factor and zzso of zzso zzso B, which is a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso factor and the downstream zzso in zzso was examined by Western zzso zzso zzso cell death was measured with terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also administered zzso a zzso zzso B zzso to examine the mechanisms for zzso effects by zzso 

zzso significantly improved zzso and reduced brain zzso after zzso zzso increased mature zzso zzso factor and prevented zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso cell death in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished the beneficial effects of zzso 

The current study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso by zzso was necessary for protection against early brain injury after zzso
