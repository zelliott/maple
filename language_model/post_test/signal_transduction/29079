zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zinc finger gene family, which encodes putative zzso Here we cloned the zzso zzso zzso and characterized its function in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso with zzso deficiencies and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso induced double axis in zzso In zzso animal cap zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso acid induced animal cap zzso as evident from the suppression of a pan neural marker, neural cell zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso activity of zzso is independent of the two major zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso Instead, zzso works specifically through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso completely zzso zzso active zzso and zzso but not dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts downstream of zzso and zzso and upstream of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the zzso and protein levels of zzso These results revealed for the first time the important role of zzso as a new player in zzso zzso during zzso embryonic zzso
