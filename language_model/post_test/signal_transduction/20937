zzso increases in zzso zzso concentration are important signaling events for zzso regulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to mediate zzso responses in the zzso by triggering action zzso which in turn open zzso zzso channels in the zzso plasma zzso It is not yet known to what extent internal zzso amplification contributes to the zzso zzso zzso Here we used fluorescent zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso and report that the zzso of the zzso zzso increase triggered by field stimulation is independent of the zzso zzso concentration as long as the concentration is greater than 50 zzso Furthermore, significantly more zzso has to be added zzso for blocking zzso responses, as predicted from the reported zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso These zzso suggest that field zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso are largely attributable to zzso release from zzso zzso Only a small number of zzso zzso have to enter across the plasma membrane for this zzso zzso amplification process to zzso Rapid zzso zzso showed that the internal zzso amplification occurs over zzso zzso and zzso increases zzso zzso zzso for up to 40 action zzso At a fixed number of field zzso zzso of 40 zzso were optimal for zzso zzso zzso Our studies suggest that the opening of zzso zzso release channels plays a crucial part in shaping the action zzso zzso zzso zzso
