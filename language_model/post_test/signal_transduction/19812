In zzso zzso zzso move towards the zzso cell walls upon exposure to low blue light zzso and to zzso walls under high zzso The regulation of these zzso movements involves members of both the zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso of zzso response zzso in zzso and zzso zzso revealed that although both zzso are capable of inducing zzso zzso under zzso conditions, the signals from these zzso appear to be zzso zzso movements in zzso plants were intermediate between those of the single zzso zzso consistent with each operating through separate zzso zzso zzso in zzso showed transient zzso avoidance responses upon exposure to intense blue light, and slow but sustained zzso avoidance under intense white light, indicating that in the absence of zzso zzso is capable of generating both a low and a zzso response zzso zzso in zzso B zzso caused an enhanced avoidance response at intermediate and high light zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that this enhancement is caused by zzso zzso of the zzso avoidance response in zzso zzso In addition, our results suggest that the zzso by zzso is not exclusive to either of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso
