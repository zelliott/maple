zzso plasticity is based on the zzso ability to zzso integrate and respond to multiple signals and cues zzso of environmental opportunities and zzso A growing body of evidence demonstrates that plants are able to adapt to imminent threats by zzso cues zzso from their damaged zzso Here, the hypothesis was tested that zzso plants are able to perceive and respond to stress cues zzso from their zzso and zzso stressed zzso and to induce stress responses in additional zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants were subjected to zzso stress or drought while sharing one of their rooting volumes with an zzso zzso which in turn shared its other rooting volume with additional zzso zzso Following the zzso of zzso zzso allowed testing for stress responses in both the stressed plants and their zzso zzso 

In both zzso zzso plants and the three wild zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress or drought caused zzso closure in both the stressed plants and in their zzso zzso While both continuous zzso stress and drought induced prolonged zzso closure and limited zzso in stressed plants, their zzso zzso zzso to the stress cues and opened their zzso zzso h after the beginning of stress zzso 

The results demonstrate a novel type of plant communication, by which plants might be able to increase their readiness to probable future zzso and drought zzso Further work is zzso to decipher the identity and mode of operation of the involved communication zzso and to assess the potential ecological costs and benefits of emitting and zzso drought and zzso stress cues under various ecological zzso
