The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso omega-3 fatty acid zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso fatty acids in membrane zzso The zzso levels of the zzso zzso gene in zzso leaves rose rapidly after local wounding zzso zzso also induced the expression of the zzso gene in zzso To study zzso expression of the zzso gene in further detail, we analyzed transgenic tobacco plants carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso In zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was restricted to the zzso whose cells contained zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by local wounding treatments was more substantial in stems zzso and roots zzso of transgenic plants than it was in leaves zzso zzso zzso induction by wounding was observed in the overall zzso of stems and included zzso the zzso cortex, vascular system, and the zzso of the zzso Strong promoter activity was found zzso in the vascular zzso of wounded zzso These results indicate that wounding changes the spatial expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, salicylic acid and zzso zzso strongly suppressed the wound zzso of the zzso promoter in roots but not in leaves or zzso In zzso plants, zzso applied zzso zzso activated the zzso promoter in roots, whereas it zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso Taken together, zzso expression of the zzso gene in roots is thought to be zzso via the zzso pathway, whereas in leaves, zzso wound signals may induce the zzso of the zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso expression of the zzso gene in aerial and subterranean parts of plants is brought about by way of different signal zzso zzso
