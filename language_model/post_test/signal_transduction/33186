zzso is a member of a recently identified family of proteins named zzso for their ability to act as signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso growth factor or zzso receptors can cause zzso of zzso and zzso of specific responses to the zzso Here the presence of zzso has been examined in the rat zzso at different times during zzso development and adulthood by means of zzso and western zzso In addition, DNA binding activity at the zzso element that is present in the promoter of the zzso gene has been studied by zzso mobility shift zzso The results have shown that zzso zzso is abundant in the rat zzso zzso was found in the external zzso cell layer and also within the molecular layer from zzso day zzso 0 to zzso From zzso to the adult, the internal zzso cell layer and zzso cells were also stained for zzso Nuclear extracts were found to contain DNA binding activity to the zzso element during development and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso mediates the formation of one zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso signaling and is involved in maintaining zzso zzso expression in the zzso of the developing and adult rat under zzso zzso
