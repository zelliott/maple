The effects of zzso zzso growth zzso on membrane structure and functions of animal cells were zzso The process of signal zzso from cell surface to zzso structures and zzso changes in zzso in the presence of this substance were studied by light scatter and differential scanning zzso zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso signal system involved in the function of zzso zzso and zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso Being a zzso substance, zzso had little effect on the zzso phase of artificial zzso but impaired the function state of transformed zzso The importance of studies of transformed cells causes no doubt because of increasing zzso of diseases associated with uncontrolled cell zzso
