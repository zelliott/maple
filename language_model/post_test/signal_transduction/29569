zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso are zzso related zzso whose natural hosts are pigs and humans, zzso Adult infections of natural hosts are mild and rarely zzso However, both viruses are also able to zzso other zzso often with lethal zzso In this report, we use the paradigm of infection of a common zzso cell type and zzso analysis to determine if these two diverse zzso engage similar or different cellular pathways to obtain a common zzso productive zzso We compared cellular gene expression in zzso primary rat embryonic zzso that were mock infected or infected with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso by either virus affect the zzso of more than 1,500 cellular genes by zzso or zzso Few differences are detected early, and the majority of changes occur during the late stages of zzso zzso the transcripts of about 500 genes are regulated in common, while the rest are regulated in a zzso zzso Genes whose expression is affected by infection fall into a diverse group of functional classes and cellular zzso Furthermore, a comparison of the cellular response to zzso infection of primary human and rat zzso revealed unexpected diversity in the transcript zzso
