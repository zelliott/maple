The suggestion that zzso may function as signaling platforms arose from the presence of growth factor zzso such as the zzso in zzso isolated zzso raft zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso in the organization of zzso zzso we have performed zzso analyses using putative zzso raft markers such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was labeled using single domain zzso from zzso zzso that specifically bind the zzso without stimulating its zzso zzso Our zzso analyses demonstrate a zzso zzso of zzso with zzso which was not observed for the zzso zzso By contrast, a zzso zzso was observed for zzso with zzso In the resting state no zzso was observed between zzso and zzso but stimulation of the cell with zzso resulted in the zzso at the zzso level of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso induced the enrichment of zzso in a zzso zzso raft zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso of the two types of zzso zzso that might lead to the formation of signaling zzso
