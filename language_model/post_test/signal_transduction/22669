zzso are small highly zzso proteins in zzso especially abundant in zzso and typically enriched at zzso zzso Three genes in humans produce closely related zzso zzso all of which share a large zzso domain capable of zzso binding to zzso zzso Alpha zzso has been specifically implicated in neurodegenerative zzso Two point zzso are genetically linked to familial Parkinson's disease, and alpha zzso appears to form the major zzso component of zzso zzso Alpha zzso also contributes to the zzso inclusions of multiple system zzso and a zzso has been found in senile plaques in Alzheimer's zzso Although their normal cellular functions are unknown, several observations suggest the zzso may serve to integrate zzso signaling and membrane zzso Alpha zzso has been identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso zzso which produces zzso acid (to which zzso zzso and is believed to function in the zzso of zzso between the cell surface and zzso zzso We outline a hypothesis zzso zzso supports zzso zzso turnover of synaptic zzso Such a process may be important for lifelong learning and memory functions and may be especially vulnerable to disruption in zzso neurodegenerative zzso
