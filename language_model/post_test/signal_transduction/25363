Plant zzso zzso zzso are ubiquitous zzso zzso A precise analysis of zzso function in plants has been complicated by the presence of several family members with zzso cross zzso Previously we reported the isolation of zzso clones coding for the seven members of the tomato zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso B, C, D, zzso and zzso Here we report the complex spatial and zzso expression of one of the members, zzso zzso The zzso B promoter was zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso similarities were found to zzso sequences of genes zzso zzso active in the following zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and responsiveness to hormones and zzso fruit and seed zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso were constructed linking zzso B zzso zzso regions to the reporter zzso zzso zzso The zzso transgenic plants were zzso analyzed for zzso activity in various zzso and zzso zzso and evaluated for zzso B responsiveness to zzso zzso It was shown that zzso B expression was tissue specific, zzso zzso zzso zzso and localized predominantly to zzso or zzso zzso
