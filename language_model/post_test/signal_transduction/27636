We have examined potential mechanisms by which the zzso zzso acts as a zzso cell survival zzso zzso expression of the wild type 33 zzso zzso and 44 zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso cells prolonged survival after withdrawal of zzso while expression of a dominant negative zzso protein zzso shortened zzso Following removal of zzso zzso cells exhibited loss of zzso zzso potential and production of zzso oxygen species, as determined by flow zzso zzso The wild type zzso proteins decreased these changes while the dominant negative protein enhanced zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso could not be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso cells maintained expression of zzso zzso following zzso zzso while a substantial decrease was seen in zzso zzso To zzso zzso protein levels, a zzso zzso zzso construct was zzso with the wild type zzso zzso zzso cells with low cellular zzso protein levels had shortened zzso survival compared with zzso clones with high zzso zzso However survival of zzso cells after zzso withdrawal was substantially independent of cellular zzso protein zzso The 33 zzso protein delayed, and the 44 zzso protein completely prevented enhanced cell death associated with enforced expression of human zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that the 33 zzso zzso zzso may enhance cell survival through cooperation with and regulation of zzso In addition the 44 zzso zzso may regulate the expression or activity of other zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso
