Loss of zzso tissue triggers a zzso response in the whole zzso Under typical normal conditions, all zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso undergo one to three rounds of replication to establish the original number of cells and restore organ zzso The review summarizes the literature of zzso patterns in situations in which proliferation of either zzso or zzso zzso cells is zzso The evidence strongly suggests that under these circumstances, zzso or zzso zzso cells can function as zzso stem cells for each other and replenish the inhibited cellular compartment by a process of zzso involving complex signaling zzso These pathways are activated under experimental conditions in zzso and in zzso zzso associated with liver failure in zzso zzso analysis of these pathways has implications for liver biology and for potential therapeutic zzso in human liver zzso
