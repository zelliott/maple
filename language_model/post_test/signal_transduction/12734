Nerve injuries induce severe disability and suffering for zzso zzso zzso in nerve zzso zzso and the central nervous system are induced rapidly after zzso This includes zzso of zzso signal zzso mechanisms aiming at the transfer of the cells into a zzso state through the induction of the appropriate gene zzso The understanding of the zzso mechanisms that occur after injury can be used to design modern strategies for reconstruction after nerve zzso Signal zzso mechanisms for instance may be targets for pharmacological intervention to stimulate nerve zzso Nerve injuries, particularly where there is a zzso between the severed nerve trunks like in zzso zzso zzso remain a challenge for the zzso Reconstruction of nerve injuries with a zzso requires zzso of graft material, which can be of various zzso Application of zzso nerve zzso and use of nerve transfers are the most common clinical solutions to overcome problems with nerve zzso In this chapter we discuss the future perspective of nerve reconstruction with focus on signal zzso mechanisms and new avenues to bridge nerve defects using zzso graft zzso
