zzso bacterial pathogens deliver a variety of zzso proteins through the type III zzso system zzso directly into the host zzso These type III zzso zzso zzso play an essential role in bacterial infection, mainly by targeting host zzso However, the molecular basis of their zzso remains largely zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the widely distributed zzso zzso family, directly interacts with zzso zzso zzso proteins through the zzso zzso domain in plant zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes and major components of the zzso zzso zzso Upon interaction, zzso can be zzso by zzso through a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producing the zzso but not a zzso zzso of zzso promotes the degradation of zzso zzso and activates zzso signaling during bacterial zzso Furthermore, zzso could partially rescue the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that lacks the production of zzso a zzso zzso produced by a few zzso zzso zzso These results highlight a novel example by which a bacterial zzso directly manipulates the core regulators of zzso signaling to facilitate zzso The targeting of zzso zzso by both zzso toxin and zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso complex is potentially a major hub of host targets for bacterial zzso
