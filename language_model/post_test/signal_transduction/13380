The development of the gastrointestinal zzso tract and its associated zzso zzso depends on zzso signals from the zzso to the surrounding zzso During development, zzso signaling is essential for patterning the zzso tract along zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in maintenance of stem zzso Our knowledge about these roles for zzso signaling is derived from studies of zzso defects that result from disrupted or activated zzso signaling in model organisms including zzso zzso and zzso These studies provide evidence for distinct roles of specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso Studies in model organisms have also zzso how zzso signaling may function in development and function of the zzso tract in zzso Several diseases and zzso syndromes are known to result from genetic defects in zzso signaling zzso and this zzso may ultimately prove to be an important target for future diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
