zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The interaction between zzso on B zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 on T cells plays a major role in several aspects of the immune response, including zzso B cell zzso While it was originally believed that zzso played a purely adhesive role, recent evidence suggests that it can itself zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso results in the zzso of class II major zzso complex, and we investigate the zzso mechanism for the signaling role of zzso We show that zzso of zzso on the B zzso line zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso of several cellular zzso including the zzso family zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that Lyn zzso was activated within 1 zzso after zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso as determined by gel mobility zzso zzso of these zzso may represent important components in the cascade of signals that link zzso to various zzso cellular zzso These data confirm the important role of zzso as a signaling zzso in B cell zzso
