The unfolded protein response zzso is activated by zzso zzso stress resulting from an zzso of unfolded or zzso zzso The zzso is divided into three arms, involving the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that together act to restrict new protein synthesis and increase the production of zzso Recent studies have implicated the zzso and zzso components of the zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the importance of zzso during zzso using stable zzso of this protein in the model zzso cell line, zzso Reduction of zzso expression by zzso resulted in impaired expression of key zzso genes and reduced zzso zzso following the induction of zzso In contrast, loss of zzso did not impair the ability of cells to undergo zzso zzso Overall, our data indicate that all three arms of the zzso including zzso must be intact to permit zzso to zzso
