In zzso zzso discs, the function of the zzso zzso gene is required at multiple steps during the development of adult sensory zzso Here we report the results of a series of experiments designed to investigate the in zzso role of H in sensory organ precursor zzso cell zzso We show that the zzso cluster pattern of zzso gene expression and of zzso zzso by zzso proteins is established normally in the absence of H zzso By contrast, single cells with the high levels of zzso zzso and zzso expression characteristic of zzso almost always fail to appear in H zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that H is required for a relatively late step in the development of the zzso zzso zzso the stable commitment of a single cell to the zzso cell zzso We also show that expression of an activated form of the zzso zzso leads to bristle loss with the same cellular zzso of zzso zzso loss of H function and that simultaneous zzso of H suppresses this zzso Finally, we demonstrate by zzso experiments that the failure of stable commitment to the zzso fate in H zzso zzso requires the activity of the genes of the zzso of split complex, including zzso Our results indicate that H promotes zzso determination by zzso the activity of the zzso zzso in this cell, thereby protecting it from zzso signaling by its neighbors in the zzso zzso We propose a simple threshold model in which the principal role of H in zzso zzso is to translate a quantitative difference in the activity of the zzso zzso (in the zzso versus the zzso zzso into a stable zzso cell fate zzso
