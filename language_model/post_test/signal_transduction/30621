zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism along the zzso zzso zzso in some zzso cells zzso such as zzso DC zzso regulates zzso zzso It is unclear whether bone zzso zzso DC zzso express functional zzso The zzso expression was examined in zzso zzso differentiated from mouse bone zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso protein with the production of zzso oxide zzso in zzso in cultures for zzso In the zzso zzso using cellular extracts of zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso with zzso was enhanced by the addition of a NO zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity was suppressed by NO zzso On the other hand, the concentration of zzso in the culture zzso of zzso was not increased by stimulation with zzso zzso added zzso was taken up by zzso independently of zzso stimulation and NO production, and the zzso of zzso was inhibited by a transport system zzso inhibitor or high zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was markedly lower than that of zzso In conclusion, zzso activity in zzso is zzso by NO production, whereas zzso strongly take up zzso zzso
