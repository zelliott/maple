Respiratory abnormalities have been described in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso newborn zzso However, the neural mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have not been zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso may impair zzso expression in brain stem zzso involved in the control of zzso To do this, we analyzed brain stem zzso expression and respiratory zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso newborn mice during the first 2 h of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was absent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contribute to zzso respiratory frequency and in scattered cells of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript levels measured by quantitative zzso were lower in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso zzso brain stems zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Breath zzso were shorter in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso and were zzso correlated with zzso transcript levels zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide evidence that zzso is upstream of zzso in zzso brain stem zzso important for respiratory rhythm zzso
