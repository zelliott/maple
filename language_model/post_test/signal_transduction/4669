Several zzso growth factors zzso mediate zzso and zzso in cattle but it is unclear whether zzso are required during the final stages of zzso zzso The objectives of this work were to determine whether blocking zzso zzso zzso activity during in zzso maturation zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso zzso examine changes in zzso transcript profiles in zzso cells and zzso during zzso and evaluate whether zzso zzso zzso transcript abundance during zzso In the first set of studies, bovine zzso complexes zzso were matured in the presence of one of two zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso After zzso zzso were washed and cultured without zzso zzso did not affect zzso rates but the percentage of zzso zzso zzso at d 3 and zzso at d 7 and d 8 zzso were decreased when zzso were matured with either zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso cells and zzso separated either immediately before zzso zzso or at 6 or 21 h after beginning zzso In zzso cells, increases in zzso zzso and zzso abundance were detected when cultured in the absence of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso (1 or 25 zzso increased the abundance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso no zzso or zzso changes in zzso transcript abundance were zzso These observations zzso zzso as crucial components of bovine zzso competency and indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso abundance in zzso cells during the final stages of zzso zzso
