The concept of zzso zzso introduced 30 years ago to account for zzso mechanisms that can regulate contraction of smooth muscle independently of the membrane potential, has since been transformed from a definition into what we now recognize as a complex of zzso molecular zzso The release of zzso from the zzso by a chemical messenger, zzso is well known to be initiated not by zzso but by zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso zzso one of many processes covered by the umbrella of zzso zzso is part of complex and general signal zzso mechanisms also operating in many zzso cells of diverse zzso It is also clear that, although the major zzso regulatory mechanism of smooth muscle, zzso of zzso is zzso the activity of both the zzso and the zzso can also be modulated independently of zzso zzso to zzso is attributed to zzso of zzso a process most likely dominated by zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso that, in turn, activates zzso that zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso It is likely that the zzso phase of contraction activated by a variety of zzso zzso is, at least in part, zzso by this zzso zzso zzso to zzso can occur either through zzso zzso of zzso by other zzso or zzso and by zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso probably involving zzso of a zzso zzso Based on our current understanding of the complexity of the many zzso signal zzso mechanisms that operate in cells, it is likely that, in the future, our current concepts will be zzso additional mechanisms of zzso zzso will be zzso and those contributing to the zzso diseases, such as hypertension and zzso will be zzso
