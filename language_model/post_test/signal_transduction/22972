Sonic zzso zzso a zzso zzso implicated in embryonic tissue zzso displays zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities on various neural zzso zzso might exert its biological functions through binding to patched zzso associated with zzso zzso leading to downstream zzso of target genes such as the zzso factor zzso We have performed a detailed zzso of cells expressing transcripts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in brain and spinal zzso of the adult rat as well as in the developing zzso In the adult, zzso cells were mainly observed in zzso structures, in the zzso cells of the zzso and in motor zzso zzso cells were frequently observed in brain areas devoid of any zzso zzso except in the median zzso or the facial nucleus, suggesting local zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso transcripts were predominantly present within zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso zzso and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso areas may indicate a role of zzso zzso in the zzso of neuroendocrine zzso The expression pattern of these three genes as well as of zzso and their zzso regulation in the zzso suggest a possible role for zzso zzso in the control of various cell populations within the zzso particularly in zzso cell proliferation and/or differentiation that might be impaired in zzso states such as zzso
