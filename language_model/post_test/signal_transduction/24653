Most of the zzso in the nuclear envelope are contained in the double nuclear zzso and this has an active zzso metabolism consistent with its origins as a component of the zzso zzso zzso However, even after removal of the nuclear membrane with detergents, some zzso mostly of unknown location and function, zzso zzso these are all of the components of what appears to be a nuclear zzso zzso system, distinct from the well-established zzso zzso found in the plasma zzso The consequences for nuclear function of the zzso of these two zzso pathways are discussed, with a detailed consideration of proposed zzso functions for protein zzso C, and the maintenance of nuclear zzso zzso
