zzso 4 zzso insulin, and zzso growth factor I zzso efficiently induced DNA synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Although these factors could not individually sustain long-term growth of these lines, a combination of zzso with either insulin or zzso did support continuous zzso The principal zzso zzso observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso previously designated zzso was of the same size zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso in response to insulin or zzso These zzso had zzso of the same size when analyzed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and each tightly associated with the zzso component of zzso zzso after factor zzso zzso the principal zzso zzso in response to insulin or zzso stimulation in zzso cells, is similar in size to zzso However, zzso zzso failed to efficiently zzso zzso and some zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso were distinct in size from the zzso of zzso Nevertheless, zzso insulin, and zzso were capable of stimulating zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells that expressed this zzso as a result of zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso insulin, and zzso use signal zzso pathways in zzso lines that have at least one major feature in common, the rapid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso insulin and zzso stimulation of zzso cell lines leads to the zzso of a zzso that may be related to but is not identical to zzso
