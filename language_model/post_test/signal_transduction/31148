zzso zzso tolerance seems to be a zzso zzso trait in zzso zzso In order to identify genes potentially implicated in zzso zzso a zzso zzso segregating population was produced from crosses between zzso zzso zzso zzso and its closest zzso relative zzso zzso zzso zzso The most sensitive and tolerant zzso of the zzso were zzso on a zzso scale by zzso zzso length zzso zzso A hundred and zzso genes expressed more in the root of tolerant zzso than in sensitive zzso were zzso Most of the identified genes showed no regulation in their expression when exposed to zzso in a zzso culture medium and belonged to diverse functional classes, including zzso oxygen species zzso detoxification, cellular repair, metal zzso water zzso signal zzso zzso regulation, and protein degradation, which are zzso
