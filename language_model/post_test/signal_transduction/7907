zzso of signal zzso pathways leading to zzso zzso has been performed in zzso zzso In such zzso the implication of an zzso zzso is demonstrated by the loss of zzso zzso upon its depletion and the restoration of zzso zzso upon its zzso Two major limitations in the wide use of this approach have been the availability of zzso zzso and the functional zzso for many classes of zzso molecules zzso by zzso zzso To circumvent these limitations, we developed extracts derived from zzso zzso cells, which are competent for zzso zzso In this system, depleted extracts are simply obtained from cells cultured with long double stranded zzso in the zzso We validated the method by showing that beads coated with the zzso domain of zzso were no longer able to trigger zzso zzso in an extract depleted of the zzso zzso We also examined the complete set of zzso small zzso of the zzso family for their ability to zzso zzso in such zzso and found that only zzso was able to induce zzso zzso Using zzso depleted zzso we confirmed that zzso triggers zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso
