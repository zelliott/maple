The zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is rapidly induced in zzso zzso zzso following a light zzso The transient induction is followed by several cycles of a zzso zzso zzso transferred to continuous light are known to exhibit a robust zzso rhythm of zzso zzso The precise zzso of zzso expression in zzso cycles, however, reflects a regulatory network that zzso information from zzso from the zzso clock and possibly from a zzso zzso We have used the zzso reporter system to investigate zzso expression with high time zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression in zzso plants exhibits a transient induction following light zzso similar to the response in zzso zzso The zzso rhythm zzso the magnitude and the zzso of the response to light, such that the zzso promoter is not light responsive during the zzso zzso A signaling zzso from the zzso zzso must therefore antagonize the zzso pathways controlling the zzso zzso We have further demonstrated that the phase of zzso zzso expression is delayed in zzso cycles with long zzso due to the zzso of the zzso zzso Under short zzso this pattern of zzso ensures that dawn zzso with a phase of high light zzso whereas under long zzso the light response at dawn is zzso
