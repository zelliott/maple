zzso receptors are expressed in smooth muscle throughout the zzso In most instances, the zzso zzso population in smooth muscle is composed of mainly the zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso and calcium zzso whereas the zzso zzso mediates an zzso of zzso zzso In addition, a variety of zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso zzso and dependent on zzso The zzso zzso of this response suggests that it is zzso by zzso zzso Following zzso induced zzso of smooth muscle, zzso dependent calcium channels are activated to enable an influx of zzso In some instances, zzso zzso enhance this zzso through a mechanism involving protein zzso C, whereas in other instances, zzso zzso suppress this calcium zzso zzso muscle often contains calcium activated zzso channels that tend to zzso the membrane following calcium zzso zzso of zzso receptors suppresses this zzso zzso in some smooth zzso Under standard conditions, zzso zzso elicit zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso When most of the zzso receptors are zzso it is possible to measure a zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso that is most likely zzso through zzso zzso zzso receptors also cause an indirect contraction by zzso the zzso effects of agents that increase zzso zzso zzso and zzso
