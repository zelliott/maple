The zzso zzso target of zzso zzso exists in two zzso complexes zzso and zzso and is a central regulator of growth and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sclerosis complex 1/2 zzso zzso a negative feedback loop that ultimately zzso zzso We present a zzso dynamic zzso network model that zzso the entire core network and used this model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by which insulin regulates zzso By analyzing the effects of zzso targeting several levels within the network in zzso and zzso we found that, in contrast to current zzso the zzso complex was not a direct or indirect zzso through the negative feedback zzso regulator of zzso Although zzso zzso required active zzso this was not affected by the negative feedback zzso zzso we propose an zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that regulates zzso This putative zzso predicts that zzso would be zzso to zzso which zzso zzso and, indeed, we found that zzso was insensitive to zzso zzso zzso in several cell zzso Our results suggest that a previously unknown network structure connects zzso to its upstream cues and zzso which molecular zzso contribute to zzso zzso
