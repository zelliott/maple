The zzso protein of zzso zzso is unique in its ability to sense and transmit zzso signals as well as light zzso By functioning as zzso to the zzso zzso zzso it regulates the expression of photosynthesis genes in response to these environmental zzso Here we show binding of the zzso zzso to a domain in the zzso part of zzso and zzso activity of bound zzso This is supported by the findings that: zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso coli shows zzso at 411 zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and 556 zzso after reduction with zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso reveals that the zzso binding domain is important for normal expression levels of photosynthesis genes and for normal light regulation in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso affects the interaction of the zzso part of zzso to zzso but also its interaction to the zzso light sensing zzso zzso Based on this we present a model for the transmission of light and zzso signals by zzso
