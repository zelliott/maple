A host of growth factors have been implicated in vascular zzso one such factor is zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso Although zzso has been shown to stimulate zzso and zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso its signaling mechanism remains zzso In this study, we examined possible signal zzso pathways by which zzso leads to zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with maximum zzso at zzso to 1 minute, whereas zzso the other zzso to which zzso zzso was not activated on zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It also activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso To investigate signaling molecules involved in zzso DNA zzso we zzso zzso with the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These zzso significantly blocked zzso DNA zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso whereas it had no effect on zzso zzso by zzso By contrast, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso by zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso requires both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways activated through zzso thereby providing a new zzso insight by which zzso contributes to vascular zzso
