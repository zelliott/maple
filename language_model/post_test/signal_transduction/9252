zzso plays a critical role during zzso development and zzso zzso sympathetic zzso depend on nerve growth factor zzso for survival during the late embryonic and early zzso period and die by zzso in its zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso increases in level after zzso withdrawal and is required for zzso zzso zzso The regulation of zzso expression in zzso is complex and this study describes a new mechanism by which an zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso gene expression in sympathetic zzso 

We report that zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso pathway, increases zzso zzso levels in sympathetic zzso in the presence of zzso We find that this effect is independent of zzso and zzso zzso and is not zzso by the promoter, first zzso or first zzso of the zzso zzso By performing 3' zzso and zzso experiments with a new zzso reporter zzso we show that zzso increases zzso expression via the zzso 3' zzso We demonstrate that this effect does not involve a change in zzso zzso stability and by using zzso a specific zzso zzso we show that this mechanism involves the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso independently reduces cell survival in zzso sympathetic zzso 

These results suggest that in sympathetic zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso expression via the 3' zzso and that this regulation is likely to be at the level of zzso This data provides further insight into the different mechanisms by which survival zzso pathways regulate zzso expression in zzso
