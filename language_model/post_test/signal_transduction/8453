Electric fields were measured at human skin wounds over one and half centuries zzso Modern techniques have verified and greatly extended our understanding of the existence of zzso wound electric zzso In virtually all wounds zzso disruption of an zzso layer zzso generates zzso electric zzso As electric fields have the intrinsic property of being zzso it has long been proposed that these fields may serve as a directional signal guiding cell migration in wound zzso We have established several experimental systems to study the guidance effects and mechanisms of electric fields on cell zzso Most types of cells migrate zzso in a small electric field, a phenomenon called zzso zzso electric fields of strength equal to those detected at in zzso wounds direct cell migration and override some other zzso zzso guidance cues such as contact zzso The naturally occurring zzso electric fields therefore may be an important signaling mechanism that regulates directional cell movement in zzso zzso electric fields may have a potential clinical role in guiding cell migration in wound zzso The magnitude and direction of the electric field can be more precisely and quickly changed than most other guidance cues such as chemical zzso Application of electric fields thus offers a robust experimental system for study of directional cell migration with extensive zzso We present a brief review of the background and describe the experimental system for studying zzso
