zzso of foreign DNA by zzso innate immune receptors triggers the production of zzso However, it is unclear whether different types of DNA zzso are recognized by similar receptors and whether the resulting response is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso To address these questions, we compared the two most commonly used types of DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso and assessed the minimal structural requirements for zzso capacity in zzso zzso Gene expression signatures and competition experiments suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso indistinguishable and differ from the zzso zzso triggering the zzso zzso zzso - activity relationship analyses revealed that a minimal length of two zzso turns is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso while zzso at the zzso is zzso Altogether, our data suggest that, in zzso zzso only one major zzso DNA recognition zzso is zzso
