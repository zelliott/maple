zzso is a potent zzso zzso but its mechanism remains to be zzso We investigated the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, from an zzso zzso cell line, expressed a high amount of zzso zzso but did not express the zzso protein because of protein zzso We isolated clones expressing the zzso level of the zzso protein from zzso zzso cells by zzso The obtained clones showed reduced zzso activity and reduced zzso cell growth with the zzso zzso These cell lines were zzso to zzso by zzso A low concentration of zzso did not affect zzso but a high concentration zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso in these cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the parental cell line, but not in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso reduced the levels of zzso and zzso zzso in all the cell lines, but the reduction was most significant in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso might be associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso
