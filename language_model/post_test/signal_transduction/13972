The rapid induction and orchestration of new blood vessels are critical for tissue repair in response to injury, such as zzso zzso and for zzso zzso responses, such as embryonic development and zzso 

We aimed to identify and characterize zzso zzso that regulate pathological and zzso zzso 

We show that zzso regulates pathological and zzso zzso by targeting zzso cell zzso bone zzso zzso signaling in zzso and in zzso zzso expression is increased in a model of acute zzso zzso in mice and in human subjects with acute coronary zzso zzso expression of zzso markedly induced zzso cycle arrest and inhibited zzso migration, zzso zzso and network tube formation in zzso whereas blockade of zzso had the opposite zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso the bone zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso by binding to the zzso zzso region, an effect that decreased expression of zzso and increased zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso inhibited formation of the zzso vein zzso a bone zzso zzso process, an effect rescued by zzso zzso zzso In mice, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso Furthermore, systemic intravenous administration of an zzso zzso locked zzso zzso increased zzso expression and rapidly induced robust zzso within 2 days, an effect associated with reduced zzso zzso size and improved heart zzso 

These findings establish zzso as a regulator of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, and that manipulating zzso expression could provide a new target for rapid zzso therapy in zzso disease zzso
