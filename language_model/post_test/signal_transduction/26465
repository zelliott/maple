zzso growth factor 21 zzso is a potent zzso regulator, and pharmacological administration elicits zzso and zzso lowering responses in zzso To delineate if zzso tissue is the zzso organ responsible for zzso effects of zzso we treated mice with reduced body fat zzso mice with zzso specific expression of active zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso mice, zzso mice were zzso to the beneficial effects of zzso on body weight, zzso mass, plasma insulin and zzso zzso To determine if zzso mass was critical for these effects, we transplanted zzso white zzso tissue zzso into zzso mice and treated the mice with zzso After zzso zzso responsiveness was completely restored in zzso transplanted zzso mice compared to sham zzso zzso Further, zzso treatment alone was sufficient to restore the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso mice revealed normal zzso expression of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling indicated that residual zzso tissue of zzso mice was resistant to zzso whilst normal zzso signaling was observed in zzso zzso Together these data suggest that zzso tissue is required for the zzso and zzso but not the cholesterol lowering efficacy of zzso and that zzso and zzso exert additive zzso effects in zzso zzso
