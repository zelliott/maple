zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso activates complement via the alternative zzso and also serves as a preferential zzso site for zzso zzso The molecular basis for this phenomenon, which has recently been demonstrated for B zzso in zzso is currently not zzso Here we present a model for this zzso complement zzso The inactive zzso zzso which forms spontaneously in serum in low amounts by reaction of native zzso with zzso binds zzso to the zzso part of zzso zzso association of zzso and factor B, and zzso of factor B by factor D lead to formation of a zzso zzso associated with zzso thus zzso zzso zzso deposition to zzso zzso This model is supported by the following experimental zzso 1) By zzso analysis and zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso and factor B bound to zzso on zzso B cells, zzso T cells, and peripheral blood B zzso 2) Both binding of these proteins and complement zzso by zzso cells were reduced in parallel by zzso against zzso 3) zzso zzso was zzso deposited on zzso when zzso active zzso zzso was added to zzso cells zzso with zzso factor B, zzso and factor D, thus proving functionality of zzso zzso zzso This model of zzso zzso activity formed on zzso zzso zzso for zzso factor offers an explanation for the deposition of zzso found on zzso zzso
