B zzso factor belonging to the zzso family zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso plays a role in zzso after zzso with zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso interactions are critical for B cell regulation, and signaling from this zzso complex results in zzso zzso Most zzso transmit signals zzso by recruitment of zzso proteins called zzso factors zzso However, zzso binds only one zzso zzso zzso and this interaction zzso regulates zzso of zzso In this study, we report the crystal structure of a zzso zzso of the zzso portion of zzso bound in complex with zzso The recognition motif zzso in zzso is zzso in the same binding zzso on zzso that binds two related zzso zzso and zzso but is presented in a completely different structural zzso This region of zzso assumes an open zzso with two extended strands opposed at right angles that each make contacts with zzso The recognition motif is located in the zzso arm and zzso contacts mediate zzso zzso In the zzso arm, key stabilizing contacts are made, including critical hydrogen bonds with zzso in zzso that define the molecular basis for selective binding of zzso solely to this member of the zzso zzso A dynamic zzso adjustment of zzso in zzso occurs forming a new zzso contact with zzso that zzso the zzso The structure of the complex provides a molecular explanation for binding affinities and selective protein interactions in zzso zzso
