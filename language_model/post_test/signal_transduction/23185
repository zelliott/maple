zzso large zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso diagnostic category with distinct molecular zzso that can be defined by gene expression zzso However, even within these defined zzso zzso zzso To further zzso the zzso of these entities, we determined the expression of the tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 248 primary zzso patient zzso These analyses revealed that loss of zzso was zzso in zzso of zzso center zzso zzso zzso whereas this zzso was found in only zzso of zzso zzso patient zzso In zzso zzso the zzso status was zzso correlated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso in both zzso cell lines and primary patient zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell line models by zzso zzso zzso indicating an addiction to this zzso in this subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso rescued zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso identifying a regulatory mechanism of zzso expression in zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso resulted in toxicity selectively in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso loss defines a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is addicted to zzso and zzso signaling and suggest that zzso zzso of zzso might represent a promising therapeutic approach in these zzso
