Loss of zzso zzso and the acquisition of zzso characteristics may contribute to zzso formation during zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways control tissue zzso and tumor development in the zzso The relationship between the activity of these pathways and the expression of zzso and zzso markers was investigated in a series of primary zzso tumors and their corresponding zzso 

zzso samples of primary zzso tumors, normal zzso zzso and regional and systemic zzso were processed for zzso in a tissue zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso markers was related to markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso status was zzso 

When compared to normal zzso primary zzso tumors showed a marked increase in the levels of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso and zzso Increased zzso expression correlated with the presence of zzso zzso and with nuclear zzso The corresponding liver, zzso zzso brain and lung zzso did not express zzso and displayed significantly lower levels of nuclear zzso and zzso while retaining nuclear zzso 

zzso zzso zzso display zzso expression of zzso and have activated zzso and zzso signaling zzso Surprisingly, many regional and distant zzso have lost nuclear zzso and zzso suggesting that the activity of the zzso and zzso pathways is reduced in secondary zzso zzso
