Several members of the zzso family of protein zzso zzso have a zzso dual zzso motif which specifies their zzso and zzso These zzso modifications are necessary for correct zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and to zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso Using zzso of the zzso dual zzso motif with two normally zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso we show here that this motif is sufficient to zzso correct zzso modification and to target these zzso to the plasma zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso are resistant to extraction with cold zzso zzso indicating targeting to zzso zzso in the plasma zzso The dual zzso motif has potential for targeting proteins to specific plasma membrane zzso involved in zzso
