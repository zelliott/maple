zzso assembly is subject to the regulatory controls of both the zzso machinery and the zzso zzso An important question is how the two regulatory pathways communicate with each other to achieve coordinated regulation in zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso the zzso located in or near the nuclear zzso signal zzso of human zzso the zzso exchange factor for zzso This zzso is necessary for zzso to generate zzso on zzso zzso in zzso cells, which in turn is required for zzso assembly and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso of zzso is required to prevent the binding of zzso alpha and beta to zzso thereby allowing zzso to couple zzso production to zzso zzso These findings reveal that the zzso machinery directly regulates the zzso zzso by placing a high zzso concentration on the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
