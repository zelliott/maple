zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso and growth factor zzso pathways that regulates a number of the biological processes involved in zzso zzso invasion and zzso such as cell zzso migration and zzso Its zzso might play a role in the zzso of invasive zzso but its involvement in human lung cancer zzso has not yet been zzso We zzso compared zzso expression and zzso in 60 zzso and zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso with that in the surrounding zzso tissue and in a further five microscopically normal zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso determined by real-time zzso in frozen tissue specimens of all of the zzso and 21 matched zzso lung zzso and protein expression in 16 zzso of the matched zzso specimens was evaluated by Western zzso The three different techniques showed that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso lung zzso and zzso in zzso Moreover, Western zzso and real-time zzso indicated a statistically significant correlation between zzso zzso and higher disease stages zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso is zzso in zzso and suggest its potential involvement in lung cancer zzso
