zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso express the key guidance molecules responsible for zzso targeting of retinal zzso However, the extent to which the zzso zzso are themselves influenced by retinal zzso and visual experience remains zzso Using zzso live imaging of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso of neural activity and sensory zzso zzso zzso were observed to exhibit spontaneous calcium zzso that were modulated by visual zzso zzso zzso zzso extended and zzso many zzso processes within the zzso zzso over zzso These processes zzso with zzso zzso and their zzso was modulated by zzso oxide zzso signaling downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual zzso These findings provide the first in zzso demonstration that zzso zzso actively respond both structurally and functionally to neural activity, via zzso NO release during the period of retinal zzso zzso
