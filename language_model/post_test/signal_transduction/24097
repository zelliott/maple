zzso oxide zzso is a highly zzso zzso that rapidly zzso and permeates cell zzso In animals, NO is implicated in a number of diverse zzso zzso such as zzso vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and zzso zzso It may have beneficial effects, zzso as a zzso in immune responses, but it is also potentially toxic when the zzso system is overwhelmed and zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso During the last few years, NO has been detected in several plant species, and an increasing number of reports on its function have implicated NO as an important zzso in plant growth, development, and zzso The broad chemistry of NO involves an array of interrelated zzso forms with different chemical zzso and numerous potential biological targets in zzso NO signaling functions depend on its zzso zzso are key zzso of NO in triggering cell death, but the nature of the mechanisms by which this occurs in plants is different from those commonly observed in zzso This review focuses on the signaling functions of zzso when channeled through the cell death zzso by zzso
