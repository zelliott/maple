zzso a widely abused substance, elicits zzso zzso behavioral responses in a zzso manner in zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying such behavioral sensitivity to ethanol are poorly zzso While zzso behavioral genetic screening is successful in identifying genes in zzso models, such complex zzso screening has proven difficult for recovering genes in zzso Here we report a novel and zzso ethanol response in zzso Using this zzso camouflage response as a screening zzso we have identified a zzso zzso named zzso zzso which displays reduced behavioral sensitivity to zzso zzso cloning reveals that fan encodes type 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to maintain the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso structures, including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso mimics the reduction in sensitivity to zzso effects of ethanol observed in the fan zzso zzso zzso strong zzso of zzso of zzso renders a zzso dose of ethanol zzso Since previous studies in zzso and mice show a role of zzso signaling in suppressing behavioral sensitivity to ethanol, our findings reveal a novel, zzso role of zzso signaling in promoting ethanol sensitivity, and suggest that the zzso level of the downstream zzso zzso is a critical zzso of behavioral sensitivity to zzso
