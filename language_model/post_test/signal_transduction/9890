The zzso zzso zzso zzso is commonly zzso in human cancer, making it an attractive target for novel zzso zzso We have used a mouse model of zzso cancer generated by zzso zzso and zzso deletion in the zzso surface zzso for the zzso assessment of a novel zzso inhibitor zzso To enable higher zzso studies, we developed an zzso primary transplant model from these mice and evaluated therapeutic response to zzso using zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth at 7 days by zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed that zzso reduced zzso metabolism dramatically, suggesting zzso may be exploited as an imaging zzso of target zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also dramatically inhibited following zzso zzso However, as a single agent, zzso did not induce tumor zzso and the long-term efficacy was zzso with tumor proliferation continuing in the presence of drug zzso We hypothesized that tumor progression was because of zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso downstream of zzso expression promoting cell survival and that the therapeutic effect of zzso would be enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso using zzso This combination induced striking tumor regression, zzso associated with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and greatly improved duration of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso converting tumor growth zzso to tumor zzso in a mouse model of zzso cancer driven by zzso loss and zzso zzso
