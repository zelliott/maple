zzso plasma membrane structures, such as zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso trafficking zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso from zzso zzso mast cells that contain several markers common to zzso including a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso causes a significant increase in the amount of zzso associated with these zzso membrane zzso Under our standard conditions for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the majority of the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso complexes are found at a higher density in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is accompanied by increased zzso zzso of several proteins in the zzso membrane zzso as well as enhanced in zzso zzso zzso activity toward these proteins and an zzso zzso With a lower zzso ratio during zzso significant zzso zzso zzso remains associated with these membrane zzso consistent with the ability to zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso under similar zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Metzger, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 91, zzso These results indicate that specialized membrane zzso may be directly involved in the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso of signaling zzso
