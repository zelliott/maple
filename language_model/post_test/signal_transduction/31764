zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso expressed by zzso and zzso zzso in response to mechanical stimulation and zzso hormone zzso Whether and how zzso expression influences bone zzso however, remains zzso We investigated the skeletal response of adult zzso and zzso mice to intermittent zzso Compared with zzso zzso mice had a lower bone mass, cortical bone volume, and strength response to zzso zzso zzso zzso were all significantly lower in zzso mice, particularly at the zzso Furthermore, in zzso stimulation of zzso signaling by zzso as evaluated in zzso reporter mice, was inhibited in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso and zzso zzso expression in bone and zzso in zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso which was zzso through the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso In turn, administration of a zzso zzso partially restored the zzso increase in bone mass in zzso zzso In addition, primary zzso from zzso mice showed a lower zzso zzso and migration, both spontaneously and in response to zzso zzso gene expression levels confirmed a zzso of zzso zzso differentiation with and without zzso as well as an increased zzso zzso in the absence of zzso These data zzso the complex role of zzso on bone zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
