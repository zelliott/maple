In this work, we have zzso the lateral diffusion of activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso on cell membrane for studying its zzso zzso After zzso zzso the mobility of individual zzso molecules was measured and compared with that in the cells disrupted of zzso pits and zzso the two zzso membrane zzso The results implicated that activated zzso molecules associated with zzso pits but not zzso at low doses of zzso whereas they were located in these two zzso at high zzso zzso It provided supporting evidence for the occurrence of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
