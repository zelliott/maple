Although zzso plays a central role in plant development, little is known about the signal zzso pathways triggered by zzso regulating cell zzso division and zzso We describe the molecular analysis of the zzso tobacco line zzso zzso which was zzso from an zzso callus created by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso plant gene zzso 4 zzso division of zzso zzso zzso from external zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso expression of zzso 4 and cell division are zzso zzso zzso 4 encodes a 109 zzso protein with significant zzso to a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso 4 or another member of the CCC family, the zzso from zzso triggers zzso growth of tobacco zzso We suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso cell division and that this function is highly zzso between zzso 4 and the shark zzso We also demonstrate that a zzso zzso of zzso 4 is sufficient to promote zzso cell division, showing that the zzso of zzso are functional zzso triggering cell zzso This may allow a molecular dissection of this process not only in plants but also in animal zzso
