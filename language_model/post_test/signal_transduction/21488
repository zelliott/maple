zzso is a zzso zzso composed of a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has zzso activity, inducing zzso zzso from activated zzso T cells and stimulating the proliferation of memory zzso T zzso We investigated the zzso role of zzso in zzso T cells in mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso an animal model of spontaneous zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the inflamed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing mouse zzso zzso significantly accelerated this joint inflammation and joint zzso zzso further increased the production of zzso which induced zzso production and zzso expression in zzso zzso T cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso abolished the zzso production induced by zzso in zzso zzso The process of zzso zzso production in zzso T cells was zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso did not participate in the zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a link between zzso and zzso zzso seems to be a central zzso zzso in the zzso of this zzso model of spontaneous zzso Its zzso signaling zzso could be useful therapeutic targets in the treatment of zzso zzso
