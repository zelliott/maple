zzso zzso located in the central nervous system zzso plays an important role in synaptic function, zzso zzso and survival of zzso and zzso acting on the zzso zzso zzso However, the functional role of zzso signaling in the zzso and blood pressure regulation is unknown, particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso Thus, we investigated whether zzso signaling in the zzso is involved in blood pressure zzso 

zzso of zzso into the zzso decreased zzso blood pressure, heart rate zzso and zzso sympathetic nerve activity zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of an zzso or zzso inhibitor into the zzso increased zzso pressure, HR, and zzso zzso expression levels in the zzso were significantly lower in spontaneously zzso rats zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso responses to the zzso inhibitor were significantly smaller in zzso than in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso by zzso interference significantly increased zzso pressure, HR, and urinary zzso zzso in conscious zzso rats zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that the zzso signaling in the zzso has zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso may contribute to the neural mechanisms of zzso
