The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso is important for both cell growth and zzso In particular, an impaired regulation of the zzso axis has been strongly implicated in mechanisms related to zzso zzso through enhancement of cell proliferation and zzso zzso syndromes zzso are a group of zzso zzso stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective zzso and by a high risk of evolution into acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso of the zzso evolution into zzso is still zzso although some recent studies indicate that zzso zzso of survival signaling pathways could be zzso In this investigation, done by means of zzso zzso we report an zzso of the zzso zzso in high-risk zzso zzso Interestingly, not only zzso was activated but also its downstream targets, zzso protein 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the selective zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso cell death of zzso (but not zzso cells from high-risk zzso zzso zzso was ineffective in cells from healthy donors or low-risk zzso Moreover, incubation of high-risk zzso patient zzso cells with zzso decreased the in zzso zzso capability of these zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect the zzso activity of high-risk zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso zzso is critical for cell survival and proliferation in high-risk zzso zzso zzso this signaling network could become an interesting therapeutic target for treating more advanced zzso zzso
