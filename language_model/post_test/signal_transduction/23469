zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso has been used in Chinese folk medicine as an zzso zzso zzso and to suppress inflammatory zzso In the present study we aimed to provide scientific evidence for the zzso properties of CM extract and evaluate the intrinsic mechanisms involved in both in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso In in zzso findings, CM significantly inhibited the zzso release of zzso zzso such as zzso oxide, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso of inflammatory responses in zzso zzso cells by CM was closely associated with the suppression of nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso degradation, and zzso of zzso CM treatment also attenuated the zzso of zzso through zzso dependent pathways in zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that CM extract concentration zzso suppressed the zzso zzso vascular zzso in zzso Considering the data obtained regulation of multiple signaling mechanisms involving zzso and zzso pathways might be responsible for the potent zzso action of zzso zzso its traditional use in inflammatory zzso
