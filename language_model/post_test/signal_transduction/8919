Exposure to zzso has been implicated in the compromised immune function in space zzso resulting in opportunistic infections, poor wound healing, and zzso Since recent studies have suggested that zzso was capable of modulating immune responses, the purpose of this study was to examine effects of zzso on the zzso and proliferation of rat lung zzso and then to examine the effects of zzso signal zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso in these same zzso In control conditions zzso cultured zzso zzso was not able by itself to increase zzso zzso or induce significant increase of either zzso production or expression of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso while it markedly enhanced the positive effects induced on these parameters by zzso A zzso Using zzso rotating wall vessel zzso zzso to simulate a zzso environment, we found that zzso responsiveness was zzso Moreover, under these conditions, zzso was not able to reverse these impaired zzso zzso with the above cited zzso effects exerted by the simulated zzso environment, evidence was also obtained of defects in zzso zzso signal zzso induced by the incubation in zzso zzso namely concerning decreased zzso zzso activity, and reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso Again, zzso appeared to be unable in restoring a zzso increase of these zzso different from what could be observed after zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso which instead demonstrated to overcome the zzso of zzso zzso functions, in the presence of simulated zzso zzso
