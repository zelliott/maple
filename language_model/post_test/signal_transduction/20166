zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in both zzso and zzso reactions in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso reaction proceeds in the same cellular zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is induced through two independent zzso zzso by continuous light and by zzso plus zzso light zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso can be replaced by zzso zzso that are not even zzso in a zzso zzso of transcripts in deletion zzso suggested that both a zzso zzso zzso and a response regulator, zzso played important roles as signal components in zzso expression under zzso conditions, but not under zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso in which zzso expression was enhanced demonstrated that zzso expression was induced at least partially even without zzso but for its further induction a zzso light stimulus was zzso These results substantiated that there are two zzso regulatory pathways for zzso gene expression in this zzso
