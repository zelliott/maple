zzso provides a zzso signal that zzso with the zzso complex to induce T cell zzso zzso production, and zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso directly regulates progression of T zzso through the cell zzso Although a number of signaling pathways have been linked to the zzso and to zzso it is not known how these two receptors cooperate to induce cell cycle zzso Here, using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso we show that cell cycle progression of primary T zzso requires simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso abundance of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which requires simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso was dependent upon both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso alone, resulted in zzso of zzso targets zzso zzso zzso 1/2, whereas zzso of zzso alone was sufficient for zzso of zzso target protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso alone was also sufficient to mediate zzso zzso of zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, direct zzso of zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso but not in the presence of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso gene product, and cellular zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso target zzso could substitute for zzso but not for zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso links zzso to cell cycle progression and suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals from zzso and zzso in primary T zzso
