To date, the only reported genetic zzso identified in the zzso disorder, zzso syndrome, is a zzso in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso syndrome is clinically and genetically zzso and whether defects in zzso significantly contribute to zzso syndrome is zzso zzso we characterize zzso cells for their response to DNA zzso zzso cells display impaired zzso of zzso zzso impaired zzso checkpoint arrest and elevated zzso zzso formation following exposure to zzso and agents that cause replication zzso We describe a novel zzso designated nuclear fragmentation zzso that occurs following replication zzso Finally, we report that zzso cells have an zzso increased number of zzso in zzso cells demonstrating a novel role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso We exploit these zzso to examine cell lines derived from additional unrelated zzso syndrome zzso We show that impaired zzso of zzso zzso is a common but not zzso feature of zzso syndrome cell zzso In contrast, all cell lines displayed defective zzso arrest, increased levels of zzso and MN formation following exposure to agents that cause replication zzso All the zzso syndrome cell lines examined showed increased zzso zzso zzso Though zzso zzso can complement the defects in zzso cells, it failed to complement any of the additional cell zzso We conclude that zzso syndrome represents a further damage response disorder that is uniquely associated with defects in the zzso zzso resulting in failed checkpoint arrest following exposure to replication fork zzso
