To investigate the expression of the zzso of collagen regulation pathways zzso tissue growth factor zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in women with zzso zzso and a study of the clinic zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was detected by zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue of 30 women with zzso zzso including ten cases of zzso ten cases of zzso ten cases of zzso and 20 cases were control group with zzso and zzso zzso 

There was a negative correlation between the zzso and expression of zzso With the increase of zzso degree, the expression degree of zzso decreased zzso which also applied to zzso and zzso On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso The synergistic change trend was found between zzso and zzso It could also be seen between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso 

The expression of the zzso zzso in pelvic support structure of POP women was zzso which resulted in the zzso zzso It could break the balance of zzso and zzso in pelvic support structure, and may induce an increase of zzso level and the zzso of zzso zzso It could inhibit the zzso of collagen and injury the pelvic support structure, thus promoting the occurrence and development of zzso
