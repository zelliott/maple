zzso zzso zzso expression is now recognized to contribute in the zzso of vascular zzso Because increased zzso has been associated with zzso zzso effects of zzso cells and zzso with respect to zzso regulation may be of clinical zzso In the present study, zzso cells are shown to markedly increase zzso on zzso zzso T cells with a more modest effect on memory T zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso cell zzso but inhibited memory cell zzso Although it has previously been recognized that human zzso cells can increase zzso zzso this is the first description of the difference in responses of zzso and memory cells and the first demonstration of synergistic effects of zzso cells and zzso on zzso zzso zzso with previous reports that zzso regulation is distinctive, another marker of early zzso zzso was not similarly zzso The mechanisms of zzso regulation were related to zzso and zzso dependent zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso of zzso was found to be dependent upon zzso activity while zzso actions to increase zzso were dependent upon zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso construct further indicated an important role for zzso in regulation of zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso cell zzso can interact with zzso through calcium zzso pathways to zzso enhance zzso zzso Because increased zzso is associated with zzso plaque and instability, results are relevant to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
