Multiple signaling pathways control the zzso of zzso cells zzso to become arteries or veins during zzso zzso Current models propose that a cascade of zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso signaling acts zzso on zzso to control the choice between zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggest that not all of the effects of zzso on zzso zzso are zzso by zzso We establish that full zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso converts the zzso zzso vein into a second zzso vessel that zzso intact zzso gene zzso zzso vessel zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso although zzso was thought to be absolutely essential for zzso zzso we find that normal and zzso zzso differentiation can occur without zzso signaling in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is able to bypass zzso to induce zzso differentiation in zzso via the zzso zzso zzso thus revealing a surprising complexity in the interplay between zzso and zzso signaling during zzso zzso Finally, our experiments establish a dual function of zzso during induction of zzso zzso
