zzso technology has advanced toward analysis of toxic occupational zzso in biological zzso zzso analysis is an ideal way to search for zzso of exposure, even if no specific gene or zzso has been zzso Analysis may now be performed on thousands of genes zzso as opposed to small numbers of genes as in the zzso This ability has been put to use to analyze gene expression profiles of a variety of occupational toxins in animal models to zzso toxins into specific categories based on zzso Analysis of normal human cell strains allows an extension of this analysis to investigate the role of zzso variation in response to various zzso This methodology was used to analyze four zzso related toxins in our zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a chemical commonly found in personal care and zzso items; and zzso zzso an environmental and occupational zzso The results for each exposure highlighted signaling pathways involved in response to these occupational zzso Both pesticides showed increase in zzso zzso while zzso showed zzso in genes related to zzso zzso exposure showed zzso in two zzso zzso related to zzso When used with occupational exposure information, these data may be used to augment risk assessment to make the workplace safer for a greater proportion of the zzso including individuals susceptible to disease related to zzso
