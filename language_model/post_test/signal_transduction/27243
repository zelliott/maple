The airway zzso cell of the lower respiratory tract is the primary host target cell for respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso To estimate whether infected zzso cells contribute to the inflammatory host response observed during the acute infection phase we analyzed the cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso cells zzso following zzso infection and zzso zzso The zzso cells zzso expressed zzso The zzso surface expression was significantly zzso up to 72 h post zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso with tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso induced an enhanced zzso expression on zzso as well as on zzso zzso zzso As early as 24 h post zzso infection and zzso zzso respectively, the maximum of zzso cells was zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso per cell was measured 24 h later, zzso after 48 h of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso did not lead to a significant increase of zzso expression either on zzso or on zzso zzso cells up to 72 h of culture zzso Performed signal zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso analysis, revealed that zzso zzso proteins possess an enhanced zzso capacity in zzso zzso zzso
