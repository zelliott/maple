The main objective of the present study is to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the delay in progression of nuclear maturation in zzso derived from cows with damaged zzso zzso zzso which was previously zzso In present study, delayed progression of nuclear maturation of zzso derived from DL cows relative to zzso derived from cows with healthy zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by low maturation promoting factor zzso activity zzso fold, zzso When zzso cells were removed from zzso complexes and the zzso zzso were zzso there was no difference in the progression of nuclear maturation between the two liver zzso In addition, gap zzso communication zzso between the zzso and zzso cells was higher in DL cows than in zzso cows at 3 and zzso of in zzso maturation zzso zzso zzso of zzso medium with zzso growth factor zzso increased the ratio of zzso zzso breakdown zzso of zzso derived from DL cows to the level seen in zzso derived from zzso zzso Additionally, the level of zzso zzso at zzso of zzso was significantly lower in zzso cells derived from DL cows than in zzso cells derived from zzso cows zzso cows, zzso DL cows, zzso zzso Thus, a low level of zzso zzso in zzso cells induced slow zzso closure between zzso and zzso cells, which resulted in slow zzso maturation of zzso derived from DL zzso
