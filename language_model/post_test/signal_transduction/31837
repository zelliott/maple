zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso comprise a large spectrum of zzso including typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso that exhibit considerably different biological aggressiveness and clinical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is known to be involved in the zzso of several types of human zzso through gene amplification, deletions or zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso gene status in zzso has yet to be zzso This study aimed to investigate the zzso gene status in a large series of zzso by direct gene sequencing and to zzso its correlation with the main zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrated for the first time a high frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a series of 190 zzso including 75 zzso 23 zzso 17 zzso and 75 zzso The frequency of the zzso gene zzso in the zzso domain was higher zzso than that in the zzso domain zzso When the zzso status of the zzso gene was compared with the main clinical and pathological characteristics of the zzso patients, we found a significant association between zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the frequency of zzso gene zzso increased with the biological aggressiveness of all zzso except zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso gene zzso may play a key role in zzso and aggressiveness of zzso The zzso gene may represent a zzso candidate for an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of patients with zzso
