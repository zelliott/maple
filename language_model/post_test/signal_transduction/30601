The activities of the zzso zzso family proteins control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in many aspects of cellular zzso However, the relative contributions of individual zzso to cellular functions including T cell responses are still zzso In addition to zzso another zzso family zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and peripheral T cells, and its zzso was induced by zzso zzso Here, we investigated the function of zzso in development of T cells by generating zzso mice in which a T zzso host was zzso with fetal zzso cells from embryonic lethal zzso zzso Although zzso was zzso for normal T cell lineage differentiation at the zzso zzso stage, zzso in the zzso mice derived from zzso cells exhibited a drastic arrest of differentiation at the zzso zzso stage, suggesting that zzso is crucial for T cell development, especially for the transition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Regarding zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso following zzso stimulation was impaired in the zzso from the zzso zzso In conclusion, we present first evidence for the important role of zzso signaling in T cell zzso
