To investigate the role of zzso in the development of compromised zzso zzso in zzso of mature zzso zzso DESIGN AND zzso zzso zzso male zzso mice and their lean zzso were treated with vehicle or the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso for 21 zzso 

Blood zzso serum insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso levels for beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso reduced blood zzso levels in zzso mice to levels that were not different from lean zzso zzso also reduced serum insulin by approximately 50% in zzso mice, but failed to restore depressed zzso alpha or zzso expression in zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in beta zzso zzso in zzso mice and a small but significant improvement in zzso zzso zzso 

The present results indicate that zzso antagonism ameliorates diabetic symptoms of the mature zzso zzso but does not zzso their obesity or fully reverse deficient expression and function of components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
