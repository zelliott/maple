zzso zzso is one of the most frequently performed procedures in molecular biology and there are literally thousands of research papers reporting its zzso In fact, this method has become so ingrained in certain areas of research that reports often simply state that cells were serum starved without providing any factual details as to how the procedure was carried zzso Even so, we quite obviously lack unequivocal terminology, standard zzso and perhaps most surprisingly, a common conceptual basis when performing serum zzso Such inconsistencies not only hinder zzso zzso but can lead to opposing and inconsistent experimental zzso Although it is frequently assumed that serum zzso reduces zzso activity of cells, available experimental data do not entirely support this zzso To address this important issue, we studied primary human zzso rat zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells under different serum zzso conditions and followed zzso changes in important signaling pathways such as the zzso zzso zzso 1/2, the zzso protein zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso induced a swift and dynamic response, which displayed obvious qualitative and quantitative differences across different cell types and experimental conditions despite certain unifying zzso There was no uniform reduction in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso clearly represents a major event that triggers a plethora of divergent responses and has therefore great potential to interfere with the experimental results and affect subsequent zzso
