zzso may undergo long-term increases or decreases in synaptic strength dependent on critical differences in the timing between zzso zzso zzso Such zzso plasticity zzso follows rules that govern how patterns of neural activity induce changes in synaptic zzso zzso plasticity in the zzso cochlear nucleus zzso follows zzso and zzso patterns in a zzso zzso Here we show that these opposing responses to synaptic activity result from differential expression of two signaling zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso in principal zzso By contrast, in zzso a temporally precise zzso synaptic zzso rule results from the combined effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell specificity in the circuit arises from selective targeting of zzso zzso receptors in different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites of expression determine both the sign and timing requirements of long-term plasticity in zzso
