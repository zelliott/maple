zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso have been recognized as a potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of pathological zzso In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso a zzso zzso exerts its zzso action in vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso model using human zzso vein zzso cells, zzso (20 zzso significantly suppressed zzso cell proliferation and invasion of the cells into the zzso basement zzso which was not reversed by treatment with zzso antagonists, zzso (10 zzso and zzso A zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this zzso effect was not reversed by zzso (10 zzso The zzso activity of zzso correlated with suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane type 1 zzso zzso In addition, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso expression were comparable to those of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso Furthermore, in an in zzso zzso system using a chick zzso membrane model, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso which was similar to the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso were zzso through the suppression of zzso zzso production and zzso zzso
