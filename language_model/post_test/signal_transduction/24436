It has been speculated that zzso diseases are caused by failure of central zzso However, this remains zzso We have suggested that zzso expression identifies zzso T cells in the periphery of zzso prone zzso In this study, we report that zzso was cloned from zzso T cells and that engagement zzso expression and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso 1 and zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso peripheral T cell zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso engagement zzso altered zzso zzso but not zzso expression in these zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in peripheral T cells may constitute a novel zzso for the generation of zzso T zzso
