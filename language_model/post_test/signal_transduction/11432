The zzso portion of zzso hormone is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been zzso to be zzso when bound to the zzso We investigated whether substitution of the zzso hindered and zzso zzso acid zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso would improve the capacity of the zzso to activate the zzso Analysis of the effects of individual zzso zzso at each position in zzso zzso on zzso potency in zzso cells revealed that zzso at most positions diminished zzso however, zzso at positions 1 and 3 enhanced zzso Thus zzso was approximately zzso more potent than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso 20 zzso respectively), approximately zzso more potent than native zzso and zzso more potent than zzso The shorter zzso zzso was also fully zzso and zzso more potent than zzso zzso 4 zzso 1 zzso versus 3 zzso 1 zzso In zzso stimulation zzso performed in zzso cells expressing zzso a zzso that lacks most of the zzso zzso domain, zzso was zzso more potent than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus 40 zzso 2 zzso and zzso more potent than zzso zzso zzso 700 zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso The zzso zzso in otherwise unmodified zzso enhanced potency and binding affinity on zzso but they had no effect for this zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso increased zzso in all peptides tested, including zzso The overall data thus suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso but become zzso zzso possibly as an zzso upon interaction with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso
