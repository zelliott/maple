zzso of the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in tumor formation and zzso providing validated targets for cancer zzso zzso a hybrid of zzso and zzso zzso compound, possessed potent activity against this zzso 

zzso of zzso on zzso zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The interactions between zzso and zzso were investigated by zzso zzso CD, and zzso zzso The potential binding modes between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso were analyzed by molecular zzso zzso activity of zzso was evaluated in tumor cells and in nude mice bearing human cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade and zzso zzso to cellular membrane in human tumor zzso zzso possessed zzso activity against both zzso and zzso with little effect on other tested 30 zzso zzso also completely zzso zzso of zzso as a feedback of zzso of zzso by zzso zzso unexpectedly arrested cells in M phase other than zzso phase, which was distinct from compounds targeting zzso zzso Further study revealed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso via binding to zzso site of zzso and resulted in zzso zzso zzso modeling indicated that zzso could potentially bind to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and shared similar zzso interactions with zzso in the complex with zzso Moreover, zzso induced rapid zzso in tumor cell, which might reflect a synergistic cooperation between blockade of both zzso signaling and zzso zzso Finally, zzso displayed potent zzso activity in a panel of tumor cells originated from different tissue types including drug-resistant cells and in nude mice bearing human tumor zzso 

Taken together, zzso targets both zzso signaling and zzso zzso which zzso contributes its zzso activity and provides new clues for zzso drug design and zzso
