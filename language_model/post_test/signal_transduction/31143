The zzso zzso family of G protein regulators, zzso and zzso form zzso complexes that zzso regulate the zzso of G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulates plasma zzso shuttling of zzso zzso Here we have investigated mechanisms zzso zzso controls the function of the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttling and that a zzso zzso motif zzso to the zzso zzso sites of zzso mediates nuclear zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism zzso zzso and nuclear import receptors both zzso the zzso domain of zzso to determine the trafficking fate of zzso zzso zzso mechanisms may regulate other signaling proteins whose distribution between the plasma membrane and nucleus is controlled by zzso Lastly, we show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso inefficient regulators of G zzso zzso signaling relative to plasma zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the function of the complex by a zzso plasma zzso zzso
