In the present study, the possible involvement of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso hormone zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment resulted in a rapidly transient increase in the zzso zzso zzso as measured using zzso zzso zzso an zzso fluorescent zzso The zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso increase in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso production was partially inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is one of the sources for zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, the zzso zzso cyanide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso production induced by zzso These data suggest that the activity of complexes I and III in the electron transport chain and the zzso inner membrane potential zzso contribute to zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was greatly inhibited by treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso but not with zzso These results indicate that zzso but not membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
