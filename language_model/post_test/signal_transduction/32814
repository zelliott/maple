zzso of zzso focal zzso zzso by zzso zzso has recently been demonstrated in pancreatic zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to examine downstream events of this zzso 

zzso of zzso focal zzso zzso in freshly isolated rat pancreatic zzso cells was determined by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso on zzso zzso zzso release was measured by zzso zzso 

zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso focal zzso zzso zzso analysis showed rapid zzso with maximum between 5 and 10 zzso and stimulation still zzso after 60 zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso D specifically inhibited zzso focal zzso zzso but not zzso zzso protein zzso or increases in zzso calcium zzso The zzso zzso showed rapid reorganization after zzso with an initial increase in zzso followed by a decline after 30 zzso zzso with zzso D prevented zzso zzso zzso release at zzso up to zzso zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso release was less pronounced after zzso D zzso 

zzso focal zzso zzso in zzso cells appears to be part of a zzso zzso leading to changes in cellular zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso might participate in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
