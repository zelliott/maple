zzso II zzso zzso cardiac zzso through zzso a variety of protein zzso In this study, to understand how cardiac zzso develops, we examined zzso signal zzso pathways leading to the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which are reportedly critical for the development of cardiac zzso in cultured cardiac zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso with zzso C or zzso of zzso by zzso with a zzso zzso for 24 h abolished zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and addition of a zzso zzso zzso induced a marked increase in the activities of zzso and zzso zzso with two chemically and mechanistically dissimilar zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso strongly blocked zzso zzso zzso in cardiac zzso Although zzso with zzso a Ras zzso zzso or zzso of a zzso zzso of Ras inhibited zzso zzso zzso neither affected zzso zzso of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso completely suppressed zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso are critical for zzso zzso of zzso in cardiac zzso
