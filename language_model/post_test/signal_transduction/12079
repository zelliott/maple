Modern zzso in many ways, is based on three major zzso the zzso selection theory, the pattern recognition theory, and the zzso zzso The last theory holds that any cell stress and tissue injury, including zzso injury, via induction of zzso molecular patterns, zzso zzso including zzso leading to zzso zzso On the other hand, the concept zzso that zzso per zzso zzso immunity as proposed by the two former zzso Recently, the zzso model has gained considerable acceptance by zzso in particular as promoted by new insights into the function of the zzso gut zzso representing a huge zzso of zzso zzso zzso by hosts is characterized by the fact that harmless zzso zzso microbes are protected by innate zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso microbes are zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso concept is zzso supported by observations of similar phenomena across the tree of life: the ability of the immune system to discriminate between harmful life-threatening zzso to induce immunity and harmless beneficial zzso to induce tolerance has apparently emerged during zzso zzso defense responses to zzso zzso zzso as reflected by plant resistance to zzso and zzso stresses on one hand, and zzso rejection on the other hand) as well as zzso protection of beneficial zzso zzso as reflected by zzso and the fetus of zzso zzso are processes in the interest of evolution and, thus, evolved under pressure across the zzso zzso
