The molecular modes of action of antipsychotic drugs are poorly understood beyond their effects at the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have placed zzso signaling downstream of zzso zzso zzso and recent data have suggested an association between psychotic illnesses and defective zzso zzso To characterize the effect of antipsychotic drugs on the zzso pathway, we used the model zzso zzso zzso a simple system where the zzso box O zzso factor zzso zzso has been well zzso All major classes of antipsychotic drugs increased signaling through the zzso pathway, whereas four other drugs that are known to affect the central nervous system did zzso The antipsychotic drugs inhibited zzso formation, zzso recovery, and shortened zzso three biological processes affected by zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and the insulin and zzso growth factor zzso zzso were required for the antipsychotic drugs to increase zzso zzso synthesis was partially involved, whereas the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso This is the first example of a common but specific molecular effect produced by all presently known antipsychotic drugs in any biological zzso Because zzso zzso have been reported to have low levels of zzso zzso increased zzso signaling might contribute to the therapeutic actions of antipsychotic zzso
