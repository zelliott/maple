The present investigation zzso the zzso zzso of zzso releasing hormone release mechanism by signal zzso cascade in discrete brain regions from zzso primed zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso followed by zzso were studied (in two different groups of zzso on protein zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso as well as zzso C, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decline in zzso metabolism was observed after zzso treatment as depicted by decrease in zzso C and zzso zzso activities as well as zzso zzso and zzso contents from discrete brain zzso zzso zzso A activity showed zzso from membrane bound to zzso form along with a decrease in its zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso dependent protein zzso II activity also declined, zzso protein zzso C activity increased in the zzso fraction after 45 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was seen to counteract the changes induced by zzso in most of the brain regions zzso zzso also suppressed zzso hormone levels, zzso zzso stimulating hormone level did not zzso The present investigation provides evidence for zzso zzso suppression of zzso release through the zzso of signal zzso zzso
