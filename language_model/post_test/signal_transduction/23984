The zzso zzso regulatory system of zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in controlling zzso by zzso the adaptation to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso harbors a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso has been shown to increase net zzso of the zzso response zzso We analyzed the effect on signaling by zzso of various zzso acid zzso at this position zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso I, or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to affect signaling by zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased both the expression of the zzso zzso fusion and the net zzso of zzso zzso to cells a zzso zzso active zzso In contrast, zzso zzso barely responded to changes in the concentration of external zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso to cells a zzso zzso inactive zzso By analyzing in zzso the individual zzso activities of the zzso sensors, we found that the zzso zzso active zzso observed for the zzso and zzso proteins is solely due to decreased zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso inactive zzso observed for the zzso zzso resulted from both decreased zzso activity and increased zzso zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which the zzso at position 48 of zzso contributes to a zzso switch between zzso and zzso zzso
