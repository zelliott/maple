Unlike in animals, female zzso of flowering plants are not the direct products of zzso but develop from a functional zzso after three rounds of free zzso zzso After zzso migration and zzso the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso which contains two female zzso as well as accessory cells at the zzso and zzso pole, zzso We report that an zzso zzso zzso is activated at the zzso pole of the zzso zzso zzso translation is restricted to the egg cell, resulting in the generation of zzso zzso directed toward its zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso is required for robust expression of the zzso gene zzso at the zzso pole of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We further show that zzso is required to prevent zzso cells from adopting central cell zzso These findings show how egg cells orchestrate differentiation of the zzso zzso
