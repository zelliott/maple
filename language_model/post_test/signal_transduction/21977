zzso we investigate the differential D1 zzso zzso zzso regulation by G zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 using two truncated receptors lacking the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tail zzso zzso We first show the association between zzso and zzso in zzso cells and rat zzso Our studies further indicate that deletion of zzso CT region of zzso does not alter the association between zzso and zzso Meanwhile, removal of both zzso and central CT regions culminates in a drastic increase in the zzso association between zzso and zzso relative to zzso and zzso Interestingly, CT zzso have no effect on the zzso and zzso association of receptors with zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso is considerably more robust in cells expressing zzso zzso the robust zzso zzso zzso is not attenuated by CT zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is not zzso whereas we unexpectedly find that zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of wild type zzso is not linked to differences in the extent of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our studies show that zzso zzso zzso is only modulated by deletion of zzso CT region while zzso and central CT regions control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was significantly lower than zzso zzso in cells harboring zzso alone or zzso and zzso Overall, our study suggests an intricate interplay between CT regions of zzso in zzso regulating zzso responsiveness by zzso and zzso
