Many patients with diabetes zzso (both type 1 and type 2) require therapy to maintain normal zzso zzso zzso To develop a novel treatment for these individuals, we used zzso display technology to target the insulin zzso zzso zzso with insulin and identified a high zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso but not the zzso actions of zzso zzso studies with cultured cells expressing human zzso demonstrated that zzso acted zzso and did not compete with insulin for binding to its zzso zzso was found to function as a specific partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not the zzso Although this zzso activated zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso zzso it neither activated zzso nor induced proliferation of cancer zzso In an insulin zzso zzso model of diabetes, zzso markedly reduced elevated zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso zzso After 6 weeks, significant improvements in zzso zzso and other manifestations of diabetes were zzso It is noteworthy that zzso and weight gain were not observed during these zzso These studies zzso therefore, that zzso zzso zzso have the potential to be novel, zzso acting, agents for the regulation of zzso in zzso
