zzso of insulin acutely stimulates zzso production and chronic insulin treatment is associated with elevated serum zzso levels and body weight in subjects with type 2 zzso 

The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between insulin administration, zzso levels, and weight gain in subjects with type 2 zzso 

This was a post hoc analysis of two randomized, controlled zzso 

The study was conducted at an zzso zzso 

zzso included 35 zzso 1) and 32 zzso 2) poorly controlled oral zzso agent zzso type 2 diabetic zzso 

Study 1: subjects were investigated during a zzso zzso zzso clamp and 12 months after being randomly allocated to start insulin or continue on zzso Study zzso 1 zzso treatment with either zzso and lifestyle intervention or insulin with or without zzso lifestyle zzso 

Changes in serum zzso levels during clamp and during 1 zzso of treatment in relationship to changes in body zzso 

Study 1: during acute insulin infusion zzso levels increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso During 1 zzso of insulin therapy, mean body weight increased by zzso whereas the zzso zzso levels increased by zzso (both P zzso zzso The weight gain observed at 1 zzso correlated with the increase in zzso levels observed during the clamp zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Study zzso mean body weight increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso levels increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso during 1 zzso of insulin treatment and the increase in zzso preceded the increase in body zzso 

zzso correlations were observed between zzso effect on serum zzso levels and the increase in weight that accompanied insulin zzso
