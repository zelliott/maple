zzso zzso zzso represents a considerable health zzso To date, limited therapeutic options are zzso In order to develop effective therapeutic strategies for zzso the mechanisms involved in zzso brain damage should be fully zzso Here we review the mechanisms of zzso brain damage induced by the experimental zzso puncture zzso We have included a description of similarities and distinctions between experimental zzso in animals and human zzso zzso Moreover, several novel treatment options to diminish zzso brain damage are zzso is accompanied by cerebral inflammation as demonstrated by an influx of inflammatory cells into the cerebral zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso pathways and increased expression of zzso and zzso Additionally, various cell death pathways including cerebral zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso damage caused by zzso strategies aiming at zzso of inflammatory or cell death pathways demonstrate the importance of these mechanisms for survival after experimental zzso Moreover, zzso therapies using stem cells are discussed as a possible strategy to repair the brain after zzso since this therapy may extend the window of treatment zzso We propose the zzso puncture model as a suitable animal model which resembles the human pathology of zzso and which could be applied to investigate novel therapeutic therapies to combat this debilitating zzso
