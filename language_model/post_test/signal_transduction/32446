The role of protein zzso C zzso in the signal zzso process when zzso cells were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in the cell line zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells induced a rapid generation of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso there was an influx of zzso followed by its zzso zzso was likely involved in zzso zzso as short-term zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the removal of preloaded zzso but had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso activity through zzso or exposure of cells to zzso zzso also blocked the zzso zzso zzso Further experiments using zzso revealed that zzso also decreased zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso These results lend support to the notion that zzso serves as a negative feedback zzso in zzso zzso and further suggest that it operates at several target zzso
