Small zzso of the zzso family have been implicated in important cellular processes such as cell migration and zzso protein zzso and/or gene zzso In the zzso system, these zzso participate in the signaling zzso that are activated after engagement of zzso zzso However, little is known about the role that zzso zzso play in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in Kit 225 T zzso We identified by mass zzso the muscle zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The interaction between the active form of zzso zzso and zzso was established directly through a domain zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso that exhibits significant zzso with the zzso binding domain of zzso The integrity of this region was crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation was inhibited upon blocking both the zzso of zzso and the activity of zzso These results reveal a new role for zzso in cell zzso showing that this zzso triggers T cell proliferation upon zzso stimulation by zzso with zzso and modulating its zzso zzso
