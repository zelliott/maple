In a previous study characterizing zzso and functional features of cell death in zzso deprived chick zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that early cell death events might be targets for zzso allowing for rescue of dying zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured with or without zzso support zzso zzso and zzso zzso soluble extract zzso or without zzso support for 11 or 18 hours and then exposed to zzso zzso Prior to and at the onset of cell death commitment (11 zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso swollen zzso low zzso zzso levels, and release of zzso c from zzso zzso zzso at 11 hours reversed these zzso Between 11 and 18 hours, irreversible DNA fragmentation increased in zzso zzso zzso A and zzso acid zzso of zzso transition zzso zzso prevented membrane zzso increases and delayed the progression to death in zzso deprived zzso by 12 hours; however, by 48 hours all zzso had zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso did not prevent early events of cell death including increased membrane zzso and zzso c release, but it inhibited DNA fragmentation and prolonged zzso survival to 48 zzso We conclude that zzso changes occur early, prior to commitment and that the suppression of these changes can prevent all the downstream events of death, whereas zzso zzso have no effect on the early zzso membrane zzso zzso thus play a critical role in the transition from zzso to irreversible commitment to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso death is brought about by zzso of one of two distinct zzso one localized in zzso and the other dependent on zzso of zzso
