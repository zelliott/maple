Plants have evolved sophisticated innate immune systems to protect themselves from potential microbial zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins is zzso by plant resistance zzso proteins and elicits potent defense responses, collectively termed as zzso immunity zzso It has long been known that zzso is often accompanied with the increase of zzso zzso zzso We recently identified six closely related zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso that orchestrate zzso zzso signaling via distinct zzso specificity and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso of zzso 5, 6 and 11 zzso a specific zzso of zzso zzso factors to regulate zzso zzso crucial for restriction of pathogen zzso Upon zzso zzso a significant portion of zzso zzso to nucleus where it interacts and zzso zzso 28 and zzso Mass zzso analysis identified several zzso zzso including zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso as the zzso sites by zzso Here we reported that zzso of zzso into zzso zzso in zzso completely abolished its zzso by zzso and zzso The importance of nuclear zzso of zzso was further demonstrated by that zzso fused with nuclear export signal abolished its synergistic effect with zzso 28 and 48 on the zzso of defense zzso In contrast, zzso zzso likely functions in the zzso to activate the zzso zzso of defense zzso consistent with the plasma membrane zzso of its zzso zzso Our data established zzso as bona fide zzso of zzso and provided a framework for the study of zzso cascade in diverse biological zzso Our results also demonstrated that the nuclear zzso and zzso dynamics of zzso are essential to relay distinct zzso signaling zzso
