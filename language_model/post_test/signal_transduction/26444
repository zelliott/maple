zzso cell disease zzso is a debilitating zzso genetic disorder with high morbidity and mortality affecting millions of individuals zzso Although zzso was discovered more than a century ago, no effective zzso prevention and treatment are available due to poorly understood molecular basis of zzso the fundamental zzso process of the zzso zzso patients constantly face zzso One of the best-known signaling molecules to be induced under hypoxic conditions is zzso Recent studies demonstrate that zzso elevated zzso signaling plays an important role in normal zzso zzso In contrast, elevated zzso signaling contributes to zzso and multiple life threatening complications including tissue damage, pulmonary dysfunction and zzso Here, we zzso recent research on the role of zzso signaling in normal and zzso zzso progression of the disease and therapeutic zzso In normal zzso both genetic and pharmacological studies demonstrate that zzso can enhance zzso zzso production via zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that elevated zzso has an zzso role in normal zzso to promote zzso release and prevent acute zzso tissue zzso However, in zzso zzso the beneficial role of excessive zzso zzso induction becomes zzso by promoting zzso zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso Additionally, zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso on zzso natural killer T zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso pulmonary dysfunction in zzso zzso Finally, elevated zzso coupled with zzso zzso is responsible for zzso a dangerous complication seen in zzso Overall, the research reviewed here reveals a differential role of elevated zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and progression of zzso Thus, zzso signaling represents a potentially important therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of zzso
