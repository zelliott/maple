zzso plays an important role in protein zzso The importance of zzso for tissue factor zzso function is zzso 

The aim of the present study is to investigate the importance of zzso zzso in transport to the cell surface and its zzso and signaling zzso 

zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were treated with zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso of one or more potential zzso zzso sites in zzso was used to generate zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso expression at the cell surface was determined in binding zzso using zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was measured by factor zzso zzso generation zzso and zzso signaling function was assessed by measuring zzso of zzso activated zzso 2 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso treatment reduced zzso activity at the zzso cell surface; however, this reduction was found to be the result of decreased zzso protein production in zzso zzso zzso treatment had no significant effect on zzso activity or zzso levels in zzso No significant differences were observed in zzso protein expression and zzso activity among cells zzso to express either zzso zzso or zzso zzso A fully zzso zzso is shown to bind zzso and interact with FX with the same efficiency as that of zzso zzso zzso zzso is also capable of supporting zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is not essential for zzso transport and zzso or signaling zzso
