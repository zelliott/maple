zzso zzso a zzso zzso present in red wine, has been shown to provide cardiovascular protection by improving zzso function and reducing zzso zzso However, little is known about how zzso affects vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso proliferation in zzso and zzso formation following artery injury in zzso Thus, one might expect that zzso will promote zzso zzso zzso our results in this study show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this is characterized by suppressed zzso of zzso marker genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in cultured zzso zzso with previous studies, zzso zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In an effort to identify the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the key zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso this suggests that zzso may induce zzso zzso via zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence showing that zzso zzso zzso zzso by regulating zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
