After zzso injury or death zzso cells become zzso exhibiting dramatic changes in zzso and patterns of gene expression and ultimately engulfing zzso zzso Rapid clearance of zzso zzso material is thought to be crucial for suppression of inflammation and promotion of functional zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is a critical in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso we find zzso zzso signals through a cascade involving the upstream zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and ultimately the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso complex composed of zzso and zzso to initiate zzso zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, loss of zzso also blocked zzso zzso of zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to rescue zzso defects associated with loss of zzso zzso This work identifies that the zzso zzso is a novel zzso of zzso zzso activity and a primary role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade appears to be zzso of zzso expression after zzso zzso
