zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso of the zzso wall and the zzso areas of the human zzso can interact with growth factor zzso zzso thereby blocking downstream actions of zzso In the present study the expression and regulation of zzso using both human zzso and two experimental animal models, namely the zzso monkey and zzso were zzso zzso protein was present in zzso and zzso areas of adult human and monkey zzso while it was almost zzso in adult wild type zzso Interestingly, the levels and sites of zzso zzso expression in the monkeys were zzso correlated with zzso maturation zzso A strong zzso expression associated with the abundant zzso tissue of the zzso areas in the zzso through zzso zzso was zzso In adult and old monkeys the zzso pattern was similar to the one in normal human zzso presenting strong expression at the zzso zzso In the zzso of both zzso men and in a mouse model of inflammation associated zzso zzso transgenic zzso the zzso changes and increased numbers of zzso necrosis factor zzso immune cells were shown to be associated with increased production of zzso Furthermore, studies with human zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso indicated that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso The data, thus, show that an increased zzso level is associated with impaired zzso function, supporting our hypothesis that zzso interferes with zzso zzso of the zzso in health and zzso
