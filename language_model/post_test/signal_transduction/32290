zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso are zzso able to grow under conditions of zzso stress caused by insufficient nutrients or zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso have zzso zzso However, whether zzso signaling is involved in the resistance to cell death in zzso cells remains to be zzso Here, we investigated the involvement of this signaling system in the survival response of zzso cells against hydrogen zzso zzso death both in the presence of normal serum zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso levels increased zzso zzso zzso in SS zzso Treatment with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels in zzso but not in SS zzso zzso zzso zzso completely suppressed zzso zzso increase and partially reduced zzso expression in SS zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso showed significantly reduced cell viability zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso and DNA zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso effects in zzso cells, which were not further ameliorated by zzso Altogether, these finding provide evidence for the involvement of an zzso zzso zzso signaling system that increases zzso cell resistance to zzso death upon serum zzso
