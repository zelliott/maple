The cellular zzso factor zzso has been identified as a tumor zzso regulating the activities of zzso and its zzso zzso and promoting zzso by the zzso of a plethora of death zzso More than 15 years of zzso recognized zzso as the key player in zzso induced by DNA damage in all types of human zzso This occurs by several mechanisms that affect zzso interaction, zzso stability and its binding to promoters of zzso zzso Recent progress has been made in revealing new zzso genes regulated by zzso and it seems that many still remain to be zzso However, whereas in the past one focused mainly on identifying zzso target genes translating cellular stress signals into cell death, today the DNA zzso regulatory network governing zzso ability to induce zzso is rapidly gaining attention as zzso zzso the lately uncovered role of zzso and zzso in triggering zzso zzso through chemotherapy gains our understanding of the DNA damage response in normal and tumor zzso In this context a large body of evidence indicates that nuclear zzso targeting zzso seem to have a major impact on its tumor zzso zzso These new findings are discussed in the context of zzso studies applying zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso agents - called zzso therapy, thereby providing new zzso links between the zzso zzso programming and advanced cancer zzso
