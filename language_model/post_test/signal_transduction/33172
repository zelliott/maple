zzso and zzso receptors are traditionally linked to tissue specific functions performed by fully differentiated zzso However, these receptors have been also implicated in growth zzso The mechanisms zzso these receptors regulate zzso signaling pathways are still poorly zzso Furthermore, pharmacological evidence suggest that many growth promoting agents act on zzso coupled zzso but there is no formal proof that induction of zzso results from decreased zzso levels of zzso In our laboratory, we have used the expression of zzso and zzso receptors as a model for studying zzso signaling through G zzso zzso Currently available evidence suggest that these receptors signal to distinct members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso through zzso zzso of zzso G proteins acting, respectively, on a Ras and zzso dependent zzso
