zzso zzso the development of new blood vessels, is a highly regulated process that is controlled genetically by zzso in zzso and tumor zzso gene expression and zzso by the tumor zzso Previous studies indicate that the zzso switch in zzso cells may be zzso promoted by the tumor zzso through the induction of the zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso In this report, we show zzso cells do not use the downstream zzso zzso or zzso activated protein zzso zzso in signaling zzso induction by zzso as zzso of zzso zzso of these genes does not inhibit zzso induction under low oxygen zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso pathway, zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner, and zzso of zzso zzso activity genetically and zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso induction in zzso cells through the zzso of a stress zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso
