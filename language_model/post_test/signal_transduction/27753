A set of open reading frames zzso potentially zzso signal zzso proteins are clustered around zzso a gene implicated in the regulation of carbon zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is the zzso for zzso whose predicted product resembles the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso whose predicted product resembles the zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose predicted products resemble the respective zzso zzso for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to determine whether the protein products zzso by these zzso possessed the functional capabilities suggested by sequence zzso each was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein and analyzed for its ability to participate in protein zzso processes in zzso It was observed that zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein zzso capable of zzso zzso and, albeit with noticeably lower efficiency, zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso these proteins on zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso
