The binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso triggers cellular responses that, generally, are only transient in zzso To explore the potential role of G zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso we performed zzso experiments in a rat zzso leukemia cell line zzso expressing zzso The ability of various zzso zzso to stimulate calcium zzso in these cells correlated with their ability to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso association with the zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of human zzso virus infection, has been proposed to act through enhanced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso profoundly induced zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso In zzso rat zzso leukemia zzso cells, zzso zzso with specificity for zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso with a role for these zzso in zzso regulation, 1-2 zzso zzso copies of zzso or zzso were found to be expressed in peripheral blood zzso zzso acid analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso selectively occurs on zzso zzso Our findings with zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso zzso sites on zzso This study demonstrates that zzso differ in their ability to induce zzso zzso and zzso and provides a molecular mechanism for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
