zzso the G zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used as a model zzso to investigate the role of specific zzso in the resting and activated states of the zzso Using a series of biological and zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso as a potential interacting partner with the zzso zzso An zzso double zzso showed zzso functional activity, whereas the zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso was partially active indicating that the zzso 205 and zzso zzso interact in an activated state of the zzso The introduction of zzso or zzso zzso into the zzso zzso active zzso suppressed the zzso zzso in contrast, the zzso quadruple zzso was fully zzso active, again indicating an interaction between zzso at the 205 and 206 positions in the zzso zzso To further test this interaction, we introduced the zzso zzso and zzso double zzso into zzso and zzso zzso active zzso After zzso zzso we found that a zzso product, with the molecular weight expected for a zzso zzso with a zzso between zzso and zzso formed only in the zzso zzso activated zzso This study represents the first experimental demonstration of an interaction between specific zzso in an active state, but not the resting state, of zzso The information gained from this study should contribute to an understanding of the zzso differences between resting and active states in zzso
