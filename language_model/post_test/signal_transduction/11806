zzso factor zzso is a zzso that causes cohesive zzso colonies to zzso into isolated cells and stimulates zzso cell zzso To investigate zzso zzso we screened agents that zzso various zzso processes for effects on scattering of zzso canine kidney zzso zzso zzso agents were studied in quantitative migration zzso using zzso zzso Agents that activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused mild to moderate zzso of scattering and migration, while zzso of zzso pathways had little effect on zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced and accelerated zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso while zzso depletion by 48 h zzso with zzso markedly zzso zzso Thus, zzso scattering may be related to zzso of zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of protein and zzso but not DNA zzso zzso and zzso migration were zzso by zzso zzso and migration were inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso mobility may be zzso in part, by protein zzso zzso in protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso filament zzso They indicate directions for further zzso
