Previous studies have shown that human zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso does not require zzso virus, and envelope zzso B zzso from zzso is a viral structural component that can directly induce zzso of zzso Here we extend these earlier findings by defining the consequences of inducing the zzso zzso We found that cells respond to zzso or soluble zzso by establishing a functional zzso state within cell types critical in zzso biology, such as zzso and zzso zzso We have also discovered new insights into the mechanism by which the zzso is zzso zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso a key zzso regulator of cellular zzso responses, is activated by zzso zzso and soluble zzso Thus, zzso becomes activated via zzso signal zzso zzso This is a novel mechanism of zzso of this key zzso factor by zzso In comparison to soluble zzso zzso which comprises the entire zzso of zzso a zzso zzso encompassing only the zzso region of zzso zzso was markedly less effective at inducing zzso zzso This indicates that the region of zzso from zzso 461 to 750 is important for initiation of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso establish an zzso state in zzso zzso zzso cells, illustrating that primary induction of zzso by zzso and zzso is sufficient to establish the zzso response and that zzso zzso is not necessary for the zzso zzso Taken together, our findings reveal that zzso zzso a coordinated zzso response through contact between zzso and an zzso cell surface zzso
