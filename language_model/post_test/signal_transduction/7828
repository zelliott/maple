The process of zzso transformation universally zzso genetic damage and zzso zzso two stresses that are signaled to zzso through different genetic zzso Based on this, it is possible to distinguish two jobs for zzso zzso of the zzso that consists in sensing and reacting to DNA damage through the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso that, zzso consists in responding to zzso signaling through the zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso recent genetic evidence in mice indicates that the response of zzso to DNA damage has little or no impact on cancer zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso is critical for zzso tumor zzso Here, we discuss the zzso implications of these observations and their relevance for cancer zzso
