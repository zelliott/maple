zzso is one of the founding members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the avian zzso zzso expression is mostly located within the central region of the inner nuclear zzso As retinal development zzso and this retinal layer zzso and zzso zzso expression forms a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso is produced by two zzso cell types, zzso cells and zzso cells, as well as by zzso zzso and bipolar zzso In retinal zzso and zzso cell cultures, zzso expression is induced by activated zzso zzso whereas zzso signaling decreases zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso cells and has no effect in retinal zzso In zzso cells, the zzso expression detected may thus result from a balance between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
