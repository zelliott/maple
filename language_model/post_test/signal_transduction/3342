zzso of new membrane to the cell surface by membrane trafficking is necessary for cell zzso In this paper, we report that blocking membrane traffic causes a zzso checkpoint arrest via zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signals are relayed by the zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and a specific form of protein zzso 2A zzso Signaling via this zzso is dependent on membrane traffic and appears to increase gradually during polar bud zzso We zzso that delivery of zzso to the site of bud growth generates a signal that is zzso to the extent of polarized membrane growth and that the strength of the signal is read by downstream components to determine when sufficient growth has occurred for initiation of zzso zzso signaling could explain how membrane growth is integrated with cell cycle zzso It could also control both cell size and zzso thereby reconciling divergent models for zzso checkpoint zzso
