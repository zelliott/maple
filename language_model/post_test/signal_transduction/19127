zzso of zzso cells in the early zzso period is a normal feature of zzso retinal zzso The role of zzso and zzso in the process has been well zzso however, the identification of key zzso zzso still remains zzso Here we report that zzso a zzso zzso family member, may be one such zzso Following growth factor zzso zzso was zzso in mouse zzso cone zzso This event correlated with the release of zzso zzso factors into the zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, a similar zzso was observed in response to zzso radiation, zzso or zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso cascade as the main regulatory zzso of zzso expression in these zzso Finally, using zzso zzso we were able to silence zzso expression and subsequently suppress zzso zzso In conclusion, we propose zzso as a critical factor in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
