zzso coli is the most common zzso zzso causing zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso coli zzso invasion of brain zzso zzso cells zzso is required for penetration into the central nervous system, but the zzso interactions that are involved in this process remain incompletely zzso Here we report the involvement of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso expressed on human brain zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso coli zzso invasion of zzso Our results showed that treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso coli zzso invasion of zzso zzso results indicated the zzso of zzso with zzso coli zzso during bacterial invasion of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were blocked by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso The small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso significantly attenuated zzso coli invasion and the zzso zzso filament zzso Furthermore, we found an increased association of zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso infected with zzso coli zzso and that zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in zzso was blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso contributes to zzso coli zzso invasion of zzso via recruitment of the zzso signaling zzso
