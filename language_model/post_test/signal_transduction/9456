The development and progression of zzso cancer zzso is a zzso process, and the zzso pathways with its two molecular zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso plays an important role in transforming a normal tissue into a zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of aberrations in the zzso and zzso genes in the zzso of zzso in the Kashmir valley, and to correlate it with various zzso zzso We examined the paired zzso and zzso specimens of 86 zzso patients for the occurrence of aberrations in the zzso cluster region zzso of the zzso gene and zzso 3 of the zzso gene by zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Analysis of promoter zzso of the zzso gene was also carried out using zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso rate of the zzso of the zzso gene among 86 zzso cases was zzso per cent (11 of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in zzso per cent zzso of zzso of zzso Furthermore, we found a significant association between zzso location, zzso grade and zzso status and the zzso status of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Although the number of zzso in the zzso and zzso genes in our zzso cases was very low, the study confirms the role of zzso gene zzso of the pivotal molecular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the development of zzso in the zzso zzso
