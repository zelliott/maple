The diversity of zzso zzso protein zzso target cell types, as well as the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso responses to other zzso zzso suggested that zzso may interact with multiple zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to establish how zzso binds and activates zzso and zzso We show that human zzso exhibit zzso binding for zzso with an estimated zzso of 1-3 zzso and about 10,000 binding zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was progressively less well zzso by zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor, or zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso 100 zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso displaced the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta as effectively as the zzso zzso zzso In agreement with the binding data, zzso of zzso with zzso completely zzso the calcium flux in response to zzso alpha and zzso However, zzso alpha and zzso failed to zzso the response of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso partially zzso each other's effects on zzso These binding and zzso results suggest that zzso binds and signals through other binding sites in addition to those shared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso competition for zzso beta binding and signaling by zzso suggests the existence of an zzso unidentified site for zzso shared with zzso zzso The existence of another unique binding zzso for zzso was further shown by the failure of any of the other zzso zzso to compete effectively for zzso binding on zzso zzso in our study was also the only human zzso zzso that consistently zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso that can bind and activate a broad range of target cells through receptors shared by other zzso zzso as well as its own zzso
