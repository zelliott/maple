The zzso receptors are a large family of zzso zzso zzso with important roles in the establishment of zzso and vascular networks during embryonic zzso The functions of zzso receptors in the adult brain have only recently been investigated, and the results are forcing us to amend the conventional view that these molecules function predominantly in a zzso zzso This review summarizes this rapidly expanding new area of research, which has shown that the zzso receptors regulate the structure and zzso function of zzso zzso through multiple mechanisms, and might thus play a significant role in higher brain zzso
