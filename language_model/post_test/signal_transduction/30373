Despite being one of the first recognized targets of insulin action, the acceleration of zzso transport into muscle and fat tissue remains one of the most enigmatic processes in the insulin action zzso zzso transport is accomplished by a shift in the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso compartments to the plasma membrane in the presence of zzso The complexity in deciphering the molecular blueprint of insulin regulation of zzso transport arises because it represents a convergence of two convoluted biological zzso transport and signal zzso Whereas more than 60 molecular players have been implicated in this orchestral performance, it has been difficult to distinguish between mainly passive participants zzso those that are clearly driving the zzso The zzso nature of the zzso system makes it almost impossible to dissect the anatomical nature of what appears to be a medley of many overlapping and rapidly changing zzso A major limitation is zzso It is clear that further progress in teasing apart the zzso code will require the development and application of novel and advanced technologies that can discriminate one zzso from another in the living cell and to zzso this upon a system in which the molecular environment can be carefully zzso Many are now taking on this zzso
