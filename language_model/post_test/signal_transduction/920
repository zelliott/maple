zzso the resident zzso of the brain, can release substances that aid zzso development, differentiation and zzso We have investigated the effects of zzso zzso on the survival of cultured rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collected from primary rat zzso cultures, was used to treat zzso zzso and zzso viability and proliferation was assessed following a further 1 or 7 days in zzso zzso medium enhanced zzso survival by up to 50% compared with zzso zzso and this effect was completely abated by zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso The expression of the proliferation marker zzso increased in zzso cultures treated with zzso medium suggesting enhanced proliferation of precursor zzso zzso zzso proliferation could be attenuated by specific zzso of zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso and by selective zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was enhanced as zzso against the zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso release stable zzso factors that can promote zzso precursor cell zzso
