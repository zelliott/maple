A major zzso zzso in hypertension is increased peripheral resistance due to changes in vascular structure and zzso zzso changes include reduced zzso diameter and zzso wall zzso zzso changes include increased zzso and/or decreased zzso These processes are influenced by many zzso factors, of which zzso II zzso zzso seems to be zzso At the cellular level, zzso II stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell growth, increases collagen deposition, zzso zzso increases zzso and decreases zzso zzso mechanisms associated with these changes in hypertension include zzso of many signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and increased generation of zzso oxygen zzso This review focuses on the role of zzso II in vascular functional and structural changes of small arteries in zzso In addition, cellular processes zzso zzso II influences vessels in hypertension are zzso Finally, novel concepts related to signaling pathways by which zzso II regulates vascular smooth muscle cells in hypertension are zzso
