The diabetic zzso caused by the deletion of insulin zzso zzso zzso in mice displays a sexual zzso Whereas the majority of male zzso mice are overtly diabetic by 12 weeks of age, female zzso animals develop mild obesity and progress less rapidly to zzso Here we investigated zzso function and zzso as potential explanations for the zzso differences in this zzso zzso insulin zzso was enhanced in zzso from male zzso mice as compared to male zzso whereas this response in female zzso zzso was identical to that of female zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso to inhibit insulin zzso was attenuated in male zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, the expression of the zzso was reduced in male zzso zzso The response of male zzso zzso to zzso was zzso zzso to increased production of zzso zzso zzso was increased in male zzso but decreased in female zzso mice, zzso with the observation that zzso tissue is sparse in males whereas female zzso zzso mice are mildly zzso zzso from both male and female zzso were resistant to the zzso effects of insulin but female zzso fat cells were additionally resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso This zzso resistance was associated with impaired generation of zzso zzso targets of zzso protein zzso zzso which mediate zzso were not zzso in zzso tissue of female zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso in mice alters the expression and/or sensitivity of components of zzso zzso
