Changes in the soluble zzso zzso of zzso have been measured in rat adrenal zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso and zzso (an analogue which is able to elicit zzso zzso in the absence of any discernible increase in zzso zzso zzso Small but significant increases in the total zzso zzso were found in response to stimulation with both zzso zzso For zzso this effect on zzso zzso metabolism occurred over the same dose range as that for the stimulation of zzso (with an zzso of zzso M zzso for both zzso It is concluded that in the absence of zzso zzso generation, zzso increased the total zzso zzso in direct accordance with its zzso zzso For zzso the effect on zzso metabolism reached a maximum with zzso M zzso and declined at higher zzso zzso precisely those associated with increased zzso zzso zzso These and the previous observations suggest that the zzso zzso generated by zzso may influence and inhibit the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso identification of the zzso zzso of the adrenal cells showed that they include zzso and zzso zzso (which would arise by sequential action of zzso A1 or zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso small but significant increases in zzso levels, indicating that a zzso A may have been zzso
