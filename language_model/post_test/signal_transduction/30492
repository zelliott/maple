We have investigated the zzso mechanisms of memory zzso and, in particular, the functional requirement for zzso mechanisms initiated by zzso zzso We show that zzso given in conjunction with a memory zzso session, can specifically disrupt the zzso reinforcing properties of a previously zzso reinforced zzso stimulus zzso whether the stimulus had been associated with self-administered cocaine or with zzso These data show that memories for both drug and zzso zzso associations are dependent on zzso zzso signaling for their zzso with implications for the potential development of a novel treatment for drug addiction and some forms of zzso
