The zzso growth factor zzso regulates cell proliferation of human cancer cells through the zzso zzso zzso pathway, with mediation of this action by the zzso zzso zzso The ubiquity of the zzso axis in human cancer is zzso We used 31 human cancer cell lines, representative of more than zzso of zzso occurring in humans, and found that zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso and nucleus by zzso The addition of zzso to cultures depressed cell number up to zzso whereas zzso zzso increased cell proliferation by up to zzso a total of zzso in the modulating capacity for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by specific zzso led to a marked increase in cell zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells, even in the face of the addition of zzso zzso The cultures to which zzso was added and subjected to zzso were similar to those with zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso activity, is a ubiquitous feature of human cancer zzso The identification of this native biological system in zzso may be important in understanding the zzso of zzso and in designing treatment zzso that zzso the body's own zzso
