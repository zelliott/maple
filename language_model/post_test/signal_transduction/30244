Heart failure with normal ejection fraction occurs in elderly patients with zzso heart zzso We hypothesized that, in such patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso the types of zzso and vascular zzso and dysfunction believed important in the transition to heart zzso We tested this hypothesis by administering zzso zzso zzso without salt loading or zzso to elderly dogs with experimental zzso zzso dogs were made zzso by zzso zzso After 5 weeks, dogs were randomly assigned to zzso (1 zzso per day zzso old zzso zzso zzso or not zzso zzso for 3 zzso At week 8, conscious zzso and zzso assessment under zzso were zzso zzso resulted in further increases in conscious blood pressure zzso without increases in cardiac output or zzso zzso In the conscious state, effective zzso zzso zzso and systemic vascular resistance zzso were increased, and systemic zzso compliance zzso was decreased in zzso zzso After zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood pressure was lower, whereas left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased in zzso zzso zzso collagen was increased in zzso animals zzso for zzso but zzso mass, zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiles were zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso structure was altered in zzso zzso These findings suggest that age and zzso heart disease enhance sensitivity to zzso zzso administration and that zzso zzso zzso could contribute to the transition to heart failure in elderly persons by promoting increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
