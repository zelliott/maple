zzso bearing zzso is the process in fruit trees by which cycles of heavy yield zzso zzso one year are followed by a light yield zzso zzso the zzso Heavy yield usually reduces flowering intensity the following zzso Despite its agricultural importance, how the developing crop influences the following year's return bloom and yield is not fully zzso It might be assumed that an zzso zzso is generated in the fruit, or in another organ that senses fruit presence, and moves into the bud to determine its zzso or zzso zzso The bud then responds to fruit presence by altering regulatory and zzso zzso zzso these zzso and when they are altered, might indicate the nature of this putative AB zzso We studied bud zzso the expression of flowering control zzso and global gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso In May, shortly after flowering and fruit set, zzso buds were already significantly longer than zzso zzso The number of zzso expressed genes was higher in May than at the other tested time zzso zzso zzso expressed between zzso and zzso trees included key zzso and regulatory zzso such as photosynthesis and secondary zzso The expression of genes of zzso metabolism and zzso metabolism was validated by zzso technology, and the latter was confirmed by zzso zzso Among genes induced in zzso trees was one zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso and annual phase zzso regulated by zzso The expression pattern of zzso zzso and other flowering control genes suggested that fruit load affects bud fate, and therefore development and zzso a relatively long time before the flowering induction zzso zzso shed light on some of the zzso and regulatory processes that are altered in ON and OFF zzso
