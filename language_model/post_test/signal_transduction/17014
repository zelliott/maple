Alzheimer's disease zzso is associated with impaired zzso degradation in the zzso zzso the process of zzso clearance is an attractive potential zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso may reduce zzso levels in zzso However, the clinical potential of many zzso zzso is limited because of their zzso actions on zzso which lead to zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso were identified from a series of zzso and were found to zzso activate zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso in different cell zzso Further investigations confirmed that these compounds facilitate zzso zzso clearance in zzso zzso zzso Administration of compound 19 reduced total brain zzso and plaque burden in zzso double transgenic mice, associated with elevated zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso zzso the active compounds reported here induced less zzso of zzso lipids and zzso in zzso zzso
