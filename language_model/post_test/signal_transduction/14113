Exercise can improve cognitive function and has been linked to the increased expression of zzso zzso factor zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the zzso of this zzso remain zzso Here we show that zzso a previously identified muscle protein that is induced in exercise and is zzso and zzso as zzso is also elevated by endurance exercise in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso and zzso mice show reduced zzso expression in the zzso zzso expression of zzso in primary cortical zzso increases zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso peripheral delivery of zzso to the liver via zzso zzso resulting in elevated blood zzso zzso expression of zzso and other zzso genes in the zzso Taken together, our findings link endurance exercise and the important zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso expression in the zzso
