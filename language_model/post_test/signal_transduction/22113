zzso and zzso are genetically zzso zzso processes that regulate cell zzso however, zzso invariably contributes to cancer cell death, whereas zzso plays the zzso role of cancer cell survival and zzso In this review, we zzso focus on targeting cancer cells via several key zzso pathways for zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that some zzso pathways play dual roles in cancer, and further zzso the intricate relationship between zzso and zzso In zzso these findings may ultimately allow biologists to harness zzso and zzso pathways as novel targets for cancer zzso
