zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is common in zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso a tumor zzso zzso could interact with zzso protein and repress zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we found that expression of zzso was frequently zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso could repress zzso zzso through recruitment of zzso an zzso that zzso zzso in zzso 310 zzso Indeed, zzso inhibitor or its specific small interfering zzso abolished the zzso roles of zzso Together, these observations suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso is required for the tumor zzso function of zzso in zzso
