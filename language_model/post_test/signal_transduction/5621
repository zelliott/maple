zzso signaling zzso plays a significant role in embryonic stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso maintains mouse zzso cells zzso independent of leukemia zzso factor zzso However, little is known about the effect of zzso signaling zzso on zzso cells with zzso zzso Our experiments aimed to explore the relationship between zzso signaling zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso We observed the effect of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso pathway, on zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso With zzso treatment, both of them lost their zzso features even in the presence of zzso But the differentiation induced by zzso on zzso zzso cells was zzso lower than that on zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells zzso zzso zzso sustains mouse zzso cells zzso independent of zzso and zzso the differentiation induced by zzso But it is insufficient to totally reverse the zzso
