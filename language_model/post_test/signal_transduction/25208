Previous studies have established that zzso express zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso which is also activated by the zzso domain sequence zzso and which promotes zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso A single previous report identified zzso as a zzso zzso but there have been no subsequent investigations of the zzso This study reveals the zzso of zzso and zzso (a second zzso which is activated by zzso but not zzso by Northern zzso analysis and compares their signaling properties in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso for zzso promote zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso elevate calcium zzso and increase spontaneous zzso zzso (but not zzso also activates zzso zzso zzso and zzso In keeping with their linkage to pathways that have been associated with growth and/or survival, zzso and zzso both induce zzso However, zzso zzso promote cell zzso a zzso that is distinct from the uniform increase in cell dimension induced by zzso zzso zzso These studies provide novel evidence that zzso zzso 2 functional zzso which link to a common set of signals that culminate in changes in zzso function and zzso zzso zzso actions may assume clinical importance in the border zone surrounding an zzso where local zzso of zzso by zzso zzso generated during inflammatory or zzso pathways would elevate calcium concentration zzso the stage for zzso promote zzso growth, and/or influence zzso zzso
