The present study has been designed to investigate the involvement of the zzso oxide mechanism in the protective effect of lycopene against zzso zzso zzso zzso symptoms in zzso 

The present experimental protocol design includes systemic zzso acid zzso zzso treatment for 14 zzso zzso zzso 5 and zzso was given orally, once a day, zzso before zzso acid treatment for 14 zzso Body weight and behavioral parameters zzso and zzso zzso were assessed on 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th day zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured on the 15th day in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes were also assessed in these brain zzso zzso zzso acid treatment significantly reduced body weight, locomotor activity and zzso zzso The zzso zzso activities were also significantly impaired in the examined brain regions in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 5 and zzso treatment significantly attenuated the impairment in zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities as compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso dose of lycopene zzso significantly attenuated the protective effect of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso with a zzso dose of lycopene zzso for 14 days significantly zzso the protective zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that the zzso oxide zzso is involved in the protective effect of lycopene against zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso in zzso
