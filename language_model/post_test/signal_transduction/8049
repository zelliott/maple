The zzso zzso gene family encodes a family of putative zzso proteins important for host zzso Although zzso binding is thought to be central to this family, this aspect is largely zzso The zzso protein zzso regulates zzso processing by assembling the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso the zzso domain are associated with zzso periodic zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso and exhibits zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, cell death, zzso complex formation, zzso and association with the zzso component zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso identifying zzso binding by zzso as a potential target for zzso zzso zzso
