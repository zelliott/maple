Despite triggering strong immune responses, zzso virus zzso has zzso more than zzso of the adult human zzso zzso persistence of zzso depends on the establishment of a balance between host immune responses and viral immune zzso Here we have extended our studies on the zzso zzso zzso which was recently identified as an zzso that functions by enhancing degradation of major zzso complex class I zzso zzso via zzso We now demonstrate that disruption of the zzso signaling motif of zzso by a zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to enhance zzso of surface zzso zzso while subsequent zzso degradation was impaired by deletion of the zzso zzso tail of zzso Furthermore, we identified another mechanism of zzso zzso it targets newly zzso zzso complexes en route to the cell zzso zzso although the diversion of zzso on the zzso zzso caused a relatively modest reduction in cell surface zzso presentation of zzso processed target peptides to immune zzso zzso T cells was reduced by around zzso The zzso functions of zzso in the context of the whole virus were confirmed in cells zzso infected with a zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso This study therefore extends our initial observations on zzso to show that this zzso can target zzso zzso presentation via both the zzso and zzso trafficking zzso The results also emphasize the merits of including functional T cell recognition zzso to gain a more complete picture of zzso effects on the zzso presentation zzso
