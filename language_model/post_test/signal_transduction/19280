zzso inwardly zzso zzso zzso channels, which help control zzso zzso are important for the response to drugs of zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso for zzso enhancement of zzso channel signaling in zzso zzso zzso treatment for zzso h increased the zzso of zzso with zzso a zzso spine zzso Western zzso analysis and quantitative zzso zzso revealed an increase in zzso protein and targeting to zzso zzso In zzso administration of zzso also produced an zzso of zzso protein in the zzso The mechanism engaged by zzso required elevated zzso zzso and was insensitive to zzso zzso implicating zzso receptors that may couple to zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso suggesting involvement of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented the zzso change in zzso zzso whereas expression of a zzso activated form of zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso with an increase in zzso surface zzso functional analyses revealed that zzso treatment increased the size of zzso zzso currents and zzso zzso zzso currents in zzso These results demonstrate plasticity in zzso zzso signaling that may contribute to the abusive effects of zzso
