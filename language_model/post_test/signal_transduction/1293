Type 2 diabetes arises from a combination of impaired insulin action and defective pancreatic zzso zzso zzso the two abnormalities have been viewed as distinct yet mutually zzso zzso The combination of impaired zzso zzso metabolism in skeletal muscle and impaired zzso function causes an increase of zzso zzso production, leading to a constellation of tissue abnormalities that has been referred to as the diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice has led to a critical zzso of the integrated physiology of insulin zzso These studies indicate that insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue does not necessarily lead to zzso so long as insulin sensitivity in other zzso is zzso Additional data suggest a direct role of insulin signaling in zzso function and regulation of zzso mass, thus raising the possibility that insulin resistance may be the overarching feature of diabetes in all target zzso I propose that we replace the original picture of a ruling zzso with that of a squabbling republic in which every tissue contributes to the onset of the zzso
