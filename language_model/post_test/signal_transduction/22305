zzso is a key inflammatory zzso and potent airway zzso It acts on zzso zzso zzso receptors and contributes to airway inflammation and airway zzso that is the characteristic feature of zzso The present study was designed to study zzso zzso signaling in airway smooth muscle cells by using an organ culture model and a set of selective pharmacological zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso and calcium signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso were used for examining zzso zzso signal proteins and zzso zzso culture of rat zzso segments for up to 48 h zzso a zzso increased airway zzso response to zzso This indicates that organ culture increases zzso zzso signaling in the airway smooth muscle zzso The enhanced zzso contraction was attenuated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso calcium and calcium channel blocker zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity and elevated zzso calcium level are required for the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, airway smooth muscle cell zzso zzso signaling occurs via zzso zzso activity and the zzso of zzso calcium influx, which may provide knowledge for understanding the signaling zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso airway zzso to zzso
