zzso of zzso cancer cells at secondary sites is known to be regulated by several families of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells have been shown to zzso to and roll on both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso human colon zzso cells adhere specifically to an zzso zzso Upon zzso to zzso the amount of zzso zzso of several proteins in zzso cell zzso increases compared with cells in bovine serum zzso zzso on zzso Western zzso this increase is statistically zzso This effect is specific for zzso to zzso since addition of an zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso causes a statistically significant decrease in zzso zzso relative to zzso alone on zzso Western zzso One protein that is affected this way has been identified as zzso zzso zzso show a zzso and statistically significant decrease in zzso activity upon zzso to zzso which zzso with an increase in zzso of zzso zzso the negative regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows an increase in zzso of zzso zzso after zzso to zzso Our results may identify a signaling zzso involving the zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso
