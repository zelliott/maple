zzso is a zzso mechanism mainly involved in the recycling and turnover of zzso constituents from zzso zzso Over the last years, zzso genetic screens have considerably increased our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of zzso and a number of genes involved in fundamental steps of the zzso zzso have been zzso Most of these zzso genes are present in higher zzso indicating that this process has been zzso zzso In zzso zzso is mainly involved in adaptation to zzso but in zzso organisms this route has emerged as a zzso zzso involved in a variety of additional processes such as programmed cell death, removal of damaged zzso and development of different zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is associated with a growing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, zzso and neurodegenerative zzso The zzso and pathological roles of zzso as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso pathway, are discussed in this zzso
