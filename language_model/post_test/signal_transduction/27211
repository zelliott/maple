The zzso axis in the frog, zzso zzso is specified by a zzso process that begins at zzso zzso of the egg zzso leads to the zzso of a zzso system on the future zzso side of the zzso that is responsible for the formation of the zzso organizer at the zzso zzso Members of the zzso family, as well as zzso and activated zzso have been shown to mimic this zzso system, but it is not known which factor or factors are used by the zzso To zzso this process, we have isolated the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso since zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that a zzso zzso of zzso can induce an zzso organized when expressed on the zzso side of the zzso zzso leading to zzso with duplicated zzso These results indicate that repression of zzso is critical for formation of the zzso axis in zzso zzso of zzso can regulate the fate of zzso cells, indicating that the repression of zzso may activate a downstream zzso zzso
