To understand how muscle cell spreading and survival are zzso by zzso we studied the signaling events initiated by the attachment of muscle cells to zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that muscle cell spreading on zzso is zzso by zzso zzso is associated with rapid zzso of focal zzso zzso and is dependent on zzso of protein zzso C zzso Here we investigated the role of individual zzso zzso in these cellular zzso We show that zzso delta and zzso are expressed in muscle cells and are activated upon zzso engagement with different zzso - zzso was activated early, whereas alpha and zzso were activated zzso Using zzso zzso we found that the zzso of zzso was necessary for cell attachment to zzso However, using zzso zzso we found that zzso of each of three zzso was sufficient to promote the spreading of zzso cells on zzso To investigate further the mechanism by which zzso signaling and zzso zzso mediate cell zzso we studied the effects of these processes on zzso a zzso of zzso and a protein known to regulate zzso zzso We found that zzso was localized to focal zzso sites soon after cell zzso and that zzso zzso from the membrane to the zzso during the process of cell zzso This zzso correlated with different zzso of zzso zzso and with reorganization of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso cells in which zzso expression is inhibited fail to spread on zzso providing evidence for the crucial role of zzso in muscle cell zzso Together, the data suggest a model in which early zzso of zzso is necessary for cell zzso the later zzso of alpha or zzso may be necessary for the progression from attachment to zzso The mechanism of zzso cell spreading may be via the zzso of signaling zzso such as zzso that are involved in the reorganization of the zzso zzso
