The zzso resumption process has been related to spontaneous zzso zzso calcium zzso in fully grown mouse zzso Our purpose was to determine whether the acquisition of zzso competence during the growth phase of zzso was associated with that of zzso zzso and whether these zzso were dependent on the zzso zzso We used zzso laser scanning zzso to image free calcium zzso in zzso zzso recovered from 12- to zzso mice for 15 zzso following zzso zzso As expected, zzso isolated from zzso mice were totally incompetent to undergo zzso in zzso whereas the zzso rate increased progressively with mouse age and zzso zzso The percentage of zzso exhibiting spontaneous calcium zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso were similarly correlated with the female age, with incompetent zzso failing to exhibit spontaneous zzso zzso It is noteworthy that regardless of the stage of growth, zzso induced an zzso calcium release from the zzso stores when it was added to the culture zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso induced a shorter sequence of zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso than in zzso mouse zzso and, whereas zzso increased the zzso rate at 15 days, it was unable to induce zzso at 12 zzso These data lead us to conclude that the acquisition of zzso competence is related to the functionality of the zzso zzso and, zzso to the zzso ability to generate spontaneous zzso zzso calcium zzso
