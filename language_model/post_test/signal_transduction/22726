Treatment of intact zzso cells or zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity and zzso expression as revealed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level and zzso gene zzso One hundred zzso zzso caused an zzso zzso of cellular zzso metabolism without zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited in zzso cells, presumably due to the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, neither zzso metabolism nor zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso in the zzso isolated from these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and BA (10 zzso zzso the activities and increased the zzso levels of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and also induced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso zzso and zzso In zzso experiments, it was found that zzso with the stimulation of the activity of a key zzso regulator of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these agents enhanced zzso acid zzso metabolism as judged by the release of zzso from AA into the culture zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso mediates the regulation of zzso and zzso BA and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells through zzso interactions that involve the zzso of the zzso and fatty acid zzso signaling zzso These results also present evidence for the first time, for the possible zzso effects of zzso and BA which are similar to those of zzso in this mouse zzso zzso cell zzso
