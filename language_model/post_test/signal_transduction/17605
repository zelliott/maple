zzso in zzso readily respond to a wide variety of zzso and systemic signals by inducing a complex pattern of early response genes zzso The level of complexity is evident in both the zzso expression zzso and levels of message zzso as well as in the zzso of response within a population of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso suggest that all zzso in culture are not zzso Although the ability of zzso cells to express zzso appears to be highly restricted in zzso one important exception is the category of zzso response to zzso zzso expression of multiple zzso proteins in zzso cells zzso by zzso conditions may play an important role in the outcome of brain injury and neurodegenerative zzso The extensive and staggered expression of zzso proteins acting as zzso factors may represent a mechanism for temporally zzso the zzso program of large sets of genes associated with zzso cell response to zzso zzso As part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may zzso and integrate the environmental signals associated with zzso damage and promote the proper restoration of zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso expression regulates the zzso of the nerve growth factor zzso gene in zzso which could have important functional consequences on zzso survival and process zzso Future studies will clarify the mechanisms that lead to the expression of zzso and the subsequent complex, temporally ordered zzso consequence of numerous zzso proteins acting as zzso factors zzso upon target gene zzso Such studies will enrich our understanding of zzso interaction, clarify how distinct sets of genes in zzso cells contribute to the problem and/or solution of zzso situations and guide our efforts to diagnose and treat zzso zzso
