zzso zzso leukemia zzso patients exhibit a variable clinical zzso To investigate the association between zzso features and responsiveness of zzso cells to zzso zzso we evaluated gene expression changes and modifications in zzso distribution, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso samples upon zzso zzso zzso analysis highlighted a different response profile to zzso stimulation between zzso and M zzso zzso analysis identified several genes modulated exclusively in the zzso cases upon zzso zzso zzso gene groups, including signal zzso transcription, zzso regulation, and zzso organization, were zzso upon stimulation in zzso zzso zzso and proliferation analyses confirmed that zzso zzso induced a significant progression into the zzso phase and a moderate increase of zzso activity exclusively in zzso zzso Moreover, we observed only a small reduction in the percentage of zzso cells, without changes in zzso in zzso zzso zzso a significant increase of zzso levels was observed in zzso cells from M zzso These results document that a differential zzso and functional response to zzso zzso between zzso M and zzso cases is operational in zzso indicating that response to zzso stimulation plays a pivotal role in disease zzso
