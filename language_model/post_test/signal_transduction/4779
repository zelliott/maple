G zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso plays a key role in cardiac signaling regulation, and its expression is increased in heart zzso Recently, increased expression of zzso in the zzso of mice has been shown to be zzso in the setting of zzso zzso The ubiquitous nuclear zzso factor zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of numerous genes in various zzso and zzso of zzso has been shown to be associated with heart zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso signaling in the regulation of the zzso gene and expression of this zzso in zzso First, in analyzing the zzso DNA of zzso the presence of a potential zzso binding site was observed in the promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso increased the levels of zzso in zzso whereas treatment of cells with zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso or with SC zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso 2 decreased zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso we found that both zzso and zzso zzso could interact with the promoter of zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso short interfering zzso zzso loss of zzso in zzso decreased the zzso increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso inhibited the levels of zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates that zzso plays a critical role in the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso and that this may translate to the significant expression changes seen in heart zzso
