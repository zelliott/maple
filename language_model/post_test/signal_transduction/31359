zzso to zzso elicits changes in zzso synthesis in the corresponding cell bodies that are critical for an effective zzso zzso For decades the most easily studied aspect of this phenomenon was the onset of zzso a suite of structural changes in the cell body characterized by zzso shifting of the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso The question: zzso is the signal for zzso received no less than 10 possible answers in a comprehensive review article published more than three decades zzso Here we come back to this 36 years old question, and review progress on understanding the mechanism of retrograde injury signaling in zzso peripheral zzso Recent work suggests that this is based on local zzso synthesis of critical carrier zzso including zzso and zzso that link diverse signaling molecules to the zzso retrograde zzso A zzso of binding sites and of potential signaling zzso including zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso may allow diverse options for zzso zzso of the injury status of the zzso for transmission to the cell zzso
