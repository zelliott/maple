zzso B10 cells, a zzso line of rat brain zzso zzso cells, exhibit a single zzso zzso zzso of which leads to increases in free zzso zzso In the current study the identity of this zzso zzso was determined by its binding parameters for a range of zzso zzso and by its complementary DNA zzso zzso The signal zzso mechanism activated by this zzso was also zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha S bound with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso expressed on B10 cells, which was found to be extremely abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated Ki values of a range of zzso zzso zzso which competitively displaced binding of zzso alpha S led to the rank order of zzso zzso alpha S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (both zzso 10,000 zzso The zzso zzso antagonists, zzso blue 2 and zzso were also able to zzso zzso with Ki values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast zzso acid zzso zzso was able to zzso only zzso of zzso alpha S binding at a concentration of 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a partial zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso zzso formation zzso by zzso zzso in a manner that was prevented by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be inactive at a concentration of 100 zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was derived from zzso from B10 cells and from zzso a rat zzso cell line known to possess a zzso zzso that is coupled to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the entire coding region revealed that both were zzso identical to the rat zzso zzso zzso No other zzso zzso zzso could be detected in B10 zzso Exactly the same sequence was isolated from rat brain cortical zzso where zzso has been shown to increase zzso C zzso zzso Since the zzso responsible for the zzso shares with the aforementioned binding site significant pharmacological features, including a strong activity of zzso zzso of zzso receptors alone among all known zzso zzso and an unusual zzso to zzso and since abundant zzso is present of the zzso zzso but not of any other type resembling the known zzso zzso it is concluded that a zzso zzso on rat brain zzso zzso cells can account for all of the zzso This single zzso zzso therefore, appears to couple in different native cell types to either zzso zzso zzso or to zzso C zzso
