zzso zzso is zzso by normal zzso breast cells but not by zzso zzso zzso is able to inhibit growth of breast zzso cells in zzso zzso exerts its activity via two zzso zzso zzso and zzso 130 zzso The expression of these zzso zzso in breast tumors has been zzso but there are no previous reports of their zzso significance, to the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was studied in 75 tumor samples obtained from breast zzso zzso Patients were followed for a maximum of 71 months zzso zzso 61 zzso 60 patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years or died during the observation zzso zzso factors were analyzed in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso specific to zzso zzso and zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly correlated with earlier stages of the zzso In zzso analysis, expression of zzso and its zzso zzso proved to be a positive zzso factor for overall survival zzso and disease free survival zzso zzso and zzso expression were good independent zzso factors for zzso The zzso zzso of all patients was zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso positive groups was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas in negative groups it was zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in breast zzso tissue is associated with earlier stages of the zzso In advanced zzso expression of zzso and its zzso zzso predicts better zzso
