As a neurotransmitter and zzso zzso zzso influences zzso outgrowth in the nervous systems of several zzso In zzso cells, zzso is known to have zzso effects, although the signal zzso zzso responsible for these effects is not zzso In this study, we hypothesized that a zzso increase in zzso zzso concentration zzso could be involved in zzso the effects of zzso Application of zzso to zzso cells enhanced nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth in a zzso manner, and the sensitivity of this zzso effect was increased in differentiated zzso zzso In zzso an increase in zzso was observed following application of zzso in differentiated zzso zzso This increase was amplified by further zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso calcium channel blocker, but not by zzso a zzso zzso zzso or zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso These pharmacological tests indicated that zzso increases in zzso are zzso by zzso of zzso calcium channels via zzso receptors and that zzso increases in zzso are likely to be independent of zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso increases in zzso which are zzso via zzso receptors and zzso calcium channels in zzso cells, and subsequent zzso of zzso and zzso enhance zzso zzso zzso
