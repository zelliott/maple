Although zzso is expressed in various stem cells, our understanding of the functional roles of zzso in embryonic stem zzso cells is still zzso and zzso Thus, this study investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and its related signal zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and protein expression levels, which were inhibited by a disruption in zzso by zzso D and translation by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by these zzso In investigation of signal zzso involved in this process, zzso increased zzso zzso concentration and the protein zzso C zzso which induced zzso signal regulated zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso activated by zzso was not involved in zzso signal regulated zzso zzso Moreover, zzso target of zzso signal zzso was zzso in response to zzso Finally, zzso increase of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were inhibited by blocking of zzso zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso pathways in mouse zzso zzso
