zzso in zzso zzso zzso are the most common known cause of Parkinson's zzso The zzso zzso tandem domain exhibits zzso activity controlling zzso zzso activity via an zzso zzso We report the interaction of zzso with the zzso family of zzso zzso key regulators of zzso zzso zzso pathways important for zzso guidance, zzso formation and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso can interact with and mediate the zzso of small zzso with structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso domain were necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso protein levels, an effect that was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were disrupted by the familial zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso strengthened zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso cells resulted in the zzso of zzso to typical zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells and zzso in zzso and growth cones of differentiated zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of the zzso of a key zzso protein interaction by zzso zzso domain zzso segregating with Parkinson's zzso Since the zzso zzso domain is known to be involved in the regulation of small zzso we propose that: zzso zzso may influence zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso domain zzso modulating zzso interactions indirectly influence zzso zzso Our findings also link zzso to zzso zzso zzso suggesting novel zzso mechanisms and new targets for genetic analysis in Parkinson's zzso
