Acute lung injury zzso and acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso is the clinical syndrome of persistent lung inflammation caused by various direct and indirect zzso Despite advances in the understanding of disease zzso few therapeutic have emerged for zzso Thus, in the present study we evaluated the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso a plant zzso in the context of zzso using in zzso zzso and in zzso models zzso zzso Our in zzso data supports the view that zzso zzso inflammatory condition in zzso as significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were observed with the single zzso of zzso post zzso zzso Also, zzso analysis of mice lung tissue demonstrated that zzso restored zzso zzso cellular influx inside the lung zzso zzso the mechanism of action, our zzso and western zzso analysis suggest that enhanced expression of zzso zzso the protective effect of zzso on zzso level in mice lung zzso zzso of zzso in turn appears to be zzso by zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity through zzso notably zzso the zzso induced protective effect in zzso induced human zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that zzso generated moderate amounts of zzso could induce zzso zzso in the in zzso zzso However, given the insignificant amount of zzso recorded in the injected material in the in zzso system, additional mechanism for zzso action could not be zzso zzso our results highlight the protective role of zzso in zzso and provide the novel insight into its usefulness as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of zzso
