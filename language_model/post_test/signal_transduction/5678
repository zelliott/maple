As in many fishes, zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso develops with pronounced zzso zzso zzso For example, in more than 95 per cent of zzso larvae, the zzso an accessory to the zzso organ, forms on the left side of the brain and the adjacent left zzso nucleus is larger than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso affects this bias, producing equal numbers of larvae with the zzso on the left or the right side and corresponding zzso zzso zzso of live larvae using fluorescent transgenic reporters provides a useful zzso for studying the effects of zzso asymmetry on zzso Previous studies had suggested that zzso zzso is correlated with zzso zzso such as zzso eye zzso We find that the zzso of zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso gene zzso does not alter a variety of motor zzso including responses to zzso zzso However, we discovered significant deficits in swimming initiation and in the total distance zzso by larvae with zzso zzso We discuss these findings with respect to previous studies and recent work linking the zzso region with control of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
