The zzso consists of a highly organized set of zzso that are largely generated zzso during expansion of the zzso cell precursor zzso zzso Since the zzso factor sonic zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells and functions as a zzso zzso in zzso it is possible that zzso influences zzso during zzso development by regulating the position and/or size of zzso We studied how zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso zzso regulate zzso proliferation in zzso and tested whether they influence zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression zzso zzso and temporally with zzso zzso of the zzso target gene zzso is also highest in the anterior zzso zzso but is restricted to zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso is expressed zzso in all cells in the developing zzso except zzso cells and zzso is broadly expressed along the zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso have a normal zzso zzso zzso have greatly reduced zzso at birth and a decrease in zzso In a complementary study using transgenic mice, we show that zzso zzso in the normal domain does not zzso alter the basic zzso pattern, but does lead to prolonged proliferation of zzso and an increase in the overall size of the zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate that positive zzso signaling through zzso is required to generate a sufficient number of zzso for proper lobe zzso
