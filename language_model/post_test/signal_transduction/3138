zzso zzso 1 zzso is an unusual zzso that interacts with multiple G protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their linked signaling pathways to regulate a broad range of zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso interacts with multiple G proteins are not well zzso Whether zzso interacts with various G proteins at the same, different, or overlapping binding sites is not zzso Here we investigated the functional and specific binding interactions between zzso and representative members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report that zzso physically and functionally interacts with specific zzso acids within the second zzso zzso loop of zzso We identified five zzso acids within the zzso zzso loop that, when zzso individually, each markedly reduced zzso zzso of linked zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso only zzso completely abolished direct zzso binding to zzso and also zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso in zzso cells and zzso primary zzso In stark contrast, none of the zzso zzso loop zzso disrupted direct zzso binding to either zzso or zzso or their functional zzso to linked zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso our findings suggest that zzso calcium signaling involves a newly appreciated zzso zzso In zzso we have identified key molecular zzso for zzso interactions with zzso and our findings support a model where zzso zzso or zzso each bind to distinct sites within the zzso regions of zzso
