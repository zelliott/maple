The zzso bystander effect represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the zzso effects of zzso radiation, in that zzso and zzso events may also contribute to the final biological consequences of exposure to low doses of zzso Although zzso bystander effects have been well documented in a variety of biological systems, the mechanism is not zzso It is likely that multiple pathways are involved in the bystander phenomenon, and different cell types respond differently to bystander zzso Using zzso zzso a number of cellular zzso zzso including zzso zzso have been shown to be zzso linked to the bystander zzso The observation that zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the bystander response further confirmed the important role of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cascade in the bystander zzso Furthermore, cells deficient in zzso DNA showed a significantly reduced response to bystander zzso suggesting a functional role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso provided evidence that NO and calcium zzso are part of the zzso zzso The bystander observations imply that the relevant target for various zzso zzso is larger than an individual zzso A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the bystander phenomenon, together with evidence of their occurrence zzso will allow us to formulate a more accurate model for assessing the health effects of low doses of zzso zzso
