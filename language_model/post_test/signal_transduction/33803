zzso protein zzso 12 is an inhibitor of transforming growth factor zzso type I zzso Several lines of evidence support the view that zzso stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation and zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso also known as zzso on cellular proliferation and on zzso protein production in human zzso 

We measured cell proliferation with flow zzso using zzso incorporation and zzso by measuring DNA concentration with zzso zzso Western zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used to measure the levels of zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis was also investigated by Western zzso The zzso signal was studied by both Western zzso and zzso zzso We used the zzso technique for zzso gene zzso Our results show that zzso stimulates zzso proliferation and collagen type I zzso zzso enhanced zzso levels and activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso which are important zzso of zzso zzso zzso D1 expression was zzso We also demonstrate that zzso activates the zzso signal in zzso and that, through this zzso it stimulates cell zzso 

zzso can act as a growth factor for zzso
