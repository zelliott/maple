Environmental signals in the cellular milieu such as zzso growth factors, zzso zzso zzso or zzso molecules on adjacent cells can activate signaling pathways that communicate the state of the environment to the zzso Several groups have evaluated gene expression or signaling pathways in response to increasing cell density as an in zzso surrogate for in zzso zzso zzso These studies have also perhaps assumed that cells grown at various zzso in standard in zzso incubator conditions do not have different zzso oxygen zzso However, zzso zzso can be induced by increasing cell density, which can exert profound influences on the target cell lines and may explain a number of findings previously attributed to zzso zzso zzso Thus, we first sought to test the hypothesis that zzso interactions as evaluated by the surrogate approach of increasing in zzso cell density in routine zzso culture conditions results in zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso Second, we sought to evaluate whether such interactions affect zzso zzso by the zzso response element zzso zzso we sought to zzso the signal zzso pathways zzso the induction of zzso in response to cell density induced zzso zzso in routine zzso culture zzso Our results indicate that zzso cell interactions can induce nuclear zzso of zzso protein and this zzso is associated with strong stimulation of the zzso zzso We also make the novel observation that cell zzso activity of the zzso is dependent on zzso oxide production, which acts as a zzso zzso factor zzso by densely cultured zzso These results suggest that zzso cell interactions associated with zzso zzso lead to the zzso induction of zzso activity via the cooperative action of zzso zzso zzso via zzso diffusion of zzso zzso In addition, these results highlight the importance of examining zzso zzso as a possible stimulus in experiments involving in zzso cell density manipulation even in routine zzso culture zzso
