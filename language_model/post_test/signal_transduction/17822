Control of the shape and size of indeterminate zzso such as roots and zzso is directly related to the control of the shape and size of the cells in these zzso as predicted by zzso cell zzso For example, the zzso growth of leaf cells directly affects the polar expansion of zzso Thus, the control of leaf shape is related to the control of the shape of cells within the zzso as suggested by cell zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso such as leaves, the number of cells does not necessarily reflect organ shape or zzso zzso evidence shows that a zzso zzso is involved in leaf zzso and that an increase in cell volume can be triggered by a decrease in cell number and vice zzso Studies of zzso leaves also suggest interaction between leaf cells that coordinates the zzso of these cells at the organ zzso Moreover, leaf size also appears to be coordinated at the zzso zzso The recently zzso zzso cell theory describes how leaf zzso and zzso mechanisms control leaf shape at the zzso via zzso zzso
