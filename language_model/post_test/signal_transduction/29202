To explore the role of early growth response zzso zzso signal zzso in acute zzso zzso liver injury in zzso 

A single dose zzso zzso of zzso zzso was administered by zzso to each experimental rat to induce zzso zzso Liver tissue and serum specimens were collected from rats at 24, 48 and 72 h after the zzso The values of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the values of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso were zzso by real-time zzso zzso and zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso NO and zzso were zzso by zzso acid method, zzso zzso method, zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso method, zzso 

In the model group at 24, 48, 72 h after zzso the values of zzso and zzso zzso were higher than those of the controls zzso zzso zzso In the model group at 24, 48 h after zzso the value of zzso zzso was higher than that of the controls zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference at 72 h zzso zzso zzso Of the model group, the zzso value of zzso was lower than that of the controls at 24, 48 and 72 h zzso zzso zzso Of the model group at 24, 48, 72 h after zzso the values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher than those of the controls zzso zzso zzso but the values of NO and zzso were lower than those of the controls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signal zzso is involved in acute zzso zzso liver injury induced by zzso After zzso was zzso zzso and zzso are activated consequently and attract zzso into the zzso zzso alpha and zzso are activated at the same time, so zzso are activated and the resulting zzso zzso and zzso increased, injuring the zzso zzso and NO may play a protective role in acute zzso zzso liver injury induced by zzso
