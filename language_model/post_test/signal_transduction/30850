We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso lung injury zzso produced by high peak inflation pressures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005), but the relative contributions of the various downstream products of zzso on the acute zzso response were not zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso and the downstream products of zzso acid metabolism in the zzso zzso increase in vascular zzso We zzso isolated mouse lungs and measured the zzso zzso zzso zzso after 30 zzso of ventilation with 9, 25, and 35 zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso increased significantly, zzso after ventilation with 35 zzso zzso compared with paired baseline values and zzso zzso Also, increased zzso of lung zzso suggested zzso zzso after zzso zzso However, treatment with 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso (an inhibitor of zzso or a combination of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso acid (a zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso increase in zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not prevent significant increases in zzso even though zzso zzso levels of the zzso or zzso products were significantly zzso These results suggest that multiple zzso from each zzso contribute to the acute zzso zzso increase in isolated mouse lungs by mutual zzso
