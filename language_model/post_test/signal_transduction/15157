zzso zzso contains a zzso of the zzso gene shown to be responsible for the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso acted as a zzso zzso sensing signal controlling zzso zzso gene expression when it is produced at high levels during mid exponential growth zzso 

zzso activity was produced by the parental strain zzso zzso when grown in rich zzso broth zzso as expected, but interestingly was not present in defined zzso Eagles zzso zzso zzso with previous studies, the zzso zzso showed comparable growth rates to the parental strain and exhibited decreased zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso analysis of genes zzso expressed in wild type and zzso zzso strains showed that many effects on zzso transcript abundance were dependent on the growth medium and linked to zzso functions including zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso to the wild type and the zzso zzso growing zzso in either zzso or zzso did not induce any zzso changes as zzso by zzso 

Taken together these results led us to conclude that there is no evidence for the role of zzso in zzso communication in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso under the growth conditions used, and that the effects of the zzso zzso on the zzso are related to the consequential loss of function in the activated zzso zzso
