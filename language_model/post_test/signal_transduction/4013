During zzso stimulation of the heart, there is a decrease in zzso zzso sensitivity zzso by the protein zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso I zzso zzso which occurs at zzso 23 and zzso 24 in an zzso extension unique to zzso decreases the zzso affinity of the zzso regulatory site of cardiac zzso C zzso In view of the zzso organization of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is not clear how the zzso signal at one end of the complex affects the zzso binding site at the other zzso To address this question, we zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso fragments, zzso and zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso labeled with zzso When zzso was zzso the affinity of zzso for the zzso complex decreased significantly as indicated by a shift in the zzso value from zzso to zzso Upon zzso the affinity of zzso for zzso decreased by zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso In contrast to the case with full-length zzso neither zzso nor zzso induced significant structural changes in zzso 5 as determined from zzso distance zzso between zzso 5 and zzso zzso Moreover, neither zzso of zzso could significantly restore zzso regulation of force generation, when exchanged into fiber zzso from which zzso had been zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso signal from zzso to the regulatory site of zzso involves a global change in zzso zzso
