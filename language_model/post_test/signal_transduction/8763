Perhaps the major challenge in developing more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer patients is confronting the zzso of the disease, recognizing that breast cancer is not one disease but multiple disorders with distinct underlying zzso zzso profiling studies have been used to dissect this complexity, and our previous studies identified a series of intrinsic zzso of breast cancer that define distinct populations of patients with respect to zzso Additional work has also used signatures of zzso zzso deregulation to dissect breast cancer zzso as well as to suggest therapeutic opportunities linked to zzso zzso 

We used zzso analyses to identify relations between breast cancer zzso zzso deregulation, and drug zzso For these studies, we use three independent breast cancer zzso data sets to measure an individual tumor zzso zzso between zzso status and zzso are examined and linked to predictions for response to conventional zzso 

We reveal patterns of zzso zzso characteristic of each molecular breast cancer zzso including within the more aggressive zzso in which novel therapeutic opportunities are critically zzso Whereas some zzso pathways have high correlations to breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso others have high zzso of activity within a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting biology independent of common clinical zzso Additionally, we combined these analyses with predictions of sensitivity to commonly used zzso zzso to provide additional opportunities for zzso specific to the intrinsic zzso that might be better aligned with the characteristics of the individual zzso 

zzso analyses can be used to dissect the zzso of breast zzso We use an integrated analysis of breast cancer that combines independent methods of zzso analyses to highlight the complexity of signaling pathways underlying different breast cancer zzso and to identify optimal therapeutic zzso
