In this study it is shown that both zzso and soluble forms of signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso induce proliferation and zzso synthesis by activated human B zzso zzso B cells express the zzso form of zzso zzso the soluble zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the expression levels of zzso on B cells are rapidly zzso after zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and L cells zzso with zzso efficiently enhance B cell proliferation induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso I zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso strongly enhances proliferation of both freshly isolated B cells and B cells derived from long-term in zzso cultures, indicating that zzso acts not only during the initial phase of B cell zzso but also during the expansion of zzso B zzso In addition, zzso enhances production of zzso zzso and zzso by B cells activated by zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to be a high affinity zzso and the present data suggest that signaling through zzso zzso binding during zzso and zzso cell interactions enhances the expansion and differentiation of activated B zzso
