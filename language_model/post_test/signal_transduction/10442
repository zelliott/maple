The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso consisting of a zzso labyrinth network that extends throughout the zzso of the cell and is zzso with the nuclear zzso In all zzso cells, the zzso is the site where folding and assembly occurs for proteins destined to the zzso space, plasma zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso is exquisitely sensitive to zzso in zzso and provides stringent quality control systems to ensure that only correctly folded proteins transit to the zzso and unfolded or zzso proteins are retained and ultimately zzso A number of zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso in calcium zzso or zzso status, elevated zzso protein zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso altered zzso and overloading of cholesterol can disrupt zzso zzso impose stress to the zzso and subsequently lead to zzso of unfolded or zzso proteins in the zzso zzso The zzso has evolved highly specific signaling pathways called the unfolded protein response zzso to cope with the zzso of unfolded or zzso zzso Recent discoveries of the mechanisms of zzso stress signaling have led to major new insights into the diverse cellular and zzso processes that are regulated by the zzso This review summarizes the complex regulation of zzso signaling and its relevance to human physiology and zzso
