zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites are observed on zzso isolated from rat liver and devoid of any zzso zzso or plasma membrane zzso A pH of about zzso is found optimum for maximum zzso specific binding that is sensitive to changes in zzso The zzso binding on the zzso can be distinguished into a high affinity site and a low affinity zzso The two binding sites are characterized by distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso The calcium zzso by zzso is highly sensitive to zzso since it is achieved even at 1 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, data are documented demonstrating that a rapid and transient zzso release by zzso zzso zzso from the intact zzso can be reversed by zzso The presence of zzso zzso the action of zzso in nuclear calcium zzso as zzso by the rate of calcium zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso A novel mechanism of nuclear calcium signaling is proposed where zzso brings calcium into the zzso zzso by its specific putative binding zzso
