Mixed lineage zzso zzso protein zzso was recently found to interact with zzso interacting protein 3 zzso and to be essential for tumor necrosis factor zzso programmed necrosis zzso in cultured cell zzso We have generated zzso mice by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene disruption and found zzso to be zzso for normal mouse development as well as immune cell zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso and zzso both showed resistance to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were indistinguishable from zzso cells in their ability to activate zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mice exhibited normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso production after zzso zzso zzso zzso protects mice from zzso acute zzso a zzso disease, but has no effect on zzso septic zzso animal zzso Our results provide genetic evidence for the role of zzso in zzso
