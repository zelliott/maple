The zzso zzso gene regulates growth through the zzso zzso zzso encodes a precursor protein that is processed and produces biologically active zzso zzso However, the functions of these peptides are not zzso In zzso zzso cells in culture and in flies in zzso zzso and zzso activated the zzso zzso and regulated body zzso In addition, the zzso precursor and the processed zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso of the central nervous zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso peptides processed from the zzso precursor are sufficient for regulating body growth through the zzso zzso in zzso
