The G zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso the precise regulation of zzso signaling is important for proper cellular zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso sorting of activated zzso are critical for the termination of zzso Unlike most G zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso protein complex 2 zzso and zzso rather than zzso However, the function of zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso signaling is not zzso Here, we report that zzso and not zzso regulates activated zzso zzso zzso via two different mechanisms that zzso in part, a subset of zzso zzso of zzso of G protein zzso zzso zzso A significantly greater increase in activated zzso signaling was observed in cells depleted of zzso using zzso or in cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso with defective zzso zzso This effect was attributed to zzso zzso of zzso surface expression and efficiency of G protein zzso We further found that zzso expression of zzso zzso members zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced activated zzso zzso zzso whereas signaling by the zzso zzso zzso was minimally zzso zzso zzso depletion analysis revealed a function for zzso in the regulation of signaling by the zzso wild type but not the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso wild type, and not the zzso zzso induced zzso association with zzso via an zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulates activated zzso signaling by altering zzso surface expression and through recruitment of zzso zzso
