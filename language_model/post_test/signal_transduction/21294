Identification of a new family of proteins zzso zzso that function as negative regulators of G protein signaling has sparked new understanding of zzso of this signaling zzso Recent studies with several zzso zzso proteins has delineated their ability to interact with and function as zzso proteins specifically for G proteins in the zzso zzso Here, we investigated the functional activity of zzso and a truncated form of zzso on G zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso protein zzso in intact zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso amplification of zzso ends analyses revealed the zzso expression of a short form of the zzso transcript that encodes the approximate zzso half of zzso This truncated form of zzso zzso was shown recently to function as a negative regulator of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Baby zzso kidney cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso exhibited a pronounced impairment in zzso factor zzso zzso zzso production, a zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in both zzso and zzso zzso were reduced significantly in zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso In contrast, baby zzso kidney cells zzso with the full-length zzso zzso showed no impairment in zzso and zzso zzso production zzso by these G zzso zzso However, zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was impaired markedly in both zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating the functional ability of both zzso forms to zzso zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence for regulatory effects of an zzso protein on zzso and zzso signaling in intact cells and document that the zzso region of zzso comprises the structural domain for this zzso
