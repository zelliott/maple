We studied zzso of insulin signal zzso zzso insulin zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat brain in response to insulin zzso and insulin resistance during the development of experimental type 1 or type 2 diabetes zzso In type 1 diabetes zzso characterized by acute insulin zzso specific binding of insulin in rat brain increased zzso in comparison with the control and zzso expression in rat zzso and zzso 2-4 fold surpassed the normal zzso In type 2 diabetes zzso (110 and 190 days of zzso changes in the test parameters in rat brain were less zzso These findings attest to involvement of the brain insulin signal zzso into the response to systemic insulin zzso in type 1 diabetes zzso
