zzso is required for tumor progression and represents a rational target for therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to have activity against various tumor cell types by zzso proliferation and inducing zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso have also been reported to inhibit zzso The goal of this study was to characterize the zzso and zzso activity of a recently developed zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate the zzso activity of zzso we did cell cycle analysis, cell zzso tube formation, invasion zzso in zzso and zzso plug zzso in zzso To determine the zzso activity of zzso we established human prostate zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso signaling zzso gene zzso and protein zzso we did Western blots and reverse zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso analysis was done to evaluate new blood vessel formation in zzso 

zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso correlated with induction of zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso tube formation, zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso dosing of mice with zzso (10 zzso reduced zzso and zzso tumor zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso zzso a wide range of effects on zzso cells that lead to zzso of tumor zzso These results support the role of zzso zzso as a therapeutic strategy to target both the tumor and zzso compartment and warrant the clinical development of these agents in combination with zzso zzso
