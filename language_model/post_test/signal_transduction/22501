Human zzso are neural zzso zzso zzso cells aligned at the periphery of the dental zzso They become exposed to zzso oral bacteria as these progressively zzso zzso then zzso to gain access to the zzso Due to their situation at the zzso zzso zzso are the first cells encountered by invading pathogens and/or their released zzso and zzso in the zzso the first line of zzso for the zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso are able to sense pathogens and elicit innate zzso In particular, they express several pathogen recognition receptors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso families, which allow them to recognize specific bacterial and viral zzso So far, most studies aiming at zzso the role of zzso in the dental pulp innate response have focused on zzso bacteria, as these largely dominate the zzso zzso in initial and moderate zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso were found to be sensitive to zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso acid which is recognized through cell membrane zzso Our studies have shown that engagement of zzso zzso by zzso triggers zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso production of various zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while promoting immature zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso including collagen type I and zzso zzso as well as zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso We provide here additional data showing the fine zzso of zzso in healthy dental zzso as well as differential regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes by zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso It appears from the aforementioned data that zzso immune events constitute potential targets for interrupting the signaling zzso which lead to excessive immune response and necrosis in the dental pulp tissue challenged with zzso zzso In particular, preventing zzso bacteria recognition or signal zzso by pattern recognition receptors may represent a valuable strategy to achieve this zzso Future studies in the field will pave the way for designing novel therapeutic agents which zzso zzso zzso to promote pulp healing and zzso
