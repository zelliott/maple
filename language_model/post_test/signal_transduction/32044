zzso zzso 5 plays a pivotal role in signal zzso in animal and plant cells, and it was previously shown that zzso protein zzso 5 zzso performs multiple zzso activities that are zzso by zzso changes induced by heat shock zzso In addition, transgenic zzso of zzso gene zzso enhanced heat shock resistance compared with zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying this enhanced heat shock tolerance through functional and zzso changes upon heat stress is not zzso In this report, zzso was shown to zzso interact with its zzso zzso under heat stress zzso In addition, in zzso analysis, zzso was observed to form a complex with zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso may enhance zzso via forming zzso complexes under heat shock conditions in zzso Finally, we show that zzso is primarily localized in the zzso of zzso
