We have carried out a detailed comparison of the zzso properties of differentiated zzso cells and human peripheral blood zzso We compared the effects of zzso stimuli and of zzso of zzso proteins on zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and differentiated zzso cells using zzso and a filter zzso for zzso We also assessed expression of zzso and zzso proteins using Western zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso polarity in zzso cells comparable to that of zzso zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso were also very similar for both cell types, concerning mean speed of migration, the fraction of migrated cells and the concentration of stimulus optimal for zzso The zzso zzso was in contrast clearly less effective in zzso zzso responses of differentiated zzso cells as compared to zzso An important functional role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso responses of zzso cells, consistent with their zzso during zzso could be confirmed using zzso with specificity for the corresponding zzso The only difference observed here between zzso cells and zzso concerned the differential effects of a protein zzso C zzso zzso the results presented here show that differentiated zzso cells, zzso with zzso zzso are a valid model system to study molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
