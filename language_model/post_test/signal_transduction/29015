Noise exposure is known to induce cell death signaling in the zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is known to induce both cell survival and zzso the present study focused on early changes zzso 24 zzso after impulse noise exposure, zzso whether cell death is always related to zzso of zzso in the inner zzso zzso adult zzso rats were exposed to a single impulse noise exposure zzso zzso and sacrificed 3 or 24 h zzso zzso sections were examined for positive zzso of zzso zzso and the presence of cells with fragmented DNA zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso was observed at the spiral zzso and in the zzso zzso at 24 h following impulse noise exposure, but no correlation with zzso zzso was found at these zzso In the hearing organ zzso of zzso and in the lateral wall, zzso cells were observed at 24 h following zzso This was preceded by zzso zzso at 3 zzso indicating zzso cell death in these zzso Finally, zzso zzso was observed in the spiral zzso with no correlation to zzso zzso within the time frame of this zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso following impulse noise exposure may not always be related to cell death, and conversely, some cells may die through zzso zzso
