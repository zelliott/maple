Single injections of cocaine, zzso or methamphetamine increased zzso zzso levels in rat zzso by two- to zzso The D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect by itself but strongly attenuated zzso zzso induction by zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso when administered alone and greatly enhanced stimulation by zzso To examine the effects of repeated zzso on zzso zzso rats were treated with escalating doses of zzso zzso zzso for 4 days, followed by 8 days of multiple daily injections zzso zzso h zzso four zzso Twenty hours after the last injection the animals were challenged with zzso zzso zzso or vehicle and killed 1 h zzso In zzso animals, acute zzso induced the expression of zzso 3, and 5 and the immediate early genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were not zzso Prior repeated treatment with zzso strongly suppressed induction of immediate early genes and zzso to a challenge dose of zzso In sharp contrast, prior exposure to zzso did not reduce the induction of zzso and zzso zzso to a challenge dose of zzso indicating that control of these genes is resistant to zzso zzso These data establish a role for zzso receptors in the regulation of zzso expression and suggest that zzso and 3 might mediate some aspects of zzso zzso
