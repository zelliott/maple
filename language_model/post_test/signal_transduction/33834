The zzso family of signal zzso proteins is widespread amongst the three zzso of life, and its members have fundamental roles in the general control of nitrogen zzso These proteins exert their regulatory role by direct zzso interaction with a multitude of cellular zzso The interactions are dependent on the binding of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and on whether or not the zzso protein is zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso have been identified and termed zzso zzso and zzso In this report we zzso the interaction of zzso with known cellular targets such as the ammonium zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our results show that the interaction of zzso with cellular targets is regulated in zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso : zzso zzso Furthermore, we show here for the first time, to our knowledge, that in the interactions of zzso with the three different partners, the energy signal zzso : zzso zzso in fact zzso the zzso signal zzso In addition, by generating specific zzso acid zzso in zzso we show that the interactions with different cellular targets are zzso affected, and the possible implications of these results are zzso Our results are important to further the understanding of the regulatory role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso a zzso zzso in which the nitrogen fixation process and its intricate control mechanisms make the regulation of nitrogen metabolism even more complex than in other studied zzso
