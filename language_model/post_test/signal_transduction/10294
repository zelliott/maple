zzso and zzso family proteins are zzso zzso that act on surrounding cells to pattern many different zzso in both zzso and zzso The discovery that these proteins are zzso linked to lipids has raised the puzzling problem of how they come to be released from cells and move through zzso A synergistic combination of zzso cell biological and genetic approaches over the past several years is beginning to illuminate both the forms in which zzso zzso are released from cells and the variety of molecular and cell biological mechanisms that control their zzso
