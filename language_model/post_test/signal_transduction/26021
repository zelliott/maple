zzso zzso zzso serve for zzso of specific zzso and its zzso efficacy is regulated by interacting proteins or zzso zzso Whether and how the zzso themselves are modified by cellular signaling is zzso Here we report that protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso Regulatory Factor 1 zzso can switch its zzso preference between two proteins of opposing actions on zzso zzso zzso factors that promote zzso formation elevated zzso zzso at a zzso site zzso and preventing this zzso reduced zzso formation in cultured zzso zzso and impaired polarization of cortical zzso in zzso zzso changed the relative affinities of zzso for its zzso leading to reduced degradation of polarity protein zzso and increased degradation of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could switch its zzso zzso contributing to selective protein degradation required for localized cellular zzso
