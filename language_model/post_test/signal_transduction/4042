zzso of the zzso zzso zzso responsible for starch degradation in zzso zzso is down regulated by the presence of zzso In order to zzso the role of zzso in the regulation of the zzso system, a zzso zzso library was constructed and screened for genes that enhanced growth of a zzso zzso zzso strain on starch zzso This screen allowed us to clone and characterize a novel zzso gene of zzso (and by zzso zzso and zzso designated zzso A strain transformed with multiple copies of zzso exhibits increased levels of zzso zzso and, consequently, increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso located on zzso zzso results in zzso absence of zzso zzso zzso has not been cloned previously and the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso to any other known zzso An outstanding feature of zzso is that the protein contains regions of 33 zzso zzso interrupted by only three zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso interrupted by a single zzso zzso zzso studies showed that deletion of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso caused by the zzso of zzso a previously identified zzso In turn, it was found that deletion of zzso still allows zzso of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso therefore appears to be positioned below zzso in a signal zzso zzso
