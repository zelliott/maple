Among human zzso zzso zzso zzso each G zzso zzso zzso is reported to have one G zzso zzso However, the signaling may not be as simple as previously thought to zzso zzso receptors are probably the least well understood among the zzso zzso but the authors found that zzso receptors couple to multiple signaling zzso When the zzso receptors were expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells, they modulated the level of second zzso For example, zzso of zzso receptors inhibited the zzso zzso activity and subsequently reduced the zzso level, as previously zzso In addition to this known signaling via zzso zzso receptors are coupled to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso receptors zzso opened the zzso channels, presumably due to the increase in zzso zzso after formation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso currents were inhibited by both zzso and zzso with zzso zzso suggesting the zzso between zzso protein and zzso C zzso Thus, the authors results indicate that zzso receptors couple to multiple second zzso systems and may contribute to the complicated zzso and zzso zzso Although this multiple signaling has been reported only for zzso receptors so far, it is possible that other zzso zzso zzso bear similar zzso As a result, in addition to the wide variety of expression patterns of each zzso zzso zzso it is possible that multiple signal zzso systems may add complexity to the zzso system in brain zzso The investigation of these zzso signaling and its impairment at cellular level may help to understand the symptoms of brain zzso
