Recent evidence indicates that the rate of progression of the zzso disease is significantly reduced in zzso major patients upon treatment with high doses of zzso zzso The authors have previously demonstrated that in zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso decreases the zzso of zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso which has a zzso effect on zzso zzso In this study, therefore, zzso zzso from zzso cells isolated from 10 patients with zzso or zzso cell zzso given zzso as compared to 10 zzso subjects has been zzso Evidence is presented showing that zzso treatment reduces zzso zzso zzso by zzso its steady state zzso and by enhancing its zzso through binding to soluble zzso zzso type II zzso We also show that zzso treatment limits the in zzso zzso of zzso a zzso factor involved in both zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are impaired in patients upon zzso zzso This mechanism may contribute to delayed progression of the zzso infection in zzso
