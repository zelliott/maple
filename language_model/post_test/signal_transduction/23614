zzso isolated from the bark of zzso zzso which are used as Brazilian medicine plant for the treatment of inflammation diseases, suppressed zzso oxide zzso production and induction of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression in zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso Because of zzso zzso zzso 4 and its signal zzso are indispensable to the production of NO and zzso expression by zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso signaling zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso zzso by zzso was suppressed by zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited not only zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso However, it showed no effect on zzso zzso zzso of transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso 1 that exists upstream of zzso and zzso and is required for the zzso of these signaling molecules on zzso signaling zzso These results suggested that zzso might have inhibited the zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, these results were supported from the zzso pattern of zzso on zzso signaling molecules when the cells were zzso by zzso zzso zzso which activates the same zzso as zzso on zzso signal zzso
