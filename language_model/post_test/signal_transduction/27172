To study the interaction between insulin zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso action in zzso cells expressing a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1048 zzso zzso normally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in cells expressing zzso 1048 zzso However, the zzso 1048 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso by zzso in zzso 1048 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso activity toward synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso activity was zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was restored with the zzso of the impaired zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso by the introduction of abundant zzso zzso in zzso 1048 zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso 1048 zzso causes a dominant negative effect on zzso in zzso signals to zzso and zzso zzso zzso which leads to decreased zzso DNA zzso and that the zzso insulin zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso which leads to the normal zzso zzso zzso
