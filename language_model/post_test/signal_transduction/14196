zzso is a dietary zzso that has been shown to have zzso and zzso properties in various types of human cancer zzso This study investigates the molecular mechanism of the zzso effects of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso reduces the viability of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells is accompanied by nuclear zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso triggered the zzso zzso zzso pathway, as indicated by the loss of zzso membrane potential, the release of zzso c from zzso and the regulation of B cell zzso 2 family member zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited a sustained zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and treatment with a zzso zzso inhibitor enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice experiments revealed that zzso significantly reduced tumor growth and weight in mice zzso with zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and that zzso zzso the in zzso tumor growth of zzso zzso zzso
