zzso zzso is a pivotal mechanism turning off zzso from the zzso zzso zzso It is well established that whereas zzso binding leads to zzso degradation of zzso transforming growth factor zzso causes zzso zzso zzso therefore leads to continuous zzso and is a more potent zzso than zzso In addition to zzso and zzso five zzso zzso have been zzso Although many of these zzso are zzso in zzso very little is known about their effect on zzso zzso We have compared the effect of six different zzso on zzso trafficking of zzso We find that, whereas they all stimulate zzso zzso they have very diverse effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor and zzso target all zzso for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso lead to complete zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso degradation of the majority but not all zzso zzso does not target zzso for zzso degradation but causes fast as well as slow zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso especially zzso are responsible for zzso zzso after stimulation with all zzso and persistent zzso zzso and zzso largely correlate with zzso zzso
