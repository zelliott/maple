zzso of isolated zzso under zzso (no zzso produced a rapid and strong zzso of overall zzso zzso which was neither related to cell death nor to the appearance of specific stress zzso Treatment of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso or with the zzso inhibitor zzso did not modify the impairment of protein synthesis induced by oxygen zzso indicating that such zzso pathways are probably not involved in the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso reduced the incorporation of zzso into proteins of zzso maintained under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso The effects of oxygen deprivation and zzso acid were zzso whereas sodium zzso did not enhance the impairment of protein synthesis induced by zzso This observation suggests that a common zzso involving the net zzso of protein zzso zzso that is insensitive to zzso might participate in the negative control of the translation induced by oxygen zzso The effect of zzso on the synthesis of proteins was fully and rapidly zzso upon the restoration of oxygen supply, thus indicating that zzso are able to sense zzso Although high zzso of zzso zzso partially mimic the effect of oxygen deprivation on protein zzso the nature of such an oxygen sensor remains unknown, and appears unlikely to be a part of a classic zzso zzso
