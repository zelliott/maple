zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso hormone zzso zzso However, molecular mechanisms for this induction remain zzso We therefore developed zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso a zzso signaling zzso to address whether zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso We show that these zzso act in a dominant negative manner by blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso activity in the dominant negative zzso clones prevented zzso from promoting zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso whereas this zzso action was enhanced zzso p zzso zzso in zzso zzso clones in comparison to zzso cells zzso However, zzso or dominant negative zzso clones showed comparable zzso zzso induction after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso an alternate zzso of zzso transcription, indicating the zzso specificity for zzso zzso Moreover, dominant negative zzso of zzso activity resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso confirming the in zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Chemical or molecular blockade of the zzso protein zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a critical zzso component of the zzso zzso interface in zzso zzso
