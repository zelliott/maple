zzso is essential to life in zzso and zzso is a fundamental element in zzso Progress in characterizing the mechanisms that mediate zzso has been made possible by using a uniquely accessible cell model, the zzso zzso cell of the zzso tilapia, zzso zzso In addition to a brief historical zzso we offer a summary of our recent progress on signal zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is a central regulator of zzso balance in zzso in freshwater zzso zzso with its essential role in zzso zzso zzso release in zzso is zzso related to zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso changes in zzso cell volume control zzso zzso A decrease in zzso zzso increases cell volume, leading to a rapid influx of zzso through zzso channels followed by a sharp rise in zzso zzso Our recent studies also suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso signal zzso and that zzso zzso can zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso show a larger rise in zzso release after a reduction in medium zzso than those from SW zzso Paradoxically, zzso increase in zzso zzso was observed only in cells from SW zzso Our studies have revealed differences in the abundance of the water channel, zzso 3 zzso and the stretch activated zzso channel, transient zzso potential zzso 4 zzso in zzso cells of zzso and SW fish that may explain their differing zzso and zzso output in differing zzso zzso
