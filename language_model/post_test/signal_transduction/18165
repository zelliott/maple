The plasma protein zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to constitute a critical component of the zzso zzso The protein has also been suggested to act as an zzso zzso in a diversity of experimental zzso Recently we reported that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso cells per zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso on primary cultures of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were studied using the zzso zzso We found that 1) zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso as reflected by the increased zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso with zzso zzso zzso for 20 zzso markedly and zzso inhibited the effect of zzso whereas zzso did not; 3) zzso zzso a zzso response that was abolished by zzso with either zzso or zzso and finally, 4) zzso of zzso for 6 zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the action of zzso In zzso this is the first report demonstrating that zzso affects human zzso cells and that it does so by using zzso as a second zzso This provides an explanation for previous findings of zzso effects of the protein and shows that zzso affects the zzso during both normal and zzso zzso
