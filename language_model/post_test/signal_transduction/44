zzso and their receptors have an important role in analgesia and alcohol and substance use disorders zzso We have identified several naturally occurring zzso acid changing zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso and assessed the functional consequences of these previously zzso zzso in zzso expressing cell zzso Several of these zzso had altered trafficking and signaling zzso We found that an zzso zzso showed significant zzso in response to zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso which did not zzso in response to zzso Also, when zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso suggesting that, in the zzso condition, the zzso zzso would be zzso This finding is potentially important, because zzso zzso has been associated with development of tolerance to zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso abolished both signaling and zzso in response to zzso doses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso led to independent trafficking of the 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a rightward shift in potency of both zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso displayed a subtle zzso shift in zzso zzso These data suggest that these and other such zzso may have clinical relevance to zzso responsiveness to both zzso zzso and zzso drugs, and could influence a broad range of zzso including zzso pain responses, and the development of tolerance to zzso
