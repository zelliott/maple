zzso patterning of the developing brain is crucial importance for accurate wiring and zzso Although the adult brain contains many complex structures, it begins with a simple zzso neural zzso As it develops, the neural tube is divided into several regions, including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In each of these regions, signaling molecules are zzso from discrete zones, which establish zzso information and regulate regional zzso There are many zzso questions that remain to be resolved about the action of these growth and differentiation zzso The cellular factors zzso patterning in response to these factors are largely zzso Furthermore, identical differentiation factors are expressed in different regions of the brain and yet control significantly different patterning mechanisms, and the factors that control zzso responses to these factors are mostly zzso Furthermore, differentiation factors also show dramatically different expression patterns in different zzso species that may zzso changes in brain structure, but the mechanisms by which these changes in gene expression occur poorly zzso To address these issues, we discuss the role of zzso which controls zzso patterning in different regions of the developing zzso We also discuss how modifications of zzso expression in the zzso controlled by zzso can change the shape and function of the brain in various zzso
