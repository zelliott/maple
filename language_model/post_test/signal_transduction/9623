zzso disease zzso is an inherited disorder characterized by excessive zzso of zzso in cells due to a zzso zzso that is linked to programmed cell death zzso Although clinical manifestations vary, type II zzso is the most severe zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso stress, neurological dysfunction, and zzso zzso human zzso zzso has been very popular for treating zzso anemia and recently was shown to have zzso effects including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects prompted us to test zzso beneficial action on type II zzso patient zzso Initially, to examine the responsiveness of type II zzso cells to EPO, the expression of the EPO zzso was determined at zzso and protein zzso EPO effects on signaling pathways and zzso stress in zzso cells were also zzso Finally, the zzso effect of EPO on zzso cells was zzso We found that EPO zzso signaling zzso enhanced the expression of zzso reduced zzso stress marker protein levels, and enhanced the proliferation rate of type II zzso patient zzso This novel approach involving a beneficial role of EPO in zzso should provide insights into new concepts for treating zzso
