Evidence for a general role of zzso D in signal zzso is zzso In the present study, the activity of the zzso was investigated in heart tissue under zzso conditions and after addition of zzso zzso or aluminum zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso plus 10 zzso zzso zzso of rats and chickens were incubated with zzso acid in order to label zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso generated zzso and zzso acid zzso the primary zzso products of zzso zzso When zzso or zzso ethanol was present, zzso zzso was rapidly formed at the expense of zzso This zzso reaction is specific for zzso D zzso The zzso formation of zzso was not inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso which is known to activate protein zzso C, enhanced the net formation of zzso whereas the inactive 4 zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso also increased the formation of zzso and, in the presence of ethanol, of zzso The zzso formation of zzso occurred again at the expense of zzso zzso and maximum effective zzso of zzso were 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on either zzso zzso and generation of zzso showed the same zzso zzso both effects were blocked by a zzso zzso zzso but not by a zzso medium without zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
