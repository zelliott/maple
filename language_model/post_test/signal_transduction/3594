One of the prevailing theories of aging, the zzso zzso theory, views aging as the result of the zzso of damage through imperfect zzso Aging, then, is explained from an evolutionary perspective by asserting that this lack of maintenance exists because the required resources are better invested in zzso However, the amount of maintenance necessary to prevent aging, zzso zzso has so far been largely neglected and has certainly not been considered from an evolutionary zzso To our knowledge we are the first to do so, and arrive at the conclusion that all maintenance requirement needs an evolutionary zzso zzso in maintenance requirement can only be selected for if these are linked with either higher zzso or better capabilities to cope with environmental challenges to the integrity of the zzso Several observations are suggestive of the latter kind of zzso the existence of which leads to the inevitable conclusion that the level of maintenance requirement is in principle zzso Even the allocation of all available resources to maintenance could be unable to stop aging in some zzso This has major implications for our understanding of the aging process on both the evolutionary and the zzso zzso It means that the expected effect of measures to zzso resources to maintenance from reproduction may be small in some zzso We need to have an idea of how much maintenance is necessary in the first zzso Our explorations of how natural selection is expected to act on the maintenance requirement provides the first step in understanding zzso
