zzso cells have evolved multiple responses for dealing with DNA zzso One response is to acutely zzso DNA synthesis at the initiation zzso Essentially nothing is known about the initial signal that activates this zzso zzso or the zzso involved in zzso the signal into the final zzso step at zzso zzso whether any radiation induced changes in known proteins involved in cell cycle regulation or in other signal zzso pathways are primary or secondary responses to DNA damage constitutes a major challenge to identifying members of the zzso It may turn out to be easier to identify the final zzso in the pathway, namely the zzso whose interaction with origins is ultimately affected by zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes in genetically zzso systems such as S zzso or zzso zzso will allow the identification of zzso genes in zzso Most zzso cells are zzso negative, and yet it is not clear that zzso status influences radiation zzso The zzso zzso may therefore represent an important protective mechanism that stands in the way of effective zzso cell killing by radiation zzso It is hoped that an understanding of this zzso will provide opportunities for developing novel zzso targets and/or radiation zzso
