Delta proteins function as cell surface zzso for zzso receptors in a highly zzso signal zzso zzso Delta activates zzso by zzso zzso zzso of Delta that is in complex with zzso on a neighboring cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of Delta renders the zzso inactive by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso How zzso and zzso cooperate in Delta function is not well zzso We now show that zzso Delta zzso occurs independent of and prior to zzso in zzso and zzso mother cells in zzso and cells in zzso Delta zzso occurs at two novel sites that we identify in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition to the previously identified zzso zzso zzso which acts on the zzso domain, zzso in the TM domain is facilitated by a zzso zzso zzso that is distinct from zzso Furthermore, zzso in the TM domain is zzso in the presence of zzso Overall, zzso Delta zzso differs from the conventional regulated zzso zzso zzso mechanism by two criteria: zzso zzso processing of Delta is not sensitive to zzso and zzso TM and zzso domain zzso occur independently of each zzso Altogether, these data support a model zzso zzso can zzso Delta zzso activity independently of zzso
