Internal tandem zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso is the most frequent zzso in human acute zzso zzso and is significantly associated with zzso and a poor zzso Previously we reported that zzso with zzso zzso formed a zzso and was zzso on zzso zzso while the mechanism remains zzso In this study, we zzso the role of the zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso zzso with not only zzso but also an zzso or zzso zzso domain transformed zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso regardless of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso molecules such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the truncated zzso lacking zzso and zzso zzso with the wild type zzso into zzso cells resulted in the autonomous zzso In these cells, truncated zzso generated a zzso with zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso domain plays an important role in zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso but also activates zzso in a zzso
