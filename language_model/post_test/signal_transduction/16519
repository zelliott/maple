Many zzso require a zzso switch from budding to zzso growth to cause zzso Although the control of zzso has been zzso for organisms such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso almost nothing is known about the control of mating and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of genes whose zzso products act as, or interact with, components of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways that regulate mating and zzso in other zzso A comparison of gene expression under various in zzso conditions was superimposed on a comparison of in zzso zzso in zzso expression to yield a more complete picture of the expression of these genes in zzso zzso during zzso zzso For the most part the expression of these genes was highest on low zzso intermediate for zzso and in zzso and lowest on rich zzso As expected, under conditions of low zzso expression of the zzso zzso ammonium zzso genes zzso and zzso mirrors that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An intriguing possibility is that zzso is a sensor to signal when conditions are conducive for zzso The zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso at least zzso mating and might be linked to ammonium zzso in zzso zzso
