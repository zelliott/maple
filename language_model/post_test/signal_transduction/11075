zzso binding zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso factor implicated in the regulation of terminal zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, potential interaction partners of zzso involved in zzso development were zzso zzso was found to associate with other zzso family members, including zzso and zzso as well as other proteins that are known to contain a zzso protein interaction motif including zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso demonstrated the potential for interaction with proteins that do not possess a zzso zzso including proteins that may be involved in zzso zzso inhibitor of activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As expected, the association of zzso with other zzso family members depends on the presence of a functional zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso with zzso (as an example of a zzso zzso showed that zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso The function of zzso interacting proteins was further zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in potent zzso in a zzso reporter zzso A gel mobility shift zzso suggests that zzso zzso and zzso proteins can bind as zzso to a zzso consensus zzso zzso As zzso is known to represent a zzso zzso the functional interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso caused marked zzso repression of target reporter zzso Our results suggest zzso partners of zzso zzso the function of zzso in zzso gene zzso during zzso
