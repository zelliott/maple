Following shocks with low zzso electric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a yellow zzso that has alarm properties for zzso and zzso properties for zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso for zzso snakes has been isolated and zzso to zzso from such zzso by means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso protein is highly attractive to zzso zzso it loses its activity after zzso zzso It is a zzso consisting of a single zzso chain with an zzso zzso This zzso has a minimum molecular mass of zzso zzso calculated from its zzso acid and zzso contents and an apparent molecular mass of about 20 zzso as estimated from sodium zzso zzso gel zzso It has a zzso of about zzso and it binds wheat germ zzso but not zzso zzso This zzso shows a protein to zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and a ratio of total sugar to zzso sugar of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of its zzso 15 zzso acid zzso has been zzso Studies were also conducted on the zzso zzso through the zzso sensory system of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso bound to snake zzso sensory zzso membrane zzso It did not bind to membrane extracts of the zzso zzso of the zzso mushroom zzso The zzso also bound specifically to zzso sensory zzso membrane in a zzso and zzso fashion with zzso and zzso values of about zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso studies, the zzso applied to the zzso zzso caused an increase in firing rate of individual zzso in the accessory zzso bulb of zzso zzso the projection site for zzso zzso The present results are the first clear zzso and zzso evidence for a zzso zzso response to a zzso zzso zzso and this makes the zzso snake zzso system ideal for studying the mechanisms of zzso zzso
