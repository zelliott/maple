zzso and genetic studies have demonstrated that members of the zzso zzso zzso family are critical innate immune zzso zzso are recognition receptors for a diverse group of microbial zzso including bacteria, zzso and zzso This study demonstrates that distinct zzso are responsible for the recognition of zzso zzso zzso versus intact zzso zzso We show that the zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso were unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso response to whole zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso not by zzso but rather by zzso Studies of zzso zzso revealed that expression of human zzso was sufficient to zzso responsiveness to intact zzso bacteria, but zzso zzso was not zzso Our studies further suggest that zzso zzso island genes may zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso as zzso bacteria were more active on a zzso basis compared to zzso zzso bacteria for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso studies, analysis of knockout mice demonstrated that zzso was required for the zzso response to intact zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso mice produced a robust zzso zzso response zzso and zzso when zzso with intact zzso zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso mice were profoundly unresponsive to intact zzso zzso failing to zzso zzso even at high zzso zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso may be the dominant innate immune zzso for recognition of gastrointestinal zzso zzso
