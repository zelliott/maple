In zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso and its target protein zzso control secondary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso showed high zzso similarity in zzso acid sequence with the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by cloning and zzso zzso zzso and a fusion protein between zzso and zzso zzso produced in high yield as inclusion bodies in zzso coli were zzso with zzso zzso by column zzso and then zzso to an active form by dialysis to gradually remove the zzso zzso was also fused to zzso zzso zzso the fusion product in the soluble fraction in zzso coli was zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso yielded zzso products containing zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso or zzso production, irrespective of the culture zzso The zzso zzso did not form aerial zzso or spores on media containing zzso at zzso higher than zzso but did form spores on zzso and zzso zzso this suggests that zzso is essential for zzso in the presence of zzso Introduction of zzso restored aerial zzso formation in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso introduction of zzso restored the zzso in aerial zzso formation on zzso zzso Thus the zzso system in zzso zzso is zzso needed for zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso it is zzso involved in secondary zzso
