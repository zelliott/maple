Stem cells zzso through zzso division or zzso through zzso division whilst generating zzso cell zzso The balance between zzso and zzso division requires tight control to either expand a stem cell pool or to generate cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso dividing zzso cells transform into zzso dividing zzso The switch from zzso cells to zzso is triggered by a zzso wave that sweeps across the zzso Here we review recent findings showing that the orchestrated action of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways controls the progression of the zzso wave and the sequential transition from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso to zzso transition in the zzso lobe bears many similarities to the switch from zzso cell to zzso zzso cell in the developing zzso cerebral zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a similar role in the transition from zzso to zzso stem cell pools in the developing zzso zzso and in the neural zzso zzso findings in the zzso zzso lobe provide insights into the transitions between zzso and zzso division in the stem cell pools of higher zzso
