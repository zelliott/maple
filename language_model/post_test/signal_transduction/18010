The zzso zzso protein is thought to play a central role in the zzso of Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso notably chronic zzso leukemia zzso There is compelling evidence that zzso transformation by zzso is critically dependent on its protein zzso zzso zzso zzso As a result, multiple signaling pathways are activated in a zzso manner, and thus the zzso of such pathways may affect the expression of genes that zzso the zzso zzso In this study, we used differential display to investigate the zzso of gene expression in zzso a zzso cell line derived from zzso blast crisis, after exposure to zzso which selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the expression of a set of 12 genes is correlated with the zzso activity and that the profile of these genes reflects mechanisms implicated in the zzso of zzso Several of the genes show a consistent pattern of altered regulation in all zzso zzso cell lines, whereas others appear to be unique to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso activity drives the expression of specific target genes that contribute to the zzso transformation of zzso zzso The identification of downstream molecules with a consistent regulation pattern may provide suitable targets for therapeutic intervention in the zzso
