zzso input from the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso is well known to be critical in learning and zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso may zzso zzso and zzso firing and thereby enhance plasticity in the zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso induced with zzso in zzso In the present study, we tested the role of zzso zzso activity in the induction of zzso beyond effects on spike timing by using a zzso zzso method at zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso action zzso zzso have been shown to induce zzso when the zzso zzso precedes the zzso zzso by zzso zzso but contribution of zzso zzso has not been ruled zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso Surprisingly, prolonged exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by SP, perhaps because of zzso zzso These results demonstrate an essential role of zzso signaling in this form of zzso zzso
