A human zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed in zzso and used to identify regulatory proteins that may be related to those present in zzso zzso The sequence similarity of human zzso B protein zzso protein 2 zzso protein to zzso zzso and zzso proteins suggested that these proteins might be involved in zzso zzso zzso in this model zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso reporter gene was reduced by approximately zzso in cells that lacked zzso In zzso interaction experiments indicated that a zzso fusion protein and zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the isolated zzso repeat zzso region of zzso from plasmids restored zzso zzso zzso function in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso proteins facilitate the zzso of human zzso zzso expressed in zzso perhaps in the same manner as the zzso zzso protein and related zzso proteins in zzso zzso
