zzso zzso regulates genetic competence through a complex network that receives zzso from a number of environmental zzso including two zzso peptides designated as zzso and zzso The response of the downstream competence genes to these zzso shows evidence of zzso and zzso and has been difficult to zzso We have used zzso zzso methods to study how combinations of zzso signals shape the response of zzso an alternative zzso factor governing expression of the late competence zzso We find that the composition of the medium determines which zzso signal zzso or zzso can elicit a response from zzso and whether that response is zzso or zzso across a population of zzso In a chemically defined zzso zzso zzso does not induce zzso whereas zzso zzso elicits a zzso response from all zzso In complex zzso zzso zzso does not induce zzso whereas zzso elicits a zzso zzso response from the zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso required an intact copy of zzso which encodes the precursor of zzso The zzso capability for both zzso and zzso response suggests that a constituent - most likely peptides - of complex medium interacts with a positive feedback loop in the competence regulatory zzso
