During zzso zzso the formation of reiterated structures along the body axis is dependent upon the generation of the zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a crucial role in both the generation and regulation of the molecular clock that provides the spatial information for zzso cells to form zzso In a screen for novel genes involved in zzso we identified a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso which is transcribed in an zzso manner, and may represent a new member of the molecular clock zzso The zzso of zzso is extremely zzso in the zzso of vestigial tail zzso a zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso have a similar phase to zzso fringe zzso zzso and they are arrested in zzso (a negative regulator of zzso zzso deficient zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso requires zzso and that its zzso patterns depend upon the function of zzso zzso signaling has been zzso to be upstream of zzso signaling but we demonstrate in this study that a zzso gene may also be regulated by zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that the zzso interaction of zzso and zzso signals, and of their respective negative feedback zzso function to organize the zzso clock required for zzso
