For over 30 years, empirical studies have demonstrated expression of chemically authentic zzso by diverse animal zzso and zzso zzso De zzso zzso of zzso zzso by animal cells displays striking similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso previously characterized in great zzso and molecular detail in zzso zzso zzso zzso The committed zzso step within this zzso involves an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso product of zzso zzso zzso to form the essential intermediate precursor zzso zzso We have hypothesized that zzso zzso is zzso within peripheral sites via conversion of zzso in a regulated zzso pathway, or conversely, zzso may be directly transported into the zzso and converted to zzso zzso within a similar zzso zzso The fundamental chemical relationship of the zzso zzso zzso and its immediate precursor zzso to zzso zzso expression indicates a novel zzso interactive mechanism that links zzso and zzso pathways in the zzso and zzso of key zzso responses, including higher order neural zzso zzso of interactive zzso and zzso signaling pathways within zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso factors driving zzso behavioral syndromes in major psychiatric zzso Our short review is designed to provide insights on zzso and zzso in schizophrenia from a novel perspective involving zzso zzso signaling zzso
