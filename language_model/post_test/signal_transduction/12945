The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso pathways zzso regulate zzso cell sheet movement during the process of zzso closure in the zzso By a genetic screen of zzso affecting zzso closure in zzso we have now identified a zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso and controls the localized expression of zzso in the zzso zzso We have also investigated how zzso zzso This unique zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Complex formation activates zzso zzso which in turn zzso and activates zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso represents a novel zzso regulating zzso activity by organizing a molecular complex of zzso and zzso factors, thus zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso
