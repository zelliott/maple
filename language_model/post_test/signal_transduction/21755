zzso and oxygen availability are key zzso parameters for zzso zzso In order to enable zzso cells to manifest their zzso zzso and oxygen levels we engineered a genetic sensor zzso which converts signals zzso on the cellular zzso balance into a robust reporter gene expression zzso Capitalizing on the zzso zzso zzso control system, consisting of zzso modulating zzso promoters in an zzso manner, we designed a zzso dual sensor zzso control system by fusing zzso to the generic zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso which zzso an artificial zzso zzso able to bind and activate zzso promoters assembled by placing a zzso operator module zzso of a minimal zzso promoter zzso When zzso levels were low and resulted in depleted zzso pools zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter genes was high as a consequence of increased zzso zzso zzso at hypoxic conditions leading to high zzso zzso levels, strongly reduced zzso interaction zzso low-level zzso expression in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso Other molecules (for example, zzso cyanide or hydrogen zzso which are known to imbalance the zzso zzso poise could also be detected using the zzso sensor zzso zzso sensor capacity zzso and oxygen zzso operated seamlessly in transgenic zzso cell derivatives adapted for growth in zzso suspension cultures and enabled precise monitoring of the population's zzso zzso As the first genetic zzso sensor designed for zzso cells, zzso may foster advances in process development and zzso zzso
