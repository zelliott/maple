zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in embryonic development of many zzso including the gastrointestinal zzso Sonic zzso Indian zzso mice die before or soon after birth, zzso further study of this signaling zzso in the mature zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso to zzso proteins zzso zzso during late stages of zzso or to early zzso mice produced zzso zzso zzso progressive zzso and severe zzso of dietary zzso In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of zzso zzso signaling on weight gain and zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso zzso was administered to adult zzso mice fed either a zzso zzso diet or a zzso zzso diet, and to adult zzso mice fed the zzso zzso zzso Weight gain was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso treatment in zzso mice fed the zzso but not the low-fat diet and in zzso zzso Further analysis of adult zzso mice fed the high-fat diet demonstrated that although total zzso zzso was normal, the rate of zzso zzso was significantly delayed in mice treated with zzso zzso and they had significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in high-fat fed zzso mice treated with the control zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings point to a potential role for zzso signaling pathways in zzso abnormalities of zzso zzso
