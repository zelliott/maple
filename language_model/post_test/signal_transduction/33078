This study compares the zzso changes in zzso in zzso zzso regions in normal mice and in mice carrying the zzso zzso which leads to delayed zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso techniques were used to define the time course of changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso after unilateral aspiration zzso of the zzso zzso In control mice, zzso zzso levels increased rapidly in the zzso zzso to a peak that was about tenfold higher than control at 2-4 days, decreased between 6 and 8 days zzso and then increased again to a second peak at 10 days zzso zzso in zzso for zzso were evident by 2 days, remained elevated until 12 days zzso and then decreased zzso In mice carrying the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso was substantially zzso zzso absent was the dramatic increase in labeling at 2-4 days zzso which was such a prominent feature of the response in control zzso Peak labeling in the zzso zzso was not seen until zzso days zzso The development of a zzso band of intensely zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zone was also delayed in the zzso animals, although there were modest increases in zzso as early as 2 days zzso that were seen throughout the zzso zzso to the zzso These results suggest that degenerative changes in zzso and synaptic terminals are the principal trigger for zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso although other signals also play a role in the early zzso zzso
