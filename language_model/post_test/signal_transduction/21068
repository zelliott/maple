zzso of a transgenic zzso line zzso that zzso zzso B zzso display enhanced zzso specifically in red zzso To identify genetic zzso necessary for zzso signal zzso in red light, we chemically zzso zzso seeds and screened zzso zzso for zzso of the enhanced zzso zzso One zzso red zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in the original zzso background as well as in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also deficient in several other aspects of red zzso responses known to be zzso by zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and the shade avoidance zzso zzso was mapped to the bottom of zzso 4 at a position distinct from all known zzso zzso Together with zzso analysis, the data show that zzso is a novel zzso zzso The evidence suggests that zzso represents a putative zzso signal zzso zzso potentially specific to the zzso zzso
