We have previously found that the zzso nuclear zzso which is specifically targeted by zzso in the limited zzso form of systemic zzso behaved as a potent migratory factor for human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso Other recent studies have shown that several zzso zzso induced cell migration by interacting with various zzso zzso zzso by this hypothesis, we undertook this study to determine whether zzso interacts with zzso receptors on the surface of human zzso to explore the relevant signaling zzso and to characterize the effects of zzso binding on zzso zzso 

To demonstrate the expression of specific zzso receptors by human zzso at both the zzso zzso and protein levels, reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso and flow zzso analyses were zzso zzso studies and specific zzso were used to further identify the zzso target on the surface of human zzso 

Our data strongly suggested that zzso used zzso zzso 3 zzso to mediate human zzso zzso Moreover, several lines of evidence indicated that zzso binding subsequently zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso via a zzso zzso mechanism that involved the processing of zzso zzso growth zzso zzso of the zzso through zzso was found to be a critical zzso that elicits zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso such as zzso Finally, zzso zzso were found to abolish this signaling pathway, thus preventing zzso from zzso zzso and exerting its zzso activities toward vascular smooth muscle zzso 

The identification of zzso as a zzso zzso opens up new perspectives for the study of the zzso role of zzso zzso
