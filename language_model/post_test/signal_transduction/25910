The best characterized zzso zzso employed by transforming growth zzso zzso is the zzso zzso We focused on zzso because it is essential for the zzso of zzso target zzso We aimed to explore the possibility of zzso zzso formation after wounding by blocking zzso zzso by means of a gene therapy approach using zzso expression of zzso zzso The coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso which has a deletion in the zzso region of zzso was introduced by zzso zzso into an zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and cell zzso collagen protein production, and the expression of collagen type I and type III zzso were evaluated in zzso using a cell proliferation test, western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso Cell proliferation and the expression of collagen type I and type III zzso and protein were all inhibited by the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso was applied zzso to wounds on rats, and zzso examination and zzso of the scars were performed to evaluate the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso successfully inhibited zzso formation in rat zzso In conclusion, zzso can block the zzso zzso of mouse wound cells zzso In addition, gene therapy with zzso can effectively inhibit wound zzso in rats and may potentially be applied to clinical treatment of zzso
