We report here the expression of functional zzso zzso zzso on mature zzso zzso cells zzso and synergistic effect of zzso on zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production by DC zzso from both zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso against zzso blocked such enhancing effect of zzso on zzso production, indicating the presence of functional zzso on zzso zzso effects of zzso were also observed on zzso production by DC zzso through zzso or zzso class II, suggesting that T zzso zzso can act on DC during zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that DC produce zzso during interaction with zzso zzso T cells from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso produced by zzso T cells upon zzso stimulation is an important factor during zzso to zzso differentiation by inducing zzso from zzso
