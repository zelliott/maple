zzso protein zzso IV zzso plays a key role in the regulation of zzso gene zzso The expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso regulated genes are involved in memory and zzso zzso We report here that: zzso a zzso analysis of zzso promoters of the human zzso predicted several zzso target zzso being zzso a very interesting zzso zzso zzso promoter contains zzso zzso motifs similar to those present in zzso target zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso and protein expression levels in rat zzso zzso as well as zzso promoter zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso with zzso increases the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter: zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso signaling improve spatial memory impairment and restores the expression of zzso in a mice double transgenic model for Alzheimer's disease which shows decreased levels of the zzso We conclude that zzso is regulated by the zzso signaling zzso and that its expression could play a role in the zzso function of the zzso signaling against the Alzheimer's zzso zzso
