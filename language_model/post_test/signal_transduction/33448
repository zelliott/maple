Our aim was to examine how certain signal zzso pathways influence the regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso breast cancer cell zzso 

We used the breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso treated with steroid hormones or various zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso Western blots and zzso were used to assess transcript and protein zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso upon zzso stimulation in the zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso in the presence of the hormone, thus implicating the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in regulating zzso zzso gene zzso Analysis of zzso cells revealed changes in zzso expression with a pattern parallel to zzso gene zzso zzso zzso identified zzso recruitment of specific zzso factors to the zzso zzso zzso including zzso binding to zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the breast cancer cell line zzso is dependent on major zzso signaling zzso This work provides a new dimension to the regulation of these zzso genes and the potential for new therapeutic targeting zzso
