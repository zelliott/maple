The zzso zzso protein zzso regulates zzso zzso within the nucleus zzso zzso but the precise zzso signaling zzso involved are not zzso This study examined the role for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in regulating excessive alcohol consumption within the context of the scheduled high alcohol consumption zzso model of binge alcohol zzso zzso bouts of binge drinking ( approximately zzso zzso per 30 zzso elevated zzso zzso expression and increased zzso activity in this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression attenuated alcohol zzso as did an zzso infusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting necessary roles for zzso in binge alcohol zzso Moreover, when compared with zzso zzso transgenic mice with an zzso point zzso in zzso that markedly reduces Homer binding exhibited a 50% reduction in binge alcohol drinking, which was related to reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the hypothesis that zzso signaling may be a mechanism governing excessive alcohol zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso were not zzso nor were they observed in the zzso transgenic zzso Finally, mice genetically selected for a high versus low zzso zzso differed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity, consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso a high binge zzso zzso Together, these data point to an important role for zzso zzso signaling in regulating zzso alcohol consumption that has relevance for our understanding of the zzso of alcoholism and its zzso
