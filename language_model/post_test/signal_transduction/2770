zzso release from zzso stores is one of the major events zzso zzso signals into living zzso Recently, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described to release zzso from zzso internal stores of zzso zzso T cells possess zzso zzso stores sensitive to caffeine, so a potential involvement of zzso in zzso signaling was zzso zzso released zzso in a zzso manner from zzso stores of zzso zzso T zzso Half zzso release was obtained at zzso zzso zzso Prior addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not influence zzso zzso release, indicating the presence of different zzso pools sensitive to zzso and zzso The specificity of the response was confirmed using the zzso zzso red, zzso and zzso All three compounds blocked zzso but not zzso zzso release in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release was also partly antagonized by zzso red, indicating involvement of a zzso step in the formation of zzso The presence of zzso zzso was analyzed directly by zzso zzso separation on strong zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a single zzso peak zzso with standard zzso The identity of this zzso material was further confirmed by its ability to release zzso in zzso zzso T zzso
