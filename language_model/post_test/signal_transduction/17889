The regulation of zzso protein function through zzso distribution is a crucial zzso zzso mechanism for zzso zzso We investigated the processes controlling zzso nuclear zzso Here we show that in the absence of zzso proteins nuclear export is not a default zzso for zzso zzso zzso In different cell backgrounds, zzso can be imported or exported from the nucleus independently of its capacity to interact with zzso zzso The cell zzso balance between nuclear export and import of zzso is controlled by the zzso domain, which contains several zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso state of these zzso whose zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso A zzso specifically zzso zzso at these zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso activity in zzso blocks zzso nuclear export in zzso limb zzso zzso Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of zzso nuclear export in addition to the absence of zzso zzso which involves the zzso of zzso zzso at specific sites within the zzso zzso
