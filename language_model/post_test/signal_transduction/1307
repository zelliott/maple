Nine zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso However, our knowledge of their individual functions is still zzso Here, we demonstrate the role of zzso in regulating zzso cell zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso which acts as a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity with zzso induced zzso and membrane ruffle formation in zzso zzso in the absence of growth factor zzso zzso zzso formation induced by zzso growth factor was significantly inhibited upon expression of zzso active zzso Moreover, the zzso active zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso These effects are zzso because, in the same experiments, none of the corresponding zzso of zzso and zzso closely related zzso affected cell zzso These results suggest that zzso specifically zzso in the zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso In support of this, zzso zzso with zzso zzso especially in zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso was physically associated with cellular zzso zzso zzso expression blocked the zzso formation induced by zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts upstream of zzso This model is supported by studies demonstrating that zzso zzso selectively activated zzso but not zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest that zzso functions through its zzso action as an upstream zzso of zzso and, consequently, zzso zzso
