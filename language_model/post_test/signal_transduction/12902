zzso are versatile adapter proteins that form complexes with most zzso receptors zzso following zzso binding and zzso of receptors by zzso zzso zzso zzso They play a central role in the interrelated processes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which lead to the termination of G protein zzso zzso binding to zzso both zzso receptors from zzso G proteins and targets them to zzso pits for zzso Recent data suggest that zzso also function as zzso signal zzso They can form complexes with several signaling zzso including zzso family zzso zzso and components of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By recruiting these zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso distinct signaling activities upon the zzso zzso complexes have been proposed to zzso zzso zzso to trigger zzso zzso and to mediate zzso zzso By acting as scaffolds for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso both facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso and target active zzso zzso to specific locations within the zzso Thus, their binding to zzso might initiate a second wave of signaling and represent a novel mechanism of zzso signal zzso
