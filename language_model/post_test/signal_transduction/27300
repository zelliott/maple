When zzso bind to their specific receptors in the membrane of nerve and muscle cells they induce zzso transitions leading to the formation of open zzso and zzso zzso zzso A knowledge of the rate and equilibrium zzso associated with these transitions is required to zzso relate the mechanism of the zzso reaction to the resulting changes in zzso zzso that trigger signal transmission between zzso zzso calculate changes in zzso zzso that result from the interaction of diverse zzso and zzso receptors in the same cell, and zzso understand the mechanism by which zzso function is affected by zzso zzso including clinically important compounds, and diseases of the nervous zzso The zzso transitions of interest occur in the zzso and the zzso time zzso Chemical kinetic techniques for studying reactions zzso by zzso neurotransmitter receptors in cells or zzso in this time domain were not zzso Here we describe the development and use of a laser pulse zzso technique suitable for chemical kinetic investigations of neurotransmitter receptors in the zzso s and zzso time zzso The type of information that can be obtained is also zzso
