zzso fibrosis, the excessive deposition of zzso zzso combined with the reduction of the cell zzso defines zzso diseases, a major cause of death and a public health zzso Key cellular processes in zzso include the generation of zzso from zzso cells, and the zzso or switch of already differentiated cells to a zzso synthetic zzso zzso a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, is zzso to be involved in muscle zzso We have examined whether myostatin affects the differentiation of a zzso zzso mouse cell line into zzso and/or zzso the zzso zzso and zzso expression of the cell zzso In addition, we investigated the role of zzso in this zzso zzso of cells with zzso myostatin protein did not affect the proportion of zzso in the culture, but significantly zzso the expression of zzso markers such as collagen and the key zzso factors transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as well as zzso and 4, and the zzso An zzso process evidenced by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 8 accompanied these zzso zzso inhibited zzso induction by zzso zzso with a zzso expressing myostatin zzso zzso whereas an zzso against myostatin blocked this zzso In conclusion, myostatin induced a zzso zzso without significantly affecting differentiation into zzso The concurrent zzso zzso reaction confirms the view that zzso switches in zzso and differentiated cells may affect the progress or zzso of fibrosis, and that myostatin pharmacological zzso may be a novel therapeutic target against zzso
