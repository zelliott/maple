Chemical communication is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic animals but is difficult to investigate because the signals are not zzso Here, we present the results of a study into chemical communication in blindfolded fighting zzso zzso zzso in which we employed a new method: zzso of urine using the dye zzso The probability of urine release is greater during fights than during zzso activities or zzso The eventual winners are more likely to release urine during fights than the eventual zzso In both winners and zzso urine release is coupled to offensive zzso and the probability of urine release increases with increasing levels of zzso In zzso zzso urine is carried to the opponent by the zzso zzso zzso During spontaneous release, urine is zzso zzso with the aid of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is effective in intimidating blindfolded opponents only in conjunction with urine zzso receivers decrease offensive zzso and increase defensive zzso zzso zzso alone does not intimidate zzso The loser of a recent fight is deterred equally well by a familiar and an unfamiliar zzso zzso in zzso individual recognition of the urine scent of a dominant individual does not appear to be significant for the maintenance of dominance zzso Our results suggest that urine contains information about the fighting ability and/or aggressiveness of the zzso The chemical signals thus far unidentified appear to be important in determining the outcome of a zzso
