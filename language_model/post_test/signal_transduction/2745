zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso insulin zzso and zzso gene expression of pancreatic zzso This study demonstrates the molecular cloning of a zzso for the zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso a seven zzso domain protein of zzso zzso acids which showed high zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from rat or zzso was zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso into zzso zzso a high affinity zzso was expressed which coupled to the zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso and increasing zzso zzso levels under stimulation with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso accepted only human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as high affinity zzso At 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were without zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso did not increase zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed one transcript of human zzso zzso zzso with an apparent size of zzso zzso The exact understanding of zzso zzso regulation and signal zzso will aid in the understanding of the zzso zzso failure to exert its biological action at the pancreatic zzso in type II diabetes zzso
