zzso is a zzso protein that is thought to function as an zzso of signaling pathways controlling zzso trafficking, zzso and zzso zzso It regulates zzso zzso and has binding zzso for zzso and zzso which is a zzso protein and an exchange factor for zzso We show that zzso cycles between at least three distinct zzso zzso including zzso structures, the leading edge and zzso zzso The zzso structures, which also contain zzso zzso and zzso do not zzso zzso with zzso zzso or membrane zzso suggesting that they represent a novel zzso zzso The zzso zzso complexes are zzso and tended to move toward the cell periphery where they joined existing zzso In retracting regions of the cells, the zzso complexes moved away from the disassembling zzso toward the cell zzso Using deletion zzso we have identified zzso that target zzso to each of the zzso zzso to zzso and the leading edge requires the zzso domain, which comprises the zzso 140 zzso zzso whereas targeting to the zzso complexes requires the central region that contains zzso repeats and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso but not zzso in which the zzso domain is deleted, increases the rate of migration and the size and number of zzso The latter are inhibited when zzso is zzso with a zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction with zzso is required for enhanced migration and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso targets zzso activated zzso to zzso and the leading edge via its interaction with zzso Since expression of zzso targets zzso zzso to the leading edge, it appears that the leading edge is the location of zzso responsible for these zzso Thus, zzso is a component of a zzso zzso complex that zzso a set of signaling components to specific locations in the cell where they regulate localized zzso
