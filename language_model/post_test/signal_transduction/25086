In previous studies we demonstrated that zzso preparations possess multiple effects in zzso on zzso hormone zzso We have now studied the specificity and signal zzso pathways involved in the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and incubated rat zzso zzso In the zzso experiments, freshly dispersed zzso cells were packed into short columns and were continuously zzso with zzso zzso The substances to be tested zzso were pumped through the zzso circuit, at the end of which zzso zzso were collected and zzso measured by specific zzso In the incubation studies, freshly dispersed zzso cells were incubated in a zzso incubator with different stimuli at different doses and for varying zzso zzso of cells with median zzso extract zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso or zzso zzso (30 zzso generated clear zzso release zzso zzso incubated with zzso zzso and zzso showed a zzso and zzso zzso effect on zzso release which, for zzso was blocked by zzso zzso an zzso zzso acid synthetic zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was unable to mimic the action of zzso To detect the possible signal zzso pathways involved in the response of zzso to zzso cells were incubated with the calcium zzso zzso the calcium zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso enhancers caffeine, zzso and zzso and the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso Both zzso (or zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso were able to reduce significantly the response of zzso to zzso Our results confirm previous evidence that zzso may act as zzso zzso The data also suggest that zzso and zzso pathways participate in these zzso
