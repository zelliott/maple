zzso zzso is emerging as an important contributor to zzso in various cell zzso However, zzso of zzso does not initiate zzso and cells which express zzso at zzso levels grow zzso suggesting that zzso may function differently between normal and zzso zzso In this study, we determined that an zzso protein zzso zzso positively correlated with cellular zzso zzso The 55 zzso zzso protein was not a result of a novel zzso zzso of the zzso primary zzso Instead, it was determined to be a zzso zzso of the full-length 68 zzso zzso protein that could not be inhibited by zzso zzso but could be suppressed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso cascade abolished the 55 zzso zzso and both zzso protein forms zzso and 55 zzso accumulated in the nucleus during zzso In a mouse model for zzso zzso acute zzso failure, the 55 zzso zzso protein was detected in the impaired zzso but not in the normal ones, and its levels correlated with the zzso of the zzso In zzso a 55 zzso zzso protein resulting from the zzso of 68 zzso zzso is induced during zzso and it is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso This study suggests that an alternative form of zzso may play a role in zzso
