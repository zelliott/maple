In the present study, the link between cellular metabolism and zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso skeletal zzso zzso events of zzso release from the zzso zzso were detected with zzso and zzso scanning zzso zzso functions were monitored by measuring local changes in zzso membrane potential (with the zzso dye zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso (with the zzso indicator zzso Digital zzso imaging zzso was used to zzso changes in the zzso zzso of zzso When zzso were immersed in a solution without zzso zzso zzso release events were readily zzso The addition of zzso or zzso zzso decreased the frequency of zzso release events and increased zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso Application of various zzso zzso led to the loss of zzso zzso and promoted spontaneous zzso release from the zzso zzso In many cases, the increase in the frequency of zzso release events was not accompanied by a rise in global zzso Our results suggest that zzso exert a negative control over zzso zzso in skeletal muscle by zzso zzso near zzso release zzso
