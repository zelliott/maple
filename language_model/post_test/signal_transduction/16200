Loss of zzso zzso zzso attachment leads to zzso zzso that limit cellular energy zzso zzso of the zzso zzso induced by zzso detachment revealed a dramatic decrease in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso decrease in flux through zzso the zzso zzso pathway, and the zzso acid zzso zzso However, flux through zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso with increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and increased carbon zzso zzso of zzso maintains zzso flux by suppressing zzso expression in an zzso manner, and zzso signaling also regulates zzso flux in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso of zzso positively regulates zzso flux through decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso cells suppresses the zzso rescue of zzso levels, and in attached cells, zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso de zzso zzso and cell zzso Mining of zzso data from human tumor data sets revealed that zzso zzso is commonly zzso in tumors compared with their zzso of zzso These results identify a novel mechanism by which zzso attachment, growth factors, and zzso zzso the zzso fate of zzso by controlling zzso expression and zzso flux to influence zzso
