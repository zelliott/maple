zzso zzso in zzso zzso involves an zzso recognition between zzso zzso and zzso resulting in zzso of incompatible zzso A picture of some of the zzso events and mechanisms involved in this specific zzso of zzso tube growth is beginning to be built zzso This highly specific response triggers a zzso zzso cascade in incompatible zzso when a zzso zzso interacts with zzso Rapid increases in zzso free zzso concentration zzso can now be attributed (at least in part) to zzso zzso The rapid loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso within approximately 1-2 zzso is accompanied by the zzso of zzso tube tip zzso zzso with this zzso zzso of zzso a soluble zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso reveals that it is a soluble zzso zzso which suggests a possible direct functional role in zzso tube zzso zzso later, a putative zzso zzso zzso is thought to be zzso Finally, preliminary evidence that programmed cell death zzso may be triggered in this response is zzso A key target for these signals, the zzso zzso has also been zzso In this article the current understanding of some of the components of this zzso cascade and how they are beginning to throw some light on possible mechanisms involved in this zzso zzso of zzso tube growth, is zzso
