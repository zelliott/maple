zzso sensing is a process of bacterial zzso communication involving the production and detection of zzso signaling molecules called zzso Recently, it has been proposed that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso derived from the recycling of zzso zzso to homocysteine, serves as a universal signal for zzso zzso 

In this study, 138 completed zzso were examined for the genes involved in the synthesis and detection of zzso Except for some zzso and zzso all organisms have a zzso to zzso zzso either using a zzso zzso conversion by the zzso and zzso zzso or a zzso conversion using zzso zzso 51 organisms including most zzso zzso and zzso and zzso possess the zzso pathway, while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prefer the zzso zzso In all 138 organisms, only the three zzso strains had strong, zzso matches to the zzso zzso binding protein zzso and the central signal relay protein zzso The initial zzso sensor zzso protein zzso and the terminal response regulator zzso are found in most zzso as well as in some zzso often in several zzso 

The zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso required for zzso synthesis is widespread in bacteria, while the zzso binding protein zzso is only present in zzso zzso Thus, other organisms may either use components different from the zzso signal zzso system of zzso strains to sense the signal of zzso or they do not have such a zzso sensing system at zzso
