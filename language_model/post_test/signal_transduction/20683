We prepared primary cultures of mouse zzso from the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso to examine the possibility of regional disparity in binding of human zzso and zzso brain zzso peptides zzso zzso and their effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound in a specific and zzso manner to all three zzso For both zzso zzso analysis suggested a single population of binding sites on zzso from all three zzso No significant differences were observed in the zzso binding capacities zzso or binding zzso zzso zzso between the two peptides in the zzso preparations from different zzso zzso and zzso also evoked zzso stimulation in a similar, zzso fashion in zzso from all three regions, with zzso responses to both peptides reached at a concentration above 1 zzso While zzso zzso a greater zzso zzso zzso than zzso no difference could be demonstrated in the zzso responses to either zzso between brain zzso Thus we have been unable to demonstrate regional zzso in the responsiveness of zzso to zzso and zzso
