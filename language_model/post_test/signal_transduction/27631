zzso of zzso growth factor zzso signaling by the zzso zzso has previously been found to involve zzso of an unknown zzso zzso zzso In transient expression experiments we tested different zzso for zzso towards zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or the zzso zzso zzso exhibited elevated activity towards zzso zzso in zzso zzso The possible relevance of zzso for regulation of zzso zzso signaling activity was further explored in stable zzso cells lines zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso expression clearly reduced zzso zzso zzso Also, soft zzso colony formation of respective cell lines was reduced upon zzso expression whereas zzso zzso zzso expression zzso both, zzso zzso zzso and soft zzso colony zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso expression rendered zzso cells resistant to zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso We propose that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, becomes activated by zzso via an unknown mechanism and is thereby capable to mediate zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso
