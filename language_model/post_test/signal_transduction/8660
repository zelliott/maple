zzso universal zzso of zzso are recognized by two kinds of zzso B1 and zzso which have been found to be expressed in numerous cell types of several zzso However, the knowledge of the regulation of these receptors in zzso is still not zzso In the current work, we have demonstrated a zzso production of B2 zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cells and its zzso zzso after cell differentiation with zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced the expression of both B2 and B1 receptors in cells before and after zzso Generally, the zzso cells were more susceptible to zzso induction of zzso receptors zzso by approximately zzso and zzso for B2 and B1 zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso of B1 zzso by zzso was detected on both zzso and protein zzso In addition, an unexpected strong induction of B2 zzso by this compound was observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells (by zzso and zzso zzso that suggests a possible zzso of zzso receptors by own zzso during the inflammatory zzso On the other hand, a strong enhancement of the expression of both receptors by zzso zzso especially in the zzso zzso cells, indicates the involvement of zzso receptors in the propagation of the inflammatory zzso
