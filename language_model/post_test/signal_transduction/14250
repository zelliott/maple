The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is activated via zzso zzso molecules or via zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso These lead to zzso of zzso stress fibers and formation of focal zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso signals are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso humor contains various biologically active factors, some of which are elevated in zzso zzso These factors affect zzso zzso in part, through ROCK signaling zzso Various drugs acting on the zzso have also been shown to increase zzso zzso by acting directly on zzso zzso In zzso animal studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso eyes is more zzso and more randomly oriented than in zzso control zzso In a previous study, we introduced ROCK zzso as a potential glaucoma therapy by showing that a selective ROCK inhibitor significantly lowered rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso directly affect the TM and zzso canal zzso differing from the target sight of other glaucoma zzso The TM is affected earlier and more strongly than zzso muscle cells by ROCK zzso largely because of pharmacological affinity differences stemming from regulatory zzso Additionally, ROCK zzso disrupt tight zzso result in zzso zzso and zzso zzso calcium level, effectively increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso eye with a ROCK inhibitor resulted in wider empty spaces in the zzso zzso area and more giant zzso in the zzso cells of zzso while the zzso lining of SC was zzso Interestingly, ROCK zzso also increase retinal blood flow by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells, directly protecting zzso against various zzso while promoting wound zzso These additional effects may help slow progressing visual field loss in glaucoma patients, making ROCK zzso an even more desirable zzso zzso All evidence indicates that zzso humor zzso is affected by zzso physiology and this information may provide valuable insight into understanding glaucoma pathology and zzso
