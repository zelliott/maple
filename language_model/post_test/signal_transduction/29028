zzso are zzso secondary zzso responsible of zzso intoxication in animals and zzso zzso zzso A and zzso are the best known zzso zzso able to alter zzso functions resulting in zzso zzso vomiting and zzso inflammation in zzso Although their effects on zzso barrier and transport activities have been extensively zzso the mechanisms responsible for their zzso effect are still poorly zzso Here we investigated if zzso zzso inflammation results from a direct and/or indirect zzso activity of these zzso on human zzso zzso cells, using differentiated zzso cells as model and zzso 8 zzso as an indicator of zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso able to directly increase zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We also investigated if these zzso could indirectly stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the action of zzso molecules such as the zzso zzso and/or zzso an increase in the zzso passage of zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso A and zzso all zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and increased the zzso passage of zzso bacteria zzso from 12- to zzso zzso In addition to potentially exacerbate established zzso zzso these zzso may thus participate in the induction of zzso and zzso inflammation in zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso zzso is zzso by both direct and indirect zzso
