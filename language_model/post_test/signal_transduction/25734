zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are important for the development of secondary zzso zzso during embryonic zzso The significance of zzso and zzso for the formation of zzso tissue during adult life is not well zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and laser zzso were used to compare zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso tissue that has been newly formed 8 zzso after avascular zzso into adult zzso During zzso zzso is sufficient to induce formation of the marginal zone, zzso T and B cell zones, and a mixed zzso cell zone that completely surrounded the T cell zzso zzso in adult mice, the formation of zzso compartments required both zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating that the molecular requirements for zzso tissue formation are different during embryonic and adult zzso Thus, interfering with the zzso zzso offers the possibility to selectively block the formation of zzso zzso tissue and at the same time to spare secondary zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso This opens a new perspective for the treatment of zzso and inflammatory zzso
