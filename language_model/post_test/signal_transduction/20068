zzso is the principal vaccine zzso for clinical applications but it is a poor zzso of cellular immunity and is not an optimal zzso for vaccines where zzso responses are required for zzso The mechanism underlying the inefficiency of zzso in promoting zzso responses is not fully zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso inhibit the zzso of the zzso polarizing zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso zzso selectively inhibited DC expression of the zzso zzso and the zzso effect results from zzso zzso zzso zzso To develop a more effective zzso for promoting zzso zzso we investigated alternative zzso and found that in contrast to zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso A combination of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso and enhanced zzso of zzso and the other key zzso and zzso polarizing zzso When used as an zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso also enhanced zzso and zzso responses but was less effective than zzso zzso zzso is an attractive alternative to zzso in zzso for vaccines where potent zzso immunity is zzso
