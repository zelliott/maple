To investigate the functional role of zzso a zzso zzso for human prostate cancer, in the regulation of zzso cell zzso we zzso zzso zzso into zzso 145 human prostate cancer cells and established stable zzso clones with high zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells exhibited significantly increased zzso cell zzso in comparison with the control zzso zzso This zzso of the zzso zzso was further enhanced upon exposure to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in the zzso signaling for the cell zzso Among several signal zzso zzso tested, zzso an inhibitor of zzso family zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso When different types of zzso expression zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso 145 cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited much lower zzso zzso than the mock cells zzso with an empty zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells was not enhanced by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates the zzso signaling zzso of zzso for the induction of zzso zzso of human prostate cancer zzso
