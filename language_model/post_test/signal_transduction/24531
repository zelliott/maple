zzso growth factor zzso signaling plays a major role in the control of aging and life span in zzso Major extension of life span in growth hormone zzso knock out zzso mice that are zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicates that similar mechanisms may operate in zzso This conclusion is supported by association of reduced zzso levels and delayed aging in three different zzso zzso mice and in animals subjected to caloric zzso but is difficult to reconcile with zzso effects of zzso and with the suspected role of declining zzso levels during zzso We suggest that the role of zzso in the regulation of growth and adult body size is important in zzso the effects of longevity genes on aging and life zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso action in aging also include reduced insulin zzso enhanced sensitivity to insulin, and reduced zzso with diminished zzso damage of zzso being the likely final common zzso of these zzso We suspect that zzso is important in zzso zzso mechanisms that link life history, including development, zzso and aging with availability of energy zzso
