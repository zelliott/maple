The zzso signaling zzso plays a very important role in the transmission of signals for initiation of zzso translation and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso activates various downstream zzso to promote initiation of zzso zzso translation and mediate zzso and zzso zzso Recent evidence has implicated zzso of this signaling cascade in zzso translation for zzso zzso genes zzso In addition, it was recently shown that zzso signals play important roles in the generation of zzso zzso and growth zzso responses, suggesting that zzso and its zzso can mediate diverse biological responses, depending on the cellular context and the triggering zzso In this review, the regulatory effects of various growth zzso zzso on the zzso zzso are summarized and the emerging new functions of zzso are zzso
