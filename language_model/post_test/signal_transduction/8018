The zzso associated with the cardiac zzso zzso membrane zzso specific membrane zzso to generate important zzso signaling zzso which are known to influence normal cardiac zzso However, impairment of the zzso and their related signaling events may be zzso factors in altering cardiac function of the diseased zzso The identification of the changes in such signaling systems as well as understanding the contribution of zzso pathways to the zzso of heart disease are rapidly emerging areas of research in this zzso In this paper, I provide an overview of the role of zzso signal zzso processes in cardiac zzso and zzso heart failure, diabetic zzso as well as in zzso From the cumulative evidence zzso it is suggested that zzso signal zzso processes could serve as novel targets for the treatment of the different types of heart zzso
