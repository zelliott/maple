zzso receptors are commonly thought merely to mediate the zzso of zzso particles or the exchange of lipids at the cell zzso Recent findings have now implicated these zzso receptors in cellular zzso mechanisms that extend beyond simple zzso zzso By zzso the cellular zzso of zzso vitamins and hormones, zzso a member of the LDL zzso gene family, regulates critical hormonal and zzso zzso Other members of the LDL zzso family interact with zzso zzso and scaffold zzso which allows them to transmit signals directly across the plasma membrane of the target zzso This sheds a new light on the emerging roles of zzso receptors in zzso disease processes such as Alzheimer's zzso
