We previously demonstrated that cultured human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso induced a slight increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso signal zzso after zzso stimulation was further investigated by analyzing zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso When zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso increased to zzso but zzso zzso decreased to zzso These changes concurred with the data on the protein levels of zzso and zzso as previously zzso The effect of zzso on zzso production in zzso was not significantly altered after the zzso of zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, an effect of zzso on zzso production did not appear when the cells were treated by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso from zzso was not altered by zzso of zzso Regarding the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso but was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and further stimulation by zzso almost completely abolished zzso zzso These changes were well associated with zzso levels of zzso and zzso These results suggested that zzso on zzso preferably zzso zzso resulting in a decrease of zzso in both the protein and zzso levels and that effect of zzso on zzso zzso is neither involved in zzso nor zzso zzso
