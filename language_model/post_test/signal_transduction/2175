Treatment of mouse zzso cultures with combined zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso induced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in sustained release of large amounts of zzso oxide, whereas zzso and zzso individually were unable to induce zzso expression in zzso The role of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso in the early zzso signal zzso involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso activated all zzso zzso and zzso pathways as determined by zzso zzso zzso using specific zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is specifically involved in zzso zzso zzso since zzso protein and zzso oxide release in the presence of a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso were dramatically zzso In contrast, zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso did not couple zzso to zzso transcription, but zzso had a clear role in zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso controlled zzso expression at the zzso level, since zzso zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was investigated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity in zzso zzso was exclusively zzso through zzso most likely because zzso signals in zzso did not connect to the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso expression depends on a yet zzso second zzso in addition to zzso
