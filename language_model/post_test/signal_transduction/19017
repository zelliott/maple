The zzso zzso modifier, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of a diverse set of target zzso resulting in important consequences to the cellular zzso zzso machinery charges the processed zzso so that it can be linked via an zzso bond to a target zzso The removal of zzso zzso from zzso proteins by zzso zzso pools of processed zzso and unmodified target zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso E1 and zzso recognize a diverse set of zzso zzso proteins using them to modify protein zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso recognize the zzso zzso zzso resulting in specificity of the zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso zzso is further diversified by the addition of regulatory zzso Therefore the zzso zzso in this zzso system, have evolved to contain information that allows not only zzso with the zzso system but also diversity with the zzso zzso
