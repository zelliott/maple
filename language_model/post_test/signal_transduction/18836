zzso zzso 1 zzso is one of the two known zzso which generates zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso involved in cell survival, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso generation of zzso were suggested to be part of the growth and survival zzso zzso and zzso of zzso provoked cell zzso zzso Using a highly selective and sensitive zzso approach, here we show that zzso zzso but not zzso in different primary cells and cultured cell lines results in zzso zzso of the synthesis of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso isotope zzso experiments in conjunction with zzso zzso of different zzso demonstrated strong interference of zzso zzso with the de zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso flow of newly formed zzso bases from zzso formation toward the synthesis of zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso was not directly linked to the de zzso zzso bases transformations and was dependent on zzso generation of zzso from complex zzso As a result of zzso zzso migration and zzso of human pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso to stimulation with external zzso but not zzso was strongly zzso In contrast, selective increase in zzso content of zzso or zzso through the zzso and zzso of corresponding zzso bases had no effect on zzso signaling or zzso of wound zzso Furthermore, infection of human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso virus increased zzso synthesis of zzso and zzso whereas zzso enhanced only zzso production in zzso These findings uncover a new functional role for zzso which can control zzso zzso balance by targeting zzso de zzso zzso and selectively generating zzso at a zzso step preceding zzso zzso
