zzso signal zzso systems involving zzso zzso and zzso to an zzso zzso on a receiver zzso have only recently been discovered in zzso although they are well studied in zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso is a zzso regulator involved in zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We have discovered a second function of zzso by identifying zzso activated zzso zzso zzso that regulate the essential zzso factor zzso zzso zzso cause a zzso increase in the activity of an zzso reporter, whereas deletion of zzso causes a zzso decrease in reporter activity and a corresponding decrease in expression of zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit reduced zzso of zzso and increased zzso suggesting that zzso zzso shift the zzso equilibrium toward the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso map to zzso zzso in the receiver domain zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso implicated in bacterial receivers to control receiver zzso zzso Thus, it appears that increased zzso zzso both stimulates zzso activity and diminishes signaling through the zzso zzso zzso
