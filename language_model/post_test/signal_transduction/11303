zzso constitute a family of zzso with apparently very restricted expression in human zzso They have previously been detected only in the zzso and the nervous zzso In the present study, two zzso were isolated from the zzso human colon zzso cell zzso The zzso were structurally characterized as a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso using zzso and mass zzso This zzso has not previously been structurally zzso When zzso cells were allowed to differentiate into more zzso cells by culture in zzso zzso expression of both of these zzso was greatly zzso The presence of zzso in a human colon zzso cell line indicates that expression of this family of zzso may not be as restricted as previously zzso Instead this class of zzso may serve as differentiation zzso in various normal zzso and in tumor zzso The zzso zzso was previously identified as a zzso for bacterial zzso and zzso The finding that this zzso is also linked to a zzso zzso opens up new possible roles for this zzso zzso in zzso zzso
