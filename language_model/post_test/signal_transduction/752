The effect of zzso zzso zzso on the human zzso zzso and on other zzso zzso receptors has been zzso We first examined the zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso receptors in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for reduction of the zzso zzso effect was zzso In contrast, zzso a competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso curve to the zzso zzso also zzso blocked the zzso zzso signaling induced by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A simple structural analogue of zzso was zzso and found to be inactive as a zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso group of zzso is a necessary structural component for zzso zzso zzso We next examined the possible zzso of the binding of the newly available zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso binding to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the competition for zzso zzso binding by zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that its antagonism of the zzso zzso may be zzso zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso of other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso selectively and zzso blocked zzso zzso signaling without affecting zzso zzso
