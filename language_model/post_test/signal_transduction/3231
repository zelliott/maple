The type 1 zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its downstream signaling components have become increasingly recognized as having a driving role in the development of zzso and consequently zzso has become a potential target for cancer zzso Several zzso of zzso are in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, including zzso cell lung cancer zzso These zzso agents include zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two phase III trials of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were discontinued in 2010 as it was considered unlikely either trial would meet their primary zzso In light of disappointing clinical data with zzso and other targeted agents, it is likely that the use of molecular markers will become important in predicting response to zzso This review outlines the role of zzso signaling in solid tumors with a particular focus on zzso and provides an overview of clinical zzso
