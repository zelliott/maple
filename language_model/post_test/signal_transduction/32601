Nuclear factor zzso B zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell zzso zzso and tumor zzso We provide evidence for a direct link between zzso activity and cell cycle zzso zzso was found to stimulate zzso of zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso checkpoint zzso Two zzso binding sites in the human zzso D1 promoter zzso zzso by zzso as well as by growth zzso Both levels and zzso of zzso D1 expression during zzso phase were controlled by zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso caused a pronounced reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and resulted in delayed zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso promotes zzso transition in mouse zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression of zzso cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso could be rescued by zzso expression of zzso zzso Thus, zzso contributes to cell cycle zzso and one of its targets might be zzso zzso
