zzso is driven by positive feedback zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso These feedback zzso ensure the swift and efficient elimination of cells upon initiation of zzso zzso At the same time, the signaling network must be insensitive to zzso mild zzso zzso to avoid zzso excessive cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in fact was shown to be a requirement for the differentiation of multiple cell types but might also occur accidentally during short, transient cellular stress zzso Here we carried out an in zzso comparison of the molecular mechanisms that so far have been identified to impair the amplification of zzso activities via the zzso zzso zzso zzso In a systems model resembling zzso cervical cancer cells, the zzso balance of zzso zzso suppressed the amplification of zzso responses, surprisingly outperforming or matching known zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso These findings were further substantiated in global sensitivity analyses based on combinations of protein zzso from the zzso to zzso range to screen the full spectrum of biological zzso that can be expected within cell populations and between distinct cell zzso Additional modeling showed that the combined effects of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein and zzso zzso processes can also provide resistance to larger zzso of active zzso Our study therefore highlights a central and so far underappreciated role of zzso zzso in avoiding unwanted cell death by lethal amplification of zzso responses via the zzso zzso zzso zzso
