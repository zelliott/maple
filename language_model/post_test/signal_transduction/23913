Cell migration and invasion are fundamental components of tumor cell zzso Increased focal zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso are connected with elevated zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in embryonic zzso and zzso zzso exhibit cell migration defects in zzso Here we show that viral zzso zzso transformation of zzso cells promotes zzso zzso equal to stable zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cells were not zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were required for the generation of an invasive cell zzso Cell invasion was linked to transient zzso zzso at zzso formation of a zzso signaling complex, elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso expression and zzso Our studies support a dual role for zzso in promoting cell zzso and invasion through the zzso of distinct signaling zzso
