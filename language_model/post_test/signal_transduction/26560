zzso how cell cycle is regulated in normal zzso zzso is essential for deciphering defects of breast cancer and therefore for developing new zzso zzso provided by both the zzso zzso and growth factors are essential for zzso cell zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso controls cell cycle in normal zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we describe the consequences of removing the zzso gene from primary cultures of zzso zzso cells in zzso using zzso Upon zzso gene zzso the cells were unable to progress efficiently through zzso but were still able to undergo collective two-dimensional zzso These responses are explained by the presence of zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso containing different zzso exert differential control on zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso deletion did not inhibit growth factor signaling to zzso or prevent the recruitment of core zzso components to focal zzso Instead the zzso arrest resulted from defective zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso and blocked zzso zzso zzso rescued the proliferation zzso in zzso cells, indicating that this zzso is essential in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso promote cell cycle in zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso are involved in zzso
