zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of various genes occurs subsequent to zzso signal zzso in its target zzso Using the zzso differential display method, a zzso gene was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso By DNA sequencing, this gene turned out to be zzso which has been reported as an zzso signaling zzso to zzso mast cell zzso Because zzso expression was limited to the zzso of a pregnant zzso its zzso expression was examined especially in relation to zzso expression during zzso zzso was expressed specifically on day zzso of pregnancy, as was zzso and the site of the most abundant expression of zzso and zzso zzso was the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso expression in the zzso zzso is induced just before zzso by zzso and/or zzso effects of zzso Considering its function as an zzso signaling zzso on mast cells, a possible role for zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso as an zzso that allows zzso attachment is zzso
