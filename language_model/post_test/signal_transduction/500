The zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been implicated as major cause of transformation in acute zzso zzso zzso signals zzso by zzso zzso are involved in cell differentiation and survival whereas zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem zzso promotes enhanced cell zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as zzso sites and zzso of growth factor zzso binding protein 2 zzso interaction, leading to the association of zzso associated zzso 2 zzso and contributing to proliferation and zzso zzso cells were zzso with either the zzso zzso or the zzso with or without a triple zzso of the zzso binding sites, and zzso in terms of proliferation and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso promoted increased survival but after introducing the triple zzso this zzso was zzso When looking into different downstream zzso this effect was mainly caused by decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso carrying the zzso binding zzso showed less zzso and zzso zzso compared to the regular zzso zzso zzso These findings not only reveal novel zzso sites in zzso but contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso functions in pathological zzso
