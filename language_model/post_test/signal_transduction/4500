zzso factors are important in the development of zzso 

The aim of this study was to search for novel genes that regulate bone mineral density zzso 

We performed a search for zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso using zzso zzso and a replication zzso 

zzso examinations were conducted in Japanese zzso zzso The mean zzso age of the subjects was zzso zzso zzso We chose five zzso associated with zzso as those having lower combined P values between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the second-stage zzso zzso zzso analyses than the value determined by zzso zzso We also analyzed the zzso zzso in knockout mice of a candidate zzso 

We focused on an zzso of G zzso zzso 98 zzso gene that showed a significant P value after the zzso tests in Japanese zzso zzso The subjects with one or two risk zzso zzso and AG zzso zzso had an increased risk of fractures zzso zzso zzso + zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso A zzso zzso test revealed that this zzso zzso did in fact correlate with mechanical fragility in zzso zzso Compared with primary zzso zzso primary zzso zzso had increased zzso expression and induced activity for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analyses in both human and mouse models uncovered the importance of the zzso gene in the regulation of bone zzso
