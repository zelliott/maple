The generation of zzso immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of zzso zzso a key signal of the innate immune zzso Yet, for many zzso the molecules that induce zzso production by zzso and the mechanisms by which they do so remain zzso Here it is shown that microbial zzso are potent zzso of zzso production by human zzso and that induction is zzso by zzso receptors zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso and the production of zzso oxide, a powerful zzso zzso zzso of zzso by microbial zzso may initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious zzso
