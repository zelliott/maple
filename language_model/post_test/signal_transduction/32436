Identification of a third component of the zzso zzso complex, zzso has established that the zzso complex consists of at least three distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso specifies the zzso zzso zzso The zzso or zzso alone do not show any appreciable zzso binding activity, however simultaneous existence of both chains generates a functional zzso complex that is suggested to associate with a zzso type protein zzso zzso that may deliver zzso signals further zzso zzso studies have revealed that discrete zzso regions of the zzso and zzso zzso at least two independent signaling zzso
