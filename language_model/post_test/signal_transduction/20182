The zzso box O zzso zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in the regulation of cell zzso and zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso zzso factors and the involvement of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso in the brain of the zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso through zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso increased when the animals ceased zzso zzso conditions reduced zzso zzso zzso but increased both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were simultaneously localized in the zzso These results provide new insights into the process of zzso of brain zzso through the involvement of zzso zzso factors following zzso of insect zzso
