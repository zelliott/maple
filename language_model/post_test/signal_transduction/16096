The zzso factor zzso contributes to zzso zzso in the heart presumably by regulating zzso and zzso zzso We wanted to study zzso function in the adult heart in zzso by expressing a zzso active zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso 

We generated transgenic mice in which a zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso expression in adult mice resulted in a decrease in heart weight by zzso and a reduction in stroke volume and cardiac zzso The decrease in heart size was due to a reduction in the size of individual zzso whereas there was no evidence for increased cell zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by the initiation of a zzso gene zzso with increased expression of zzso heavy chain and zzso zzso and by the zzso of zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso As shown by electron zzso zzso zzso zzso destruction of zzso and zzso and induced expression of zzso and zzso When zzso expression was shut off in affected mice, cardiac zzso and dysfunction as well as molecular markers were zzso within 1 zzso zzso expression did not counteract zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso active zzso leads to zzso heart zzso The zzso of the zzso suggests a remarkable ability of the adult zzso to respond to different regulatory zzso
