The zzso growth factor zzso system plays an important role in a variety of zzso processes and in diseases such as zzso Although the role of the zzso system in cancer has been recognized many years ago, components of the system have only recently been targeted and shown to affect cell zzso zzso survival, zzso and migration in tissue cultures and in mouse models of zzso We have been zzso that targeting zzso in addition to blocking its interaction with the zzso zzso type I zzso would also allow to block that portion of the signal zzso through the insulin zzso that is due to its interaction with zzso zzso its level may also not induce zzso of its production as for zzso Finally, targeting a zzso zzso as zzso may not require penetration of the zzso inside tumors but could shift the equilibrium to zzso zzso with zzso so the zzso concentration would decrease in the tumor environment without the need for the zzso to penetrate the zzso Here, we describe the identification and characterization of three novel zzso fully human zzso zzso They bound with high zzso affinity to zzso did not zzso with zzso and insulin, and zzso inhibited signal zzso zzso by the zzso interaction with zzso The most potent zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso and the insulin zzso as well as zzso of the downstream zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso with an zzso of the order of 1 zzso at zzso concentration of 10 zzso It also inhibited growth of the prostate cancer cell line zzso and migration of the breast cancer line cells zzso These results indicate an zzso potential of zzso zzso likely in combination with other zzso and zzso drugs but only further experiments in mouse models of cancer and human clinical trials could evaluate this zzso
