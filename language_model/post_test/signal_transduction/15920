The zzso activity of zzso zzso has recently been investigated in several cancer cell lines, including human zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso cell death in human zzso cancer cells is still not well zzso The aim of the present work is to explore the possible mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso A two-dimensional zzso zzso analysis was employed for identification of possible zzso proteins of zzso zzso Among zzso proteins identified as zzso we focused on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which has been known as a key zzso of zzso We also showed that zzso zzso the expression of the zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso which strongly regulates zzso zzso In order to obtain a broad understanding of the correlation of zzso and zzso we observed the zzso of the activity of zzso protein zzso regulators of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso by the zzso of zzso protein zzso
