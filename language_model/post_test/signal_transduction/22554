To investigate the signal zzso events underlying zzso actions, the zzso protein zzso cascade was zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso We found that zzso of three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with zzso actions in rat skeletal zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso and increased zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso rat zzso completely reversed zzso action on zzso and partially decreased zzso of zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso human zzso blocked zzso of zzso but had little effect on zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso via two independent mechanisms, and that zzso might be a zzso zzso zzso biological zzso
