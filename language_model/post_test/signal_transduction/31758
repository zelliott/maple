Maintenance of an optimal zzso environment is critical for appropriate functioning of cellular processes and cell zzso Despite the importance of maintaining zzso zzso it is not clear how the optimal zzso potential is sensed and set, and the processes that impact zzso on a zzso level are poorly zzso The genetic bases of cellular zzso zzso were investigated using a green fluorescent protein zzso based zzso probe, zzso and a pH sensitive zzso probe, zzso The use of zzso in conjunction with zzso enabled determination of zzso zzso zzso potential in a zzso and real-time zzso A zzso screen using both the zzso and essential gene collections was carried out in zzso zzso using zzso to identify factors essential for maintenance of zzso zzso state under zzso zzso 102 genes of diverse function were identified that are required for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these genes led to shifts in the zzso zzso zzso potential by zzso zzso Interestingly, some specific zzso zzso processes were identified as zzso in the data zzso Further investigation of the role of zzso zzso systems in zzso zzso zzso was conducted using zzso zzso targeted to the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was measured in cells in exponential and stationary zzso zzso allowed for the identification of key zzso systems on a zzso level and the identification of novel genes involved in the regulation of cellular zzso zzso
