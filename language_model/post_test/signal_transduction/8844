zzso restriction zzso and a reduced growth hormone zzso signal affect insulin sensitivity and lifespan in zzso in a similar zzso We investigated the effects of zzso and moderate zzso of zzso on zzso zzso of insulin signaling and the expression of genes related to fat metabolism in white zzso tissue zzso in zzso We used zzso male, zzso zzso zzso rats, fed ad zzso zzso or a zzso zzso diet from zzso of age, and transgenic zzso rats with moderately suppressed zzso zzso zzso were killed zzso after an zzso injection of zzso or zzso In control zzso rats, the levels of serum insulin, zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso 4 in the membrane fraction were greater in the zzso group than in the zzso group, indicating significant zzso of insulin signaling in response to zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso rats, the serum insulin and zzso levels were lower than those in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso even after zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso genes including zzso zzso and its zzso were higher in the zzso rats than in the zzso and zzso zzso The present findings indicate zzso tissue zzso profiles specific to zzso
