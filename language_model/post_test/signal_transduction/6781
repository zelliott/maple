Growth hormone zzso signaling is required for promoting zzso body growth, stem cell zzso zzso and survival and for regulation of zzso Failure to adequately regulate zzso signaling leads to disease: excessive zzso signaling has been connected to cancer, and zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso Since its discovery in 1989, the zzso has served a pivotal role as the zzso zzso zzso both structurally and zzso zzso and zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso at the cell surface: two zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine the zzso responsiveness of cells by controlling its zzso whereas zzso zzso the zzso zzso We used blue native zzso to identify zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso occur as zzso complexes that zzso into active zzso complexes upon zzso zzso The zzso complexes act as platforms for transient interaction with zzso and zzso zzso If zzso and receptors are made in the same cell zzso zzso only limited numbers of zzso complexes are zzso The experiments reveal the dynamic changes in zzso modifications during zzso signaling events and show that relatively simple zzso receptors like zzso are able to form higher order protein zzso Insight in the complex formation of zzso receptors is zzso important for engineering zzso that control zzso cell responses and for generating a new class of therapeutic agents for a wide range of zzso
