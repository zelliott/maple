zzso is a human protein found previously to associate with zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1), but whose cellular zzso remains zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso transport zzso protein that plays a critical role in assembling functional zzso zzso particle zzso We have cloned a loss of function zzso zzso in which several key components of the zzso machinery, including zzso as well as zzso zzso A and B zzso fail to enter zzso zzso and/or zzso resulting in compromised zzso structures and sensory functions, and abnormal zzso zzso zzso in different zzso backgrounds further suggest that zzso functions as a novel component of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso role, zzso zzso zzso to zzso bodies and zzso and zzso zzso functions zzso with the zzso syndrome protein zzso to ensure proper zzso a key zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings therefore zzso zzso in a previously unknown but critical role in zzso zzso and further highlight the emerging role of this zzso in zzso zzso
