The role of nuclear zzso 2 zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso signaling has not been characterized in human skeletal muscle despite an extensive zzso of zzso stress in the zzso of aging and zzso We assessed whether the zzso decline in zzso response is due, at least in part, to dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso We also evaluated whether an active lifestyle can conserve skeletal muscle cellular zzso status via zzso of zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso active lifestyle is associated with the zzso of upstream zzso that induce the zzso zzso response cascade in skeletal muscle of the zzso zzso a sedentary lifestyle is zzso associated with these adaptations mainly because of zzso of zzso zzso signaling that renders the zzso environment prone to zzso oxygen zzso zzso Our results indicate that an active lifestyle is an important zzso of cellular zzso zzso We propose that the zzso induction of zzso zzso signaling promises to be a viable therapy for attenuating zzso zzso damage in skeletal muscle associated with physical zzso
