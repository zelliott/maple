zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso zzso are generated in zzso of the zzso and act as zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso a key zzso underlying appetite control and energy zzso It is therefore important to understand many aspects of zzso gene regulation in the brain, as pharmacological manipulation of zzso zzso could be a potential strategy to combat zzso Most studies that have zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso have focused on gene zzso zzso Ultimately, however, factors that regulate zzso processing and zzso of peptides will have most bearing on zzso zzso This article focuses on zzso current evidence that zzso is involved in zzso zzso how zzso zzso is regulated in the zzso zzso the mechanism by which zzso processing of zzso is controlled in the zzso and what peptides are produced and zzso which zzso peptides are the most potent zzso at the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso It seems that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso may be regulated with respect to energy zzso We predict that further research into zzso zzso processing, and the zzso zzso involved, may yield important new clues on how flux through the zzso zzso is zzso
