zzso is a principal cereal food in a number of parts of the world and is critical in folk medicine in Asia and zzso However, its effects on bone are zzso Growth hormone zzso is a regulator of bone growth and bone zzso zzso activates several signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso thereby regulating expression of zzso including zzso growth factor zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso induce the differentiation of cells of the zzso zzso increasing the pool of zzso target cells, the mature zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso extracts zzso on zzso signaling via the zzso zzso in zzso were zzso zzso was not observed to be toxic to zzso cells and increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso hormone zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso The observations indicate that zzso signaling is similar to zzso signaling via the zzso signaling zzso Using small interference zzso zzso analysis, zzso was found to play an essential role in zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of the current study indicate that zzso promotes bone growth through zzso of zzso
