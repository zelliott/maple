Emerging data on the consequences of the interactions between invasive oral bacteria and host cells have provided new insights into the zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of the zzso zzso barrier by zzso bacteria appears to be a critical step in the initiation and progression of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso have developed different strategies to zzso the structural and functional integrity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to, zzso and replicates within human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to host cells is zzso and involves the interaction of bacterial zzso zzso with receptors expressed on the surfaces of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso within host cells is rapid and requires both bacterial zzso components and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso also zzso host responses to bacterial challenges by zzso immune cells and molecules and by zzso host processes leading to tissue zzso The zzso ability of these pathogens that allows them to survive within host cells and degrade zzso tissue constituents may contribute to the initiation and progression of zzso In this paper, we review current knowledge on the molecular zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in the development of zzso
