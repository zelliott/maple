zzso as a robust zzso for multiple zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and nervous systems, zzso zzso also is considered to be an attractive therapeutic candidate to zzso inflammatory cell function and survival during neurodegenerative zzso To this end, zzso of the central nervous system serve a complex function not only to dispense of foreign organisms and injured cells of the brain, but also to foster tissue repair and reorganization during zzso and vascular cell zzso We therefore examined the ability of EPO to zzso zzso cell survival and the underlying signal zzso pathways that govern zzso integrity during zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate in the zzso cell line zzso 2 that EPO provides direct zzso protection against early and late zzso programs of membrane zzso exposure and zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, expression and zzso of zzso is vital to the zzso capacity of EPO, since pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or gene zzso of zzso expression eliminates the ability of EPO to protect zzso zzso Through zzso dependent mechanisms that can be zzso through the gene zzso of zzso maintenance of zzso cell integrity during zzso by EPO is closely integrated with the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso trafficking of zzso and nuclear zzso Further work that continues to zzso the ability of EPO to target the intricate pathways that determine inflammatory cell function and integrity may lay the ground work for new therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative zzso
