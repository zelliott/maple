Our understanding of how steroid hormones regulate zzso functions has been significantly advanced by structural biology zzso However, progress has been hampered by zzso of the zzso binding zzso in zzso expression systems and by zzso flexibility that interferes with zzso Here, we show that protein folding problems that are common to steroid hormone receptors are zzso by zzso that stabilize zzso zzso of the zzso We use this approach to present the structure of an zzso steroid zzso that reveals a zzso channel allowing soaking of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of different pharmacological classes of compounds allowed us to define the structural basis of zzso signaling through the zzso zzso thus revealing a unique zzso of the zzso that allows selective suppression of inflammatory gene zzso The ability to crystallize many zzso complexes with distinct zzso allows one to define structural features of signaling specificity that would not be apparent in a single zzso
