It has been well known that Ras signaling is involved in various cellular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso However, distinct cellular functions of Ras zzso are not fully zzso Here we show the opposing roles of zzso and zzso genes in the zzso of cell sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso of active zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells increases resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is detected specifically in zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the increased zzso in cells zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso on the other hand, markedly increases radiation zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity is selectively enhanced by zzso radiation in cells zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso cell zzso We further show that the mechanism that zzso zzso of cell death in cells zzso zzso involves zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso in zzso cells is completely inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, introduction of cells with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell death as well as zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings explain the opposite effects of zzso and zzso on zzso of zzso and suggest that differential zzso of zzso and zzso zzso signaling by zzso and zzso may account for the opposing response to the zzso zzso These data provide an explanation for the diverse biological functions of Ras zzso and partly accounts for the differential response of transformed cells to zzso zzso
