zzso zzso segregation is controlled by the zzso checkpoint, which responds to the lack of zzso attachment or of tension across sister zzso through zzso of zzso proteins by the zzso zzso zzso Aurora B, and zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso on zzso generated by zzso zzso of an unknown zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso checkpoint zzso Using zzso approach and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso we report here that not only the formation of the zzso zzso is dependent on the checkpoint zzso but also the loading of the zzso zzso to zzso requires the prior assembly of zzso zzso and zzso onto zzso Interestingly, generation of the zzso zzso in checkpoint extracts requires the zzso activities of zzso and zzso but not that of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that checkpoint proteins in zzso extracts are assembled onto zzso in a highly ordered zzso consisting of three zzso zzso and zzso are loaded first, and zzso and zzso second, followed by zzso and zzso The characterization of this ordered assembly zzso provides a framework for the zzso mechanism of the checkpoint signaling and will aid in the eventual identification of the zzso zzso
