Previously we showed that the human zzso zzso gene was expressed during the induction of zzso differentiation in human leukemia zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we found that treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced expression of zzso zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso did zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso response element binding protein zzso was prevented by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity of the zzso region from zzso to zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or deletion of a zzso site located around zzso of the promoter reduced zzso promoter activity, as did the zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that induction of zzso zzso during zzso differentiation in zzso human leukemia zzso cells depends upon the zzso zzso
