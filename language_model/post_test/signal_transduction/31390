zzso zzso and zzso major heat shock proteins in zzso cells, belong to a zzso of the zzso family, zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso has completely different effects on zzso zzso depending on cell zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso zzso are not fully zzso Here, we established zzso cells that zzso either zzso or zzso by removing zzso and examined how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso features such as the zzso of zzso on the plasma membrane and nuclear zzso changes were induced by the treatment with zzso and the zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso of zzso or zzso In addition, we found that zzso of zzso or zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso and zzso by preventing the release of zzso c from zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso to zzso which results in the release of zzso c from the zzso was also suppressed by the zzso of zzso or zzso Thus, it is suggested that zzso suppresses the zzso zzso at its initial step, the zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso
