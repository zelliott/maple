The zzso zzso protein zzso is one of the most abundant molecules expressed on the surface of rat mast cells and rat zzso leukemia cells, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in these cells release of zzso zzso so does zzso of the zzso with high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso To examine whether there is any relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we have isolated from zzso zzso cells a zzso cell line deficient in the expression of surface zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its ability to be activated by an zzso to zzso Northern and zzso analyses revealed that the zzso cells were deficient in the expression of a structural or a regulatory gene for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso The cells did not respond by release of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but their response to zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso into the zzso cells restored the surface expression of zzso zzso zzso and responsiveness to both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on responsiveness to zzso zzso The combined data indicate that zzso of surface zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso which is independent of the presence of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and surface expression of zzso zzso zzso
