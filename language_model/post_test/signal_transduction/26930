We previously reported that zzso II zzso zzso increases zzso content through a new zzso II zzso zzso that is distinct from both the zzso and zzso zzso in differentiated zzso zzso In this study, the mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso increase was investigated in comparison with zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso increases in differentiated zzso zzso zzso II increased zzso in differentiated zzso cells zzso with a zzso effect in 30 zzso and a return to zzso levels in 60 zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the time course and zzso dependency of the effect of zzso II were similar to those of the effect of zzso which activates soluble zzso zzso but distinct from those of the effect of zzso which activates particulate zzso zzso zzso blue, an inhibitor of soluble zzso zzso attenuated the effects of zzso II and zzso but not that of zzso zzso a zzso zzso blocker, prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel blockers, zzso and zzso or an zzso zzso channel blocker, zzso failed to inhibit the effect of zzso zzso zzso II had no effect on formation of zzso zzso or zzso content, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in differentiated zzso zzso Further, the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso content but not that zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso formation and the effect was inhibited by the zzso oxide zzso zzso These results indicate that the newly found zzso II zzso mediates zzso formation through zzso of soluble zzso zzso and that the zzso is zzso by zzso oxide, which is increased by zzso influx via an zzso channel distinct from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
