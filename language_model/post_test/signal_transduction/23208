After birth, stem cells in the zzso zone zzso generate zzso that migrate along the zzso migratory stream zzso to become zzso in the zzso bulb zzso This migration is a fundamental event controlling the proper integration of new zzso in a pre-existing synaptic zzso Many regulators of zzso migration have been zzso however, still very little is known about the zzso molecular mechanisms controlling this zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein zzso is highly zzso in mouse zzso migratory zzso zzso mice display an abnormal zzso and a smaller zzso zzso labeling experiments show that lack of zzso significantly zzso zzso migration, but does not appear to affect cell zzso Moreover, zzso depletion substantially alters the polarized zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso of zzso on zzso regulates its zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso imaging of brain slices demonstrates that the zzso zzso of zzso activity ensures efficient zzso zzso Finally, zzso lifetime imaging zzso studies in rat zzso reveal that the interaction between zzso and zzso can be modulated by zzso zzso which controls zzso migration in zzso We conclude that zzso whose zzso appears to mark the transition to the migratory zzso stage, is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso We propose that a tightly regulated zzso cycle modulated by zzso signals is required for the polarized zzso and migration in zzso thus contributing to efficient zzso
