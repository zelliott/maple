zzso giant cells are a classic cellular feature of chronic zzso although the mechanism of zzso fusion leading to their formation is not well zzso Here, we investigate the participation of protein zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso fusion of human zzso zzso and foreign body giant cell zzso formation in zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso C attenuated zzso fusion, whereas zzso which is more selective for zzso and zzso did zzso zzso fusion was also prevented by the zzso C zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and by zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso for zzso or zzso In cultures of fusing zzso we detected only zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso and we also observed strong expression of these zzso by zzso Our collective results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or iota zzso zzso are not required in the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso whether zzso is required is zzso However, new evidence is provided that zzso formation is supported by zzso zzso and zzso in combined zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso
