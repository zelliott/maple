zzso is the major component for maintenance of zzso mass in adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso in mice zzso resulted in marked expansion of zzso mass by increase in zzso proliferation and zzso The current studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso proliferation by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso proliferation induced by zzso we generated zzso mice that were zzso zzso or zzso for zzso The results of these studies showed that deletion of one zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso expansion in zzso mice by decreased zzso zzso mice deficient in zzso developed zzso failure and zzso These experiments suggest that zzso zzso zzso proliferation in a zzso manner by regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data also indicate that zzso in levels of these cell cycle components could affect the maintenance of zzso mass in zzso states and the adaptation of zzso to pathological states resulting in zzso
