In their environment, plants interact with a multitude of living organisms and have to cope with a large variety of zzso of zzso or zzso zzso To survive, plants have acquired, during evolution, complex mechanisms to detect their zzso and defend zzso zzso and signaling pathways that are involved in such interactions with the environment are just beginning to be zzso What has been known for several decades is the extraordinary variety of chemical compounds the plants are capable to zzso and many of these products are implicated in defense zzso The number of natural products occurring in plants may be estimated in the range of hundreds of thousands, but only a fraction have been fully zzso Despite the great importance of these zzso for plant and also for human health, our knowledge about their zzso pathways and functions is still zzso Recent progress has been made particularly for zzso and zzso zzso which are emphasized in this zzso Both pathways are involved in plant resistance at several zzso by providing building units of physical barriers against pathogen invasion, by zzso an array of zzso compounds, and by producing signals implicated in the mounting of plant zzso
