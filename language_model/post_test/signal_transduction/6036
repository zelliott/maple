To investigate the role for initiation factor zzso in de zzso translation, we have studied the recovery of human kidney cells from zzso zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that zzso shock causes a rapid zzso of protein zzso the zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and increased association of zzso with zzso The return of cells to zzso medium promotes a transient zzso of zzso and the zzso of initiation factors, promoting an increase in protein synthesis that is independent of a requirement for zzso zzso As de zzso translation is associated with the zzso of zzso we have investigated the role of the signaling pathways required for this event by the use of zzso zzso Surprisingly, although zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and its release from zzso they did not prevent the recovery of translation zzso These data suggest that only a small proportion of the available zzso complex is required for zzso translation rates under these zzso Similarly, prevention of zzso activity alone with low zzso of zzso did not impinge upon de zzso translation until later times of recovery from salt zzso However, zzso which prevented the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso attenuated de zzso protein synthesis in recovering zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso is zzso by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways and that zzso of either zzso in isolation is sufficient to promote de zzso zzso
