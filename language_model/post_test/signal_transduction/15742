zzso growth factor 21 zzso has recently emerged as a zzso hormone involved in regulating zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso but the regulatory mechanisms and actions of zzso in humans remain zzso Here we have investigated the regulatory mechanisms of the human zzso gene at the zzso zzso A deletion study of the human zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso revealed two zzso signals, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals, that independently induced human zzso gene zzso in mouse primary zzso In addition, two feeding signals, zzso and zzso also zzso induced human zzso gene zzso and zzso expression in both human zzso cells and mouse primary zzso zzso protein expression and zzso were also induced by high zzso zzso The human zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso was found to have a zzso element at zzso to zzso zzso which is distinct from the zzso response element zzso zzso of the zzso response element binding protein by zzso diminished zzso human zzso zzso Moreover, we found that a region from zzso to zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter region exerts an important role in the zzso of basic zzso In conclusion, human zzso gene expression is paradoxically and independently regulated by both zzso and feeding zzso These regulatory mechanisms suggest that human zzso is increased with nutritional crisis, including zzso and zzso
