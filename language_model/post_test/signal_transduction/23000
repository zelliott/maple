zzso and zzso each have potent effects on B cell responses as well as strong mutual zzso Here we have examined the quantitative effects of these zzso on zzso zzso B cell zzso cell survival, and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced the number of B cells found in culture by reducing the average time cells take to enter the first division cycle and by promoting B cell zzso When added in zzso the net effect of zzso and zzso on time to division and survival was a response intermediate between that of the two zzso alone, indicating a partial antagonism of zzso by zzso By modulating both time to division and cell survival, these small effects of zzso are amplified and give rise to large reductions in cell number in the presence of zzso At higher zzso zzso had minor zzso effects on zzso zzso switching to zzso and greater effects on zzso A zzso relation was observed between the ability to inhibit zzso at late cell divisions vs induction of zzso In contrast, zzso did not prevent switching to zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso antagonism between zzso and zzso is observed at multiple levels and over different concentration zzso resulting in complex net zzso The evolutionary significance of this complexity is zzso
