zzso is a potent and widely used zzso zzso zzso induced by this drug has been well zzso However, very little information is available on zzso zzso and its underlying mechanism remains zzso High doses of zzso have been known to produce zzso Additionally, elevated expression of zzso zzso has been associated with enhanced zzso zzso Several studies suggest that zzso toxicity occurs by the increased generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso the present study zzso in zzso the zzso effects on zzso zzso structure and function as well as the occurrence of zzso death by zzso Adult male zzso rats zzso zzso were divided into two groups zzso treated as zzso zzso control group zzso solution, 1 zzso 100 zzso body weight, zzso and zzso zzso group (10 zzso zzso body weight, zzso The animals were killed 72 h after the zzso zzso was evidenced in the zzso group by the increased serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso was found to involve membrane zzso decreased zzso ratio, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso damage of zzso and protein zzso zzso Moreover, cell death by zzso was also demonstrated and the findings strongly suggest the participation of the zzso signaling zzso in this zzso zzso the results show the key role of zzso in the zzso induced by zzso and delineate several zzso processes that could be targeted in future zzso therapy zzso
