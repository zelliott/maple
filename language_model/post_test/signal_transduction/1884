zzso receptors zzso are zzso receptors capable of recognizing zzso zzso patterns zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are major receptors for zzso and zzso bacterial cell wall zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso can activate immature zzso cells zzso and induce DC maturation characterized by production of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and increased ability to activate T zzso However, little is known regarding the regulation of zzso gene expression in mouse zzso In this study, we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression by zzso in zzso immature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso following zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression coincided with significantly increased production of zzso necrosis zzso induced by zzso plus zzso zzso While zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso prevented the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression but enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was differently regulated by zzso in mouse immature zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression by zzso might promote the overall responses of DC to bacteria and help to explain the zzso between zzso and other bacterial products in the induction of zzso zzso
