zzso vascular zzso is a characteristic feature of zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso prevents zzso disruption of zzso barrier function in zzso It was the objective of this study to determine whether zzso may zzso zzso lung vascular leak in mice and to further explore the possible underlying zzso 

zzso mice were randomly divided into the control, zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso injection of zzso at a dose of 30 zzso Mice in the zzso plus zzso group were zzso received 8 units zzso zzso zzso diluted in 20 zzso sterile saline at zzso h before the injection of zzso 

1) zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso changes in Lung at 6 zzso 2) zzso of mice with zzso ameliorated zzso lung zzso and lung vascular leak at 6 zzso 3) zzso zzso dramatically inhibited zzso and ROCK zzso in the lung zzso of zzso mice (3 and 6 zzso 4) zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso gene zzso but did not affect the increased expression of zzso zzso in the lung zzso of zzso mice at 3 or 6 zzso 

These data suggest that zzso may zzso zzso lung vascular leak by regulating zzso zzso zzso
