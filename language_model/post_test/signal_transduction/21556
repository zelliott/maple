zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, which mediates proliferation or growth arrest and zzso of normal B cells, depending on their zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that surface zzso zzso zzso is expressed at variable levels by chronic zzso leukemia zzso B cells freshly isolated from 33 different zzso zzso expression was zzso following cell stimulation via surface zzso zzso zzso effects were more evident in zzso zzso B zzso zzso induced an early signaling cascade in zzso B cells, which included zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling failed to stimulate zzso zzso zzso but induced their zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso and zzso signals delivered by zzso to zzso B zzso zzso zzso involved zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of Bid to its active form zzso and zzso of zzso and of zzso Recent data indicate that zzso B cells require interaction with the zzso for their survival and zzso The present findings thus provide a set of new mechanisms involved in the balance between zzso and zzso signals in zzso B zzso
