The zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon the zzso of the pathway, zzso zzso zzso and activate zzso zzso which in turn zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso with zzso motif zzso recruit them to the zzso from the nucleus and turn off cell zzso and zzso gene zzso Thus, the zzso restricts cell overgrowth and prevents zzso Although a high cell density and stress zzso are known to activate the pathway, no specific zzso are so far zzso As the dysfunction of the zzso is frequent in human zzso and zzso with poor zzso it is important to find out zzso that stimulate the zzso for not only basic research but also clinical zzso We here developed a zzso method of screening zzso that induce the recruitment of zzso to the zzso Using this method, we found that zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso to our expectations, the effect of zzso is independent of the zzso zzso but our method opens the possibility to discover zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
