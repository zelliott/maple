zzso tissue growth factor zzso has been reported to play an important role in zzso the zzso effects of transforming growth zzso zzso in various zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen IV expression upon the stimulation of zzso in cultured human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and further investigated the effects of zzso zzso blockade on the zzso process induced by zzso It is revealed that upon the stimulation of zzso human zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly zzso while collagen IV gene expression decreased significantly zzso all in a zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells was significantly larger in the zzso groups than that in negative control zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso as confirmed by flow zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso expression was zzso by the stimulation of zzso zzso Under this condition, collagen IV zzso into the culture media was lowered markedly zzso On zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso gene zzso preceding that of zzso The zzso zzso expression induced by zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With prolonged incubation time, zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso protein zzso as demonstrated by indirect zzso So it is concluded that zzso could promote the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells towards zzso in zzso both directly and as a downstream zzso of zzso and zzso blockade would be a possible therapeutic target against zzso zzso
