The importance of the zzso family of signal zzso molecules in zzso cells has long been acknowledged, even though its role and its regulatory mechanism are not completely zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso also located inside the nucleus of zzso cells, is zzso during maturation of zzso precursors induced by zzso acid zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso of zzso during zzso maturation is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and is essential for the zzso changes of the cell zzso These zzso events are independent on the zzso zzso exchange activity of zzso We also found that, in zzso cells, and in both zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction is essential for the zzso zzso zzso activity and for association of zzso zzso with zzso particularly in the zzso Our data indicate an unprecedented crucial function for zzso in modulating the zzso maturation process of zzso cells in a zzso exchange factor zzso manner and suggest a role of zzso as an zzso protein responsible of targeting zzso zzso to its zzso zzso
