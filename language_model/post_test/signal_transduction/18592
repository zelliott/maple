For zzso and zzso genes in zzso a switch in gene regulation has been described that zzso patterning and maintenance zzso Maintenance of segment and organ zzso involves secondary patterning and differentiation steps, as well as survival factors regulating proliferation and organ zzso In a screen for embryonic lethal zzso in the flour zzso zzso zzso we have recovered two zzso of the zzso zzso which result in short, zzso zzso These zzso have severely reduced zzso and differentiate a zzso that lacks most overt signs of zzso In addition, they lack zzso and display defects in the nervous zzso Early patterning in zzso zzso zzso is normal up to the extended germ band stage, as indicated by the formation of regular zzso zzso and wingless zzso zzso zzso however, these patterns zzso Similarly, zzso growth and patterning of limbs are nearly normal initially, but limb zzso zzso and zzso patterns zzso during subsequent zzso zzso could be a segment polarity gene required for segment border maintenance in both trunk and zzso zzso it may have a more general role in tissue or organ zzso
