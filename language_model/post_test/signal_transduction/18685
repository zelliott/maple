zzso melanoma has a high propensity for zzso spread, making it the most deadly form of skin zzso zzso has been identified as the most zzso gene in these invasive cells and therefore an attractive therapeutic zzso However, for uncertain reasons, chemotherapy zzso zzso has not been clinically zzso This has raised questions whether this zzso is important in melanoma zzso or whether targeting a protein other than zzso in the signaling cascade could more effectively inhibit this zzso to reduce lung zzso Here, we investigated the role played by zzso in melanoma zzso and showed that targeting this signaling cascade significantly reduces lung zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso was used in mice to reduce expression zzso of each member of the signaling cascade and effects on zzso development were zzso zzso any member of the signaling cascade reduced zzso but zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 almost completely prevented lung tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso through reduction of melanoma cell zzso through the zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor BAY zzso which was found ineffective in clinical trials and seems to act primarily as an zzso zzso did not decrease zzso whereas zzso of zzso using zzso decreased cellular zzso capacity, thereby effectively reducing number and size of lung zzso In zzso this study provides a zzso basis for targeting zzso and not zzso in the zzso zzso signaling cascade to inhibit melanoma zzso
