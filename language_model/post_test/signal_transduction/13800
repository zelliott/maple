The zzso zzso assembly checkpoint zzso delays zzso onset until all zzso have attached to both zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso zzso in response to acute detachment of individual zzso using laser zzso Most detached zzso delayed zzso until they had zzso to the zzso zzso A substantial fraction of cells, however, entered zzso in the presence of zzso zzso We identify two mechanisms by which cells can bypass the zzso first, single zzso zzso inhibit the zzso zzso zzso less efficiently than a full complement of zzso zzso second, because of the relatively slow zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso cells were unresponsive to zzso detachment up to several minutes before zzso zzso Our study defines when cells zzso commit to enter zzso and shows that the zzso signal strength zzso with the number of zzso zzso zzso knowledge about zzso zzso zzso is important for understanding the emergence of zzso and the response of cancer cells to zzso targeting the zzso zzso
