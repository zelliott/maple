In this zzso current evidence for how the zzso zzso axis developed zzso as a crucial part of the zzso mechanism will be zzso The zzso human zzso allowing the concentration of urine up to a zzso zzso around 1200 zzso zzso urine to plasma zzso ratio around zzso essentially no sodium zzso is the result of up to 3 billion years zzso Moving from aquatic to zzso zzso required profound changes in kidney zzso most notable the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso from basically a water zzso system to a water zzso zzso zzso molecules has during the evolution played a significant role in body fluid zzso more specifically, the zzso of body liquids by controlling the zzso of fluid trough stimulating zzso receptors to mobilize zzso water channels in the zzso collector zzso Recent evidence supports that all components of the zzso zzso axis can be traced back to early precursors in evolutionary zzso The potential clinical and pharmacological implications of a better zzso understanding of these biological systems so essential for body fluid zzso relates to any pathological aspects of the zzso zzso in particular deficiencies of any part of the zzso axis causing central or zzso diabetes zzso for broader patient populations also in preventing and treating disturbances in human zzso regulation of urine volume and zzso that may lead to zzso and zzso
