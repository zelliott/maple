Vitamin C zzso also known as zzso acid, is involved in many important zzso and zzso reactions in the zzso Here, we report that zzso enhances the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso differentiation of embryonic stem zzso We investigated zzso regulation of zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso using cell signaling zzso profiling systems, and further confirmed by specific zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso strategies, we demonstrated that zzso is a new positive regulator of zzso and is activated by zzso following zzso zzso In addition, site zzso analysis identified that zzso physically occupies the zzso promoter, which was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso Taken together, our data suggest a role for zzso in zzso regulation networks and reveal a novel role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso
