zzso discovered almost 50 years ago, was for many years a subject of great scientific zzso The putative functions attributed to this zzso could not be confirmed due, at least in part, to a zzso that took a long time to be zzso This chapter describes the properties of zzso and the regulation of its zzso Also, the interactions that have been described for zzso in both zzso and zzso and the signaling mechanisms reported to zzso from such interactions are zzso The consequences of zzso signaling pathways for different cell types and organisms are also zzso Since the discovery of zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso in zzso many more functions have been attributed to zzso interactions in trans toward other cell zzso Recently, a zzso for zzso zzso was unveiled and shown to elicit signaling in zzso The zzso and the zzso for zzso turned out to be the same zzso zzso zzso which upon interaction with zzso yields zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso biology is again beginning to make progress in answering main questions surrounding this enigmatic zzso Some of these remaining questions are highlighted in this zzso
