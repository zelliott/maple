Red light, acting through the zzso controls numerous aspects of plant zzso Many of the signal zzso elements downstream of the zzso have been identified in the aerial portions of the zzso however, very few elements in zzso zzso have been identified specifically for zzso Gene profiling studies using zzso and quantitative zzso zzso were performed to characterize gene expression changes in roots of zzso zzso exposed to 1 h of red zzso Several factors acting downstream of zzso in zzso zzso in roots were zzso Some of the genes found to be zzso expressed in this study have already been characterized in the zzso zzso for whole zzso For example, zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso were all significantly zzso in roots of zzso exposed to 1 h of red zzso The zzso of zzso OF zzso A zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes suggests that the zzso zzso was attenuated by red zzso In addition, genes involved in lateral root and root hair formation, root zzso development, zzso zzso and hormone zzso were also regulated by exposure to red zzso Interestingly, members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) family, which have been shown to mediate zzso zzso were also zzso regulated in roots in red zzso zzso these results suggest that red and blue light pathways interact in roots of zzso and that many elements involved in zzso found in the aerial portions of the plant are zzso expressed in roots within 1 h of red light zzso
