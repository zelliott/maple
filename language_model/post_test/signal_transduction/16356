zzso zzso zzso zzso was only recently identified as an zzso with high zzso to the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite this zzso it is mainly discussed as a zzso of viral infections by modulating type I zzso However, in zzso studies also showed that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso activity, but the distinct mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso are not zzso Given the paramount role of zzso in zzso we investigated the regulation and function of zzso in models of inflammatory zzso in zzso We found that zzso was abundantly expressed in zzso zzso in the spinal zzso and in zzso root zzso zzso zzso and protein levels rapidly increased in spinal zzso and zzso root zzso during hind paw inflammation evoked by injection of zzso or zzso zzso knockout mice showed normal zzso responses to acute heat or mechanical zzso However, in inflammatory pain models, zzso mice exhibited a significantly reduced zzso behavior in comparison with wild type mice, indicating that zzso contributed to the development of inflammatory zzso zzso effects were associated with reduced zzso of zzso and attenuated zzso induction of zzso zzso NO zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso which is an important zzso target in viral infections, was not regulated after inflammatory zzso zzso zzso we concluded that zzso zzso inflammatory zzso sensitivity by zzso of zzso gene zzso and may be useful as a therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory zzso
