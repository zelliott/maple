Human peripheral blood zzso and zzso were activated with zzso A with or without zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso alone or zzso + zzso 2 zzso under zzso conditions to test the hypothesis that lack of production of zzso by zzso is the cause of the near total loss of zzso observed earlier on several zzso zzso The 60 zzso failure of the zzso 1 zzso g reference zzso at the time of the addition of the zzso renders the zzso data at 1 zzso g zzso However, the data from a previous experiment on zzso show that there is no difference between the results from the zzso 1 zzso g zzso and 1 zzso g on zzso The comparison between the data of the cultures at 0 zzso g in space and of the zzso control at 1 zzso g on ground show that zzso zzso and zzso do not prevent the loss of activity zzso as the zzso zzso at 0 zzso zzso production of zzso however, is partially zzso In contrast to a previous experiment in space, the production of zzso is not zzso
