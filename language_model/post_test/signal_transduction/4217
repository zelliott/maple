zzso zzso of the zzso series form in zzso and exert effects on a variety of biological zzso While most of zzso mediate their effects through G zzso zzso the mechanism of action for the zzso series of zzso remains zzso Here, we report the zzso and its derivatives are zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors alpha and gamma zzso alpha and zzso zzso respectively), orphan nuclear receptors implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso gamma and promotes efficient differentiation of zzso zzso to zzso These data provide strong evidence that a fatty acid zzso can function as an zzso agent through direct interactions with zzso gamma and zzso suggest a novel mechanism of action for zzso of the zzso zzso
