zzso zzso is one of the most frequently used compounds in the treatment of coronary artery disease predominantly in the zzso However, zzso was reported to induce zzso dysfunction, which was corrected by vitamin C pointing to a crucial role of zzso oxygen species zzso in causing this zzso We sought to zzso the mechanism how zzso causes zzso dysfunction and zzso stress in vascular zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso 69 in total) were treated with zzso (75 zzso or zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by zzso in zzso zzso zzso infusion caused significant zzso dysfunction but no tolerance to zzso itself, whereas zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso heart, and whole blood were zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and caused zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso likely due to a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso of zzso The adverse effects of zzso were improved in zzso knockout mice and zzso by zzso in zzso zzso treatment and suppressed by zzso In addition, a strong increase in the expression of zzso within the zzso cell layer and the zzso was zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso causes zzso dysfunction and zzso stress, predominantly by an zzso zzso of the vascular and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso These findings may explain at least in part results from a retrospective analysis indicating increased mortality in zzso patients in response to long-term treatment with zzso
