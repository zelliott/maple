One mechanism that bacteria have adopted to regulate the production of zzso compounds is zzso zzso zzso sensing zzso exploiting the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso bacteria, most known cases involve the AHL control of zzso antibiotics production by zzso zzso This work is the first to demonstrate that zzso are not the only group of zzso antibiotics whose production is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso rape and described as a zzso zzso which protects crops against zzso zzso was also shown to produce zzso zzso zzso and several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes zzso and zzso which are zzso of zzso and zzso genes from other zzso bacteria, were cloned and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was simultaneously deficient in the production of zzso and zzso as well as in its ability to suppress the growth of several zzso plant pathogens in zzso However, zzso production could be restored in this zzso by introduction of the zzso genes cloned into a zzso or by addition of the zzso medium from strain zzso or zzso standard to the growth zzso
