We have generated transgenic mice that express a zzso inactive form of zzso protein zzso IV zzso specifically in zzso T zzso The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced zzso zzso although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the zzso and zzso cell surface zzso that are used to gauge T cell zzso zzso zzso T cells from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor zzso When challenged with an zzso stimulus such as zzso or a combination of zzso zzso plus zzso the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso production is secondary to the inability to zzso the zzso response element binding zzso zzso and induce expression of the immediate early genes such as zzso B that are required to zzso the zzso zzso Because zzso expression was regulated by the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso gene and this promoter is zzso in T cells that exit the zzso the zzso zzso is not present in peripheral T zzso zzso T zzso present in the zzso can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above, demonstrating that the effects of the inactive zzso on zzso are zzso Our results suggest that zzso may represent a zzso relevant zzso zzso in T cells and that the zzso is also required to ensure normal expansion of T cells in the zzso Whereas the zzso responsible for this latter role is yet to be zzso it is unlikely to include zzso zzso
