zzso Y zzso and zzso zzso well-known zzso associated with feeding and zzso show zzso properties via zzso cell zzso Previous studies have revealed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso medicine, has an zzso effect in behavioral animal models of zzso the mechanisms underlying this effect may involve the zzso system and subsequent zzso of zzso cell zzso However, the roles of zzso in zzso zzso effect remain zzso Here we investigated whether the regulation of the zzso system could play crucial roles in this effect in the zzso zzso model zzso The zzso effect of zzso administered orally zzso zzso for 28 d was abolished by a continuous zzso injection of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso Likewise, zzso injection blocked the zzso increases in zzso cell proliferation and cluster formation of neural zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso injection did not affect zzso increases in zzso zzso cells or in serum zzso zzso These results suggest that the control of the zzso system in the brain plays an essential role in zzso zzso effect and zzso zzso cell zzso both of which could be zzso at least in part, to the control of the zzso system subsequent to the control of the zzso zzso
