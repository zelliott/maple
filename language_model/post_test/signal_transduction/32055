zzso response regulators zzso are a group of zzso factors that are activated by zzso zzso and regulate the expression of zzso zzso Recently, we reported that zzso of zzso in zzso is facilitated by zzso resulting in zzso of the signaling output of zzso zzso Interestingly, despite similarities in the primary structures and zzso receiver zzso the zzso properties of zzso are distinct from those of the other zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso resistant to protein degradation, we clearly demonstrated that increased levels of zzso affected zzso processes such as primary root growth, callus zzso zzso zzso and leaf zzso At the molecular level, expression of zzso zzso was increased in zzso expressing zzso resulting in enhanced zzso zzso Here, we describe these findings and how they may be incorporated into the currently accepted model for the regulation of zzso zzso In addition, we describe the zzso approaches used to identify proteins that interact with zzso The putative roles of zzso zzso are also addressed with regard to other zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso degradation of zzso must be appreciated as a zzso event important for regulating zzso signaling zzso
