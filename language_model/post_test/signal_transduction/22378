zzso zzso are zzso cell signaling platforms, and their zzso role can be explored by cholesterol zzso To characterize zzso changes ongoing after zzso raft disruption in zzso zzso a cell type that zzso its cholesterol in zzso we performed zzso expression zzso zzso results show that over 3,000 genes are zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso after cholesterol zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso validation and protein release zzso demonstrate the zzso relevance of zzso zzso Major enriched terms and functions, determined by zzso Pathways zzso identify cholesterol zzso as a major function, illustrating the specificity of zzso response toward cholesterol zzso Moreover, the inflammatory skin disorder zzso zzso zzso is identified as the disease most closely associated with the profile of zzso zzso zzso This finding is confirmed in skin of zzso patients, in whom transcript levels of major zzso raft target genes are similarly regulated in zzso zzso skin, compared with zzso and normal zzso Thus, zzso raft disruption evokes typical features of zzso thereby suggesting that zzso raft organization and signaling could be zzso in zzso zzso
