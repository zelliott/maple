A network of zzso zzso factors controls differentiation and zzso of the zzso These factors interact via zzso feedback, and zzso zzso Previous work has suggested that zzso nuclear factor zzso and zzso participate zzso in this zzso zzso We investigated how zzso controls the expression of zzso We observed that zzso expression was zzso in the liver of zzso mouse zzso and in zzso mouse embryonic liver zzso cell lines derived from embryonic zzso liver, suggesting that zzso zzso the expression of zzso Because no evidence for a direct repression of zzso by zzso was found, we zzso the existence of an indirect zzso We found that the expression of a zzso and targets of the transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling was increased both in zzso liver and in zzso zzso cell zzso Using these cell lines, we demonstrated that zzso signaling was increased in the absence of zzso and that this resulted from zzso of zzso zzso II zzso We also found that zzso can stimulate the expression of zzso in zzso cells and that zzso of zzso signaling in zzso cells zzso the expression of zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso zzso in the absence of zzso results from increased zzso signaling via increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso We further conclude that zzso zzso zzso by zzso the activity of the zzso signaling zzso This identifies a new mechanism of interaction between zzso zzso factors zzso one factor indirectly controls another by modulating the activity of a signaling zzso
