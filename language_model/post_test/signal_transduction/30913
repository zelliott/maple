zzso to zzso conversion in tobacco zzso zzso zzso is regulated by an unstable zzso locus which in its activated state gives rise to a high zzso low nicotine zzso in the zzso zzso In plants that carry the high zzso zzso nicotine conversion is primarily zzso by a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso whose zzso is strongly zzso during leaf zzso To further investigate the regulation of zzso zzso we examined the zzso distribution and the zzso and signaling zzso expression patterns of zzso using zzso analysis and a fusion construct between the zzso zzso upstream regulatory region of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso expression revealed that the zzso promoter zzso high levels of expression in the zzso leaves and flowers, and in the green stems of young and mature plants, but only very low activity was detected in the zzso In the leaves, zzso activity was strongly correlated with the progression of zzso zzso of leaf tissue with various signaling molecules including zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, salicylic acid and zzso zzso and zzso such as drought, wounding and tobacco mosaic virus infection did not enhance nicotine conversion or zzso activity in the green leaves, but an increase in zzso expression was observed in response to zzso or tobacco mosaic zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso is zzso in the leaves and the use of the zzso promoter could provide a valuable tool for regulating gene expression in the zzso zzso
