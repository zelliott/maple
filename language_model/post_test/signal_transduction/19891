zzso zzso a leading cause of severe zzso primarily zzso zzso zzso cells zzso causing zzso zzso To better understand innate immunity to zzso we sought to define the extent to which zzso zzso of zzso responses required viral replication or could be zzso by zzso RV or its zzso Using model human zzso zzso we observed that zzso zzso of signaling events and gene expression typically associated with viral infection was largely zzso by administration of ultraviolet zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that such zzso zzso gene expression required type I zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of nuclear zzso zzso expression was dependent on viral zzso The zzso gene expression induced by zzso was not significantly zzso by RV zzso or RV zzso particles although the latter could enter zzso Together, these results suggest that RV proteins mediate viral entry into zzso cells leading to zzso detection of RV zzso that generates an zzso zzso
