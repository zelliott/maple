zzso quantities of zzso are zzso by marine bacteria, and this process involves at least three signal zzso systems in zzso zzso One system, zzso to zzso zzso is probably used to colonize zzso zzso But how do the first few cells find this highly zzso zzso The following hypothesis is proposed to answer this question: the bacteria respond to soluble zzso in zzso from injured zzso Virtually all zzso organisms also contain zzso and/or zzso often at high zzso such as zzso in insect zzso zzso of zzso zzso was therefore studied with a variety of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso but not zzso The cells exhibit weak zzso taxis to zzso and zzso After zzso they show a weak response to zzso but are strongly attracted to the following zzso of the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There is a rough qualitative but no quantitative correlation between the rate of zzso and the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso is especially noteworthy because it is zzso at a very rapid rate by zzso cells but is not an zzso until the cells are zzso We suggest that unidentified zzso factors link the zzso to zzso
