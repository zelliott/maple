Plant zzso binding and zzso repeat zzso proteins contain a region of zzso known as the ARC domain located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling suggests that the ARC region can be subdivided into zzso and zzso zzso We have used the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso resistance to zzso virus X zzso to investigate the function of the ARC zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain is required for binding of the zzso N zzso to the zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso and a zzso disease resistance zzso zzso showed that zzso recognition localized to the zzso half of the zzso zzso However, inappropriate pairings of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain is required to condition an zzso state in the absence of zzso as well as for the subsequent zzso zzso Our data suggest that the ARC region, through its interaction with the zzso translates zzso zzso of the C zzso into a signal initiation zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that physical disruption of the zzso interaction is not required for signal zzso We propose instead that this activity can lead to multiple rounds of zzso recognition, providing a means of signal zzso
