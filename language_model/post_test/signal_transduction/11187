The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic beta cells via pathways dependent on nuclear zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso We recently showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso to be a natural negative feedback regulator of zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso and beta cell lines, preventing their deleterious zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso zzso and prevention against zzso remain zzso 

The effect of zzso expression on the global zzso profile following zzso exposure was zzso using a rat beta cell line zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso functional analyses were zzso 

zzso known genes and several expressed sequence tags zzso changed expression level zzso or more in response to zzso zzso Following 6 h of zzso exposure, 23 transcripts were zzso Of these, zzso including all eight transcripts relating to zzso response zzso were suppressed by zzso Following 24 h of zzso exposure, secondary response genes were zzso affecting zzso energy generation, protein synthesis and degradation, growth arrest, and zzso The majority of these changes were prevented by zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso early response genes were inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations were zzso confirmed in functional zzso 

This study suggests that there is an unexpected zzso between the zzso and the zzso pathways of zzso in pancreatic beta cells, which could lead to a novel perspective of blocking two important zzso pathways in pancreatic beta cells by influencing a single zzso zzso namely zzso
