Cellular differentiation is zzso by differential gene zzso The cells of the zzso are no zzso Indeed, recent studies based on zzso and expressed sequence tag analyses have revealed dynamic changes in gene expression during zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is an example of a gene that is tightly regulated during zzso with zzso initiating in primary zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our studies show that this zzso zzso is regulated at multiple levels, including binding of ubiquitous and zzso zzso factors, reconfiguration of zzso zzso of zzso modifications of specific zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso Our ability to isolate relatively pure populations of different zzso cell types has allowed us to determine the order of these events that lead up to initiation of zzso of the zzso zzso By examining similar parameters in transgenic mice carrying various portions of zzso regulatory zzso we have localized specific signals responsible for each of these regulatory zzso Together these results demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso gene involves a zzso ordered cascade of zzso events that zzso this locus in preparation for the initiation of zzso
