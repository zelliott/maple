The small zzso zzso zzso family has significantly expanded in the past decade to now zzso five discrete classes, grouped by common structural and functional zzso Some of these gene products are not classical zzso whereas others have new and unique zzso In addition to being structural zzso zzso constitute a network of signal zzso being mostly zzso they are upstream of multiple signaling zzso They affect zzso zzso a major zzso of information for cellular responses, and zzso distinct zzso including those driven by bone zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso members, zzso zzso zzso such as zzso family members and the zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso zzso The wealth of zzso insights into the molecular and cellular functions of zzso has revealed both the sophistication of this family of regulatory proteins and the challenges that remain in uncovering the totality of their zzso This review is focused on novel biological functions of zzso with special emphasis on their protein cores, newly described genetic diseases, and signaling events in which zzso play key zzso
