Stem cell factor zzso promotes limited proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso cells and is zzso synergistic in combination with growth factors such as zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso 3 zzso or zzso zzso We have examined zzso zzso induced by zzso in the zzso cell line zzso and found zzso of proteins of zzso zzso zzso 58 and 55 zzso The dominant zzso in zzso treated cells were 200 and 145 zzso Our studies indicated that the 145 zzso protein was zzso the zzso for zzso zzso work was directed towards further characterizing the 200 zzso zzso Surface labeling of zzso cells suggested that zzso had an zzso domain and could be induced to associate with zzso after stimulation with zzso The rapid zzso of zzso and its immediate association with zzso suggest that zzso is potentially a component of the zzso signal zzso zzso
