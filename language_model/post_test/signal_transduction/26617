After almost 30 years of research, the existence of zzso steroid actions is no longer zzso Yet, there is still a debate on the nature of receptors involved, and answers to the inherent questions are important for zzso zzso In the case of zzso the existence of receptors different from the classic zzso receptors zzso had been zzso 25 years ago as the pharmacology of about 50% of rapid actions of zzso reported so far is incompatible with MR involvement zzso to classic MR zzso Candidates proposed as alternatives to MR were protein zzso C, zzso zzso or zzso forms of zzso none of which supported convincing evidence to represent 'the zzso membrane zzso Early in 2011, data on zzso showed its involvement in rapid zzso action, and major pharmacological aspects of this action are compatible with the landmark zzso from MR pharmacology mentioned zzso zzso therefore, may be a zzso candidate for zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a variety of promising candidates zzso rapid zzso action has been zzso including zzso zzso membrane component 1 zzso which seems to be associated with tumor zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso originally identified in fish with potential linkage to zzso zzso So far, no candidate was unanimously zzso In 2010, two independent groups reported that zzso a calcium channel, is a strong zzso candidate for the rapid action of zzso on zzso zzso With these novel receptors zzso zzso activities ultimately leading to new drugs for cardiovascular protection (in the case of zzso or zzso benefits (for zzso are much more zzso
