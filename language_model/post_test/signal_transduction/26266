In complex organisms, both zzso and zzso communication are critical for the appropriate regulation of the distribution of zzso to assure optimal zzso delivery and organ zzso The mobile zzso is in a unique position in the circulation as it both senses and responds to a reduction in zzso tension in its zzso When zzso enter a region of the zzso in which zzso tension is reduced, they release both zzso and the zzso zzso via zzso of a specific and dedicated signaling zzso that requires increases in zzso which are regulated by zzso The zzso released zzso a conducted zzso that results in zzso in the distribution of zzso to meet the zzso zzso zzso This delivery mechanism is modulated by both positive and negative feedback zzso zzso defects in low zzso zzso zzso release from zzso have been observed in several human disease states in which impaired vascular function is zzso zzso of the role of zzso in controlling zzso distribution and the signaling pathways that are responsible for zzso release from these cells makes the zzso a novel therapeutic target for the development of new approaches for the treatment of vascular zzso
