The zzso subset of human zzso zzso T cells is thought to contain the population of cells that have recently emigrated from the zzso while their zzso counterparts have been proposed to originate from zzso cells after zzso cell zzso zzso zzso maintenance is known to involve zzso zzso such as zzso zzso It remains to be investigated what role this zzso has in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso defined by zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso exerts a preferential zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso T cells from adult peripheral blood compared with the zzso zzso zzso proliferation did not result in loss of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso T cells can undergo zzso zzso proliferation while preserving zzso Furthermore, zzso sustained or increased zzso expression even in zzso zzso Both proliferation and zzso maintenance were dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that during adulthood zzso zzso zzso T cells are maintained by zzso and that zzso therapies may exert a preferential effect on this zzso
