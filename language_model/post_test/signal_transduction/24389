We characterized the growth of the primary root of zzso under zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso zzso focusing on the role of zzso We zzso the spatial profile of relative zzso with a novel method based on image processing, as well as the production rates of cortical cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso moderately decreased the zzso rate of relative zzso shortened the growth zone, and decreased the production rate of both zzso cell types but not of cortical zzso zzso zzso production (with zzso or action (with zzso increased zzso in high zzso and decreased it in low zzso That these effects were specific to zzso was confirmed by zzso the effect of inhibited zzso production with simultaneous treatment with an zzso precursor zzso zzso Under both zzso zzso zzso regulated the zzso rate of relative zzso rather than the size of the growth zzso In addition, zzso zzso action in high versus low zzso zzso opposite responses for the position of root hair initiation and for the production rates of zzso cells and zzso We conclude that the root system zzso to zzso zzso by changing the signal zzso zzso connecting zzso levels to growth and zzso
