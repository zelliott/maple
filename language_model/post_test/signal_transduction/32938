zzso cells are retinal zzso that receive synaptic input from zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso On bipolar cells by closing zzso zzso channels, an effect zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies of zzso zzso have suggested that the zzso couples to a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and that zzso directly gates the zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested by zzso On bipolar cells with zzso zzso of zzso zzso recordings were obtained from On bipolar cells in slices of zzso tiger zzso zzso Surprisingly, On bipolar cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso responded normally to zzso or zzso zzso Response zzso and zzso were not significantly altered compared with cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or with zzso and zzso together, indicating that zzso is not required for zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso solution suppressed the zzso current and zzso the zzso response, whereas dialysis with zzso or with zzso zzso had no significant effect on either the zzso current or the zzso zzso of an zzso directed against zzso also reduced the zzso response, indicating a functional role for zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may signal through zzso rather than a zzso zzso
