zzso models are useful for providing a framework for zzso data and gaining insights into the zzso and dynamic behavior of complex biological systems such as networks of interacting zzso We review the dynamic behaviors expected from model gene networks incorporating common zzso zzso and we compare current methods for modeling genetic zzso A common modeling technique, based on simply modeling genes as zzso zzso is readily implemented and allows rapid zzso zzso However, this method may predict dynamic solutions that do not zzso to those seen when systems are modeled with a more detailed method using ordinary differential zzso Until now, the majority of gene network modeling studies have focused on determining the types of dynamics that can be generated by common zzso motifs such as feedback zzso or protein zzso For example, these elements can generate multiple stable states for gene product zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso rhythms and other zzso and optimal stimulus zzso for zzso zzso In the future, as new experimental techniques increase the ease of characterization of genetic networks, qualitative modeling will need to be supplanted by quantitative models for specific zzso
