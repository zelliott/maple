zzso and zzso are related zzso zzso It is therefore of interest whether zzso shares some of the properties of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso we show that the zzso zzso of both proteins bind zzso in zzso The zzso domain of zzso was engineered to be autonomously expressed in chicken zzso cells and, like zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso domain of zzso was found to zzso to cellular focal zzso In contrast, full-length zzso was generally found zzso distributed throughout the cell, although a fraction of the cells exhibited focal zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso and zzso zzso cells induced a dramatic increase in the zzso content of a common set of proteins including zzso zzso and zzso but some of these zzso particularly zzso appeared to be zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher in zzso cells, and additional zzso species were specifically zzso In addition, zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced a profound zzso change, which could be a consequence of the observed differences in zzso zzso
