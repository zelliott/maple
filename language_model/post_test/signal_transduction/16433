To explore the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso pathways in male zzso rats and its zzso 

Fourteen male zzso rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: control group, and zzso exposed group (40 zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso once daily for 12 days, the control rats were only zzso with normal saline by zzso zzso indexes including body weight, gait scores, nervous sensory to heat, foot zzso in zzso landing were measured, then the contents of zzso zzso and its zzso 3, zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso in the zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso 

In comparison with control, there were significant differences in all zzso indexes zzso zzso zzso The contents of zzso in zzso exposed group decreased by zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso However, no significant differences of zzso and zzso content were found between zzso exposed group and control zzso 

zzso may affect zzso of rats and decrease the level of zzso in zzso thus induce a series of zzso zzso
