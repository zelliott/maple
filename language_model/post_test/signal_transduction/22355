zzso zzso play fundamental roles in many cellular processes in virtually all type of zzso The use of zzso sensitive fluorescent indicators has proven to be an indispensable tool for studying the zzso dynamics of zzso calcium zzso With the aid of laser scanning zzso zzso and new generation of zzso zzso highly zzso short-lived zzso signals, namely zzso zzso were revealed as elementary zzso release events during zzso zzso in zzso Since the discovery of zzso zzso in 1993, the demonstration of dynamic zzso zzso in living zzso has revolutionized our understanding of zzso signal zzso in normal and diseased zzso In this chapter, we have described a commonly used method for recording local and global zzso signals in zzso using the fluorescent indicator zzso zzso zzso and laser scanning zzso zzso
