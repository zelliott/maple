The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the interaction between zzso and zzso pathways in primary cultures of rat zzso affects biological functions and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso agents such as zzso and then treated or not with zzso zzso for 6 h with zzso zzso or zzso enhanced the effect of insulin on DNA zzso but not the effect of insulin on zzso acid transport or zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins was determined by zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a 195 zzso zzso which may be a zzso of insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including insulin zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso including the insulin zzso zzso was reached within 30 s of incubation with zzso zzso for about 3 h with zzso zzso or zzso agents clearly increased zzso zzso zzso of the 195 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or the insulin zzso zzso Because zzso zzso and zzso agents did not increase insulin zzso number or its zzso activity, the effect of zzso on this zzso of zzso zzso is assumed to be exerted at a step zzso to insulin zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso may in part be secondary to zzso of zzso zzso activity, because zzso zzso blunted the effect of zzso on the net zzso zzso of the 195 zzso protein as compared with cells zzso with no zzso In zzso the interactions between zzso and zzso pathways that lead to zzso of DNA synthesis appear to parallel the changes in zzso zzso Further studies will be required to determine whether there is a zzso relationship between these zzso
