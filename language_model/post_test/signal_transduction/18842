zzso of zzso zzso receptors is the critical first step in the zzso immune response against zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso assembles a large membrane zzso culminating in zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso was found to play a surprisingly prominent role in zzso zzso in addition to its well-known role in zzso zzso zzso is activated after zzso stimulation and zzso a complex with B cell zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex zzso We now report that the zzso zzso zzso binds to active zzso upon zzso stimulation and zzso its movement into zzso zzso We identified in zzso two putative zzso binding motifs in the zzso sequence and found that zzso of critical zzso within these sites abolished zzso binding and diminished zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also required for zzso zzso zzso but only zzso and zzso control zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso independently controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and unveil an essential role for zzso as a critical zzso linking these two zzso signaling zzso
