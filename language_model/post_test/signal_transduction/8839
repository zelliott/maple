Acquisition of zzso barrier function occurs late in mouse zzso Several days before birth a wave of barrier acquisition sweeps across zzso fetal skin, zzso on zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the molecular pathways active during zzso barrier zzso zzso signaling increased as the barrier wave crossed zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso experiments on embryonic zzso showed that the zzso of zzso was dependent on both zzso and protein zzso 2A zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling also caused defects in zzso barrier zzso These data are compatible with a model for zzso barrier acquisition zzso by zzso regulation of zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso Support for this model was provided by zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso expressed in an zzso manner in zzso during barrier zzso zzso reduction caused significant increase in zzso zzso and zzso with the acquisition of barrier function, with barrier acquisition being restored by zzso of zzso zzso Our data provide strong evidence that zzso is a regulatory zzso of zzso that targets this zzso to zzso and that zzso action is necessary for barrier zzso We therefore describe a novel zzso zzso activity that acts at least partly through zzso to affect initial barrier formation during late embryonic zzso zzso
