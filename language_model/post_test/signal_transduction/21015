zzso zzso zzso one of the two receptors for zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso has been shown to generate the major part of zzso signals in zzso cells, although the mechanisms are poorly zzso Here we examined the processing and signal zzso of zzso Both in zzso cells and in zzso cells expressing zzso an immature form of zzso with a molecular mass of about 150 zzso was zzso to create a 200 zzso zzso and after further zzso a mature 230 zzso was expressed on the cell zzso Only this 230 zzso form was rapidly and zzso zzso on zzso zzso in the presence of zzso As a major zzso of zzso zzso was found to be rapidly zzso and associated with zzso both in zzso cells and zzso zzso Interestingly, however, a prompt zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent strong zzso signaling were generated only in the zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso showed a slower response as maximum levels were only attained after 20 zzso compared to 5 zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso cell zzso signal zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response in zzso zzso
