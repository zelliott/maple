zzso The effects of zzso II zzso on water and zzso transport are zzso and zzso such that low zzso zzso to zzso zzso stimulate zzso and high zzso zzso to zzso zzso inhibit zzso Similar zzso relationships have been obtained for zzso and zzso addition of zzso zzso The cellular responses to zzso are zzso via zzso receptors coupled via zzso proteins to several possible signal zzso zzso These include the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso C or D and zzso release in response to zzso or following zzso channel opening induced by the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In the brush border zzso zzso of the zzso signal involves zzso zzso but does not require second zzso zzso zzso II affects zzso sodium transport by zzso of zzso exchange at the zzso membrane and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso does not appear to affect zzso zzso sodium transport directly, but acts via specific receptors on the zzso and brush border zzso to raise zzso zzso levels and inhibit zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that there is a zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso acting via zzso of zzso to inhibit zzso sodium zzso This effect is exerted by peptides delivered at both zzso and zzso sides of the zzso and provides a basis for the zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso The evidence reviewed supports the concept that in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso act zzso in their roles as regulators of zzso fluid zzso
