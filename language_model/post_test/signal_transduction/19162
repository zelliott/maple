Directed cell migration results from the polarization of the cellular zzso apparatus by integration of zzso signals, which are presented in a zzso zzso manner in living zzso To investigate the mechanism underlying the highly polarized and directional nature of migration in zzso we have developed an imaging system for observing zzso lip cell migration in the developing chicken zzso First, we show that zzso is the central regulator of the overall zzso zzso and zzso formation in these zzso However, zzso of zzso polarity zzso of zzso zzso the zzso complex, does not disrupt the cell zzso whereas it affects orientation of the tip of the leading zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is required for the generation of zzso but not the overall zzso zzso interference of class zzso zzso zzso abrogates both directional extension and maintenance of the long leading process, whereas zzso zzso the size of the zzso zzso zzso is important for coordinated spreading of the tip of the leading process in zzso Finally, zzso functions in the generation of zzso on the zzso lip zzso These results suggest that polarized zzso formation on zzso precursors may occur by a more divergent and complex mechanism than that seen in studies of other cell types growing on zzso zzso
