zzso repeats and zzso zzso 1 zzso is a recently discovered negative regulator of growth factor zzso The zzso integral membrane protein has been demonstrated to regulate various zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso zzso were shed, and if zzso could regulate cell proliferation and zzso signaling in a zzso zzso zzso zzso shed zzso zzso in zzso and shedding was modulated by known regulators of zzso including the zzso specific inhibitor zzso Furthermore, shedding was enhanced by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso appeared to be shed in zzso as well, as demonstrated by zzso of mouse and human tissue zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso suppressed zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that shed zzso zzso can function in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso signaling without any apparent zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, the results show that the zzso zzso can be zzso shed and can function as a zzso regulator of growth factor zzso Thus, zzso or its zzso could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of growth factor zzso zzso
