zzso cells are zzso zzso that are most efficient at fulfilling their functions after a phase of zzso provided by zzso and/or accessory zzso Although type I zzso are known to be important in this process, it remains unclear whether they act directly on zzso cells or indirectly on accessory zzso We used adoptive transfer experiments and mixed bone zzso zzso to dissect the requirement for type I zzso signaling in response to the zzso analog zzso zzso We demonstrate that optimal zzso cell zzso requires type I zzso to signal on both zzso cells and accessory zzso In the absence of zzso the residual zzso cell zzso was strictly dependent on zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Our results suggest that type I zzso produced following viral infection simultaneously target accessory cells for zzso zzso and zzso cells themselves and that these two pathways cooperate for zzso cell zzso
