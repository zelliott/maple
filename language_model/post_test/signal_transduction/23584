zzso zzso zzso channels are widely expressed in various types of zzso Once zzso by zzso zzso channels are ready to be activated by a small zzso near the resting membrane potential and, therefore, are optimal for regulating the zzso and zzso of zzso under zzso conditions near resting zzso zzso influx through zzso channels engenders zzso zzso zzso which in turn trigger a burst of action zzso zzso burst firing has been implicated in the synchronization of the zzso circuit during sleep and in absence zzso It also has been suggested that zzso channels play an important role in pain signal transmission, based on their abundant expression in zzso pathways in peripheral and central zzso In this review, we will describe studies on the role of zzso zzso channels in the zzso as well as pathological generation of brain rhythms in sleep, absence zzso and pain signal zzso Recent advances in studies of zzso channels in the control of zzso will also be briefly zzso
