zzso involves a dynamic balance of the mechanisms regulating cell division, differentiation and zzso The development of the chicken zzso inner ear offers a zzso model at the zzso level to study which signals are implicated in the zzso of cellular zzso and zzso The early zzso decisions that control the origin of the inner ear elements are just beginning to be identified by complementary in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and nerve growth factor zzso are among the best zzso zzso factors acting during inner ear zzso Although the cellular actions of these factors are beginning to be zzso the zzso pathways triggered by them still remain largely zzso In this context, viral vehicles can be used to deliver genes and then zzso their functional roles during inner ear zzso A model is proposed where the actions of zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso expression of zzso and zzso family members in particular zzso of the zzso zzso Some of these mechanisms may be also implicated in zzso zzso
