The major adverse consequences of radiation exposure, including the initiation of zzso and other zzso are generally attributed to effects in the cell nucleus at the time of zzso However, zzso damage as a longer term consequence of radiation exposure has more recently been demonstrated due to zzso radiation effects including delayed zzso instability and bystander zzso These zzso mainly studied in zzso are characterized by zzso cells demonstrating effects as though they themselves had been zzso and have been associated with altered zzso zzso To investigate the potential for these zzso effects of radiation to produce delayed damaging events in zzso we studied a zzso model of zzso acute zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice exhibit enhanced levels of zzso stabilization, increased levels of zzso and increased amounts of zzso as expected, in the first few hours zzso but also at much later times: weeks and months after the initial zzso Because these responses are seen in cells that were not themselves directly zzso but are the descendants of zzso cells, the data are consistent with an initial radiation exposure leading to persistently increased levels of ongoing DNA damage, analogous to zzso zzso zzso To investigate the potential source of ongoing zzso zzso we show increased levels of zzso a marker of damaging zzso species in zzso Not all animals show increased zzso activity or zzso responses as long-term consequences of zzso but increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso are directly correlated with increased zzso in individual mice zzso The data zzso persistent zzso of zzso responses in zzso zzso as a zzso bystander mechanism for causing delayed DNA zzso
