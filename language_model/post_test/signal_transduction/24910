zzso and clearance of zzso is essential for successful resolution of zzso zzso signaling via the zzso zzso could explain the observed zzso of zzso lifespan and associated tissue injury at inflammatory zzso We therefore compared inflammatory zzso extracted from zzso of zzso arthritis patients, with peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso in culture more rapidly than peripheral blood zzso this was not explained by changes in surface expression of zzso or by induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso remained sensitive to zzso death, at levels comparable to those seen in peripheral blood zzso Similarly, zzso zzso factor reduced zzso but did not abolish signaling via zzso These data provide evidence for the rate of zzso in inflammatory zzso being continually modulated by death and survival signals in the inflammatory zzso This allows for rapid resolution of inflammation as levels of survival factors fall, and suggests new strategies for inducing resolution of zzso
