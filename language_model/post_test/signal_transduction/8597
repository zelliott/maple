The zzso factor zzso family, the crucial zzso group in innate immune zzso increased to 24 in zzso the oldest lineage of the zzso To address how these expanded molecules evolved to adapt to the changing zzso zzso signaling zzso here we conducted zzso and functional comparisons of four distinct zzso zzso groups with their human zzso We showed that zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the expansion of zzso zzso and 3 zzso whereas zzso and 6 maintained a relatively stable zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso and 3 molecules displayed various expression patterns in response to microbial infection, and some of them can zzso the zzso zzso zzso by human zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented two unique zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and involvement in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso defense, the mechanism was not the same as that observed in zzso In zzso our findings reveal the evolutionary uniqueness of the zzso family in this zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso and functional divergence of the zzso family are important for the current form of the zzso signaling pathways in zzso
