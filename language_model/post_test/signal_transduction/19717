The cellular programs for zzso and zzso must be strictly distinguished but the mechanisms controlling the entry to zzso remain largely elusive in higher zzso In contrast, recent analyses in zzso have shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso In this review, the current understanding of these mechanisms in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso signals in this zzso emanating from environmental conditions including the zzso status zzso on the activity of an zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein plays pivotal roles in both the induction and progression of zzso and has now been found to govern the zzso program in a quite unexpected zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso degradation system that selectively eliminates zzso zzso during the zzso cell zzso zzso a novel zzso protein of the zzso is essential for this zzso zzso zzso zzso and thereby zzso the transcripts necessary for the progression of zzso
