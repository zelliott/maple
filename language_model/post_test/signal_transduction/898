A major question in cell biology is how molecular specificity is achieved by different growth factor receptors that activate apparently identical signaling zzso For the zzso family, a distinguishing feature is the ability to maintain a prolonged duration of signal zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso receptors assemble such a sustained signaling complex are not zzso Here we report that an unusual zzso zzso protein zzso is closely associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and not the zzso zzso This association requires interactions between zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is rapidly zzso zzso after binding of zzso to zzso receptors and provides a zzso site for the zzso complex, resulting in zzso sustained zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso or the zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso or treatment with small interference zzso against zzso substantially reduce zzso signaling to zzso but without any effect upon Ras or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso acts as a major and zzso platform for prolonged zzso zzso signaling by zzso
