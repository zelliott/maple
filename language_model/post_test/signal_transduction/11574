zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso controls cell polarity and movement during development, but the molecular nature of zzso polarity signal zzso remains poorly zzso Here we report that in human cells and during zzso zzso zzso signaling activates the small zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires the zzso protein zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso protein zzso zzso binds to both zzso and zzso and mediates zzso zzso complex zzso zzso or depletion of zzso prevents zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso Our study illustrates a molecular zzso from zzso signaling to zzso zzso in cell polarity signal zzso
