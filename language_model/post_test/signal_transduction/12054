The purpose of this study was to zzso the mechanism of the airborne poultry dust zzso matter, zzso respiratory tract zzso a common symptom in agricultural respiratory zzso The study was based on the hypothesis that poultry PM would induce the release of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso by respiratory zzso cells under the upstream regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Human lung zzso cells zzso in culture were treated with the poultry PM zzso zzso for different lengths of time, following which zzso activity, release of zzso and zzso of zzso in cells were zzso zzso PM zzso zzso caused a significant zzso of zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso which was significantly attenuated by the zzso agents, zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso PM also significantly induced the release of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B4 and zzso and upstream zzso of AA zzso in the zzso zzso PM also significantly induced release of zzso by the cells in a zzso and zzso manner, which was significantly attenuated by the calcium zzso agents, antioxidants and zzso and zzso zzso The current study for the first time revealed that the poultry zzso zzso release from the respiratory zzso cells was regulated upstream by zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso
