To explore the effect and possible cell signal zzso mechanism of active components zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the vascular zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured in zzso and zzso by zzso then cultured in media containing zzso whole recipe zzso its zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso as well as zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso respectively after then, changes of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso expressions were zzso 

zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells were significantly enhanced after zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso When compared with the zzso group, the three expressions were lower in the zzso treated group zzso zzso zzso while in groups treated with zzso and zzso only expressions of zzso and zzso were lower zzso zzso zzso but no obvious difference in zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased after zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso which could be enhanced by zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but inhibited by zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells showed no remarkable change after zzso zzso or after reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar to that of zzso and zzso zzso was unchanged in all the zzso 

zzso could zzso the increasing of zzso expression induced by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso might be the active components in the zzso The effect of zzso is mainly zzso through zzso of zzso while zzso zzso or zzso are not the chief signal zzso zzso And zzso and its effective components may antagonize the zzso zzso on zzso through zzso the zzso of zzso
