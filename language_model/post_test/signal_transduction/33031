The zzso proteins constitute a large family of zzso zzso molecules that are found throughout the animal kingdom and are important for a wide variety of normal and pathological zzso zzso Here we describe zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that binds to zzso proteins and zzso their zzso zzso is present in fish, zzso and zzso and is expressed during zzso and zzso development in a complex pattern that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arches and neural crest zzso We use zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso affects zzso (the generation of trunk zzso zzso in agreement with its normal expression in zzso zzso In zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso Together with earlier results obtained with the zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso proteins interact with structurally diverse zzso zzso presumably to fine-tune the spatial and zzso patterns of zzso zzso
