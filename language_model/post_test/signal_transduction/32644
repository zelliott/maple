In search for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we used the zzso zzso method and identified the zzso zzso interaction domain of the Ral exchange factors zzso Ral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso These zzso which also interact with activated Ras and zzso are zzso of Ras and mediate the zzso of Ral in response to the zzso of zzso Here we show that the full-length zzso interact with the zzso form of zzso in the zzso system as well as in zzso When zzso in zzso cells, an activated zzso zzso zzso but not an inactive protein zzso zzso with zzso and zzso moreover, zzso complexes can be isolated from the particulate fraction of zzso cells and were localized by zzso zzso to the resident compartment of zzso zzso the zzso zzso However, the zzso of activated zzso neither leads to the zzso of the Ral zzso via zzso nor zzso zzso Ral zzso in zzso Several hypotheses that could explain these results, including zzso of proteins involved in signal zzso are zzso Our results suggest that in cells, the interaction of zzso with zzso might trigger other cellular responses than zzso of the Ral zzso
