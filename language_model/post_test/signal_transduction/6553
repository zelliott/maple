Our previous studies demonstrated that a synthetic zzso encompassing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso chain of type IV zzso named zzso zzso in zzso melanoma cell proliferation and zzso In the present study, zzso melanoma cells were zzso zzso to zzso the complete zzso domain zzso zzso or its zzso part, encompassing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso inhibited zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso growth, and invasive zzso For studying the in zzso effect of zzso representative clones were zzso injected into the left side of zzso zzso In zzso tumor growth was decreased by zzso and zzso respectively, with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso compared to control zzso This zzso effect was associated with a decrease of in zzso zzso D1 zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso induced an in zzso zzso of zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso especially the production or zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso The zzso zzso system was also altered in tumors with a decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a strong increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso or its zzso zzso fragment, zzso zzso zzso in zzso melanoma progression by triggering an zzso zzso pathway, which involves a zzso zzso zzso zzso
