We review in this article recent findings on the effects of cell proximity zzso to each zzso on anterior zzso cell function in zzso Important cellular zzso including protein zzso zzso hormone release, response to zzso regulatory factors and signal zzso can change as a function of the distance between adjacent zzso These findings, together with a growing body of evidence on zzso zzso zzso form a basis for proposing a model of anterior zzso cell zzso In this scheme zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways all contribute and interact to control zzso processes in zzso
