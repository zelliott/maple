Recent studies of the sea zzso zzso have zzso the mechanisms that zzso and pattern its nervous zzso These studies have revealed the presence of two overlapping regions of zzso potential at the beginning of zzso each of which becomes progressively restricted by separate, yet linked, signals, including zzso and subsequently zzso and zzso These signals act to specify and zzso the embryonic neural fields - the anterior zzso and the more zzso zzso band zzso - during zzso Here, we review these zzso nervous system patterning signals and consider how the relationships between them might have changed during zzso zzso
