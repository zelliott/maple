zzso zzso zzso are emerging as key molecules in human cancer, with the potential to serve as novel markers of disease and to reveal zzso aspects of tumor zzso Here we discover 121 zzso prostate zzso zzso transcripts zzso by zzso zzso assembly of zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso from a cohort of 102 prostate zzso and cells zzso We characterized one zzso zzso as a zzso regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the zzso zzso Complex 2 zzso We further found that patterns of zzso and zzso expression zzso patient zzso into molecular zzso distinguished by expression signatures of zzso target zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in a subset of prostate cancer zzso These findings establish the utility of zzso to identify zzso zzso that may improve the zzso of cancer zzso
