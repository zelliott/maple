The ability to build genetic circuits with a zzso response to external stimuli depends on the experimental and theoretical methods used in the zzso A theoretical zzso that describes the response of a zzso zzso genetic network to the external stimuli zzso zzso is zzso Two applications are studied in detail: the design of a logic pulse and the interference of three signal generators in the zzso regulatory zzso The gene interactions are presented using molecular zzso that have a precise mathematical structure and retain the biological meaning of the zzso
