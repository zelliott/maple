zzso of proteins by zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso phenomena such as blood zzso and skin zzso We show that zzso zzso suppressed innate immune signaling in the zzso zzso interference zzso directed against zzso reduced the life span of flies reared under conventional zzso conditions but not of those raised under zzso zzso In conventionally reared flies, zzso zzso enhanced the expression of genes zzso zzso peptides in the immune zzso zzso zzso zzso flies that zzso gut zzso prepared from conventionally reared zzso zzso flies had shorter life zzso In conventionally reared flies, zzso zzso triggered zzso in the gut and induced the nuclear zzso of zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso flies that zzso synthetic zzso donors, which inhibit the zzso zzso zzso reaction, showed nuclear zzso of zzso and enhanced expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso signaling zzso to enable immune tolerance against zzso zzso
