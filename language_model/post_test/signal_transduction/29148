zzso of the molecular mechanisms involved in the biology of zzso zzso zzso is essential for the identification of candidate zzso zzso new putative therapeutic targets, and early detection strategies zzso of zzso 

The authors performed zzso analyses in a series of primary zzso by using complementary DNA zzso zzso of putative targets was performed in large series of zzso by zzso on tissue zzso real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, and Western zzso zzso 

The expression signature consisted of 159 zzso genes and 186 zzso zzso Most of these genes were involved in cell zzso signal zzso cell cycle, zzso and zzso Among the genes from the molecular signature, zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 7 zzso were evaluated in wider series of zzso zzso analysis carried out in different types of zzso revealed exclusive zzso in zzso Furthermore, survival analysis by using functional clusters of genes related with cancer and zzso biology revealed 7 genes involved in the zzso zzso that presented a significant association with clinical zzso Among these zzso positive expression of zzso X protein zzso was associated significantly with better survival in a larger series of zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso was demonstrated in this set of zzso 

The authors concluded that there is a significant role for zzso zzso zzso genes in patients with zzso and putative zzso markers associated with zzso zzso were zzso The detailed study of these candidate genes and the molecular pathways regulating zzso zzso reveal that they are promising targets for the clinical management of patients with zzso
