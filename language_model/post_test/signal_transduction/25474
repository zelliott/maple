zzso zzso small signal molecules into the environment that induce self and zzso gene zzso This phenomenon, termed zzso zzso allows cooperative zzso that increase the fitness of the zzso The zzso signal molecules are the zzso zzso zzso zzso by a growing number of bacterial species including important pathogen species such as zzso zzso These molecules have recently been proposed to have properties other than those of zzso functioning as iron zzso or zzso As the presence of an zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso could constitute a zzso mechanism against these zzso in this work we zzso the effects of different zzso varying in length and zzso on the growth and nitrogen metabolism of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All the zzso tested strongly inhibited nitrogen zzso The zzso seems to take place at zzso level, as no effect on zzso differentiation or on the expression of zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso showed a specific zzso effect on this zzso in the presence of a combined nitrogen source, but the mechanism involved seems to be different from that described so far for zzso acid derivatives of zzso zzso These results suggest a variety of new unexpected activities for zzso at least on zzso zzso
