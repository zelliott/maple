In simple zzso specialized zzso functions such as transport and zzso are made possible by the segregation of proteins and lipids into opposite surface zzso This polarized distribution results from selective delivery to and retention at the appropriate zzso In the case of direct delivery, the sorting site for zzso and zzso proteins is the zzso network zzso where they are incorporated into distinct zzso and zzso zzso that are targeted to the respective zzso The machinery that controls this simple process is in fact rather zzso It involves many different steps from the recognition event (between zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the formation of the zzso their zzso and the zzso to the specialized plasma membrane zzso Here we zzso the latest developments in the sorting of zzso and zzso zzso focusing in particular on the signals that are involved in this process and the current hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for it, in both zzso and in zzso zzso
