TIM zzso cell, zzso zzso proteins can regulate T cell immune zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in T cells, but exclusively in zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso and zzso fusion protein was shown to either inhibit or expand T zzso However, the molecular basis for such opposite effects was not zzso By generating zzso we show that expression of zzso protein is restricted to zzso and zzso cells and is zzso upon zzso We show that zzso specifically zzso zzso and zzso T cell expansion by enhancing cell division and reducing zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of signaling molecules zzso zzso and zzso in T zzso zzso expressed on zzso is a zzso zzso that promotes T cell expansion and survival by zzso zzso on T zzso
