This article addresses the problem of zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

We introduce zzso an open source zzso for constructing zzso database warehouses using the zzso and Oracle zzso database zzso zzso zzso its component databases into a common zzso framework within a single database management system, thus enabling zzso queries using the zzso zzso Language zzso but also zzso a variety of database integration tasks such as comparative analysis and data zzso zzso currently supports the integration of a zzso set of databases including zzso zzso and zzso and in addition the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso databases, and the Gene zzso zzso tools, written in the C and zzso languages, parse and load these databases into a zzso database zzso The zzso also apply a degree of semantic zzso to their respective source data, decreasing semantic zzso The zzso supports the following zzso zzso chemical compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso features on protein and zzso zzso organisms, zzso zzso and controlled zzso As an application example, we applied zzso to determine the fraction of zzso characterized zzso activities for which no sequences exist in the public sequence zzso The answer is that no sequence exists for zzso of zzso activities for which zzso numbers have been zzso These gaps in sequence data significantly limit the accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and are a barrier for zzso zzso Complex queries of this type provide examples of the value of the data zzso approach to zzso zzso 

zzso embodies significant progress on the database integration problem for zzso
