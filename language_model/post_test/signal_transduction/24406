zzso zzso zzso zzso mice completely lack zzso and develop severe zzso These mice also show a zzso in their zzso cell zzso In the present study, the expression of zzso was examined in zzso cell lines using flow zzso and reverse zzso Three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso on their surface, and two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso at the late zzso cell stage, expressed it at low levels, although their zzso expression was zzso Another zzso cell line, zzso at the intermediate stage between zzso and immature B cells, did not express zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso which expresses the zzso cell zzso on the cell surface, also expressed zzso When differentiation of zzso cells was induced in zzso by removing zzso from cultures, zzso expression zzso it was restored by the addition of zzso suggesting that zzso functions in cooperation with zzso To examine the function of zzso we introduced the zzso gene into zzso cells and established two zzso that zzso expressed zzso even in the absence of zzso In these zzso after removal of zzso the number of cells that succeeded in zzso chain zzso was decreased to one third; and zzso expression decreased to less than one zzso Moreover, the percentage of cells in the zzso phase was increased by 50% over the mock zzso These findings indicate that, before zzso chain zzso occurs, zzso together with zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso and makes this zzso more zzso
