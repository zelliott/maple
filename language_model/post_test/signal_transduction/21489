Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for their effects on the locust immune system and for comparison with the effects of challenge by injection with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso as Met zzso is highly zzso whether applied zzso as zzso or injected as zzso However, isolate zzso zzso zzso to zzso as Met zzso is zzso only when injected as zzso suggesting that the lack of zzso of zzso applied zzso from this isolate is due to a failure to penetrate the insect zzso and gain access to the zzso After topical application of zzso from Met zzso no zzso of zzso is zzso but injection of zzso from Met 189 brings about a transient increase in zzso activity in the zzso in both adult zzso and 5th zzso zzso although this does not prevent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the zzso of adult locusts, and enhances it in zzso It is argued that the lack of zzso of zzso in zzso shown previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso are related to the zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in response to injection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Biology 33, zzso reflects differences in the sensitivity of the immune system between adults and zzso rather than distinct qualitative differences, and this is confirmed in this study by the demonstration that doses of zzso higher than those used previously zzso zzso do activate the zzso cascade in 5th zzso zzso zzso are formed in zzso of all ages in response to zzso infection or injection of zzso although there is wide variation in the number, size and distribution of zzso zzso During the examination of 5th zzso zzso for zzso formation, a previously unknown phenomenon was observed in which the zzso zzso zzso in response to injections of zzso or high doses of zzso In zzso zzso of such zzso this reaction is so strong that the whole zzso zzso is intensely zzso Such a response is not observed in the zzso zzso of mature adult zzso
