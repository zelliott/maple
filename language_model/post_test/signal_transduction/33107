zzso that determine the competence of cells to respond to zzso cues are not well zzso We demonstrate that two zzso zzso factors have zzso roles in determining the ability of zzso zzso zzso precursor cells zzso to respond to the zzso signal from the anchor cell of the zzso zzso The zzso develops from a subset of zzso zzso precursor cells distributed along the zzso zzso zzso patterning depends on both a localized zzso zzso the zzso growth factor, and lateral signaling between induced zzso One zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso two zzso By examining the response of single zzso to controlled doses of zzso signal in zzso and in zzso zzso animals, we demonstrate that zzso reduces the competence of these two zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso of zzso that causes zzso expression of zzso in all zzso reduces the sensitivity of all zzso to zzso zzso Additional experiments suggest that another zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso in zzso animals to respond to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso tests are consistent with models in which zzso acts downstream of the zzso zzso to regulate response to zzso zzso We propose that the spatial pattern of zzso gene expression may enhance the precision of zzso fate zzso
