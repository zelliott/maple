zzso of the rat zzso zzso gene is zzso by growth factors such as zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso and inhibited by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso requires the presence of factors that recognize the zzso binding site in the zzso promoter, but zzso stimulation requires induction of the zzso zzso while zzso acts through a zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to involve protein zzso C zzso since zzso but not zzso requires activated protein zzso C to stimulate zzso zzso zzso beta zzso of zzso gene expression requires an upstream zzso referred to as the zzso beta zzso element zzso zzso is also a part of a protein complex that binds to the zzso The zzso zzso is therefore involved in both stimulation and zzso of zzso gene zzso
