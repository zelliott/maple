G zzso receptors zzso recognize a wide variety of zzso zzso to control diverse zzso zzso zzso that bind to such receptors can either zzso fully or partially (full or partial zzso or reduce zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso Various studies have shown that the zzso of receptors through binding of zzso proceeds by zzso changes as the zzso switches from a resting to an active state leading to G protein zzso Yet the molecular basis for differences between zzso and inverse zzso is zzso These different classes of compounds are assumed to switch the zzso zzso in distinct zzso It is not known, however, whether such switching occurs along a linear zzso scale or whether zzso and inverse zzso induce different switch zzso Using a zzso approach to study the zzso zzso zzso we show that inverse zzso are differentiated from zzso in that they trigger a very distinct mode of a zzso zzso This switch couples inverse zzso binding to the suppression of activity in the zzso
