The development of quantitative models of signal zzso as well as zzso zzso to improve existing models, depends on the ability to obtain quantitative information about various proteins that are part of the signaling zzso However, zzso measurement techniques such as Western blots and mobility shift zzso provide only qualitative or zzso data which cannot be used for zzso zzso Thus there is a clear need for techniques that enable quantitative determination of signal zzso zzso 

This paper presents an integrated modeling and experimental approach for zzso determining zzso factor profiles from green fluorescent protein zzso reporter zzso The technique consists of three steps: zzso creating data sets for green fluorescent reporter systems upon zzso zzso analyzing the zzso images to determine zzso intensity profiles using principal component analysis zzso and zzso zzso and zzso computing the zzso factor concentration from the zzso intensity profiles by zzso a model describing transcription, translation, and zzso of green fluorescent zzso We have used this technique to zzso characterize zzso of the zzso factor zzso by the zzso zzso In addition, we have applied the quantitative zzso profiles obtained from our technique to develop a model for zzso signal zzso where the parameters were estimated from the obtained zzso 

The technique presented here for computing zzso factor profiles from zzso zzso images of reporter cells generated quantitative data on the magnitude and dynamics of zzso zzso by zzso The obtained results are in good agreement with qualitative descriptions of zzso zzso as well as zzso experimental data from the zzso The profiles zzso from the experimental data have been used to zzso parameters for a zzso model and the results of additional experiments are predicted very well by the model with the new zzso zzso While the presented approach has been applied to zzso and zzso zzso it can be used to determine the profile of any zzso factor as long as zzso reporter fluorescent profiles are zzso
