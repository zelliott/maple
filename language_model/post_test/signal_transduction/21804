Two key models for examining zzso development of primary visual zzso zzso involve either reduction of activity in both eyes via zzso zzso or imbalance of activity between the two eyes via zzso deprivation zzso Combining DNA zzso analysis with zzso approaches, zzso zzso and zzso imaging, we find that DR leads to zzso zzso of genes zzso synaptic transmission and electrical activity, consistent with a coordinated response of cortical zzso to reduction of visual drive, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso implicating zzso zzso as underlying the delay in cortical maturation after zzso MD partially activates zzso mechanisms but zzso zzso molecular pathways related to growth factors and zzso zzso consistent with reorganization of connections after zzso zzso of a binding protein of zzso growth zzso zzso is highly zzso after MD, and zzso application of zzso prevents the zzso effects of MD on zzso dominance plasticity examined in zzso
