zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso member that can track with zzso zzso tips zzso referred to as tip zzso during both zzso and zzso zzso tracks with zzso tips by binding to zzso proteins zzso through the zzso tip zzso signal zzso which lies N terminal to zzso neck and motor zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso behavior during zzso has never been zzso In this paper, we identify and define a zzso function specific to the zzso zzso population of zzso negative regulation of zzso length within the assembling bipolar zzso This function depends on zzso ability to bind zzso and track with zzso zzso zzso zzso Although this activity zzso zzso separation during zzso it ultimately benefits the dividing cell by promoting robust zzso attachments to the zzso zzso
