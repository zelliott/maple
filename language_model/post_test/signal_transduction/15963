zzso how stem cells are maintained in their zzso (the zzso is vital for their application in zzso zzso Studies of zzso male zzso stem cells zzso have served as a paradigm in zzso cell zzso It is known that the zzso and zzso pathways are necessary for the maintenance of zzso in the zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2001; zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, our recent work strongly suggests that zzso signaling is the primary zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso controls zzso maintenance by modulating the zzso zzso We found that zzso was specifically expressed from hub cells, and accumulated at the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited a reduced number of zzso yet maintained a normal population of zzso stem cells and hub zzso Additionally, zzso zzso activity was reduced, whereas zzso zzso was retained in zzso zzso Finally, zzso loss caused by the zzso zzso could be suppressed by zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso
