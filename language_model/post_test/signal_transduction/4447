zzso resistance zzso its well-known efficacy to control zzso breast zzso The involvement of zzso zzso in this mechanism is still not definitively zzso 

We selected 155 patients treated with zzso after development of zzso or as zzso zzso We performed zzso for zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso and zzso promoter zzso 

We found zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients receiving zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso presented shorter zzso survival zzso (all zzso Also, zzso and zzso zzso liver and brain relapses implied poor overall survival zzso (all zzso In patients with zzso disease, decreased zzso correlated with zzso expression zzso whereas for zzso were the presence of vascular invasion and zzso expression zzso Cox zzso 

Our results support that zzso resistance mechanisms are related with deregulation of zzso pathway, and/or zzso and zzso zzso in a subset of zzso breast zzso
