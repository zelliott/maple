zzso fatty liver disease zzso is a common liver zzso the zzso spectrum of which ranges from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso often leads to zzso and development of zzso zzso To better understand zzso of zzso we performed the zzso of distinction analysis zzso on a zzso association study zzso of 250 zzso white female adult patients with zzso who were enrolled in the NASH Clinical Research Network zzso Database zzso to investigate whether zzso process variation measured through zzso variation of genes within these pathways was related to the development of zzso or zzso Pathways such as zzso of zzso zzso of steroids, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of steroids were associated with zzso inflammation and zzso zzso while those in zzso synthesis were also associated with zzso and zzso These were also related to the zzso activity score zzso which is derived from the zzso severity of zzso inflammation and zzso zzso zzso protein translation and recycling of zzso related zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling events zzso by zzso zzso zzso transition, and zzso zzso receptors were also significantly associated with zzso Taken together, the results provide evidence for additional ways, beyond the effects of single zzso by which genetic factors might contribute to the zzso to develop a particular zzso of zzso and then progress to zzso Further studies are warranted to explain potential important genetic roles of these biological processes in zzso
