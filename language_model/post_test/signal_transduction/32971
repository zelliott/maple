We investigated the mechanisms responsible for altered zzso and relaxation function in zzso zzso zzso Although baseline zzso function zzso zzso in zzso mice was similar to that of zzso zzso mice, left zzso zzso contraction, zzso zzso and zzso channel currents zzso were greater in zzso mice in response to zzso M zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso The late phase of relaxation of the isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso was accelerated at baseline in zzso but did not increase further with zzso In zzso zzso using zzso also demonstrated enhanced relaxation at baseline in zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased contraction similarly in zzso and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso blocked the increases in zzso response and zzso currents to zzso in zzso and to zzso in both zzso and zzso It also blocked the accelerated relaxation in zzso at baseline but not the zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced in zzso compared with zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso relaxation at end zzso but does not affect baseline zzso function in isolated zzso However, the enhanced responses to sympathetic stimulation partly reflect increased zzso channel zzso zzso the cellular mechanisms zzso these effects appear to involve a zzso as well as a zzso zzso
