In zzso animals, activity is evoked in the primary sensory zzso cells zzso zzso by mechanical stimulation of the zzso In some cell populations this activity is correlated well with continuous stimulus parameters such as zzso zzso zzso but in others it is observed to represent events such as zzso contact or zzso The zzso process is zzso by the mechanics of the zzso zzso and zzso complex zzso and the mechanics and zzso of zzso within the zzso An understanding of this zzso process and the nature of the primary neural codes generated is crucial for understanding more central sensory processing in the zzso and zzso However, the details of the peripheral processing are currently poorly zzso To overcome this zzso in our knowledge, we constructed a simulated zzso model of the zzso system in the rat and tested it against a variety of data drawn from the zzso The agreement was good enough to suggest that the model captures many of the key features of the peripheral zzso system in the zzso
