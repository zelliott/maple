zzso regulatory T cells zzso have recently been the subject of intense research due to their strong zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso Nevertheless, the mechanism by which zzso performs this function remains to be fully zzso To address this question, we isolated zzso from human peripheral blood, and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso combined with zzso to examine the proliferation of zzso and to explore related molecular zzso Here, we show that zzso can induce the proliferation of zzso in the presence of zzso The induction is zzso by zzso presenting zzso in trans to zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated by zzso may also play a supportive zzso After zzso withdrawal, zzso zzso recycling in zzso contributes to the proliferation of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the degradation of zzso may be involved in this zzso These findings might explain the proliferation of zzso in the absence of zzso in zzso and provide a novel method to achieve large-scale proliferation of zzso in zzso in order to obtain cell numbers sufficient for zzso
