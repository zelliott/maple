Exposure to cigarette smoke stimulates the proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso in zzso and in zzso However, the molecular mechanism remains zzso This study aimed at investigating the role of signaling pathways involving protein zzso C alpha zzso and zzso D1 in the cigarette smoke extract zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were treated with different zzso of zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was measured by detecting the expression of zzso protein in the zzso and membrane zzso using Western zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso D1 zzso was assessed by real-time zzso The zzso and zzso D1 protein levels were detected by Western zzso 

Low zzso of zzso zzso - zzso zzso proliferation of zzso with its zzso effect at zzso zzso zzso led to zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity using zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso one of key regulators of zzso transition, was found to be zzso by zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso transition was abolished by zzso D1 zzso Moreover, zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso of zzso D1 at both the zzso and protein zzso 

zzso D1 zzso at least partially mediates the zzso proliferation in zzso
