The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso organ, which zzso part of the zzso zzso As the zzso is located in the deep pelvic floor, its zzso process is still zzso Bone zzso protein zzso signaling plays pivotal roles in various zzso However, the function of zzso signaling for zzso development is still zzso The present study aimed to zzso the role of zzso signaling in the development of the zzso We observed the prominent nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso the downstream molecules of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known as the major type 1 signal zzso in some zzso To analyze the zzso signaling function for zzso development, we examined zzso zzso zzso gene conditional zzso mice utilizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso conditional knockout zzso The zzso zzso zzso specimens also showed inflammatory zzso These zzso abnormalities resembled some of the zzso zzso observed in human zzso zzso The current study suggests that zzso signaling possesses an essential role in zzso development and zzso This would be the first report showing that the zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso some abnormalities of human zzso syndromes affecting the zzso zzso
