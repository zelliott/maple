In contrast to zzso fatty acids like zzso acid zzso the zzso potential of zzso fatty acids such as zzso acid zzso has been zzso We examined the zzso zzso dependent effects of AA versus zzso on zzso rolling, zzso and zzso through inflammatory activated human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as well as on zzso to investigate the impact on vascular zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso or sham, and zzso with zzso zzso or zzso Rolling and zzso were investigated by means of a parallel flow zzso zzso was performed in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was measured as zzso of protein zzso B zzso zzso was determined by zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso rolling, zzso and zzso although expression of zzso zzso molecules was zzso In contrast, AA increased zzso zzso Both fatty acids did not alter zzso zzso of the zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso The divergent effects of AA and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was decreased when compared to zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso In addition, zzso in comparison to AA zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso a reduction in rolling, zzso and zzso of zzso through inflammatory activated zzso that is in part zzso zzso zzso driven zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso as contribution to the resolution of inflammation is zzso modulated by zzso versus zzso
