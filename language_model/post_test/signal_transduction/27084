Signal zzso in zzso rod and cone zzso cells involves zzso channels that are directly gated by the internal zzso zzso zzso and each type of cones express genetically related yet different forms of zzso zzso that control the zzso zzso of zzso in rods and cones are also the product of distinct zzso Two different zzso clones zzso zzso channels have been characterized from the chicken zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gives rise to zzso channel zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso specific for the zzso zzso acid sequence derived from one clone stain outer segments of cone but not rod zzso Therefore chicken rod and cone cells each express different forms of zzso channels that are genetically related to each zzso zzso in zzso cells produces the complete form of both channel zzso whereas Western zzso analysis indicates that channels in outer segment zzso are present in a processed form that is significantly shorter than the full-length zzso
