zzso zzso zzso acid zzso reduces body fat in animals and some zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso when added to cultures of zzso vascular cells containing newly differentiated human zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso content, zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso incorporation into zzso and zzso compared with zzso In zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and many of its downstream targets were diminished by zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso gene expression was zzso Prior to changes in gene expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a robust and sustained zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso could be attenuated by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso with zzso blocked the ability of zzso zzso zzso to alter gene expression and zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso of the zzso zzso the induction by zzso of zzso signaling was linked to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso these data demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso zzso decreases the zzso content of newly differentiated human zzso by inducing zzso signaling through the zzso actions of zzso and zzso
