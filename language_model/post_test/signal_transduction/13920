zzso zzso are a family of regulatory proteins of genetic information with a high degree of conservation among zzso The zzso are heavily involved in several zzso functions including control of gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been the most studied zzso and plays important role in the prevention and progression of neurodegenerative diseases acting in different pathways of proteins involved in brain zzso zzso zzso regulates important genes that also exert zzso actions such as zzso nuclear factor zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver X zzso and zzso box zzso It is well established in literature that growing population aging, zzso stress, zzso and genetic factors are important conditions to development of neurodegenerative zzso However, the exact zzso mechanisms leading to these diseases remain zzso The zzso show strong potential to become valuable zzso and zzso markers for diseases and as therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative zzso In this context, the aim of the current review is to present an actual view of the potential role of zzso in modulating the interaction between target genes and neurodegenerative diseases on the zzso
