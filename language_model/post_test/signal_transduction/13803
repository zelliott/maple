The zzso target of zzso zzso functions as a critical regulator of cellular growth and metabolism by forming zzso yet functionally distinct complexes zzso and zzso Although zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso little is known about how zzso is zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso suppresses zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso or zzso in a cellular zzso manner, zzso not only zzso or zzso but also zzso or zzso zzso zzso by zzso demonstrating a negative regulation of zzso independent of zzso and zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso by bypassing this negative zzso Together, our results reveal a zzso zzso regulation, providing a potential molecular mechanism by which zzso in the zzso zzso axis might cause zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, which zzso zzso
