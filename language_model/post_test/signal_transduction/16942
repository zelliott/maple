Interest in human saliva zzso for zzso zzso screening increased in the last zzso We used whole saliva samples from zzso healthy and diseased subjects with chronic zzso to screen for zzso differences in the protein zzso 

We selected 20 zzso healthy and 20 zzso diseased subjects from the zzso zzso Study of Health in zzso zzso and zzso zzso collection was performed with commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso Whole saliva proteins were zzso after zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso by zzso zzso were zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso software zzso 

In whole saliva we identified 344 human protein groups across all zzso For label free zzso we only considered 152 proteins identified with more than one unique zzso In total, 20 proteins showed zzso difference in abundance between controls and patients zzso the majority of these proteins showed higher abundance in the zzso diseased zzso zzso zzso of proteins linked the zzso diseased status with acute phase response and inflammatory zzso 

zzso free zzso analysis of whole saliva is a powerful tool to characterize the zzso disease status and differentiate between healthy and zzso diseased zzso
