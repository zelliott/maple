Multiple sclerosis zzso is a zzso disease characterized by a progressive loss of zzso and a failure of zzso zzso zzso particularly in the progressive zzso of the zzso An improved understanding of the signaling mechanisms that control differentiation of OL precursors may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for zzso in zzso About 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known, many of which are involved in signaling both in health and zzso We have undertaken a systematic zzso approach to evaluate zzso gene activity in multiple sclerosis zzso and in related in zzso and in zzso models of the zzso This effort led to the identification of zzso a zzso previously believed to be expressed only in zzso as being zzso regulated during OL differentiation and in zzso zzso zzso zzso interference studies revealed that zzso is a key regulator of OL zzso Finally, we identified zzso and zzso as novel and specific zzso zzso providing an indication as to how this zzso might exert control over OL zzso
