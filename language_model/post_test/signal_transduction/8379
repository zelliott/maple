We have identified zzso and beta zzso and zzso as two regulators of zzso signaling in zzso We found that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and B cause defects in zzso trafficking, where zzso and other membrane proteins accumulate in late zzso zzso We show that zzso is transported to the surface of zzso cells and that signaling is disrupted after the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso pump responsible for zzso zzso zzso We found that, similarly, zzso and B appear to regulate zzso zzso Moreover, we identified zzso in zzso a zzso zzso and showed that they zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso affects zzso signaling and trafficking through regulating zzso function, which implies that the zzso of an zzso compartment in the receiving cells is crucial for zzso
