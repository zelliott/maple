zzso do not always mix zzso in zzso but can cluster to form zzso We will consider one type of zzso that can form in cell zzso These are enriched in cholesterol and zzso and are referred to as zzso zzso probably exist in zzso in the zzso phase or a phase with similar zzso We will briefly review membrane zzso phase behavior, and the differences between zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso We will present evidence suggesting that zzso zzso phase zzso and zzso zzso phase zzso zzso can exist in equilibrium in biological zzso especially the plasma zzso zzso zzso of membrane proteins into zzso can affect zzso Among the proteins that are targeted to zzso are those anchored in the outer leaflet of the membrane through zzso attachment to a special zzso zzso zzso zzso Other proteins that are linked to saturated zzso zzso such as those that are directly zzso with two or more zzso zzso or a zzso and a zzso chain, are also targeted to zzso zzso of zzso proteins and other proteins to zzso plays a role in signal zzso in zzso cells, and possibly also in sorting in zzso zzso and regulation of zzso zzso in other zzso zzso
