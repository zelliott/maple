Recent data indicate that age-related zzso zzso zzso transmission impairment is correlated with the reduction in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso As zzso is associated with several diseases and conditions that generally occur with age, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso and its impact on zzso We found that in zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso In the early phase of zzso the expression of zzso is reduced, both at the protein and zzso level through zzso upstream of zzso zzso involving zzso zzso system zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso together with treatment with zzso and zzso blocks zzso death, whereas pharmacological zzso and zzso suppression of zzso zzso exacerbate zzso zzso In the late phase of zzso the increased expression of zzso contribute to the last, zzso wave of cell zzso These findings are relevant to our understanding of zzso zzso and zzso activity regulation, raising further questions as to the role of zzso in those zzso zzso such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a convergence of zzso mechanisms and zzso zzso
