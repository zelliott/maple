The zzso complex in muscle consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is part of the larger zzso complex zzso which is essential for maintaining muscle membrane zzso zzso in any of the four zzso cause zzso muscular zzso zzso In this report, we have identified a novel interaction between zzso and the 16 zzso zzso c zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso cell system revealed that zzso interacts specifically with zzso and the highly related zzso through the zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso forms a complex with zzso at the plasma zzso Loss of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and alters the zzso of zzso at the zzso In addition, the steady state level of zzso is zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso also interacts directly with zzso and our data demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso were zzso together in zzso zzso Since zzso have been proposed to participate in zzso signaling with zzso our findings suggest that zzso might mediate the communication between zzso and zzso and play an important role in the zzso of muscular zzso
