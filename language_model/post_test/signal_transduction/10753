Alzheimer's disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive zzso accompanied by two main structural changes in the brain: zzso protein deposits termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein deposits surrounded by zzso zzso that constitutes the senile zzso Currently, it is widely accepted that zzso zzso (A zzso metabolism zzso is crucial for zzso zzso A beta deposition may be enhanced by molecular zzso including metals like copper and proteins like zzso zzso At the zzso level, several zzso proteins interact with zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso zzso and both in zzso and in zzso studies suggest that zzso signaling is a target for A beta zzso zzso zzso of this signaling by zzso or zzso zzso in zzso animal models or in primary zzso zzso zzso A beta zzso by recovering zzso levels and zzso gene expression of survival genes such as zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also activate zzso signaling and they have zzso effects on zzso zzso Our studies are consistent with the idea that a sustained loss of function of zzso signaling components would trigger a series of events, determining the onset and development of zzso and that zzso of this zzso through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso should be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
