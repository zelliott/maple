The effect of insulin on zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso signaling were measured in fat cells from lean and obese zzso rats of different zzso zzso zzso transport was markedly reduced in zzso from old and obese zzso The protein content of zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 were also reduced while other zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and 2) were essentially zzso There was a marked impairment in the insulin zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 2 as well as zzso of zzso and zzso in cells from old and obese zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane was virtually zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso upstream signaling including zzso and zzso activities as well as rate of zzso zzso Thus, the insulin resistance in cells from old and obese zzso rats can be accounted for by an impaired zzso process, due to signaling defects leading to a reduced zzso of zzso and zzso as well as an attenuated zzso protein zzso
