zzso hormones zzso have a wide variety of essential roles in zzso ranging from the regulation of key zzso processes to cell proliferation and zzso The classical mechanism of action of zzso is zzso zzso zzso binds to specific nuclear receptors zzso and zzso the expression of specific zzso Recently, a new category of mechanisms, termed zzso has been discovered for zzso These mechanisms include, among others, the rapid zzso of signal zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso which eventually lead to cell zzso These effects are zzso in some cell types by a plasma membrane zzso identified as zzso zzso and in other cell types by zzso zzso The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of zzso on the cell growth of chick zzso zzso at two different stages of development, 14 and 19 days, and to determine the zzso of the signal zzso zzso focusing on the potential involvement of a plasma membrane zzso and the possible participation of zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso Our results clearly show that zzso stimulates cell proliferation at both stages of development through the zzso of the zzso zzso and the production of small amounts of zzso which operate as effective second zzso Moreover, we prove that these effects are not initiated at the plasma membrane zzso for zzso
