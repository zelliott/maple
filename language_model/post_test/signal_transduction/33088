We studied the influence of diabetes on zzso zzso changes in zzso free zzso levels zzso zzso zzso in single tail artery vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso week zzso diabetic zzso rats showed an increase in sensitivity to zzso when compared to control zzso cells in that the concentration of zzso needed to elicit half zzso response of the initial zzso transient was reduced more than zzso though the zzso response attained was apparently zzso In addition, the slope factor zzso of the zzso relation was lowered zzso Moreover, zzso cells of diabetic animals had a higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The shift of the zzso curve to the left, coupled with a higher zzso of zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in tail artery zzso of diabetic rat may be zzso
