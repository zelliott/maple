We show that during zzso zzso male zzso development, the zzso of a zzso versus zzso cell fate in a zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso of a zzso signaling zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sheath cell into its sister, the zzso zzso We discovered a new zzso zzso that displays this same cell fate zzso The zzso zzso enhances the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in several zzso zzso including zzso development, zzso zzso development, and male tail zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso protein and is localized in all cell zzso through development as revealed by a zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso function by zzso interference results in the same zzso zzso as caused by zzso of zzso a zzso class zzso protein known to act downstream of the zzso signaling zzso Our results provide in zzso evidence for the functional involvement of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The sequence zzso zzso protein zzso and the sequence specific zzso protein zzso might both act in the zzso responding cells to regulate gene zzso in opposite zzso
