The genetically zzso model zzso zzso zzso has provided insights into a myriad of biological questions, enabled by its short generation time, ease of growth and small zzso This small size, though, has zzso a number of technical approaches found in other model zzso For example, blood zzso in zzso systems and zzso techniques in plants enable asking questions of circulatory system composition and zzso The circulatory system of the worm, the zzso has until recently been impossible to zzso zzso To answer questions of zzso signaling and circulatory system composition zzso zzso researchers have traditionally turned to genetic analysis, zzso specific rescue, and mosaic zzso These techniques provide a means to zzso what is happening between cells, but are not universally zzso in identification and characterization of zzso zzso Here we present a newly developed technique to directly zzso the zzso fluid of zzso zzso The technique begins with either genetic or physical manipulation to increase the volume of zzso zzso Afterward the animals are subjected to a zzso reverse zzso technique using a zzso zzso that allows fine balance pressure zzso After isolation of zzso fluid, the collected fluid can be zzso by transfer into other animals or by molecular zzso To demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique we present a detailed approach to zzso a specific example of zzso signaling zzso long zzso during a systemic zzso zzso Although characterization of systemic zzso is a proof of principle example, we see this technique as being adaptable to answer a variety of questions of circulatory system composition and zzso
