The effects of aging were studied on both early and late zzso to zzso of protein zzso C zzso events of signal zzso in mouse T cell zzso Aged zzso mice showed significant suppression of Con zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cells compared to young zzso When early signaling was zzso by stimulating cells with the combination of a calcium zzso and a zzso zzso zzso incorporation was comparable between young and aged mice while Con zzso zzso zzso remained depressed in aged zzso These results suggest that impairment of early (but not zzso events may be responsible for the suppression of T cell proliferation in aged zzso Further, aged mice exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous proliferation resulting in a robust reduction of the stimulation index of both Con A and zzso zzso Similarly, aged mice exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous zzso expression in both zzso and zzso T zzso No differences in zzso zzso were found between young and aged zzso The change in zzso expression was positively correlated with increased spontaneous zzso zzso these results suggest that: 1) impaired early zzso rather than later zzso events of signaling may be responsible for poor proliferation of T cells, and 2) zzso zzso of cells related to increased level of zzso expression may play an important role in zzso zzso
