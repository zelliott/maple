zzso zzso zzso is the most aggressive and fatal brain zzso zzso is resistant to chemotherapy and zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso cells zzso which have characteristics of cancer stem cells, are responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy and radiation and zzso No effective therapy for zzso has been zzso Here we showed that zzso peptides zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso penetration accelerating sequence zzso and zzso of zzso zzso induced the cell death of zzso zzso was effectively zzso into human zzso The peptides zzso inhibited cell growth and at 3 zzso completely blocked the growth of zzso but not embryonic stem zzso zzso cell death was observed in the zzso treated with zzso but zzso was zzso zzso without zzso showed the same effect as zzso suggesting Pas to play a critical role in the cell death of zzso Finally, zzso reduced tumor mass in mice transplanted with zzso zzso zzso therapy using zzso could be a new method for the treatment of zzso
