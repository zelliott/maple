zzso proteins released by zzso zzso cells are critical zzso of cell communication, zzso and organization, yet the actual spectrum of proteins released by any given cell (the zzso is poorly zzso To define the set of proteins zzso by human zzso zzso cells zzso we combined zzso and zzso approaches to define a zzso protein set based upon probable biological zzso Analysis of zzso medium by liquid zzso zzso resulted in identification of zzso unique zzso of which 151 were found to be specifically enriched in the zzso compartment when compared with a database of proteins expressed in whole zzso zzso Additional high mass accuracy analysis revealed 36 proteins whose zzso abundance increased after treatment with zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso and general zzso Many of the zzso zzso proteins have been reported to be zzso expressed in human zzso and appear to be zzso as zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso a zzso critically required for normal zzso function, we found that the zzso of specific zzso zzso was also zzso regulated through zzso zzso This study demonstrates a tiered strategy by which zzso proteins can be identified and progressively assigned to classes of increasing confidence and regulatory zzso
