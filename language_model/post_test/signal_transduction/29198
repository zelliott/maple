zzso smooth muscle cells zzso have been implicated in the zzso of stroke, the third most common cause of death and the leading cause of long-term neurological disability in the zzso However, there is little insight into the underlying cellular pathways that link zzso function to brain zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso knockout mouse model of zzso 3, a zzso signaling zzso zzso highly expressed in vascular zzso we uncover a striking zzso to zzso stroke upon zzso Cellular and molecular analyses of vascular zzso derived from these animals associate zzso 3 activity to the expression of specific gene targets, whereas genetic rescue experiments zzso link zzso 3 function in vessels to the zzso zzso
