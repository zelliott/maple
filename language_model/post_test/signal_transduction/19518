zzso is an essential regulator of cell migration and zzso in both zzso and zzso It has long been speculated that the zzso protein zzso zzso which is a key regulator of zzso migration in the zzso brain, might be a component of this signaling pathway, but this idea has been zzso We now demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso result in zzso that mimic zzso zzso zzso both in zzso guidance and zzso zzso The zzso zzso interacts genetically with zzso in zzso and with zzso in the zzso accessory factors trio and enabled zzso zzso zzso tests show that zzso functions upstream of zzso and zzso and, consistent with this, we show that zzso is required for the zzso zzso of these two zzso We therefore zzso that zzso is a bona fide component of the core zzso signaling zzso in zzso
