zzso alpha zzso X zzso also called zzso is a nuclear zzso highly expressed in zzso that play a role in zzso zzso In this report we show that fatty acids are positive regulators of zzso alpha gene expression and we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso In cultured rat zzso and primary zzso cells, fatty acids and the zzso fatty acid zzso zzso acid, robustly induce zzso alpha (up to zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso beta (also called zzso zzso steady state levels, with zzso fatty acids being more effective than saturated fatty zzso zzso stability and nuclear zzso studies demonstrate that changes in the zzso rate of the zzso alpha gene account for the major part of the induction of zzso alpha zzso zzso A similar induction of protein level was also seen after treatment of primary zzso with the same fatty zzso zzso with such a zzso effect, transient zzso studies with a zzso reporter zzso driven by zzso zzso of the zzso region of the mouse zzso alpha zzso show a zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso activity upon treatment with zzso acid and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso alpha zzso region contains the necessary sequence elements for fatty acid zzso In addition, in zzso zzso alpha expression was induced by fatty zzso consistent with the in zzso cell culture zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso alpha expression is controlled by fatty acid signaling pathways and suggest an important zzso between fatty acid and cholesterol regulation of zzso zzso
