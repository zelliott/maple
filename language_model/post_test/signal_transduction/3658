The zzso zzso from zzso coli is a zzso zzso protein that mediates zzso behavior and is the most studied system among the zzso receptors to understand the molecular mechanism for zzso zzso However, there is an unresolved issue for the structural event which zzso the zzso signal upon binding to the zzso zzso and genetic evidence implies an zzso mechanism zzso zzso whereas zzso evidence implies an zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso evidence has been ambiguous because all the zzso protein structures contained a zzso zzso and a completely zzso structure has not been available thus zzso Here we present the crystal structure of the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso free of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The structural comparison of this structure with those of zzso and zzso forms revealed that, on zzso or zzso zzso the zzso change in the zzso domain is relatively small, but there is a considerable rotation between two zzso supporting the zzso zzso
