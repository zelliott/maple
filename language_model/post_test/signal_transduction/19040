zzso II zzso zzso is known to play a pivotal role in the development of diabetic zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso zzso effects on diabetic zzso is still zzso We have reported that zzso plays a key role in diabetic zzso zzso expansion and directly regulates the zzso of type IV collagen zzso in zzso and in zzso Here we examined the effect of zzso II on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso expansion in zzso zzso diabetic rats in zzso using zzso II type 1 zzso blocker, zzso We also examined the signaling mechanism by which zzso II zzso zzso zzso expansion in zzso Treatment of diabetic rats with zzso zzso for 20 weeks reduced zzso and zzso without affecting blood pressure and inhibited zzso zzso expansive changes and the expression of zzso and smooth muscle alpha zzso compared with those in zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso showed that the increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso II induced zzso synthesis and increased expression of zzso and zzso in cultured zzso cells, which was blocked by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of dominant negative zzso also reduced the zzso of zzso Moreover, addition of zzso zzso against zzso significantly reduced the zzso of zzso and synthesis of zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso II can regulate the development of zzso zzso expansion in the early phase of diabetic zzso through zzso and zzso
