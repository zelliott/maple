We previously hypothesized that zzso zzso senses a diverse set of environmental and nutritional factors associated with zzso formation through a zzso in the activity of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso we report our further investigation of the impact of additional environmental stress factors on zzso cycle activity and provide a detailed description of our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was treated with zzso that are associated with zzso formation, a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As controls and to integrate our current data with our previous study, zzso ethanol stress and zzso were also zzso zzso with our prior zzso the effect of many environmental stress factors on the zzso zzso zzso was essentially identical to the effect of zzso cycle zzso in the zzso zzso strain zzso A detailed quantitative analysis of zzso concentration changes using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified a network of 37 zzso zzso affected by the zzso and zzso cycle zzso We zzso that the zzso cycle acts as the central zzso in a zzso signaling zzso
