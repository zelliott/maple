The vitamin D zzso system zzso an arsenal of important biological functions in more than 30 different zzso in zzso and long-term zzso Two membrane receptors and one nuclear zzso are suggested to be involved in the vitamin D signaling system, but the function and zzso relevance of the receptors are zzso The complexity of the vitamin D zzso system makes it necessary to combine experimental data with in zzso simulations to get a holistic view of vitamin zzso regulation of tissue and cell zzso This review focus on binding characteristics for the three putative vitamin D receptors and proposes a future systems biology approach including mathematical modeling that will be helpful together with experimental methods in depicting zzso and other biological effects promoted by the vitamin D zzso zzso
