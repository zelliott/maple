Head and neck cancer, the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide, is associated with a dismal prognosis that has minimally improved during the last few zzso Future advances in the treatment and prognosis of this fatal disease largely rely upon a better understanding of the molecular events that zzso tumor development and zzso allowing specific targeting of the involved molecules and zzso In this context, recent efforts have revolved around a family of zzso factors known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins comprise a family of zzso zzso zzso factors that become zzso activated in response to zzso signals, leading to regulation of diverse zzso zzso There is compelling evidence that persistent zzso of specific zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso possesses zzso properties in a number of human zzso including head and neck zzso The presence of zzso activated zzso molecules in cancer cells is mainly attributed to the zzso of upstream zzso pathways and the aberration of negative regulatory zzso The end result is induction of specific target genes that stimulate cell zzso prevent zzso promote zzso and facilitate tumor immune zzso zzso targeting and disruption of zzso zzso signaling may theoretically be accomplished through various approaches, involving direct zzso interference with the various zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso and indirect strategies zzso zzso of upstream signaling events and enhancement or restoration of negative regulatory zzso The availability of multiple potential targets for interruption of zzso zzso signaling in cancer and the zzso promising results have generated optimism for the clinical zzso of zzso targeting in head and neck cancer, which is the focus of this zzso
