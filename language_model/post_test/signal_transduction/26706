zzso migration of T zzso assures zzso of zzso T cells to secondary zzso zzso and zzso trafficking of zzso T zzso Previous studies carried out in zzso have demonstrated zzso zzso of the expression of zzso receptors such as zzso and zzso however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso expression and turnover in T cells, during advancing age in zzso Our recent results demonstrating increased zzso migration in response to zzso in zzso T cells obtained from the elderly, as compared to those from young donors, led us to zzso that increase in surface zzso because of altered zzso regulation of zzso on T cells during aging, might be directly responsible for increased migration toward zzso Studies presented here demonstrate a significant increase in the surface expression of zzso in zzso T cells from elderly human donors, relative to those from the zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of zzso was zzso regulated during aging, which could be attributed to zzso in the zzso of zzso Thus, altered zzso of zzso may contribute to the increased surface expression and enhanced zzso migration to zzso stimuli in the zzso
