Sonic zzso zzso zzso by the polarizing region at the zzso margin of the chick wing bud is pivotal in patterning the digits but apart from a few key downstream zzso such as zzso which is expressed in the zzso region of the wing that gives rise to the digits, the genes that mediate the response to zzso zzso are not zzso To find genes that are zzso with zzso in the zzso of chick wing buds and regulated in the same way, we used zzso to compare gene expression between anterior and zzso thirds of wing buds from normal chick zzso and from zzso zzso zzso chick zzso which have defective zzso zzso due to lack of primary zzso We identified zzso zzso expressed gene zzso which were then zzso Two clusters contained genes predominantly expressed in zzso thirds of normal wing zzso in one zzso genes including zzso were expressed at high levels in anterior and zzso thirds in zzso wing zzso in the other zzso genes including zzso were expressed at low levels in anterior and zzso thirds in zzso wing zzso zzso patterns of genes in these two clusters were validated in normal and zzso zzso wing buds by in zzso zzso and demonstrated to be responsive to application of zzso zzso of several genes in the zzso cluster was also shown to be responsive to manipulation of protein zzso A zzso activity, thus demonstrating regulation by zzso zzso Genes in the zzso cluster were then zzso by zzso comparison of zzso expression patterns in normal wing buds to produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the zzso region of early chick wing buds together with 6 novel genes which are likely to be functionally related and represent secondary targets of zzso zzso Other groups of zzso genes were also identified, including a group of genes involved in zzso
