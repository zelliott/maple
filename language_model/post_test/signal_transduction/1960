Cell zzso molecules play an important role in the development of the visual zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso that mediates cell zzso and may signal in response to zzso zzso is expressed in the chick zzso during development and promotes zzso outgrowth from retinal zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso form the zzso zzso which is the sole output from the zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso In this study, we observed that zzso expression in zzso zzso occurs as a step zzso with zzso zzso expressing the highest level of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso occurred as a smooth descending zzso from anterior to zzso regions during zzso Because zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso regions, zzso may regulate the formation of zzso projections to the zzso In agreement with this hypothesis, a differential response of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso were unable to extend zzso on zzso compared with zzso of zzso zzso When given a choice between zzso and a second zzso the growth cones of zzso zzso clustered at the zzso border and zzso thus avoiding additional growth on the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso for growth of zzso zzso Finally, application of soluble zzso to retinal cultures resulted in the collapse of zzso but not zzso growth zzso zzso zzso may specifically signal to zzso zzso zzso to cease their forward growth after reaching the anterior zzso thus allowing for subsequent zzso of deeper zzso zzso
