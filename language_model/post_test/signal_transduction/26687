zzso are zzso of skin in zzso and provide a model for analyzing skin zzso zzso The feathers of Chinese zzso zzso and White zzso zzso chickens have distinct zzso Based on preliminary genetic results, we cloned the chicken gene zzso zzso sine zzso binding protein zzso which is expressed at a higher level in the zzso skin and in the feather zzso in the zzso compared with the zzso The zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso indicated that zzso was expressed in many zzso and was continuously expressed during embryonic development in both zzso Northern and Western zzso indicated that the zzso of zzso was approximately 5 zzso and the zzso protein was approximately 96 zzso The expressions of signaling molecules that affect feather development were zzso This study is the first report of zzso expression in zzso Our results suggest that zzso might regulate distinct feather zzso
