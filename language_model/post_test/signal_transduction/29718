zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein that is zzso zzso following the zzso of multiple zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso Its function then is to recruit and activate multiple signaling zzso In our previous work, we showed that zzso enhances cell growth and zzso the transformed zzso in zzso cells downstream of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso In this report, we analyze how it produces these zzso Because zzso is the major binding partner of zzso we zzso its binding site in the zzso zzso zzso This construct was zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or an empty expression zzso zzso Our findings show that after zzso zzso zzso has a higher level of zzso zzso at early time points than zzso zzso recruits more zzso zzso than zzso after zzso zzso which accounts for a higher and more sustained zzso zzso in zzso cells relative to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells demonstrate a higher level of zzso zzso 1 zzso at early time points of zzso zzso However, there was an unexpected decrease in zzso promoter induction in zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso cells show a zzso of the transformed zzso including fewer zzso changes, an increase in stress fiber zzso organization, and a decrease in cell proliferation and zzso independent zzso These results reveal that the zzso interaction is essential for cell growth and transformation but that this must occur through a novel zzso that is independent of zzso zzso or zzso On the basis of its role in growth and zzso the zzso interaction may become an attractive target for the zzso intervention of zzso cell zzso
