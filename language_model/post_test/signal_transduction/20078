Major depressive disorder zzso has caused a substantial burden of disease worldwide with moderate zzso Despite efforts through conducting numerous association studies and now, zzso association zzso studies, the success of identifying zzso zzso for zzso has been zzso which is partially attributed to the complex nature of depression zzso A zzso zzso strategy to investigate the joint effects of various genes within specific biological pathways has emerged as a powerful tool for complex zzso The present study aimed to identify enriched pathways for depression using a zzso zzso for zzso For each zzso we estimated its zzso p value using combined and minimum p value, zzso zzso pathways from the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso We employed four zzso zzso approaches zzso set enrichment analysis, zzso test, zzso zzso zzso We adjusted for multiple testing using zzso & zzso method to report significant zzso We found 17 significantly enriched pathways for depression, which presented zzso zzso The top four pathways were long-term depression zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso molecules zzso In conclusion, our comprehensive zzso analyses identified promising pathways for depression that are related to neurotransmitter and zzso systems, immune system and inflammatory response, which may be involved in the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso We demonstrated that zzso enrichment analysis is promising to facilitate our understanding of complex traits through a deeper interpretation of zzso zzso Application of this comprehensive zzso strategy in upcoming zzso data for depression could validate the findings reported in this zzso
