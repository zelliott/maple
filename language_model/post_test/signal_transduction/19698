zzso zzso are the central signal zzso in bacterial zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso They link the signal input zzso in these zzso that is, the zzso zzso to the output zzso for example, the zzso zzso zzso A similar architecture is present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso where a zzso domain is positioned between the zzso membrane anchor and the zzso zzso zzso Because the activity of the zzso domain responds to zzso in the zzso domain, a method has been developed which uses the zzso domain of zzso as a reporter to probe the zzso domain function of diverse bacterial zzso A strategy for construction of zzso between a variety of zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso are zzso in zzso coli and zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso is determined by a zzso method published earlier in the zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso domain from the zzso protein of zzso zzso are shown as an example for the successful application of the zzso
