Target zzso and large-scale zzso analyses of tobacco zzso zzso zzso Bright zzso zzso cells were employed to identify novel zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso function in zzso At the zzso level, we describe the specific zzso of several zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, global gene expression analysis of zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso containing expressed sequence tags zzso from zzso cells revealed 828 genes that were zzso by zzso treatment within 48 zzso Using zzso expression data we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso that was zzso in a close zzso pattern with the core zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco zzso cells caused zzso of specific zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso transgenic lines revealed that a limited number of zzso including PAL and zzso were specifically induced in the presence of the zzso zzso These results, together with results of both zzso expression analysis and of gel mobility shift zzso strongly indicate that the zzso protein functions in tobacco zzso signal zzso inducing zzso zzso genes and the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso
