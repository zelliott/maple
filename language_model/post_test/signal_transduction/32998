We have isolated, from canine pancreatic juice, two zzso proteins with zzso activity that had zzso sequence zzso with canine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso In this study we have obtained evidence that zzso activity is an intrinsic property of pancreatic zzso zzso pancreatic zzso from zzso or zzso Mannheim was zzso into several zzso by reverse phase high performance liquid zzso They were tested for stimulation of zzso release from zzso neuroendocrine zzso tumor cell line zzso and zzso cells enriched zzso cell preparations isolated from rat upper small zzso Each zzso preparation was found to contain several components of zzso zzso Each zzso fraction was zzso to zzso by zzso and then subjected to mass spectral analysis and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso It was found that the fraction with highest zzso activity also had the highest zzso activity and the same Mr as zzso pancreatic zzso Moreover, it also had the same zzso zzso acid sequence (up to 30 zzso zzso as that of zzso pancreatic zzso suggesting that it was identical to the zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso also zzso zzso release zzso from both zzso cells and a zzso cell preparation enriched in zzso zzso cells isolated from rat zzso zzso of the zzso activity by zzso with zzso zzso did not affect its zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso pancreatic zzso on zzso zzso from zzso cells was inhibited by an zzso zzso channel blocker, by zzso of protein zzso C or by zzso of the cell with zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso pancreatic zzso possesses an intrinsic zzso activity that was independent of its zzso zzso This action is zzso zzso and is in part dependent on zzso influx through the zzso channel and zzso of protein zzso zzso
