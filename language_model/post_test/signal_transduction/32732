zzso formation in zzso is initiated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso This zzso is activated in fish melanoma as well as in a zzso cell line zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to define the underlying signaling zzso triggered by the activated zzso zzso we attempted to identify its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for putative zzso zzso sites revealed the presence of potential binding motifs for zzso as well as for zzso zzso of these zzso proteins to the zzso zzso was detected in zzso and in cells expressing the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso interactions with the zzso could be disrupted individually by zzso peptides containing putative zzso zzso sites, indicating direct binding of both zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso activated zzso zzso led to strong zzso zzso zzso in zzso melanoma zzso We also identified a zzso binding site for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Competition experiments with zzso zzso this site confirmed that it is used for zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso in melanoma zzso Thus, zzso can initiate different signaling pathways by using multiple zzso sites to trigger proliferation of zzso zzso
