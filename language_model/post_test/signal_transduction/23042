Single zzso zzso were incorporated into each of three zzso segments that play key roles in the structural transition of zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso to the active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to monitor changes in a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Steady state zzso changes resulting from zzso binding were used to calculate binding zzso and to detect the structural zzso that coordinate reactions at active sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso state zzso of zzso and zzso complex formation were determined from zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the formation of the zzso complex were consistent with a model with two or more steps in which rapid equilibrium binding of zzso is followed by a slow zzso zzso This zzso is ascribed to the closing of the zzso flexible loop and is likely the zzso step in the reaction of zzso with zzso The zzso state zzso for binding zzso to the zzso zzso zzso complex could also be fit to a model involving rapid equilibrium binding of zzso followed by an zzso zzso zzso The changes monitored by zzso account for the zzso between zzso zzso structures determined previously by X-ray zzso and define an intermediate zzso zzso
