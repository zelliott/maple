We review zzso the definition of the zzso zzso site in human zzso and zzso together with the new zzso findings of the assembly of zzso zzso components and the signal zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso is associated with multiple interrelated signaling zzso Upon cell zzso the second zzso act on the assembly of zzso zzso zzso The zzso components are first zzso and then associated with the membrane zzso Small zzso proteins and zzso components also participate in the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso findings demonstrate that the zzso generated by zzso zzso activity is initially localized in distinct types of zzso zzso and not at the plasma membrane as previously zzso Thus, the assembly of zzso zzso components possibly occurs at the limiting membrane of the zzso zzso The zzso compartments mobilize and become associated with the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation with soluble stimulants, or fuse to zzso upon stimulation with particulate zzso zzso zzso is released to the zzso space and into zzso in proportion to the zzso zzso zzso association with the plasma membrane and with the zzso zzso zzso
