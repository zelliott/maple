zzso zzso along zzso fibers provide a primary zzso for the formation of cortical zzso To examine the mechanisms underlying zzso migration, we analyzed the dynamics of zzso and signaling components in living zzso zzso involves the coordinated zzso movement of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso with the zzso moving forward before nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso cage, zzso zzso and zzso away from the zzso and zzso zzso motion and zzso zzso Thus, we propose that during zzso migration the zzso acts to coordinate zzso dynamics in response to zzso zzso
