The receptors for the two structurally related zzso hormones zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso share approximately zzso sequence identity and demonstrate complete specificity for their zzso zzso while utilizing similar second zzso zzso In the current study zzso zzso receptors were prepared, and the effect of zzso on zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso consisting of the first 132 zzso acids of the external zzso zzso domain bound zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso However, for zzso zzso to zzso production it was necessary to extend the zzso into the first zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso which included part of zzso zzso demonstrated binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to the wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while devoid of zzso zzso zzso were capable of zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not completely dependent on high affinity zzso zzso These data clearly demonstrate that the zzso domain of the zzso zzso acts as the zzso binding domain and that the first zzso domain is important for zzso zzso
