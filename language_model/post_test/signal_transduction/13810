As the newest plant hormone, zzso research is undergoing an exciting zzso In less than five years, roles for zzso have been defined in shoot zzso secondary growth, root growth and zzso to add to the growing understanding of their role in zzso zzso and zzso weed zzso zzso are particularly fascinating as signaling molecules as they can act both inside the plant as an zzso hormone and in the soil as a zzso zzso Our recent research has highlighted such a dual role for zzso potentially acting as both an zzso and zzso signal for zzso zzso zzso There is also significant interest in examining zzso as putative regulators of responses to environmental zzso especially the response to zzso zzso given the strong regulation of zzso production by nitrate and zzso observed in many zzso In particular, the potential for zzso to mediate the ecologically important response of zzso colonization to zzso has been widely zzso However, using a zzso approach we found that zzso are not essential for zzso regulation of zzso colonization or zzso This is consistent with the relatively mild impairment of zzso control of zzso root growth observed in zzso zzso zzso This contrasts with the major role for zzso in zzso control of shoot branching of rice and zzso and indicates that the integration of zzso into our understanding of zzso response will be zzso New data presented here, along with the recent discovery of zzso specific zzso zzso indicates a potential role for zzso a component of the zzso of zzso pathway, in zzso control of zzso
