A critical process during zzso development of the T cell repertoire is the induction of zzso zzso in developing T cells is highly dependent on zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso development in turn requires signals from mature zzso zzso a zzso relationship termed zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso zzso zzso which mediate negative selection and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso in the zzso and are necessary for zzso zzso Combined absence of zzso and zzso results in profound zzso in zzso development comparable to that observed in the absence of zzso zzso This requirement for zzso signaling is maintained even in a zzso transgenic model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maturing in the altered zzso zzso environment of zzso knockout mice are highly zzso in zzso and are lethal in zzso adoptive transfer in zzso demonstrating a critical role for these zzso pathways in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso between zzso and zzso pathways is required for normal zzso zzso and for maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso
