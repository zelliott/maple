zzso monoxide zzso is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic zzso in the treatment of patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress zzso No study has assessed the effects of CO on zzso zzso transport and zzso fluid zzso two key aspects of zzso barrier function that are zzso in acute lung zzso respiratory distress zzso Both CO gas zzso zzso and CO donated by the CO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso lining zzso applied to healthy, isolated, zzso and zzso rabbit zzso significantly blocked zzso clearance from the zzso zzso and blocked zzso fluid zzso after fluid zzso zzso application of two CO donors, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso currents in zzso human zzso zzso cells and primary rat zzso type II cells by up to zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, the CO effect was localized to zzso channels on the zzso zzso This effect was abolished by zzso a scavenger of zzso and was not observed when inactive forms of CO donors were zzso The effects of CO were not blocked by zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso blue and zzso or zzso of trafficking events zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso affinity of zzso cells was reduced after CO zzso These data indicate that CO rapidly zzso sodium zzso across the airway zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms, which may rely on critical zzso zzso in zzso channels or associated regulatory proteins on the zzso surface of lung zzso zzso
