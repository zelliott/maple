zzso a cholesterol-lowering agent, has demonstrated zzso effects against brain injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso 4 zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso related signaling zzso and secondary brain injury in rats after traumatic brain injury zzso Adult male zzso rats were divided into four groups: zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso and zzso zzso group zzso Right zzso cortical zzso was made by using a zzso zzso In zzso group, zzso was administered orally at a dose of zzso zzso at 1 and 6 h after zzso Brain samples were extracted at 24 h after zzso As a result, we found that treatment with zzso markedly inhibited the zzso and protein expressions of zzso zzso and the downstream inflammatory agents, such as zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso following zzso significantly ameliorated the secondary brain damage, such as cortical zzso brain zzso zzso barrier zzso zzso and motor zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso administration may zzso zzso inflammatory response in the injured rat brain, and this may be one mechanism by which zzso improves outcome following zzso
