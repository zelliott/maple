zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso normally present in lungs and other zzso zzso pulmonary arteries zzso in different species, whereas the underlying mechanisms are still not fully zzso The aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate the signal zzso of zzso in the relaxation of isolated rat PA zzso The zzso tension of the rings was studied in zzso with zzso zzso In zzso zzso rings, zzso zzso zzso relaxation after the rings were zzso by zzso A similar effect, though smaller, was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso zzso of PA zzso The zzso zzso was markedly reduced by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, which was seen in zzso rings, but not in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso increased the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso but did not affect the overall expression of zzso In zzso rings, the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso channel inhibitor zzso almost totally abolished the zzso effect of zzso The results suggested that the zzso effect of zzso on rat zzso is zzso by both vascular zzso and smooth muscle, involving respectively the zzso zzso and the zzso channel zzso
