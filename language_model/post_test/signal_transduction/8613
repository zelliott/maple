zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor 2 zzso elicit cellular responses via zzso of protein zzso and zzso We have reported that the zzso and zzso pathways are critical for zzso and zzso zzso zzso artery zzso zzso cell zzso We have also shown that protein zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso we investigated if protein zzso 2 zzso modulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso specifically targeting human zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was used to suppress zzso expression in zzso zzso When compared with scrambled zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso protein levels zzso zzso and activity zzso zzso without altering protein levels of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso oxide zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso rapidly zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso whereas inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and slightly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not significantly affect zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Thus, suppression of zzso alone zzso modulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso without altering zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso These data also suggest that signaling molecules other than zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important zzso for zzso and zzso zzso cell proliferation after zzso zzso
