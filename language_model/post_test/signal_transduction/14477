The innate immune response of zzso zzso to spores, the environmentally acquired form of zzso zzso is poorly zzso We therefore examined the early zzso zzso response to zzso zzso spores, before zzso zzso were exposed to zzso and spores of zzso strain zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was measured by real-time zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso spore layer was retained zzso or removed by zzso zzso zzso consistently induced a strong zzso response, with the zzso spores zzso a two- to zzso response than zzso zzso The threshold for zzso zzso production by zzso zzso was significantly lower than that required for tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso production was largely dependent on zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso however, the expression of beta zzso in zzso zzso suggests involvement of a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso the zzso zzso spore is not zzso inert, zzso the zzso masks zzso recognized by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso involves multiple pattern recognition receptors and signaling zzso and zzso compared to other zzso zzso is expressed at a lower spore zzso
