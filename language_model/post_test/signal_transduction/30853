zzso signaling is required for zzso acid zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and cell zzso but the mechanism is not well zzso In this study, zzso is found to cause zzso zzso with sustained association of zzso to zzso or zzso leading to a zzso zzso of zzso and binding to zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was found to function as a critical component of zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso parental cells, zzso zzso zzso cells failed to show zzso and consequential zzso and zzso zzso failed to accumulate zzso zzso that control zzso transition, and failed to differentiate and arrest in response to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso signaling and caused accelerated zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso expression in response to zzso whereas zzso of zzso or zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso diminished zzso zzso expression and attenuated differentiation and growth zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso the zzso active domain, in the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso and the ability to differentiate and arrest, indicating that zzso effects zzso signaling by zzso to propel zzso Taken together, zzso zzso cell differentiation and growth arrest through zzso of a novel zzso zzso with zzso as a critical component in a positive feedback mechanism that may contribute to the prolonged zzso signaling zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso
