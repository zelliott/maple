Both the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of a variety of human zzso zzso tumor zzso has been achieved both zzso and clinically with a number of strategies that antagonize either zzso zzso Here we constructed and produced two fully human zzso zzso zzso zzso that target both zzso and zzso using two zzso human zzso originally isolated from a zzso display zzso The zzso not only retained the zzso binding capacity of each of the parent zzso but also were capable of binding to both targets simultaneously as demonstrated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effectively blocked both zzso zzso and zzso from binding to their respective zzso and inhibited tumor cell proliferation as zzso as a combination of both the parent zzso More importantly, the zzso were able to completely block zzso of several major signal zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso whereas each individual parent zzso was only effective in zzso those signal molecules activated by the relevant single growth zzso The zzso molecules retained good zzso binding activity after incubation with mouse serum at 37 degrees C for up to 6 zzso Taken together, our results underscore the benefits of simultaneous targeting multiple growth factor zzso pathways for more zzso cancer zzso This report describes the first time use of a zzso zzso for targeting two zzso molecules on either a single or adjacent tumor cells for enhanced zzso zzso
