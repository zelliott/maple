We investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso water zzso which have long been used to treat zzso zzso The activity of the extracts was characterized in a transient zzso system, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasmids in zzso zzso zzso The extract activated both and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the effects were zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the extracts increased expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and expression of zzso zzso was decreased in zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso water extracts showed zzso effects and may be a potential clinical application for treatment of zzso related vascular zzso
