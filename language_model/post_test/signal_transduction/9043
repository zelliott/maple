zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two major plant hormones that zzso regulate plant development and tolerance to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso induce the expression of several zzso zzso while blocking either signaling zzso zzso the induction of these genes by zzso and zzso alone or in zzso However, the molecular basis of zzso zzso and signaling zzso is largely zzso Here, we report that two zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso integrate zzso and zzso signaling in the regulation of gene zzso root development, and zzso pathogen zzso Further studies reveal that zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso by removal of zzso domain zzso zzso which physically interact with and repress zzso In addition, we find that zzso proteins recruit an zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso zzso zzso Our studies identify zzso as a key integration zzso whose zzso requires both zzso and zzso zzso and illustrate zzso zzso as a common mechanism to integrate diverse signaling pathways in the regulation of plant development and zzso
