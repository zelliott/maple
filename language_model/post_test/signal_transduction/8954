Over the last decade, accumulating data have demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso molecules on zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso It is now clear that through these zzso zzso zzso can serve two zzso one is to elaborate and relay zzso initiated at the plasma zzso and the other is to initiate new zzso in response to stimuli originating from the zzso zzso Here, we have examined this emerging zzso with particular emphasis on a novel zzso zzso zzso This system zzso and is activated by, zzso zzso zzso that arrive at the zzso complex during zzso zzso these bind to the zzso zzso and activate the zzso family zzso zzso in turn, positively regulate the zzso transport zzso This system thus coordinates the initiating process, the membrane zzso with an increased membrane zzso In more general terms, it responds with signals to an zzso zzso In this respect, it is similar to the unfolded protein response, a complex cell reaction to the zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso that is, to our knowledge the only other examples of zzso zzso initiated within the zzso However, in contrast to the zzso zzso pathway, this unfolded protein zzso is generally activated by pathological zzso We propose that zzso zzso is a mechanism by which different compartments of zzso cells coordinate their zzso
