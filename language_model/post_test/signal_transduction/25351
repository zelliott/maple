zzso represent the first defense line against bacterial infection and therefore, play a crucial role in early inflammatory zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso zzso in regulation of an early inflammatory response in zzso zzso zzso zzso We induced the inflammatory response by treating the zzso with zzso and inhibited an early inflammatory response by using zzso a zzso zzso of dietary zzso degradation that we found previously to exert its beneficial zzso effects during the early phase of in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and nitrogen species zzso were reduced by zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso protected zzso against zzso rapid and massive membrane zzso zzso induced early suppression of zzso which was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso By reversing zzso early suppression of zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso exerts its early zzso effect by preserving the zzso membrane integrity and shifting the expression of zzso forward in time in zzso
