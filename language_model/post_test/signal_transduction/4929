zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most frequent zzso in patients with acute zzso zzso zzso that zzso a poor zzso zzso active zzso zzso tandem zzso zzso define a promising target for therapeutic approaches using small zzso zzso However, several point zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso have been identified to mediate resistance towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including secondary zzso of zzso We investigated the cellular effects of the recently zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso with or without additional point zzso of the zzso including the (so far) zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively induced zzso not only in the parental zzso cell line but also in all zzso zzso zzso zzso additional zzso point zzso zzso zzso or zzso These observations correlated with a strong zzso of zzso and its downstream targets zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso We conclude that zzso represents a promising zzso that should be further investigated in clinical zzso The targeted therapy of zzso zzso with zzso might be associated with a lower frequency of secondary resistance caused by acquired zzso zzso
