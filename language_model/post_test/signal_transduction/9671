The zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the stringent response in zzso zzso and genetic studies of this response in zzso coli have shown that the zzso of zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is activated in response to zzso acid zzso and zzso responds to zzso physical stress beside nutritional zzso All zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso Further, novel zzso zzso zzso designated small zzso zzso zzso were recently identified in a subset of bacteria, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and were shown to consist only of a zzso zzso zzso Studies suggest that these zzso proteins contribute to zzso zzso in response to stressful conditions in a manner distinct from that of zzso zzso zzso proteins currently appear to always occur in addition to zzso zzso in various combinations but never zzso zzso have also been identified in zzso zzso of zzso zzso that originated from zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso are exclusively zzso in nuclear DNA and targeted into zzso The findings suggest that zzso may regulate zzso functions similar to those regulated in bacteria, including zzso and zzso In addition, a novel zzso zzso that is regulated by zzso as a result of the presence of two zzso motifs at its zzso zzso was recently identified in zzso of land zzso This finding indicates the existence of a direct connection between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso The new observations with regard to zzso zzso in land plants suggest that such zzso contributes to the regulation of a wider range of cellular functions than previously zzso
