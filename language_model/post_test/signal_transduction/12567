Each of the five cellular layers of the cerebral zzso is composed of a specific number of a single zzso zzso of projection zzso The projection zzso class is defined by its unique zzso and zzso projections to other areas of the zzso zzso cell populations lining the embryonic lateral zzso produce the projection zzso The mechanisms regulating precursor cell proliferation also regulate total numbers of zzso produced at specific zzso periods and destined to a specific zzso zzso Because the newborn zzso migrate relatively long distances to reach their final layer destinations, it is often assumed that the mechanisms governing acquisition of zzso zzso many of which become evident after zzso production, are independent of the mechanisms governing zzso zzso We review evidence that suggests that the two mechanisms might be linked via operations of zzso and zzso molecules known to regulate precursor cell proliferation and zzso zzso
