The zzso of two zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso status of zzso electron transport zzso in tobacco zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso tobacco plants, which expressed respectively the zzso coli zzso and spinach zzso zzso in zzso and showed increased tolerance to zzso stress, were used for evaluation of the relationship between zzso zzso or change of zzso status of PET and zzso induction under zzso stress zzso There was no difference in the increase in the transcript level of zzso in the first 1 h after zzso with high-intensity light between the zzso and either of the transgenic zzso The transcript level of zzso in the zzso showed a steady gradual increase during the next 5 zzso while that in the transgenic plants during this period was zzso The zzso level of zzso plants increased after 1 zzso while those of transgenic plants remained zzso The decrease in zzso value in all types of plants occurred earlier than the increase in zzso zzso These results indicate that the induction of zzso expression is caused by a zzso change in zzso probably through the zzso pool at an early stage and thereafter by an increase in the cellular zzso zzso
