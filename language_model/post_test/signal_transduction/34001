Cancer is a complex process in which the abnormalities of many genes appear to be zzso The zzso patterns of gene zzso may reveal the functional relations between genes and pathways in zzso as well as identify targets for zzso We examined the patterns of zzso zzso of zzso from zzso of zzso zzso in Cancer zzso a large-scale database curated by the zzso Trust zzso zzso The frequently zzso genes are well-known zzso and tumor zzso that are involved in generic processes of zzso control, signal zzso and stress zzso These zzso of gene zzso are zzso when the zzso from different zzso are zzso zzso in genes functioning in different pathways can occur in the same cancer zzso zzso whereas those in genes functioning in the same zzso are rarely zzso in the same zzso This observation supports the view of zzso as derived from a process like zzso zzso However, certain zzso zzso patterns violate these simple rules and demonstrate zzso zzso For instance, zzso of genes in the Ras and zzso pathways tend to zzso in the large zzso but are mutually exclusive in zzso of the zzso The relationships between zzso in different samples of a cancer can also reveal the zzso orders of zzso zzso In addition, the observed zzso patterns suggest candidates of new zzso targets that can either reveal novel patterns or validate the predictions deduced from existing zzso These zzso zzso patterns provide guiding information for the ongoing cancer zzso zzso
