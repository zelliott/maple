The zzso surface protein C zzso is a major zzso of zzso pneumoniae, the cause of zzso pneumonia and invasive zzso zzso interacts in a zzso manner with the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by respiratory zzso zzso By adopting the retrograde machinery of human zzso this zzso interaction promotes colonization and zzso across the zzso zzso Here, we explored the role of zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso for zzso of zzso via the human zzso zzso experiments suggested that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for this zzso zzso zzso By using specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso and zzso are involved in zzso invasion of zzso into host zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated during zzso of zzso In addition, zzso and zzso are essential for zzso of zzso by respiratory zzso cells via the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was activated during the infection zzso Moreover, zzso zzso upon zzso invasion depends on zzso In conclusion, our results illustrate for the first time key signaling molecules of host cells that are required for zzso invasion of zzso into zzso zzso This unique and specific bacterial entry process is dependent on the cooperation and zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso
