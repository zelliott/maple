We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso 1 zzso expression and activity are zzso by zzso zzso zzso in a skeletal muscle model system and in zzso obesity in zzso however, potential functions and in zzso relevance of this have not been zzso Here, we aimed to determine the mechanism by which PAL regulates zzso in muscle, and to determine potential roles for its product, zzso zzso in muscle biology in the context of zzso Cloning and analysis of the mouse zzso promoter revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso of a reporter under control of the zzso zzso direct interaction of zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso PAL treatment induced the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner dependent on zzso and this was attenuated by zzso of the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso obesity in mice demonstrated that zzso expression in muscle, but not zzso zzso increased in zzso but this was attenuated in zzso zzso Moreover, plasma zzso levels were significantly decreased in obese zzso mice relative to obese wild type mice, and muscle, but not zzso tissue zzso signaling was zzso These data indicate that zzso regulates zzso expression in the context of fatty acid zzso and links PAL to muscle zzso zzso Moreover, this function of zzso in zzso obesity suggests a potential role for zzso in zzso pathological zzso
