The components of the zzso current in zzso zzso of zzso have different physical and pharmacological properties, indicating the operation of different zzso zzso We investigated whether these pathways are activated by different zzso An zzso directed against the zzso sequence zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso which is present in zzso zzso was injected into the zzso zzso of zzso This zzso mediates the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso into the zzso blocked the second component of the zzso current in zzso zzso zzso but the other components could still be zzso The results support our earlier hypothesis that the zzso pathways of the current components are selectively activated by different zzso
