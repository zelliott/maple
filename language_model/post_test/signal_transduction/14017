Growing evidence from zzso studies indicates the association between zzso arthritis zzso and zzso However, the exact mechanism for this association is still unclear zzso We consider that the strong association between both diseases may be caused by shared genetic zzso We performed a zzso analysis of large-scale zzso zzso association studies zzso zzso with zzso cases and zzso controls of European zzso Meanwhile, we evaluated our findings using previously identified zzso zzso zzso interaction network and previous results from zzso analysis of zzso and other zzso diseases zzso We confirmed four pathways including zzso zzso interaction, zzso zzso T cell zzso signaling and Cell zzso zzso Meanwhile, we highlighted for the first time the involvement of zzso and zzso immune network for zzso production pathways in zzso Our results may explain the strong association between zzso and zzso which may be caused by the shared genetic zzso We believe that our results will be helpful for future genetic studies in zzso zzso and may significantly assist in the development of therapeutic zzso
