We investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso type 6 zzso a major form of zzso expressed in zzso heart, on G zzso zzso regulation of zzso production in zzso rat zzso zzso Following gene transfer of zzso zzso and zzso increases in zzso were markedly zzso whereas zzso levels of zzso and responses to several other zzso that stimulate zzso formation, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso Studies to test whether the selective enhancement in zzso zzso zzso response might result from zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin treatment failed to reveal an enhancement by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of membrane zzso indicated that zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso enriched in zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that loss of zzso zzso is not the mechanism for enhancement of zzso zzso formation and that key components of zzso zzso of zzso exist in zzso of cardiac zzso providing a means by which zzso response is selectively enhanced by increasing zzso zzso
