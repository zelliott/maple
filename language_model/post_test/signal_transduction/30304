zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, which zzso the zzso of zzso to form zzso has been identified as a potential target for type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso zzso of zzso would be expected to reduce de zzso zzso synthesis and increase zzso zzso Treatment of zzso mice with compound zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor with an zzso of 23 zzso against zzso resulted in a reduction of serum zzso and zzso zzso However, compound zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso an inactive zzso of zzso zzso with approximately zzso less activity against zzso also caused a similar reduction in zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso effects in zzso mice may be zzso by other zzso pathways independent of zzso zzso To characterize the pharmacological activity of these experimental compounds at a zzso level, rats were orally zzso for 3 days with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and gene expression analysis was zzso Gene expression analysis of zzso showed that treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in gene expression profiles highly similar to known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that, in zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso These results were further supported by both an in zzso zzso evaluation using rat zzso and zzso evaluation using zzso zzso membrane zzso Overall, the gene expression analysis suggests a plausible mechanism for the similar pharmacological findings with active and inactive zzso of an zzso zzso
