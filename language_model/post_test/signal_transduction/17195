zzso B virus X protein zzso has been shown to induce zzso by zzso the functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso known as a zzso zzso has been reported to have paradoxical function, that is, acting as an zzso particularly when expressed in the zzso The effects of zzso on the expression and function of zzso also remain zzso 

We attempted to investigate the role of zzso in the zzso process, focusing on the association with this paradoxical function of zzso The results obtained were further verified with experiments using the zzso action of zzso zzso 

zzso transgenic mice zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined by Western zzso analysis and zzso 

zzso and zzso cells exhibited increased expression of zzso zzso of zzso was positively correlated with the expression of zzso D1 and inactive zzso of zzso protein zzso These zzso cell zzso responses were zzso by zzso of zzso which resulted in growth reduction in zzso cells, suggesting the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso was zzso Finally, zzso zzso liver, as well as zzso cells, showed a shift of zzso zzso to the nucleus, accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suppressed these molecular events by shifting zzso to the zzso
