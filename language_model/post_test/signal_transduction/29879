zzso serves as the primary cellular defense against zzso damage by converting zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso A unique characteristic of this zzso zzso zzso is the conservation from bacteria to man of a rapidly formed product inhibited zzso Using zzso zzso we have generated an active site zzso zzso of human zzso which exhibits significantly reduced product zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso causes zzso effects in zzso and zzso effects in zzso Our results provide a zzso basis for the zzso zzso nature of position zzso and the evolutionary conservation of product zzso These data also provide more direct zzso evidence for the signaling role associated with zzso
