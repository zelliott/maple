zzso and zzso II zzso zzso 2 active components isolated from zzso zzso have a closely structural zzso There is evidence that zzso may be useful in the treatment of zzso dysfunction zzso however, the study on the therapeutic efficacy of zzso II on zzso is currently zzso We investigated the effects of zzso II on improving zzso function of rats with zzso zzso Fifty zzso zzso rats were randomly distributed into normal control and diabetic zzso Diabetes was induced by a one-time zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso Three days later, the diabetic rats were randomly divided into 4 groups including a zzso zzso arm and 3 zzso zzso models zzso 5, and 10 zzso After 3 months, penile zzso was measured by cavernous nerve zzso zzso with real time zzso pressure zzso zzso were harvested with subsequent zzso examination zzso red zzso Hart zzso zzso and zzso zzso and Western blots to explore the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso Diabetes significantly attenuated zzso responses to zzso zzso rats had decreased corpus zzso smooth zzso ratio and zzso cell content relative to the control zzso The ratio of collagen I to III was significantly lower in the zzso of diabetic zzso zzso cavernous elastic fibers were fragmented in the diabetic zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and vascular zzso growth factor were expressed at lower levels in the diabetic zzso zzso zzso diabetic rats had higher expression in the zzso relative to zzso diabetic zzso Both the zzso tissue growth factor zzso signaling zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso II treatment zzso zzso impairment of penile zzso likely by increasing smooth muscle, zzso function, and zzso zzso zzso II could alter corpus zzso zzso pathological structure in diabetic rats, which could be regulated by the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
