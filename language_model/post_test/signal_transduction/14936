zzso II plays a key role in the regulation of body fluid zzso To correct body fluid deficits that occur during zzso an animal needs to zzso both water and zzso Thus, it is not surprising that zzso II, which is zzso in response to zzso acts centrally to increase both water and zzso zzso Here, we review findings relating to the properties of zzso II receptors that give rise to changes in zzso Data are described to suggest that divergent signal zzso pathways are responsible for zzso zzso responses to zzso II, and a hypothesis is proposed to explain how this divergence may map onto neural circuits in the zzso
