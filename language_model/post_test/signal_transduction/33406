The zzso family protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in T cells and perform crucial functions involved in the initiation of T cell zzso zzso zzso signal zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso and zzso regulate zzso signaling are still not completely zzso One important question is whether zzso and zzso have specific targets or only provide functional zzso during zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso plays a major role in the zzso zzso of the zzso chain and the zzso zzso In an effort to identify the targets that are specifically regulated by zzso we have studied the zzso zzso of zzso a recently discovered new member of the focal zzso zzso family zzso We demonstrated that zzso was rapidly zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was selectively dependent on zzso but not zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso with zzso but not zzso resulted in substantial increases in zzso zzso zzso The selective regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso correlated with the preferential zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a specific target regulated by zzso during zzso zzso
