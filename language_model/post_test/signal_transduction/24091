The real-time observation of cell movement in brain slice preparations reveals that in the developing brain, zzso zzso alter their shape zzso with changes in the mode, direction, zzso and rate of migration as they traverse different cortical zzso Although it has been hypothesized that orchestrated activities of multiple external cues and zzso contact are essential for controlling the zzso changes in cell migration, signaling mechanisms and external guidance cues related to the zzso of zzso cell migration remain to be zzso In this article, we will first review recent studies on zzso changes in zzso cell behavior through different migratory zzso of the developing zzso zzso We will then present possible roles for the coordinated activity of zzso channels, zzso type of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fluctuations in controlling zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we will discuss the crucial roles of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in providing directional cues promoting zzso cell migration from the external zzso layer zzso to the internal zzso layer zzso Finally, we will demonstrate that zzso zzso controls the migration of zzso cells in a cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell movement near the birthplace within the zzso but significantly slows down the movement near their final destination within the zzso
