The vascular system is the first organ to form in the developing zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso is an zzso zzso signaling mechanism essential for proper embryonic development in almost all zzso zzso The analysis of targeted mouse zzso has demonstrated essential roles of the zzso signaling zzso in embryonic vascular zzso However, zzso zzso mice have so far not been examined in detail in the head zzso The zzso genes zzso and zzso are essential zzso for zzso zzso which regulate the maintenance of zzso cells and the timing of their differentiation in various zzso and zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited defective vascular zzso in the zzso In addition, zzso identity of zzso cells was partially lost in the brain of these zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso regulate vascular zzso and zzso fate zzso of zzso cells in the development of the zzso zzso and zzso represent critical zzso of zzso signals in brain vascular zzso
