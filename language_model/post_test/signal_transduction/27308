One problem in motor control concerns the mechanism zzso the central nervous system translates the motor cortical command zzso in cell activity into a coordinated contraction of limb muscles to generate a desired motor zzso This problem is closely related to the design of zzso systems that transform zzso signals chronically recorded from the motor zzso into the zzso appropriate motor output of zzso prosthetic zzso In this study we demonstrated how this transformation can be carried out by an artificial neural network using as command signals the actual impulse activity obtained from recordings in the motor zzso of monkeys during the performance of a task that required the exertion of force in different zzso The network receives zzso measured brain signals and zzso them into motor actions of a simulated zzso that mimics the zzso zzso The zzso responds to the motor cortical commands with surprising zzso generating forces in close quantitative agreement with those exerted by trained zzso in both the zzso and spatial zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso motor output may be controlled by the impulse activity of as few as 15 motor cortical zzso These results outline a potentially zzso zzso scheme that zzso raw zzso signals to drive artificial mechanical zzso
