zzso plays a critical role in multiple pathological zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso such as the formation of zzso plaques from zzso zzso production and zzso via zzso zzso precursor protein turnover and enhancing the activity of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system also contributes to zzso zzso and the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso because induction of zzso enhances the clearance of both soluble and zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in controlling protein zzso and zzso regulates zzso zzso of zzso by zzso improves cognitive deficits and zzso zzso pathology and zzso by increasing zzso Several zzso signaling components may be potential zzso of cognitive impairment in the clinical diagnosis of zzso Thus, zzso agents through the control of zzso protein degradation are emerging as an important therapeutic target for zzso
