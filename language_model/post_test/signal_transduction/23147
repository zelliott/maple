zzso coupled receptors zzso are the most important class of current pharmacological zzso However, it is now widely acknowledged that their regulation is more complex than previously thought: the evidence that zzso can couple to several zzso zzso and the existence of biased zzso able to activate them zzso has introduced a new level of complexity in zzso drug zzso Considering bias represents a challenge for the research of new zzso zzso because it demands a detailed characterization of compound properties for several zzso zzso Still, biased zzso could provide an opportunity to zzso zzso function in a finer way and to separate therapeutic from side zzso Nowadays, a variety of zzso for zzso have been zzso which differ in their ability to promote zzso zzso to different zzso families or even zzso recruit signal zzso such as zzso activate a variety of downstream molecular pathways and induce certain zzso signatures or gene expression zzso In this review, we will cover some of the experimental techniques currently used to understand and characterize biased zzso and discuss their strengths and zzso Additionally, we will comment on the zzso efforts that are being devoted to study zzso bias and on the potential they hold for zzso its structural zzso Finally, we will discuss which of these strategies could be used for the rational design of biased zzso and give some examples of the potential therapeutic value of this class of zzso
