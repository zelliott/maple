During the development of the zzso zzso junction zzso motor zzso tips stop growing after zzso muscle and transform into zzso terminals that zzso the neurotransmitter zzso and activate zzso zzso receptors zzso to trigger muscle zzso The zzso signaling that zzso zzso growth to facilitate stable zzso interaction and zzso is poorly zzso In this paper, we report a novel function of zzso signaling by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso a zzso transition in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso growth speed was zzso after contact with muscle, when compared with before zzso but when cultures were exposed to the zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso touching muscle grew zzso faster than their counterparts in control zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression using zzso or the forced expression of zzso inactive zzso in zzso also resulted in faster than normal zzso advance after contact with muscle zzso zzso interference with zzso by each of these methods also led to reduced zzso zzso at zzso sites in muscle, indicating that disruption of zzso zzso signaling inhibited zzso zzso We thus propose that zzso slowing of zzso growth enables the establishment of stable zzso contacts that develop into zzso
