We have previously shown that transforming growth zzso zzso play a critical role in zzso inflammation and zzso However, zzso effects of zzso limit their therapeutic zzso Recently, emerging roles of long zzso zzso zzso in diseases have been zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso sequencing to identify the zzso zzso related to zzso inflammation and zzso in zzso knockout mouse models of unilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso basement membrane zzso Compared with zzso mice, 151 zzso in the unilateral zzso zzso zzso kidney and 413 zzso in zzso with zzso basement membrane zzso were significantly altered in zzso knockout zzso Among them, 21 common zzso were zzso in zzso but zzso in zzso zzso zzso in both disease models in which progressive zzso inflammation and zzso were abolished when the zzso gene was deleted or zzso zzso zzso confirmed these findings and revealed the functional link between zzso zzso zzso and progressive kidney zzso zzso demonstrate that the identification and characterization of functional zzso associated with kidney disease may represent a promising research direction into zzso disorder and may lead to the development of new zzso therapies for kidney zzso
