The origin of the zzso cells responsible for the zzso zzso in systemic sclerosis zzso has not been fully zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate whether zzso zzso cells may emerge through zzso of zzso cells zzso into zzso via zzso transition zzso in zzso and to explore the signaling pathways involved in this zzso 

zzso mouse pulmonary zzso isolated by zzso methods with sequential zzso and zzso zzso selection were cultured in zzso Cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed their zzso zzso The induction of zzso was assessed by determination of zzso muscle zzso zzso type I zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The signaling pathways involved were examined using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso growth factor zzso zzso induced zzso and type I collagen expression and inhibited zzso These effects were zzso by a marked increase in zzso expression and were abolished by treatment with either the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These observations were confirmed in experiments using small interfering zzso specific for zzso and zzso 

These results indicate that zzso and zzso are crucial for zzso zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso or similar zzso inhibitor molecules may be effective therapeutic agents for zzso and other zzso zzso in which zzso plays a zzso zzso
