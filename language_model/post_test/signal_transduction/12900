zzso zzso zzso zzso and its receptors have recently been known to be responsible for zzso signaling molecules in tumor cell lines and zzso These molecules have been reported to be expressed on merely a zzso level, but not on a protein zzso Moreover, little is known about zzso zzso in human zzso in zzso 

We investigated the presence and functional status of TRAIL and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso on tumor as well as zzso zzso zzso in primary ( zzso and zzso gastric zzso from zzso zzso ( zzso by a flow zzso In addition, zzso proportions of major zzso zzso or zzso in zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso receptors are zzso expressed at high levels in primary and zzso zzso in nearly all the zzso zzso tumor cells detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and labeling zzso were barely identified in primary and zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso showed a very low level of expression of zzso receptors and zzso zzso In zzso zzso however, there was significant zzso of zzso receptors in zzso associated with a higher frequency of zzso cell death detected by zzso The zzso within zzso zzso but not within primary zzso revealed the increased proportions of zzso T cells bearing zzso zzso and zzso zzso surface zzso in zzso 

These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso could not only have resistance to zzso zzso but also might take the zzso zzso against activated zzso T zzso These functions of the cancer cells would neutralize host immune responses at the zzso phase, and accelerate further invasion and/or zzso of zzso through the escape from immune zzso
