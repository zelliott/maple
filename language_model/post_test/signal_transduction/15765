This review intends to describe recent studies on the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and tumor zzso and potential opportunities and limitations to zzso targeting the zzso 

zzso cancer is characterized by densely zzso zzso It is becoming increasingly clear that there are complex and mutually supportive interactions between cancer cells and the zzso zzso signaling pathways exist between cancer cells and zzso zzso that contribute to hypoxic zzso Recent developments in therapeutic approaches to targeting the zzso have demonstrated potential for enhancing efficacy of zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso complexity between tumors has also become more evident based on recent zzso There is increasing evidence for hierarchy of cancer cells with identification of a zzso of cancer stem cells that are inherently resistant to traditional zzso 

zzso pancreatic cancer zzso is a novel therapeutic strategy that appears justified based on recent zzso however, continued focus is needed to develop more effective therapies against cells resistant to standard zzso
