Acute zzso leukemia zzso cells are relatively resistant to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso a potent zzso agent from a Chinese zzso decreases zzso in zzso zzso We evaluated the combination of zzso and TRAIL and found synergistic promotion of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were more resistant to TRAIL than zzso cells, and zzso of zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso as a resistance factor in zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso levels in zzso while the zzso increase was blunted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, confirming a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso In support of this finding, disruption of zzso binding with subsequent increase in zzso levels by zzso increased zzso levels and zzso zzso cells to zzso The combination of zzso plus zzso plus TRAIL was more effective than either the zzso and TRAIL or zzso and TRAIL combinations in zzso cells, further supporting the role of zzso as a zzso to zzso zzso in part by independent zzso of zzso expression and zzso zzso Thus, the combination of zzso and TRAIL may provide a novel strategy for treating zzso by overcoming critical mechanisms of zzso zzso
