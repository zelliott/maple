We unveiled novel zzso consensus sites in the promoter of the zzso 1 gene and demonstrate that zzso positively zzso zzso zzso in various human cell lines both under zzso conditions and upon induction by zzso Interestingly, we find that T cell zzso zzso of zzso cells triggers an increase in the binding of zzso to the zzso 1 promoter accompanied by enhanced zzso suggesting that zzso could regulate zzso zzso and zzso through zzso
