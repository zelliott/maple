Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso can act as powerful and specific zzso of T cell zzso Analysis of various experimental systems suggests that this effect might be related to engagement of the T cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso and that the observed zzso may be zzso by interference with membrane events crucial for signal zzso such as proper zzso zzso In addition, experimental data obtained by our laboratory and others suggest that zzso antagonism may be of significant value as a therapeutic approach and as a tool to dissect the process of zzso zzso
