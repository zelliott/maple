zzso lobe zzso zzso is one of the most common focal zzso zzso In a zzso expression study of the human zzso zzso we previously showed zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso Here we investigate in the rat zzso model for zzso whether changes in zzso zzso occur during zzso and are zzso Therefore we zzso zzso protein expression and cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso after status zzso We found increased zzso (but not zzso expression in specific populations of zzso zzso at 2 and 19 weeks after zzso zzso with a persistent zzso of its zzso zzso Our results show an early and persistent zzso of zzso zzso during zzso and suggest that zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso could have a role in the zzso zzso
