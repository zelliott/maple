zzso zzso is a well-balanced methodology for zzso mapping brain surface local field zzso zzso over a wide cortical region with high signal zzso and minimal zzso to the brain zzso To directly compare surface zzso signals with zzso zzso activity immediately zzso we zzso a flexible zzso zzso array with zzso structure using zzso zzso A zzso zzso for rats contained a zzso gold zzso array with zzso zzso Specifically, the probe had zzso zzso zzso in zzso spaces, through which simultaneous penetration of zzso was zzso This zzso was placed acutely or chronically on the zzso surface of the visual zzso of zzso rats for up to 2 zzso We obtained reliable zzso profiles of visually evoked zzso signals through individual eye zzso zzso evoked zzso signals from the zzso exhibited as well or larger signal zzso as zzso zzso and less zzso zzso than conventional zzso zzso zzso selectivity of zzso responses was correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso signals carried sufficient information for predicting the zzso eye with a correct performance approaching zzso and the decoding was significantly generalized across sessions over 6 zzso zzso zzso or signal quality did not obviously deteriorate for 2 weeks following zzso These findings open up a methodology to directly explore zzso signals with reference to zzso zzso sources and would provide a key to developing minimally invasive next-generation zzso zzso
