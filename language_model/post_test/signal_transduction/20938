Until recently, the only means by which electrical activity was believed to initiate retrograde signals was via zzso events: modulated synthesis or release of zzso zzso We have evidence in chick zzso for a zzso initiation of retrograde signals from the zzso to the zzso nucleus, which is known to undergo zzso zzso death between embryonic days 12 and 17 and to become laminated during this zzso zzso injections of zzso just before embryonic day 14 reduce zzso death and prevent zzso in the zzso nucleus within as few as 6 zzso We show that these rapid effects are attributable to the direct action of zzso on the zzso zzso Alternative possibilities, such as an indirect effect via the target cells, are ruled out by control zzso Normally, action zzso may lead to a chain of second zzso events in the zzso terminal that is signaled zzso via the transport of a zzso second zzso
