Since the initial report in 1978 of zzso effects of a zzso of 16 h of zzso h of darkness, numerous studies have confirmed zzso stimulation of milk zzso The zzso zzso responsible for increased milk yield, however, has eluded zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso growth zzso zzso may mediate the zzso response to long day zzso Indeed, long days increase zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in the latter case, the response preceded an increase in milk zzso In zzso and cows, the increase in zzso is independent of changes in circulating growth zzso zzso feeding to mimic a zzso zzso suppressed the increase of zzso in zzso induced by long zzso However, zzso feeding had no effect on milk yield in zzso Despite lack of resolution of the zzso zzso dairy producers are interested in how zzso management can be integrated with current practices throughout the zzso zzso There is strong evidence that milk yield responses to long days persist through an entire zzso Also, long days can be combined with bovine zzso zzso to produce additive increases in milk zzso During the dry period, long days increase the zzso surge of zzso However, relative to long days, zzso treatment during the dry period produces the largest magnitude of response in milk yield during the subsequent zzso The response to short days during the dry period may be due to a zzso effect on the zzso response zzso In zzso zzso has emerged as a possible zzso of the increase of milk yield in response to zzso zzso zzso can be combined effectively with other management techniques such as zzso Consideration of zzso management during the dry period is essential to maximize responses during the subsequent zzso
