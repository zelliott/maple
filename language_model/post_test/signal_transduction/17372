To explore a new reliable method inducing an animal model similar to the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso 

After the rats were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso injected on alternate days for 4 zzso The zzso in the zzso was observed under a light microscope and by electron zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso were checked by zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso chain zzso 

After the models were zzso the zzso and zzso in zzso were observed 4 weeks zzso The zzso in the zzso had increased, indented zzso of zzso cells appeared, and a zzso phenomenon zzso Under a transmission electron zzso free zzso had markedly increased and the nucleus was enlarged in the zzso Compared with the control group, the expression of zzso increased zzso zzso zzso while that of zzso and zzso declined zzso zzso zzso 

In the rat model of zzso zzso induced by zzso with pharmacological zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways play an important role in regulating the zzso of zzso cells in zzso
