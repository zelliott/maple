zzso zzso receptors zzso recognize microbial zzso molecular patterns and are critical for innate immunity against microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso levels of two important second zzso involved in signaling from many surface receptors by converting zzso to zzso acid zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso results in impaired zzso zzso 12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha production following zzso stimulation in zzso and in zzso increased resistance to zzso zzso and enhanced zzso to zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso controls the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso activity or treatment with PA can restore zzso zzso production by zzso zzso zzso our data provide the first genetic evidence that an zzso involved in zzso metabolism plays an important role in innate immunity and indicate that zzso promotes zzso responses via a zzso involving zzso of zzso
