The zzso of zzso signaling is essential for mechanically induced changes in skeletal muscle mass, and previous studies have suggested that mechanical stimuli activate zzso zzso target of zzso signaling through a zzso D zzso increase in the concentration of zzso acid zzso zzso with this conclusion, we obtained evidence which further suggests that mechanical stimuli zzso PA as a direct upstream zzso of zzso zzso Unexpectedly though, we found that the zzso of zzso is not necessary for the mechanically induced increases in PA or zzso zzso zzso by this zzso we performed experiments that were aimed at identifying the zzso that promotes the increase in zzso These experiments revealed that mechanical stimulation increases the concentration of zzso zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso mice, we determined that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is necessary for the mechanically induced increase in zzso We also determined that zzso significantly contributes to the mechanical zzso of zzso zzso and this is likely driven by an enhanced binding of PA to zzso zzso we found that the zzso of zzso is sufficient to induce muscle fiber zzso through an zzso zzso and this event requires zzso zzso activity zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso but not zzso plays an important role in mechanically induced increases in PA and zzso zzso Furthermore, this study suggests that zzso could be a fundamental component of the zzso through which mechanical stimuli regulate skeletal muscle zzso
