During times of zzso stress, the human heart is able to markedly increase zzso This response is facilitated by the release of zzso from zzso sympathetic nerves and zzso from the adrenal zzso These zzso effect a zzso response by interacting with a zzso signaling system within the zzso zzso consisting of beta zzso and beta zzso zzso the zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso signal zzso complex results in production of the second messenger, zzso zzso of protein zzso A, and zzso of a group of cellular proteins that are important in zzso zzso In contrast to normal human zzso the failing human heart is insensitive to zzso zzso This zzso is a result of zzso in the function of this signal zzso pathway, including selective zzso of the beta zzso zzso zzso of beta zzso receptors from zzso zzso and an increase in the functional activity of the zzso zzso zzso yet important differences exist between zzso zzso mechanisms in idiopathic zzso zzso and zzso secondary to zzso heart zzso Most notably, zzso are zzso to a lesser degree in patients with zzso heart zzso zzso various types of zzso heart muscle disease may exhibit important zzso differences despite common clinical features and an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that zzso cardiac signal zzso may have therapeutic zzso
