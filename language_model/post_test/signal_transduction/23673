zzso zzso cells in zzso are exposed to multiple zzso cues provided by the basement zzso a specialized zzso zzso through which vascular zzso cells are attached to the underlying zzso The importance of zzso cues has been widely reported, but the signaling pathways that mediate cellular recognition and response to these cues remain poorly zzso zzso zzso patterned zzso with zzso through zzso feature dimensions were zzso to investigate cellular responses to zzso zzso The present study focuses on early events following exposure of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso to these patterned zzso In zzso medium and on zzso without protein zzso zzso oriented parallel to the long axis of underlying zzso in as little as 30 zzso zzso showed clear differences in the zzso of the focal zzso proteins zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultured on zzso patterned surfaces and on zzso surfaces, suggesting involvement of these proteins in zzso the response to zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso was not necessary for zzso alignment in response to zzso cues, although zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso These data identify key events early in the cellular response to zzso zzso
