In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance is zzso by the zzso protein zzso The zzso sensor domain zzso and the zzso loop of zzso are on the membrane zzso We used zzso to investigate interactions between zzso and a zzso zzso from zzso This zzso binds zzso zzso to the zzso zzso site as an zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso G does not disrupt zzso These results suggest a signal zzso mechanism zzso the zzso zzso partially embedded in the zzso zzso zzso changes caused by zzso zzso through the membrane via zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso
