zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso for zzso enhances zzso function without stimulating zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor, suppresses the cell proliferation by expressing zzso in various zzso 

To investigate the mechanism through which the zzso maintain zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso 

We studied the relationship between zzso and zzso expression and the effect of zzso axis on zzso proliferation in primary cultured rat zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels are determined serially after partial zzso or sham operation in zzso 

DNA synthesis was markedly increased by zzso addition in rat zzso cultured at low density but not at high zzso Cellular zzso levels increased in the zzso cultured at both the zzso zzso levels were increased and correlated with cellular zzso levels in zzso cultured at high density but not at low zzso When the activity of zzso was suppressed by a chemical inhibitor for zzso cellular zzso levels were reduced, and DNA synthesis was zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso increased the DNA zzso In rats after partial zzso transient zzso of zzso zzso levels was zzso In contrast, in zzso rats, zzso zzso levels were increased on sustained time zzso 

zzso induction of zzso may suppress zzso proliferation in the presence of zzso in the setting that zzso activity of zzso is not zzso
