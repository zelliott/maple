Based on development of various zzso for isolation and characterization of zzso zzso we have identified a number of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Many of them are zzso or zzso regulated zzso The major question zzso what are their functions in cells and zzso Various approaches to answer this question were zzso While the method is different for each approach, we have continuously studied zzso or zzso zzso interaction with functional membrane zzso which include zzso growth factor zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso Often, zzso were found to interact with other carbohydrates within a specific membrane zzso termed zzso which mediates cell zzso with concurrent signal zzso Future trends in zzso and zzso zzso research are considered, including stem cell biology and zzso transition zzso zzso
