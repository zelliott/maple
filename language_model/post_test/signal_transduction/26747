zzso changes and chemical pollution confront plant communities with various zzso compounds or combinations of zzso involving chemical structures that are at least partially novel for plant zzso Plant responses to chemical challenges and stimuli are usually characterized by the approaches of zzso zzso and stress zzso Development of zzso and zzso analysis has demonstrated the importance of modifications to gene expression in plant responses to zzso It has emerged that zzso effects could involve not only zzso and zzso zzso but also the disruption of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso affecting sensing and zzso pathways result in modifications of responses to zzso thus confirming interference or zzso between zzso effects and zzso zzso Some of these changes at gene zzso regulation and zzso levels suggest various mechanisms of zzso sensing in higher plants, in accordance with zzso mechanisms that have been characterized in other zzso zzso zzso zzso In higher plants, such sensing systems are difficult to zzso even though different lines of evidence, involving zzso studies, zzso factor analysis, or comparative studies, point to their zzso It remains difficult to distinguish between the hypothesis of direct zzso sensing and indirect sensing of zzso zzso However, future characterization of zzso sensing and zzso in higher plants is likely to be a key element for determining the tolerance and zzso capacities of plant zzso This characterization will also be of interest for understanding evolutionary dynamics of stress adaptation and mechanisms of adaptation to novel zzso
