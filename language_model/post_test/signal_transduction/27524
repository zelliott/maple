The zzso system amplified by zzso or zzso is a sensitive and widely used method for determination of respiratory burst products generated by the zzso in zzso The present study shows that zzso but not zzso can inhibit the release of oxygen zzso generated by human zzso zzso The difference in structure between zzso and zzso zzso zzso more zzso than zzso and thereby zzso is suggested to determine indirectly whether or not the zzso is zzso zzso was shown to have an increased zzso effect after zzso of zzso on a surface of zzso zzso suggesting that the cells can be transferred from a zzso to a zzso zzso Since zzso had no zzso effect in a zzso zzso system, it is likely that it interferes with the signal zzso pathway, leading to assembly and/or zzso of the zzso As a consequence of the present results, showing that zzso but not zzso can inhibit zzso activity, we suggest that zzso is used in future studies of zzso zzso release from zzso
