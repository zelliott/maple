zzso smooth muscle cells zzso have been reported to express zzso receptors zzso and take part in the zzso of asthma zzso Though zzso were found to activate zzso growth factor zzso zzso in airway zzso cells, little is known about the association of zzso zzso with zzso signaling pathways in zzso Using primary cultured zzso from Brown Norway rats, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined by real-time quantitative zzso after stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso protein in culture zzso was measured by zzso The effect of zzso signaling zzso on zzso expression was examined as zzso zzso of zzso after stimulation was examined by Western zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso expression induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso expression via zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso seem to be involved in this zzso These findings may be critical in the zzso of asthma zzso by airway zzso
