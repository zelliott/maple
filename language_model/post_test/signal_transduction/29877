zzso can promote migration, zzso and survival of zzso cells through zzso of different signaling pathways triggered by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adapter proteins are targets of activated zzso zzso and are implicated in the transmission of zzso signals to the zzso protein zzso zzso Here we report the identification of an interaction between the adapter protein zzso and the zzso domain of zzso through in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells with its zzso zzso increased its association with zzso and zzso of the adapter zzso The interaction requires the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso as shown by pull-down zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was identified as the primary binding site for the zzso domain of zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso although it has no effect on survival of zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso partially reduces the zzso zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, our results identified a novel interaction between zzso with the adapter zzso zzso and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of migration and three-dimensional organization of zzso cells induced by zzso
