zzso cell death is a major feature of various diseases, including brain zzso zzso degenerative diseases, and traumatic injury, suggesting the importance of investigating the mechanisms that mediate zzso cell zzso Although the various factors that contribute to brain zzso have been defined and the mechanism through which each factor causes zzso cell death has been investigated, zzso strategies have not been zzso In this brief review, we focus on two important mechanisms that contribute to the zzso of brain zzso First, we discuss the zzso theory, a proposed mechanism for the understanding of zzso zzso cell zzso Second, an zzso of recent molecular zzso evidence regarding the dysfunction of a cellular zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggests that it plays a major role in the zzso of zzso cell zzso Whereas the former theory reflects the role of zzso factors in the induction of cell death, the stress response of the zzso for maintenance of its function is regarded as a defense zzso Because zzso another major factor in zzso results in further dysfunction of the zzso studies on the malfunction of this cellular zzso may facilitate the development of novel strategies to block zzso cell zzso
