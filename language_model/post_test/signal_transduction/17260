zzso birth is the single biggest cause of significant zzso morbidity and zzso and the zzso is zzso Development of new therapies to treat and prevent zzso zzso is seriously hampered by incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that initiate zzso at term and zzso zzso zzso provides a new opportunity to improve this zzso It is a useful tool in zzso identifying gaps in knowledge and zzso future research, and zzso providing the basis for an in zzso model of zzso in which novel drugs to prevent or treat zzso zzso can be zzso Despite their merits, zzso models are rarely used to study the molecular events initiating zzso Here, we present the first attempt to generate a dynamic kinetic model that has relevance to the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso Using published data, we model an important candidate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of Nuclear Factor zzso zzso This is the first model of this zzso to explicitly include molecular interactions upstream of Nuclear Factor zzso B zzso We produced a zzso zzso depiction of the zzso and built a kinetic model based on ordinary differential zzso The kinetic model accurately reproduced published in zzso time course plots of zzso Nuclear Factor zzso B zzso in mouse zzso zzso In this preliminary work we have provided proof of concept that it is possible to build zzso models of zzso pathways that are relevant to the regulation of zzso and suggest that models that are validated with zzso experiments have the potential to greatly benefit the zzso
