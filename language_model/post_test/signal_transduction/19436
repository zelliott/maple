zzso zzso zzso in healing zzso wounds, and in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of several zzso genes in response to zzso zzso zzso accumulates in healing zzso and zzso synthesis is induced by zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso This study tested the hypothesis that zzso acts as an zzso messenger, enhancing specific zzso responses of zzso to zzso zzso synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso blocked zzso induction of zzso synthesis in a zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso muscle zzso collagen type III, and extra domain zzso Chemical zzso of zzso also inhibited zzso responses in proportion to their zzso of zzso zzso zzso however, showed no effect on zzso induction of zzso by the zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso using zzso to zzso zzso 2 reduced zzso zzso of smooth muscle zzso zzso and cell zzso Similarly, brief treatment of zzso with zzso reduced zzso zzso These results suggest that newly zzso zzso zzso acts as an zzso zzso of wound healing and zzso in zzso by zzso a limited subset of the cellular responses to zzso
