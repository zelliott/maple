zzso of seed zzso requires coordinate action by the zzso and surrounding zzso We used zzso zzso to establish the relative roles of zzso and zzso in the control of seed zzso and zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso oil reserves are used zzso via zzso to fuel zzso establishment and that zzso breakdown is zzso by zzso acid zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso Here, we use zzso amplification to describe the zzso of the zzso and compare the hormone responses of zzso and zzso zzso We show that the zzso responds to both zzso and zzso but that zzso in particular regulates nuclear but not zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso expression is confined to the zzso accounts for the major differences in zzso response to zzso and defines a role for zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression in the zzso defines a second region of altered zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso demonstrate the spatial specificity of zzso action in seed zzso We conclude that the single cell zzso layer plays an active role in the regulation of seed zzso in zzso
