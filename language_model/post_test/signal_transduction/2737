We previously demonstrated that human zzso or zzso a zzso acid synthetic zzso derived from human zzso induced in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso component found only in human cells that express zzso at their zzso To determine the contribution of zzso molecules to this zzso regulation, we first analyzed whether zzso of zzso by other zzso zzso zzso could trigger such regulation in cell zzso zzso we used cell extracts of either zzso cells depleted in zzso molecules by zzso with zzso zzso or zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso was induced when zzso was activated by zzso and zzso as well as by zzso the zzso virus zzso protein or zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso which did not activate B zzso through zzso did not induce zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso presented similar properties in zzso zzso to trigger zzso zzso and in regulating B zzso zzso while zzso had no effect on either zzso Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the presence of zzso activated by its zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso through two distinct zzso one which also requires the presence of zzso zzso and one which is independent of zzso The involvement of zzso in the first zzso was not due to the formation of putative zzso zzso Both pathways were zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that activated zzso molecules can play a regulatory role in zzso function, such as zzso despite the absence of zzso and zzso
