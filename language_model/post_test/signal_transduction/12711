The Ron zzso zzso zzso is expressed in normal breast tissue and is zzso in approximately 50% of human breast zzso Despite the recent studies on Ron in breast cancer, nothing is known about the importance of this protein during breast zzso To investigate the functional significance of Ron in the normal zzso zzso we compared zzso zzso development in zzso mice to mice containing a targeted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling domain of Ron zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice exhibited accelerated zzso development including significantly increased zzso extension and branching zzso While circulating levels of estrogen, zzso and overall rates of zzso cell turnover were zzso significant increases in zzso zzso which predominantly localized to the zzso were associated with increased branching zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso cells cultured ex zzso exhibited enhanced branching zzso which was reduced upon zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso genes temporally impacted by Ron expression with significant changes observed in signaling networks regulating development, zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso In total, these studies represent the first evidence of a role for the Ron zzso zzso zzso as a critical negative regulator of zzso zzso
