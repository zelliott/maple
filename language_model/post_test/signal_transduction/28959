The innate immune response to zzso bacteria, such as the opportunist zzso zzso is initiated by zzso displayed on the zzso surface of airway zzso zzso zzso of zzso is accompanied by an immediate zzso flux that is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate zzso and zzso zzso signaling to recruit and activate zzso zzso in the zzso In human airway cells, gap junction channels were found to provide a regulated zzso for the movement of zzso from cell to zzso In response to zzso zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso gap junctions functioned to zzso amplify zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso cells thus increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation also induced zzso zzso of zzso 43 and association with zzso events linked to the closure of these zzso By 4 h zzso zzso gap junction communication was decreased indicating an zzso control of the zzso Thus, gap junction channels comprised of zzso 43 and other zzso in airway cells provide a mechanism to coordinate and regulate the zzso immune response even in the absence of signals from the immune zzso
