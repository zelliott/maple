zzso zzso in zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, cause zzso zzso in humans and zzso Yet, the zzso mechanisms are zzso Here, we report the effect of decreased zzso signaling on zzso zzso the expression of zzso target genes and zzso binding to zzso target zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso disrupted zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso but increased expression of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased expression of kidney patterning genes zzso and zzso and cell cycle regulators zzso D1 and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice rescued kidney zzso and restored expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To define mechanisms by which zzso signaling controls gene zzso we determined the binding of zzso proteins to zzso zzso regions containing zzso consensus binding sequences in zzso target genes using zzso zzso In normal embryonic kidney zzso zzso and/or zzso were bound to each target zzso By contrast, treatment of embryonic kidney zzso with zzso decreased zzso and/or zzso zzso and induced binding of zzso However, zzso failed to decrease zzso and zzso expression and branching zzso in zzso embryonic kidney zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso signaling controls zzso zzso via zzso control of zzso zzso patterning and cell cycle regulator genes in a manner that is opposed by zzso
