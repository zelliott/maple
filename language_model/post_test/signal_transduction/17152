A C2 cervical spinal zzso zzso zzso interrupts descending zzso drive to zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso in rats, paralyzing the zzso zzso zzso There is gradual recovery of rhythmic zzso muscle activity zzso to cervical spinal zzso injury over time, consistent with zzso and strengthening of zzso zzso descending zzso input to zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso signaling through the zzso related zzso zzso zzso B zzso plays an important role in zzso following spinal zzso zzso We hypothesized that 1) increasing zzso signaling at the level of the zzso zzso pool by zzso zzso delivery enhances functional recovery of rhythmic zzso activity after zzso and 2) zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso with the soluble fusion protein zzso or by knocking down zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso functional recovery after zzso zzso zzso zzso were implanted zzso to verify complete zzso at the time of zzso and zzso zzso After zzso surgery in adult rats, an zzso zzso was placed at C4 to chronically infuse zzso or zzso using an implanted zzso zzso At zzso zzso all zzso zzso treated rats zzso displayed recovery of zzso zzso zzso activity, compared to 3 out of 8 zzso zzso rats zzso During zzso zzso treated rats exhibited zzso of zzso root mean squared zzso zzso only zzso in zzso zzso rats zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso treatment completely prevented functional recovery up to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso response zzso protein zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso following zzso treatment zzso compared to artificial zzso fluid treatment zzso zzso zzso injections of zzso or zzso zzso were administered after zzso to specifically target zzso zzso At zzso zzso none out of 9 zzso zzso treated rats displayed functional recovery compared to 5 out of 9 zzso zzso treated zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling in zzso zzso pool plays a critical role in functional recovery after cervical spinal zzso zzso
