zzso of zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso is the leading genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso Multiple roles of zzso may contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress has also been linked to zzso zzso but its interactive mechanism with zzso genetic factors is largely zzso Here, we used zzso zzso human zzso cells and zzso cortical zzso to determine the role of zzso in maintaining zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso acts to protect zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso from the toxicity of zzso and/or human zzso possibly through the zzso pathway, by supporting zzso of zzso a key cell survival zzso during zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso however, caused chronic zzso zzso that led to death of zzso zzso and age-related zzso zzso in zzso These observations establish a critical functional link between zzso and zzso zzso
