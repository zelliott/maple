zzso is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including zzso lateral sclerosis zzso and is characterized by activated zzso at sites of zzso zzso In zzso zzso do not die alone; zzso injury is zzso and depends upon a zzso dialogue between motor zzso and zzso Evidence from transgenic models expressing zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso suggests that the dialogue between motor zzso and zzso initially protects motor zzso However, with increasing stress and injury within motor zzso induced by the presence of zzso proteins such as zzso zzso function and zzso flow are impaired and zzso zzso stress is zzso zzso proteins themselves or alternate signals are released from motor zzso and activate zzso zzso zzso in turn, switch from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso signaling from motor zzso promotes zzso release of zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso further enhancing motor zzso stress and cell injury and initiating a zzso cycle of motor zzso injury and cell zzso A greater understanding of how to restore the imbalance between zzso and zzso will depend upon a greater understanding of the motor zzso zzso
