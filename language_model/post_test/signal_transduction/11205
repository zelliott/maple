Although limiting energy availability extends lifespan in many organisms, it is not understood how lifespan is coupled to energy zzso We find that the zzso ratio, a measure of energy levels, increases with age in zzso zzso and can be used to predict life zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso alpha zzso zzso is activated by zzso and functions to extend zzso In addition, either an environmental zzso that increases the zzso ratio or zzso that lower zzso signaling extend lifespan in an zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a sensor that couples lifespan to information about energy levels and zzso zzso
