We previously identified a zzso zzso complex that includes zzso and zzso In this study, we used zzso to investigate the role of this complex in DNA zzso break zzso zzso zzso and zzso form discrete nuclear zzso in response to treatment with zzso agents but not in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso radiation and are distinct from those of the zzso repair zzso zzso Our data indicate that an zzso cell is competent to form either zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is much higher in the zzso zzso cell line zzso than in zzso zzso zzso focus formation is markedly reduced in cells derived from zzso patients, whereas zzso focus formation is markedly zzso These experiments support genetic evidence from zzso zzso indicating that zzso have roles distinct from that of zzso in zzso zzso Further, these data indicate that zzso zzso form in response to DNA zzso and are dependent upon a DNA zzso signaling zzso
