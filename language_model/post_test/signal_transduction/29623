Plant zzso zzso in association with plant roots, can trigger induced systemic resistance zzso Considering that zzso weight volatile hormone zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso can trigger defense responses in plants, we examined whether volatile organic compounds zzso associated with zzso can initiate zzso In zzso zzso exposed to bacterial volatile blends from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso disease severity by the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced compared with zzso not exposed to bacterial zzso before pathogen zzso Exposure to zzso from zzso for as little as 4 d was sufficient to activate zzso in zzso zzso Chemical analysis of the bacterial volatile emissions revealed the release of a series of zzso weight zzso including the growth promoting zzso zzso zzso application of zzso mixture of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was found to trigger zzso and transgenic lines of zzso zzso that zzso reduced levels of zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso protection to pathogen infection compared with zzso exposed to zzso from zzso bacterial zzso Using transgenic and zzso lines of zzso we provide evidence that the signaling zzso activated by zzso from zzso is dependent on zzso albeit independent of the salicylic acid or zzso acid signaling zzso This study provides new insight into the role of bacteria zzso as initiators of defense responses in zzso
