The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso 1, which produces the zzso zzso zzso induction is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work we studied zzso induction in a zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso We found that, in both bacteria, its expression is not induced during the zzso phase of growth even in the presence of zzso and zzso Additionally, we found that zzso expression is partially zzso zzso
