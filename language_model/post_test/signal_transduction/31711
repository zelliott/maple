zzso progress has been made in identifying signaling pathways that direct the differentiation of human zzso stem cells zzso into specialized cell types, including zzso However, differentiation of zzso with zzso factors is a slow, zzso process, mimicking the protracted timing of human zzso Using a zzso screen, we identified a combination of five zzso zzso zzso that yield zzso zzso at zzso efficiency within 10 d of zzso The resulting zzso express zzso markers and functional properties of human zzso including zzso zzso zzso sodium currents and response to zzso stimuli such as zzso and zzso zzso fate acquisition occurs about zzso faster than during in zzso development, suggesting that use of zzso zzso zzso could become a general strategy for accelerating zzso timing in zzso The quick and zzso derivation of zzso offers unprecedented access to this medically relevant cell type for studies of human zzso
