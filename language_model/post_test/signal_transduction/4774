zzso studies have linked zzso to open angle glaucoma, but the functions of the protein in the eye and other zzso have remained zzso The purpose of this investigation was to zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso a component of the zzso protein complex zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso via its zzso domain and zzso with zzso from zzso zzso and mouse skeletal zzso zzso of zzso higher levels of zzso in the muscles of transgenic mice led to the elevated association of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso which increased the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso box zzso 3, key regulators of muscle size, was increased more than zzso whereas the expression of zzso zzso finger zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso was decreased by 79 and zzso respectively, in the muscles of transgenic zzso zzso the average size of muscle fibers of the transgenic mice was increased by zzso relative to zzso We suggest that zzso zzso plays a role as a regulator of muscle zzso zzso acting through the components of zzso
