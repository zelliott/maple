To reveal specific gene zzso in zzso oxide zzso inflammation we studied differential gene expression in inflammatory zzso disease zzso 

Total zzso was isolated from 20 zzso of inflamed zzso from Crohn's disease zzso and zzso colitis zzso patients each as well as from six controls, labeled with zzso and zzso to a human NO gene zzso zzso genes were analyzed for functional gene interactions and zzso generated by zzso zzso A selection of zzso expressed genes was further evaluated with zzso zzso 

zzso gene expression differences were found for 19 genes in CD and 23 genes in UC compared to controls, both diseases with high expression of zzso and zzso zzso between zzso expression and corresponding protein expression was significant zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso analysis together with functional gene interaction analysis revealed clusters of zzso and zzso in CD and zzso transcripts involved in zzso inflammatory response zzso by the zzso factor zzso factor 1, and tissue zzso Also, a fourth cluster with transcripts regulated by the zzso factor zzso was found in zzso 

zzso analysis in CD and UC revealed zzso regulation of zzso zzso which might be involved in perpetuating inflammatory disease activity in zzso
