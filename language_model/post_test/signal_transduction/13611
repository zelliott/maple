zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso We have previously observed that the saturated free fatty acids zzso induce zzso zzso in part via a death zzso 5 zzso signaling zzso Cellular inhibitor of zzso protein 1 and 2 zzso and zzso proteins are potent zzso of death zzso zzso However, the role of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso Our aim was to determine whether zzso are zzso during zzso zzso zzso proteins underwent rapid cellular elimination following treatment with the saturated zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, PA did not decrease zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on their zzso activity, suggesting that zzso undergo zzso that leads to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso targeting zzso but not zzso displayed enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which zzso rapid degradation of zzso also enhanced zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso knockout mice exhibited reduced zzso following treatment with PA plus zzso zzso that degradation of zzso zzso to zzso cell death zzso A decrease of zzso was also observed in tissue from patients with zzso zzso compared with normal obese zzso zzso these results zzso zzso degradation of zzso by zzso as a mechanism contributing to zzso zzso
