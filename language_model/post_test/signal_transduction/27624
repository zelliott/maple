zzso by zzso zzso was examined in zzso cells by zzso expressing a zzso reporter system plus zzso protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso gene by zzso in zzso cells was reduced zzso by zzso of wild type zzso This reduction of zzso zzso zzso required specific zzso zzso activity, because the effects were not zzso by zzso of either a zzso inactive zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso was severely restricted by its own activity because zzso more inactive zzso was zzso In a different zzso the zzso activity of zzso was zzso lower when zzso with zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso of the reporter zzso were nearly eliminated by even low level expression of zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso The results show that zzso activity is strictly regulated and can be a limiting factor in zzso expression of various zzso
