zzso and activity of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso were explored in zzso and zzso tissue samples from patients with primary breast zzso zzso expression was observed for zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in samples from 14 patients in whom there were sufficient zzso and zzso tissue to perform the entire zzso As previously noted, zzso expression and activity were increased sharply in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression and activity were increased zzso in breast zzso The expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso was increased zzso in zzso as compared to normal breast zzso zzso analysis in zzso with zzso to zzso revealed intense zzso in samples of zzso zzso In spite of a zzso increase in zzso zzso samples displayed a zzso decrease in the activity of this zzso protein zzso The expression of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso upstream protein zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, was elevated zzso to zzso The upstream regulator of zzso zzso zzso however, displayed normal levels of zzso providing no basis for the reduction in zzso activity observed for breast zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and the expression was found to be increased zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso as compared to zzso zzso The reduced activity of zzso in spite of its zzso appears to reflect increased zzso activity associated with primary breast zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso may enable the expression of the zzso signals from zzso in zzso zzso
