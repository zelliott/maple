zzso data analysis is often applied to characterize disease populations by identifying individual genes linked to the zzso In recent years, efforts have shifted to focus on sets of genes known to perform related biological functions zzso in the same zzso Evaluating gene sets reduces the need to correct for false zzso in multiple hypothesis zzso However, pathways are often large, and genes in the same zzso that do not contribute to the disease can cause a method to miss the zzso In addition, large pathways may not give much insight to the cause of the zzso Moreover, when such a method is applied independently to two zzso of the same disease zzso the two resulting lists of significant pathways often have low zzso 

We present a powerful method, zzso that identifies smaller parts of pathways (which we call zzso and show that significant zzso (and the genes zzso discovered by zzso are up to 51% zzso more consistent across independent zzso of the same disease zzso even for zzso based on different platforms, than previously published zzso We further show that those methods which initially declared some large pathways to be insignificant would declare zzso detected by zzso in those large pathways to be zzso if they were given those zzso as input instead of the entire large zzso
