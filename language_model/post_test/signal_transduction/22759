zzso of a collection of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso were extensively characterized using surface zzso zzso Dynamic interaction studies using combinations of zzso synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso sequences within zzso zzso and the zzso have shown that a number of the zzso recognized zzso zzso revealing the junction of distinct zzso in the folded zzso In particular, the two putative zzso binding zzso and the C zzso of the protein were shown to interact with each other in the folded zzso Using the zzso electrical response of tobacco zzso as a functional zzso all the zzso exhibited either zzso zzso or zzso zzso These effects, measured for the first time in zzso conditions, confirm that zzso is present at the plasma membrane and is involved in the zzso of the zzso electrical response of tobacco zzso Based on our surface zzso resonance data, we propose that the key event leading to the zzso of this zzso electrical response consists of a zzso change in zzso
