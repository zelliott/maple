The goal of this study was to zzso the relationships between early zzso zzso processing events and cellular responses for the zzso zzso zzso system on human zzso as a model of a zzso system in a zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso on human zzso were characterized and combined with previously published binding data for four other zzso zzso was best fit by an zzso zzso state model that included a low affinity zzso state that converted to a high affinity zzso Response behaviors zzso at 37 degrees C by the six different zzso for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso response zzso for zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for each zzso whereas all zzso showed equal efficacy for all three responses, the zzso values varied as much as zzso The level of zzso and rank order of zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso responses were the same as for the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the differences in abilities of zzso to mediate responses were determined upstream of zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso The rate zzso governing zzso binding and zzso affinity conversion were zzso Analysis of the forward and reverse rate zzso governing binding to the proposed signaling zzso state showed that it was of a similar energy for all six zzso suggesting the hypothesis that zzso efficacy is dictated by the energy state of this zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso state model was not sufficient to predict response zzso suggesting the presence of zzso states not zzso by the binding zzso
