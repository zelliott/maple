zzso stem cells zzso are a zzso population of zzso cells with zzso capacity to differentiate into zzso and zzso cell zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso reside primarily in the bone zzso but also exist in other sites such as zzso zzso peripheral blood, zzso blood, liver, and fetal zzso When zzso by specific signals, these cells can be released from their niche in the bone zzso into circulation and recruited to the target zzso where they undergo in zzso differentiation and contribute to tissue zzso and zzso Several characteristics of zzso such as the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages and the ability to be expanded ex zzso while retaining their original lineage differentiation commitment, make these cells very interesting targets for potential therapeutic use in zzso medicine and tissue zzso The feasibility for transplantation of primary or engineered zzso as zzso therapy has been zzso In this review, we zzso the current knowledge on the signals that control trafficking and differentiation of zzso
