The principal effect of transforming growth factor zzso zzso on zzso cells is its stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Previous reports indicated the significance of the zzso zzso loop in the zzso of zzso The aim of this study was to examine zzso and zzso principal molecules in the negative regulation of zzso zzso to further understand the zzso zzso loop in zzso 

zzso of expression of zzso on cultured normal and zzso zzso were determined by Western zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso To determine the zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso A transient zzso zzso was performed to measure promoter activity of the zzso collagen gene and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso levels compared with normal zzso both in zzso and in zzso Although zzso zzso formed a complex with zzso by zzso the zzso effect of zzso on the promoter activity of human zzso collagen and zzso was impaired in zzso zzso zzso analyses also revealed that zzso zzso could not compete with zzso in these zzso 

These results indicate that impaired competition with zzso is the possible cause of dysfunction of zzso in zzso zzso and that this might contribute to maintenance of the zzso zzso loop in this zzso
