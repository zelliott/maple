We reported zzso as a novel zzso factor that regulates vascular zzso We aimed to investigate molecular mechanisms, signaling zzso and functional significance of zzso zzso and to test whether zzso zzso is increased in diabetes zzso zzso which contributes to vascular zzso Studies were performed in the zzso zzso cell line and mature zzso isolated from human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso arteries with and without zzso fat and mature zzso were obtained from obese diabetic zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected in zzso and mature zzso which zzso zzso zzso and in response to zzso II zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso II stimulation increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II effects were blunted by an zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso A and zzso and nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blunted zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice (1 zzso per day, 4 weeks) increased plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso relaxation in zzso zzso arteries containing zzso fat was improved by zzso zzso zzso zzso without effect in zzso zzso zzso possess zzso zzso and produce zzso in an zzso zzso II type 1 zzso factor of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso differentiation and vascular function in an zzso and zzso manner, zzso These novel findings identify zzso as a putative link between zzso and vascular dysfunction in diabetes zzso zzso
