T cell zzso is a key component of zzso immunity to viral infection but has also been associated with pathology because of excessive or altered T cell zzso We recently demonstrated that the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso is critically required to sustain zzso T cell and zzso responses that enable control of viral replication in the context of chronic zzso zzso virus zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether reinforcing zzso stimulation through an zzso zzso had the potential to prevent zzso zzso We observed that zzso injection early after zzso clone 13 infection increased zzso T zzso zzso More zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso T cells promoted expression of the zzso zzso zzso and diverted the majority of cells away from zzso zzso cell zzso This occurred in both acute and chronic infections, and resulted in dramatic reductions in zzso center and zzso responses to the viral zzso The effect of the zzso zzso was dependent on zzso signaling and the timing of zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that excessive zzso signaling can result in deleterious consequences in the setting of zzso zzso
