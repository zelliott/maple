Cell movement is essential during zzso to establish tissue patterns and to drive zzso pathways and in the adult for tissue repair and to direct cells to sites of zzso Animal cells move by crawling and the driving force is derived primarily from the coordinated assembly and zzso of zzso zzso The small zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate the organization of zzso filaments and we have analyzed their contributions to the movement of primary zzso zzso in an in zzso wound healing zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso and for forward zzso zzso is required to maintain cell zzso which includes the zzso of zzso activity to the leading edge and the zzso of the zzso apparatus in the direction of zzso zzso is required to maintain cell zzso during movement, but stress fibers and focal zzso are not zzso Finally, Ras regulates focal zzso and stress fiber turnover and this is essential for cell zzso We conclude that the signal zzso pathways controlled by the four small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cooperate to promote cell zzso
