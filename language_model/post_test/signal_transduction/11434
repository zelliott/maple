zzso zzso have a short life zzso We tested various zzso and growth factors for the effects on the survival of zzso mature zzso In the absence of any added factors, zzso exhibited the survival rate of less than zzso after a zzso zzso Among the tested factors, tumor necrosis zzso zzso was found to increase the survival rate to approximately zzso The zzso survival of zzso appeared to be associated with reduction in zzso and suppression of zzso zzso The zzso signaling pathways involved in the zzso zzso survival were zzso zzso treatment increased the zzso of zzso in zzso which was suppressed by a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and an zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso These zzso also attenuated the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso In addition an increase in the zzso of zzso was observed upon zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival, and in these responses the involvement of zzso and zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso promotes the survival of zzso by engaging the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso
