zzso zzso and overproduction of inflammatory zzso in the central nervous system zzso have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso have been reported in serum and zzso brains of patients with zzso but its role in progression of zzso is zzso Using novel engineered dominant negative zzso zzso zzso selective for soluble zzso zzso we investigated whether blocking zzso signaling with chronic infusion of the zzso zzso zzso or a single injection of a zzso zzso zzso prevented the acceleration of zzso pathology induced by chronic systemic inflammation in zzso zzso We found that chronic zzso of zzso signaling with either approach decreased the zzso zzso of zzso protein in zzso cortex, and zzso zzso and zzso approaches using a zzso zzso zzso indicated that a major fraction of the accumulated protein was likely to be zzso zzso fragments zzso while a minor fraction consisted of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso mice yielded similar zzso Taken together, our studies indicate that soluble zzso is a critical zzso of the effects of zzso on early zzso pathology in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso may slow the appearance of zzso pathology, cognitive deficits, and potentially the progressive loss of zzso in zzso
