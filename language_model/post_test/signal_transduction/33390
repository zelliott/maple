zzso bind to zzso class zzso cells and stimulate T zzso expressing specific V beta regions of the zzso Two distinct regions of zzso zzso A zzso zzso have been shown to affect the binding to zzso class II zzso zzso presented here demonstrate for the first time that the zzso interaction can be affected by zzso on the class II zzso Furthermore, we have precisely mapped the interaction of the SEA zzso domain with the zzso domain of zzso zzso analysis using zzso cells zzso with zzso class II molecules showed a role for zzso DR alpha zzso in the binding of zzso Also, zzso experiments using zzso SEA molecules revealed an interaction between SEA zzso zzso and position zzso on an outer loop of zzso These interactions between zzso and the DR zzso are critical, as they allow the recognition by an otherwise zzso V zzso T cell zzso and induction of zzso zzso through the zzso
