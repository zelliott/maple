The zzso curve for zzso action as a plant growth promoter is extremely zzso How does the cell vary its response to such a wide range of signal zzso We suggest that cell zzso zzso and the products of its action on the wall zzso zzso and zzso provide a complex regulatory system, acting at three or possibly four different zzso Our recent observations will be presented in terms of the following zzso zzso zzso Low levels of zzso activate zzso (by inducing zzso which cuts zzso zzso zzso loosening the cell wall and tending to promote zzso 

zzso induce zzso turnover and decrease the mean Mr of wall zzso zzso of zzso fragments suggests that zzso zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso activate zzso zzso the zzso generates small amounts zzso of zzso some of which are zzso This process tends to moderate zzso
