Development of therapies to treat visual system zzso resulting from the zzso of rod and cone zzso may directly benefit from studies of animal models, such as the zzso that display continuous retinal zzso and the capacity for zzso zzso Previous studies of retinal zzso in fish have been conducted on adult animals and have relied on methods that cause acute damage to both rods and cones, as well as other retinal cell zzso We report here the use of a genetic approach to study zzso cell responses to zzso zzso in the zzso and adult zzso zzso We have compared the responses to selective rod or cone zzso zzso respectively, the zzso transgenic line and zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso rod zzso zzso increased proliferation of zzso in the outer nuclear layer zzso and is not associated with proliferation or zzso zzso in the inner nuclear layer zzso zzso characterization of the rod zzso cells demonstrated that they are committed to the rod zzso fate while they are still zzso In contrast, cone zzso zzso both zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso with little change in proliferation in the zzso We found that in both lines, zzso responses to zzso zzso can be observed as 7 days post zzso zzso These two genetic models therefore offer new opportunities for investigating the molecular mechanisms of selective zzso and zzso of rods and zzso
