zzso are complex zzso that are important in many biological zzso The present study investigated the role of zzso in the organization of zzso zzso in zzso mast cells and in the zzso of mast cell zzso via zzso The role of zzso was examined using two zzso deficient cell lines zzso and zzso as well as the parent cell line zzso All three cell lines examined express zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, only in zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso mobilized to zzso raft zzso following zzso zzso The zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso cells also resulted in a decrease in the release of zzso activity after zzso zzso The two zzso cell lines have a reduced release of zzso activity after zzso zzso but not after exposure to calcium zzso These results indicate that the zzso derivatives of zzso zzso are important in the initial events of zzso signaling upstream of zzso zzso Since the initial signaling events occur in zzso zzso and in the zzso cell lines the zzso are zzso these results also suggest that these zzso contribute to the correct assembly of zzso zzso and are essential for mast cell zzso via zzso
