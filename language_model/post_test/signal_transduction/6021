The past few years have seen remarkable progress in our understanding of embryonic stem cell zzso zzso zzso The necessity of examining human zzso cells in culture, coupled with the wealth of zzso data and the zzso of cell lines available, has enabled researchers to identify critical zzso pathways regulating zzso and identify markers that tightly correlate with the zzso cell zzso zzso across species has suggested additional pathways likely to be important in long-term zzso of zzso cells including zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso regulation, and zzso zzso In this review, we have discussed information on molecules known to be important in zzso cell zzso or zzso development and highlighted known differences between mouse and human zzso zzso We suggest that several additional pathways required for zzso remain to be discovered and these likely include genes involved in zzso regulation, zzso as well as additional global repressive pathways and novel zzso We suggest that cross species comparisons using large-scale zzso analysis tools are likely to reveal zzso and divergent paths required for zzso cell zzso and will allow us to derive zzso lines from species and strains where this has been zzso
