By zzso the zzso checkpoint, zzso drugs such as zzso cause zzso cells to arrest in zzso and then undergo zzso zzso zzso is rapid and results in the zzso of the zzso factor zzso and induction of zzso gene zzso However, the functional consequence of zzso zzso has remained zzso Evidence has accumulated to suggest that zzso zzso activity is required to suppress zzso In the present study, we confirm and extend previous findings that zzso zzso leads to the rapid zzso of zzso and test the hypothesis that the induction of zzso regulates cell survival during zzso cell cycle arrest in order to define its zzso Using a range of functional zzso we have shown that zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and degradation of zzso the zzso of native zzso zzso into the zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso By zzso either the zzso of the zzso or the degradation of zzso we find that the level of zzso is significantly increased in the zzso arrested zzso zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso cells did not affect their zzso We establish that although zzso is activated rapidly in response to zzso zzso its cell survival function is not required until zzso cell cycle arrest, when the zzso checkpoint is activated and zzso is zzso We conclude that zzso may regulate the zzso of one or more zzso proteins that may regulate cell survival during zzso cell cycle zzso
