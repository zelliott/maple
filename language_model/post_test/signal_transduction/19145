In China, the zzso root began to be used in medicine over 2000 years zzso zzso are the most important component isolated from zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of zzso zzso on the proliferation and molecular mechanism in cultured human zzso vascular smooth muscle cell zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso It was shown that zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso which blocked the cell cycle in the zzso induced a zzso of zzso D1 and an zzso in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly aggravated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso on zzso proliferation was associated with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso pathways and zzso of zzso proteins by zzso zzso may be of importance in zzso of zzso zzso
