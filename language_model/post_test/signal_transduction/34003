Here, we report that diesel exhaust particles zzso a major constituent of urban air pollution, affect zzso barrier function at the zzso zzso and molecular zzso zzso rat brain zzso exposed to zzso showed increased expression and transport activity of the key drug zzso zzso zzso (6 h zzso was approximately 5 zzso zzso of zzso was abolished by blocking zzso or protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso with radical zzso ameliorated zzso zzso zzso indicating a role for zzso oxygen species in zzso zzso exposure also increased brain zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was abolished when zzso 1 zzso was blocked and was not evident in experiments with zzso from zzso knockout zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso indicating a role for zzso in the signaling zzso zzso with this, zzso increased zzso of zzso Together, our results show for the first time that a component of air pollution, zzso alters zzso barrier function through zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso These experiments disclose a novel zzso barrier signaling pathway, with clear implications for environmental zzso zzso pathology, and the zzso of zzso zzso
