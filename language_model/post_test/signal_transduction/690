In seasonal species, the zzso zzso day zzso tightly regulates reproduction to ensure that birth occurs at the most zzso time of zzso In zzso a distinct zzso circuit controls this process via the zzso hormone zzso This hormone is responsible for the seasonal timing of zzso but the anatomical zzso and the cellular mechanisms through which zzso zzso seasonal functions remain zzso Recently, several genes have been identified as being regulated by the zzso in the brain of seasonal zzso These genes are thought to play active roles in the regulation of seasonal biology, notably for the adjustment of reproduction and body zzso Here, we briefly review findings associated with the control of seasonal breeding and describe recent data zzso zzso roles to type 2 and type 3 zzso to the zzso system and to the zzso zzso these systems involve different zzso zzso suggesting that several brain zzso may be crucial for zzso to regulate zzso and thus represent key starting points to identify the zzso mode and zzso of action of zzso Such findings raise great hopes for the future and could herald a new era of research in the field of seasonal zzso
