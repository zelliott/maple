Gap junctions form zzso channels that mediate zzso and electrical signaling between neighboring cells in a zzso Lack of an atomic resolution structure of the gap junction has made it difficult to identify interactions that stabilize its zzso zzso Using a recently zzso model of this domain, which specifies the locations of each zzso acid, we zzso the existence of several interactions and tested them zzso We introduced zzso within the zzso domain of the gap zzso protein zzso that were previously implicated in genetic diseases and that apparently zzso the gap zzso as evidenced here by the absence of the protein from the sites of zzso zzso The model structure helped identify positions on adjacent zzso where zzso zzso restored membrane zzso revealing possible interactions between zzso zzso We thus identified two putative salt bridges and one pair involved in packing interactions in which one zzso zzso suppressed the effects of zzso These results seem to reveal some of the physical forces that zzso the structural stability of the gap junction zzso domain and suggest that zzso of such interactions bring about some of the effects of zzso zzso
