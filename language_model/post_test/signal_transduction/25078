zzso is a uniquely important zzso that zzso into cells through gated channels to transmit signals to a large number of zzso The evolutionary choice of zzso was dictated by its unusual chemical properties, which permit its zzso zzso by specific proteins in the presence of much larger amounts of other potentially competing zzso The decoding of the zzso signal consists in two zzso changes of the zzso zzso of which zzso is the most zzso The first occurs when zzso is bound, the second (a collapse of the zzso zzso when interaction with the targeted zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso contribute to the zzso of cell zzso but membrane intrinsic transporting proteins are more zzso zzso is transported across the plasma membrane zzso a zzso a zzso zzso and across the membrane of the zzso The zzso zzso is the most dynamic zzso it accumulates zzso by a zzso and releases it via channels gated by either zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is more zzso but it is zzso with the zzso and senses zzso of high zzso close to zzso or zzso release zzso The regulation of zzso in the nucleus, where important zzso processes zzso is a debated zzso Finally, if the control of cellular zzso zzso somehow fails zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso inside zzso and zzso If injury zzso zzso eventually zzso
