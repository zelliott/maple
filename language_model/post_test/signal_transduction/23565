zzso heart disease zzso is a devastating anomaly that affects zzso of live zzso zzso of the zzso tract zzso make up a large percentage of human zzso We investigated zzso signaling in mouse zzso development by zzso deleting both zzso and zzso in the second heart field zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in defective zzso to zzso transition zzso and reduced cardiac neural crest zzso with zzso persistent zzso zzso Using a candidate gene approach, we found that zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To determine if zzso is a downstream zzso zzso during zzso we examined whether zzso is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso directly binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso is a direct target for the zzso zzso which is also regulated by zzso signaling in the zzso zzso of zzso reveals similar zzso to zzso zzso zzso To directly address the function of zzso repression in zzso zzso we performed ex zzso zzso cultures from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was defective in zzso from the zzso double conditional knockout zzso zzso and zzso zzso By zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso was rescued in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our study reveals that zzso levels in the zzso are tightly controlled by zzso and zzso pathways to zzso zzso zzso
