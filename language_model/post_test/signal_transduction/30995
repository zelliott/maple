zzso proteins were reported to be involved in different biological activities such as zzso of zzso calcium zzso It has been reported that each member of the zzso protein family exhibits a distinct zzso pattern of zzso Furthermore, altered zzso protein expression and function correlate with many zzso The expression of zzso was reported to be increased in different tissue with zzso The external auditory canal zzso zzso is a benign zzso of the auditory zzso zzso However, without treatment, zzso destroys adjacent zzso zzso zzso specimens were collected and investigated zzso against zzso zzso auditory zzso skin served as zzso In the zzso zzso showed a more homogeneous zzso pattern, positively expressed throughout the zzso zzso The zzso debris showed no zzso expression of zzso In the auditory zzso skin zzso zzso was only expressed in the zzso layer of the zzso We showed that there are different zzso patterns in normal auditory zzso skin, middle ear zzso and external auditory canal zzso The zzso increased with the stage of the zzso zzso to that reported previously in the middle ear zzso the zzso was strongest in the upper zzso zzso In our collective, the zzso zzso of the zzso showed strong zzso throughout all the zzso Surprisingly, there is no study regarding the connection between growth factors and zzso In previous experiments we showed significant increase of growth factors in zzso This zzso with our new data concerning zzso This is the first study to show the different zzso pattern of zzso in the external auditory canal zzso
