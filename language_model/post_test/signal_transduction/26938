In zzso zzso zzso of the key zzso regulatory genes zzso and zzso is induced in response to zzso through the action of the zzso and zzso zzso These two proteins are sensor and regulator zzso respectively, of a large family of bacterial zzso systems involved in sensing and responding to environmental zzso A zzso truncated form of the membrane protein zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso that zzso and zzso zzso in response to oxygen zzso Here we use an in zzso zzso system to prove that zzso is a zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso and that zzso of zzso markedly increases its zzso zzso was achieved either by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso or by exposing zzso to the zzso zzso donor ammonium hydrogen zzso Both zzso and zzso formed zzso complexes under the zzso conditions zzso Lastly, we were able to show that zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso greatly stimulates zzso activity at the zzso promoter with either zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso zzso This use of atmospheric oxygen to control zzso zzso in zzso represents a zzso of a bacterial zzso signal zzso system in its zzso from zzso to ultimate target, by the use of zzso zzso
