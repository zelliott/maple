The zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to cells via a specific zzso attached to the plasma membrane by a zzso zzso zzso Despite the lack of a zzso domain, the zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso signals affecting growth, migration, and zzso Several zzso zzso of the zzso family as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be associated with the zzso We found that in the human kidney zzso line zzso also components of the zzso signal zzso zzso including zzso are associated with zzso as revealed by zzso and are zzso in zzso Upon zzso of zzso complex by a zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso which in turn leads to zzso zzso zzso specific binding to DNA, and gene zzso To prove the dependence of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso cells were treated with sense and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells in which zzso expression was reduced to less then one third, zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso was abolished while zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso in this cell line, zzso also zzso the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso might be the zzso adapter for this signal zzso zzso
