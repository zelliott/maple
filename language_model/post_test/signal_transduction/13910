At the zzso zzso junction zzso the loss of zzso zzso zzso signaling causes zzso terminals to have fewer synaptic zzso whereas increased zzso activity results in a larger zzso with more zzso Here, we show that an early and transient zzso signal is necessary and sufficient for zzso growth as well as for zzso synaptic zzso This early critical period was revealed by the temporally controlled suppression of zzso the zzso zzso zzso Similar results were found by genetic rescue tests involving the zzso zzso Glass bottom boat zzso in muscle, and alternatively the type II zzso zzso zzso Thinking zzso in the zzso These observations support a model where the muscle signals back to the zzso zzso nucleus to activate zzso programs necessary for synaptic growth and zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso and zzso studies show that genes involved in zzso growth and zzso including the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso II, the zzso factor zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso all depend critically on the zzso zzso zzso for their zzso By contrast, elevated expression of zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso found to be necessary for zzso zzso rescued the zzso associated with the loss of Mad zzso We also find that synaptic structure and function develop using genetically zzso zzso zzso Although synaptic growth depended on Lar and the early, transient zzso zzso the maturation of neurotransmitter release was independent of Lar and required later, ongoing zzso zzso
