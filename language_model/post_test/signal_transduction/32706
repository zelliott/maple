zzso cell growth requires the zzso of a site for polarized growth and subsequent orientation of the zzso towards this zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso cells orient their growth in response to a zzso zzso overriding an internal landmark for polarized growth, the bud zzso This response requires zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Here we show that a two- hybrid interaction between zzso and zzso requires zzso but not zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso has a role in regulating the association of zzso and zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso form a complex in which zzso interactions can occur in the absence of the third zzso zzso zzso to sites of polarized growth suggesting that this complex is zzso In the absence of zzso zzso a bud site selection zzso zzso is essential for zzso changes in response to zzso These results suggest that formation of a zzso complex functions as a landmark for orientation of the zzso during growth towards an external zzso
