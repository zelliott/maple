zzso which acts through zzso zzso B zzso receptors during zzso development, also enhances long-term synaptic zzso zzso in adult zzso Because zzso is a zzso for long-term memory zzso in zzso we examined the requirement of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso formation at zzso zzso and behavioral zzso Using an zzso fusion protein that sequesters zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso function is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tail nerve zzso zzso in the zzso and tail zzso zzso but is not necessary for short-term synaptic zzso or short-term zzso These results show that a zzso growth factor, acting through a zzso signaling zzso is critical for the induction of long-lasting plasticity and memory formation in zzso
