The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of G proteins in zzso zzso zzso from rats with zzso arthritis zzso and to determine the effect of total zzso of zzso zzso zzso rats were induced with chicken type II collagen zzso in zzso complete zzso The rats with experimental arthritis were randomly separated into five groups and then treated with zzso zzso 50, and zzso from days 14 to 35 after zzso The secondary inflammatory reactions were evaluated through the zzso index and zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso The zzso proliferation response was determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of G proteins was performed through zzso The results show that zzso zzso 50, and zzso significantly decreased the arthritis scores of zzso rats and improved the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso and increased the level of zzso Moreover, the zzso proliferation and the level of zzso expression were significantly increased, but the level of zzso expression was decreased after stimulation with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the zzso proliferation and regulated the balance between zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso may exert its zzso effects through the suppression of zzso zzso which may be associated with its ability to regulate the balance of G zzso Thus, zzso may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso
