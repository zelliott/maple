zzso zzso C zzso is involved in the control of many key signaling pathways in zzso zzso over the past decade have shown that many effects of ethanol on cell function are closely interconnected with zzso Three distinct areas of investigation have zzso they are reviewed in this zzso In zzso studies show that ethanol and higher alcohols can both inhibit or enhance zzso activity, depending on the experimental zzso These studies show that alcohols interact directly with zzso suggesting at least some role of this interaction in intoxication and zzso Most zzso channel systems are modulated by ethanol to varying degrees, and zzso of zzso zzso this zzso however, the mechanism by which ethanol brings about this effect is not zzso Lastly, prolonged or chronic ethanol exposure zzso zzso an effect that has important consequences, for example, in zzso zzso again, the mechanism leading to this process is not zzso The current consensus is that zzso is intimately involved in acute and chronic ethanol action, and the challenge now is to determine the mechanisms involved so that strategies can be developed to control these zzso
