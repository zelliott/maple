Recent evidence indicates that zzso regulates appetite and energy zzso at least in part by zzso zzso synthesis and release from zzso zzso To demonstrate that this zzso works zzso we used a zzso zzso mouse zzso driver to show that zzso signals in zzso zzso after birth to decrease appetite by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene deletion experiments and zzso zzso infusions reveal that zzso signals in zzso zzso of the zzso through the zzso zzso to favor food intake and that this zzso function requires the expression of zzso which regulates the expression of several genes affecting zzso zzso a specific zzso of the zzso zzso decreases food intake in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso these results establish that zzso zzso of zzso is necessary to inhibit appetite zzso and provide a proof of principle that selective zzso of this zzso may be a viable option to treat appetite zzso
