zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of insulin zzso One potential mechanism for this is that zzso zzso decreases the ability of zzso to be zzso by the insulin zzso An additional mechanism for modulating insulin signaling is via the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso degradation of zzso has been well zzso both in cells as well as in patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso degradation, yet the details of how this occurs are still zzso In the present study we have examined the potential role of different signaling zzso in the zzso degradation of zzso First, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso block the zzso Second, knockout cells lacking one of the key zzso of this zzso the zzso zzso were found to be deficient in the zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Third, concurrent with the decrease in zzso degradation, the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso also blocked the zzso increase in zzso zzso Most important, an zzso zzso in which zzso was changed to zzso was found to be resistant to zzso zzso zzso Finally, an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso did not block zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso yet completely blocked zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso was not blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso In zzso our results indicate that the zzso degradation of zzso via the zzso zzso zzso is in part dependent upon the zzso zzso of zzso
