The process of zzso attachment and zzso is accompanied by dramatic cellular and functional changes in the zzso the control and mechanisms of which are not clearly zzso The zzso cloning of zzso expressed zzso specifically at zzso sites in the rabbit zzso was used to identify genes controlling functional and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of Day zzso zzso and Day 8 zzso zzso pregnant rabbits was used to screen for zzso expressed genes by combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed genes were identified zzso protein modification zzso signaling zzso structural zzso and zzso One of these is a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso family we have designated zzso zzso for zzso which displayed dramatic zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence conservation between zzso humans, and zzso In zzso zzso indicated zzso expression exclusively in the zzso zzso of the zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was specific for zzso cells at zzso sites and was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in both the zzso and zzso zzso cells of the zzso sites, sites undergoing both differentiation and/or zzso These results identify a group of zzso expressed genes in the zzso including zzso and provide new focal targets for studying processes controlling cellular zzso during zzso The important roles of zzso in controlling the activities and turnover of key signaling proteins suggest potential roles in controlling critical aspects of zzso
