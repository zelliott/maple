At distinct times during embryonic development and after vascular injury, smooth muscle cells zzso exhibit a highly zzso zzso growth zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the functional role of zzso zzso protein zzso and upstream positive and negative regulators in the control of zzso zzso zzso 

We previously reported increased expression of zzso zzso was associated with this unique growth zzso Using zzso and Western zzso analysis, we report high levels of total and zzso and increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso upstream positive regulators of zzso in rat embryonic zzso and adult zzso carotid arteries compared with zzso adult zzso and zzso carotid zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that cultured embryonic and zzso zzso that exhibited zzso growth capabilities expressed high levels of zzso and zzso active zzso zzso and zzso zzso and molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso using zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso suppressed embryonic and zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, decreased activity of zzso an zzso negative regulator of zzso zzso was associated with high in zzso zzso growth rates, and zzso loss of zzso zzso induced a zzso growth zzso in cultured zzso zzso 

The possibility exists that cells that exhibit a distinct zzso growth zzso different from traditional zzso are major contributors to zzso zzso Growth of zzso that exhibit this zzso is dependent on zzso zzso and zzso signaling and is actively inhibited through the timed acquisition of the zzso produced growth zzso zzso
