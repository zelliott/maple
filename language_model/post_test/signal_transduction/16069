We combined zzso modeling and experimental zzso to determine the influence of zzso structure on the diffusion of zzso chemical signals in mouse zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso Modeling predicts that molecular zzso by zzso spines causes diffusion along zzso zzso to be anomalous and that the value of the anomalous zzso zzso ) is zzso to spine density in both cell zzso To test these predictions we combined the local zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso imaging to track diffusion along zzso Our results show that anomalous diffusion is present in zzso zzso of both cell zzso Further, the anomalous zzso is zzso related to the density of spines in zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells is consistent with such a zzso We conclude that anomalous diffusion occurs in the zzso of multiple types of zzso Because spine density is dynamic and depends on zzso activity, the degree of anomalous diffusion induced by spines can zzso regulate the movement of molecules along zzso
