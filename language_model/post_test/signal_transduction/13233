Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso those targeting zzso 3 zzso have a high sensitivity and specificity for zzso zzso zzso A zzso role for these zzso has been proposed due to their capacity of zzso zzso in zzso Recently, zzso was also detected in human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeting zzso from zzso serum on isolated human zzso zzso cell signaling and inflammatory zzso release was zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in surface expression of zzso as zzso in zzso studies and by flow zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulting in a remarkable zzso of zzso Control zzso was entirely zzso whereas zzso reproduced the zzso zzso The signaling response was accompanied by a pronounced release of zzso into the cell zzso Moreover, large amounts of zzso and, to a lesser extent, of zzso zzso the stable zzso of zzso were zzso from zzso zzso In zzso a rise in zzso zzso levels was observed, which was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso We conclude that zzso zzso directly target zzso zzso thereby provoking pronounced zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso Associated zzso events such as the release of zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso may directly contribute to the development of zzso zzso and loss of kidney function in zzso
