zzso acts as a potent zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso also express functional zzso receptors which mediate the cellular effects of zzso Using the binding on zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso a zzso zzso raised against the functional zzso zzso we demonstrate here that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso effect is observed at zzso M zzso corresponding to zzso of approximately zzso of zzso zzso It is zzso at 20 zzso and persists for at least 24 zzso This effect is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso and involves a zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso does not induce zzso zzso degradation nor change in zzso zzso zzso level after 2 h and 24 h of zzso These results indicate that partial zzso zzso of the functional zzso zzso is induced by zzso
