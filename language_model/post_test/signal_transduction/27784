Acute zzso zzso zzso exhibits a characteristic zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso to the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso gene on zzso In a small subset of acute zzso zzso zzso zzso is fused to a different zzso the zzso zzso zinc finger zzso gene on zzso the zzso zzso gene on zzso or the nuclear zzso apparatus zzso gene on zzso We report on the molecular characterization of a zzso gene zzso in a patient with zzso and demonstrate that the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso gene is fused with zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso component of the zzso protein is zzso from the zzso to the nucleus, where it displays a zzso zzso zzso unusual features of this zzso might result from zzso of the zzso signal zzso pathways in the patient zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso as a new gene fused to zzso in zzso this is the first human zzso bearing a structurally abnormal zzso zzso
