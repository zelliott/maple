zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso which is widely used in treatment of type 2 diabetes, has shown some therapeutic effect in Alzheimer's zzso In this study, effects of acute zzso on zzso consolidation and retrieval of memory, and also the involvement of zzso oxide zzso in the effects of zzso on spatial recognition memory has been investigated in a zzso recognition zzso test and passive avoidance in zzso Memory impairment was induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 and zzso zzso was zzso prior to either zzso consolidation or retention trials, while zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso NO zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso zzso before each zzso 

1) zzso improved the acquisition of recognition spatial zzso by zzso zzso dramatically reversed improving effects of zzso on memory zzso 2) zzso did not change the consolidation of spatial memory, impaired by zzso 3) zzso improved the retrieval of spatial memory and zzso did not alter the beneficial effect of zzso 4) zzso did not affect zzso cognitive zzso in the passive avoidance zzso The present study demonstrates the beneficial effect of acute zzso administration on acquisition and retrieval of zzso cognitive zzso This effect was reversed only in acquisition phase by zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso therefore, it could be concluded that NO might be involved in the zzso beneficial effect of spatial memory zzso
