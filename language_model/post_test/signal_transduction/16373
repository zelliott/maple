zzso a zzso zzso possesses multiple pharmacological actions including zzso and zzso zzso However, the precise action mechanisms of zzso remain zzso Here, we reported the regulatory actions of zzso on zzso zzso an important zzso in inflammation and tumor promotion, and revealed the underlying zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso zzso zzso production, as well as zzso promoter zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso also significantly inhibited zzso zzso in human zzso cells in a zzso zzso The in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso considerably inhibited the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and blocked the recruitment of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, thereby attenuating the zzso zzso of zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was as effective as zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells did not change the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene delivery of zzso active zzso significantly reversed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso suppresses zzso expression by zzso the zzso signaling and blocking the binding of multiple zzso to zzso zzso Our findings therefore reveal a novel mechanism of action of zzso and suggest a potential use for zzso in the treatment of zzso diseases such as breast zzso
