Diabetes is characterized by decreased function of zzso beta cells and insufficient insulin output resulting from an absolute zzso 1) or relative zzso 2) inadequate functional beta cell zzso Both forms of the disease would greatly benefit from treatment strategies that could enhance beta cell zzso and/or zzso zzso and reliable methods of generating beta cells or whole zzso from zzso cells in zzso or in zzso could lead to restoration of beta cell mass in individuals with Type 1 diabetes and enhanced beta cell compensation in Type 2 zzso A thorough understanding of the normal zzso processes that occur during pancreatic zzso for example, zzso factors, cell signaling zzso and zzso interactions that regulate zzso differentiation from the embryonic pancreatic zzso is required in order to successfully reach these zzso This review summarizes our current understanding of zzso development, with particular emphasis on factors intrinsic or zzso to the pancreatic zzso that are involved in regulating the development and differentiation of the various pancreatic cell zzso We also discuss the recent progress in generating zzso cells from zzso zzso
