Our immune system has to constantly strike a balance between zzso and zzso of an inflammatory response to combat invading pathogens and avoid zzso collateral tissue zzso Toll zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in the zzso The biological role of zzso zzso during infection is, however, zzso We therefore evaluated zzso zzso expression during zzso coli zzso and explored its role in host defense using zzso versus zzso zzso We found that zzso protein is abundantly present in the majority of cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited an effective host response against zzso coli, as indicated by diminished zzso bacterial outgrowth and dysfunction in zzso zzso This correlated with increased amounts of circulating and zzso zzso at the early phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had increased zzso production when zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso coli, suggesting that zzso played an zzso role during pathogen stimulation by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is an important negative regulator of an zzso inflammatory response in zzso zzso cells and zzso an effective zzso host response during zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso
