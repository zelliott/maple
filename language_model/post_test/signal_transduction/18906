Better understanding of tolerance and zzso toward zzso zzso is needed to develop effective treatment for zzso and zzso zzso yet, a systematic assessment of these mechanisms has been hampered by the difficulty in tracking zzso T zzso To address this issue, we have generated transgenic mice that express zzso egg zzso as a zzso zzso By crossing these animals to a zzso egg zzso zzso zzso transgenic line we have been able to track zzso zzso T cells from their development in the zzso to their involvement in spontaneous zzso disease with striking similarity to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso destruction of zzso is partially inhibited by blocking zzso zzso interactions and also highlights the importance of local control of zzso as zzso remains zzso and never proceeds to zzso even when zzso and zzso zzso T cells are zzso zzso therapy to enhance or suppress zzso T cells can be directed at a series of zzso pathways involving tolerance and cell zzso
