zzso but not zzso is essential for the development of zzso tissue inflammation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso impact on the polarization of zzso and zzso cells, zzso While both polarized T helper populations can mediate zzso zzso their zzso in the zzso of zzso indicates that zzso exerts its crucial influence on the disease independent of its T helper polarizing zzso To study the impact of zzso and zzso on the behavior of zzso T cells in zzso we generated zzso mice in which we can trace individual populations of zzso or zzso responsive T helper cells during zzso We observed that T cells, which lack zzso (no zzso and zzso zzso fail to invade the zzso and do not acquire a zzso zzso In contrast, loss of zzso signaling prevents zzso polarization but does not prevent zzso entry into the zzso The loss of zzso engagement does not appear to alter zzso expansion but leads to their zzso in secondary zzso zzso We found that zzso licenses T cells to invade the target tissue and to exert their zzso function, whereas zzso is critical for zzso zzso but does not influence the zzso capacity of zzso T helper cells in zzso
