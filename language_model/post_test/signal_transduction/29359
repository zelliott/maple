The strain designated zzso zzso zzso zzso that was used for experiments in this paper is zzso zzso a species closely related to zzso zzso (and formerly termed the Mouse zzso strain of zzso zzso This conclusion was verified by deep sequencing and by zzso using zzso zzso All data presented in the results section that refer to zzso zzso should be interpreted as referring to zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso lacks the consensus zzso repeats present in zzso zzso zzso we cannot make any conclusions about the role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the conclusion that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a target of zzso zzso is still valid as these experiments were performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms involved in early events in zzso zzso infection, we conducted a large scale unbiased zzso interference screen in zzso zzso zzso zzso This allowed identification of candidate host factors in a simple zzso genetically zzso zzso From a library of zzso double stranded zzso zzso we identified approximately 226 host zzso including two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso related zzso a zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso We further examined the role of these two zzso in zzso zzso binding and zzso into zzso zzso Both zzso are zzso upon infection and recruited to the site of bacterial attachment, but their roles in the infectious process are zzso We provide evidence that zzso may function as a zzso as zzso of zzso by zzso interference or by zzso zzso zzso significantly reduces bacterial zzso whereas depletion of zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso can occur through zzso of zzso or through independent zzso of zzso zzso culminating in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we show that zzso a bacterial type III zzso zzso zzso implicated in entry, is a target of zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso function zzso to promote efficient zzso of this zzso zzso zzso
