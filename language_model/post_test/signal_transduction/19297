The human zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso of zzso immune zzso To study interactions between zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso bacteria, a functional zzso approach was zzso One interest of zzso is to provide access to zzso of zzso zzso We aimed at identifying bacterial genes involved in regulation of zzso signaling in zzso A high zzso zzso screening zzso allowing rapid detection of zzso zzso in zzso was established using the zzso strategy to screen zzso libraries issued from the human zzso zzso 

A zzso containing the zzso alkaline zzso zzso gene under the control of zzso binding elements was zzso zzso in zzso zzso The reporter clone zzso was selected and zzso Then, a first screening of a zzso library from Crohn's disease patients was performed to identify zzso modulating zzso Furthermore, genes potentially involved in the effect of one zzso zzso clone were determined by sequence analysis associated to zzso by zzso 

The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to activate the reporter system, translating the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso BAY zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A screening of zzso zzso clones led to the identification of zzso modulating zzso Among them, one zzso zzso zzso zzso was further zzso zzso analysis revealed that its zzso DNA insert might belong to a new zzso strain and we identified 2 zzso zzso an ABC transport system and a putative zzso potentially involved in zzso effect on zzso 

We have established a robust high zzso screening zzso for zzso libraries derived from the human zzso zzso to study zzso zzso zzso This opens a strategic path toward the identification of bacterial strains and molecular patterns presenting a potential therapeutic zzso
