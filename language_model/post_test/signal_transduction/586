Cellular prion protein zzso is a ubiquitous zzso whose zzso role is poorly zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso in zzso zzso copper zzso and signal zzso In this study we detailed the zzso events induced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found a zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, which leads to a rapid and transient zzso of zzso regulated zzso In addition, this zzso cascade relies on the engagement of zzso and involves focal zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated the zzso zzso of zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso and showed that zzso scaffolds and coordinates protein complexes involved in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso is a mechanism for recruiting the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso so as to terminate cell zzso zzso our data support a significant role for zzso as a response zzso in zzso and cell zzso
