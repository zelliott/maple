The zzso system zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the two most important mechanisms that normally repair or remove abnormal zzso zzso in the function of these systems to degrade zzso and zzso proteins are being increasingly recognized as playing a pivotal role in the zzso of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's zzso zzso of the UPS has been already strongly implicated in the zzso of this disease and, more recently, growing interest has been shown in identifying the role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and the increase of zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been associated with Parkinson's disease zzso The demonstration that zzso is zzso by both zzso and zzso indicates a possible linkage between the dysfunction of the UPS or zzso and the occurrence of this zzso The fact that zzso zzso inhibit zzso functioning by tightly binding to the zzso on the zzso membrane for zzso zzso further supports the assumption that impairment of the zzso may be related to the development of Parkinson's zzso In this review, we zzso the recent findings related to this topic and discuss the unique role of the zzso in this zzso disorder and the putative therapeutic potential through zzso zzso
