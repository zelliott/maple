It has been suggested that fetal zzso exposure might lead to predisposition to develop cancer during childhood or in later life possibly through zzso of the fetal zzso Because gender effects in the zzso of childhood zzso have been zzso we hypothesized differences at the zzso level in zzso blood between male and female newborns as a consequence of fetal zzso zzso The objective was to investigate whether zzso responses to dietary zzso and zzso zzso show zzso zzso relevant for chemical zzso 

Global gene expression was applied in zzso zzso blood samples, the zzso was used for measuring zzso zzso and zzso internal exposure, and zzso zzso levels were determined by mass zzso zzso To link gene expression to an established zzso zzso of cancer risk, zzso zzso were zzso 

While exposure levels did not differ between sexes at birth, important zzso differences were observed in gene expressions associated with these zzso linked with cell cycle, the immune system and more general cellular processes such as zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso genes between male and female newborns were identified in relation to the different zzso of exposure that might be relevant to zzso predisposition to develop these zzso in zzso zzso This study reveals different zzso responses to environmental zzso between the zzso In particular, zzso zzso signaling upon zzso exposure and zzso of the zzso in boys upon zzso exposure might represent possible zzso explanations for gender specificity in the zzso of childhood zzso
