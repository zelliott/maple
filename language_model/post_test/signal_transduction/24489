Proper patterning of zzso zzso like the hair zzso requires exquisite regulation of growth zzso Sonic zzso zzso signaling in skin controls the growth and zzso of hair zzso zzso in part through regulating the zzso zzso zzso While zzso induction of zzso target genes leads to hair zzso tumors, such as zzso cell zzso how zzso signaling normally functions during the zzso process of hair development is zzso Here, we show that, during the hair cycle, zzso expression and the ability of skin cells to respond to zzso signaling is zzso and temporally zzso zzso of zzso target genes normally occurs only in the zzso hair zzso in response to expression of zzso However, in zzso zzso mice, putative tumor precursors form with zzso induction of zzso target gene zzso only during zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso production of zzso accumulates zzso protein and zzso zzso target genes and zzso tumors at zzso but not other zzso pointing to a restricted competence occurring at the level of zzso protein zzso zzso and reception of growth signals among zzso cells are restricted in time and space to facilitate zzso pattern zzso
