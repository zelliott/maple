zzso the main zzso zzso acid zzso regulates protein zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso It is critically involved in the continuous change of the protein repertoire that is inherent to synaptic zzso zzso differential gene expression occurs both in zzso and zzso zzso In fact, besides a membrane to zzso signaling that leads to zzso control, a zzso effect in overall protein synthesis takes place after zzso receptors stimulation in cultured chick zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso receptors zzso on translation zzso was zzso A zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso tools established that zzso and zzso but not zzso trigger this zzso The removal of external zzso or the zzso with a zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through the involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso receptors regulate the zzso of zzso chains in zzso zzso
