We have examined the mechanism by which the zzso factor zzso stimulates target gene expression following its zzso at zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we found that two signals were required for target gene zzso a zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso II via the zzso zzso and a zzso domain interaction with zzso via zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso activity by binding to zzso and specifically blocking recruitment of zzso Pol II to the zzso Our results suggest that the recruitment of zzso Pol II complexes per zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso and that zzso recruitment of zzso is additionally required for induction of zzso zzso
