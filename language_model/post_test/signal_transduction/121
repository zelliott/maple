zzso clocks zzso to the solar day by sensing the zzso changes in light and zzso In adult zzso the brain clock that controls zzso rhythms relies on zzso showing Period zzso Nine of these zzso are present in each zzso brain zzso They can receive light zzso through zzso zzso and the visual system, but temperature input pathways are zzso Here, we investigate how the zzso clock network responds to light and zzso We focused on the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso cycles set molecular zzso almost in zzso to all other clock zzso We first showed that the phasing of the zzso in zzso depends on the zzso factor zzso zzso in four lateral zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso in the zzso In the absence of zzso zzso these cells appear blind, but still zzso to temperature zzso Period zzso in the zzso were stronger in zzso than in zzso but with a very similar zzso zzso the zzso of zzso were weaker in zzso than in zzso and were zzso in zzso with the zzso whereas the phase of the three other clock zzso was advanced by a few zzso In the absence of any other functional clock zzso the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso cycles but not by temperature zzso Our results show that the zzso clock zzso respond very differently to light and temperature, and strongly suggest that the zzso zzso play a prominent role in the temperature zzso of the zzso
