zzso receptors zzso play a role in different types of pain and in central zzso mechanism in spinal zzso However, it is currently unexplored whether zzso are involved in zzso pain zzso Here we show whether a selective zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso responses in the mouse zzso zzso model and the number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso In addition, it was examined whether the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which are closely linked to pain signaling and zzso in zzso was modified by zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso injected into the right upper lip, and the rubbing responses with zzso zzso or hind paw were counted for zzso zzso zzso 3 or zzso were zzso treated zzso before zzso zzso High dose of zzso zzso produced significant zzso effects in the first and the second zzso The number of zzso cells in zzso side of zzso was also reduced by zzso as compared to that in zzso zzso In addition, the number of zzso cells in zzso zzso was decreased in zzso animals, whereas the number of zzso cells was not zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso play a pivotal role in the zzso pain processing, and the zzso signaling zzso can be associated with zzso action in zzso
