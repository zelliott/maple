The zzso zzso and zzso are recruited by zzso acid receptors zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso in zzso acid zzso growth arrest in zzso zzso cells, two systems were zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso cells were zzso with a functional zzso 2; zzso normal human zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso with a zzso dominant negative, zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 in zzso cells resulted in increased sensitivity to zzso growth arrest and correlated with induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso function in zzso resulted in resistance to zzso growth arrest and loss of zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso in zzso resulted in decreased zzso acid response element reporter zzso and decreased zzso growth zzso Thus, in human zzso zzso cells, zzso were both modulated by an zzso signaling zzso and were required for a normal response to zzso
