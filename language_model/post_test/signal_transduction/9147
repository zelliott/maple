zzso is one of the most important traits for efficient zzso colonization by zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso is a zzso trait that is zzso by at least three independent zzso including the zzso zzso system, the zzso zzso pathway, and the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso which encodes a signal zzso protein that together with zzso has been implicated in zzso production, zzso in swimming zzso repression through the zzso pathway, acting downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are impaired in secondary zzso production and are zzso as zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso and a triple zzso affected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess a zzso zzso for secondary zzso The zzso strain is zzso and more competitive for zzso colonization than the zzso zzso We have compared the zzso activity of zzso with those of the zzso strain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso and zzso but is affected in secondary metabolism since it harbors a zzso zzso zzso experiments in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that the three strains possess zzso zzso zzso activity was consistently lower for zzso indicating that the production of secondary zzso was the most important trait for zzso zzso zzso showed improved zzso compared with the zzso strain, indicating that an increase in competitive colonization ability resulted in improved zzso and that the rational design of zzso agents by zzso is zzso
