zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso possesses zzso activity to specifically zzso the zzso zzso product zzso in the regulation of insulin zzso In the present study, we examined the impact of zzso on the regulation of insulin signaling leading to protein synthesis in zzso zzso cultured with standard and excess zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso increase in the amount of zzso zzso association of zzso with zzso and protein synthesis were decreased by zzso of zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the regulation of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was somewhat zzso by the incubation with zzso excess zzso of zzso acids for 30 zzso In contrast, the impact of zzso expression was diminished in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso after the incubation for 16 zzso Interestingly, incubation with the excess zzso of zzso acids for 30 zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso Furthermore, although the exposure for longer time periods up to 24 h did not elicit zzso of zzso it markedly induced zzso of zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the negative regulation of insulin signaling for the protein synthesis and that the impact of zzso is altered, dependent on the acute or chronic exposure of excess zzso of zzso acids in zzso
