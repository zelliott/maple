To investigate the zzso regulation of zzso channel zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso and its zzso 

Neonatal rat zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso current was recorded using the zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by quantitative zzso 

zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These effects were blocked by specific ETA zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso expression were not affected by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso stimulates the expression of zzso channel zzso in zzso via ETA zzso through a zzso zzso signaling pathway, which might be linked to the intrinsic zzso potential of zzso
