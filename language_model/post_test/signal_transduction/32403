In single cells isolated from guinea-pig zzso smooth muscle, held under zzso clamp at zzso zzso or zzso zzso by patch zzso in the zzso recording mode, zzso zzso evoked an zzso inward zzso zzso The frequency of current zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso current zzso were followed very closely by zzso in zzso free zzso estimated from the zzso zzso and were abolished by inclusion of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso blocked the generation of current zzso zzso current zzso were abolished upon withdrawal of zzso calcium and restored upon its zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso solution caused the generation of an zzso inward zzso which was blocked by zzso The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso current is gated by zzso of a G protein and is steeply dependent on zzso fluctuations in the release of zzso from stores during zzso action produce zzso in zzso which cause similar zzso in the zzso zzso
