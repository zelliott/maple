zzso zzso growth zzso stimulates cell proliferation by functioning on both sides of the plasma membrane as a zzso for membrane zzso binding to trigger cell zzso and as a zzso for DNA synthesis in the zzso Although zzso was initially identified as a zzso zzso zzso the biological significance of its zzso ability remains to be zzso In the present study we demonstrate that cells devoid of surface HS zzso zzso were unable to zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso consisting of zzso acid zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form of zzso devoid of zzso binding zzso suggesting that the binding of zzso to surface HS is important for zzso zzso We further demonstrate that both zzso and zzso could be zzso through zzso after binding to the cell surface zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso is found to exhibit an zzso effect on cell migration and proliferation in contrast with that observed for zzso action on zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso exploits the innate properties of both cell surface HS and membrane zzso via the zzso domain to affect related cell zzso zzso The present study indicates that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathways could be affected by the zzso zzso zzso to regulate cell migration in zzso zzso zzso as judged from the differential effect of zzso and zzso treatment on the expression level of zzso zzso
