zzso can influence lung inflammation by various mechanisms, including via zzso and zzso of zzso receptors zzso such as zzso In addition, zzso such as zzso and/or zzso zzso can disarm zzso resulting in loss of zzso zzso Currently, the role of zzso in host defense against bacterial infection is not zzso Using a zzso model of acute zzso zzso pneumonia, we examined differences in the pulmonary inflammatory response between zzso and zzso zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso mice displayed more severe lung inflammation and injury in response to zzso zzso infection as indicated by higher zzso zzso fluid zzso numbers, protein zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso levels were markedly reduced in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso clearance of zzso zzso was diminished in zzso zzso In zzso testing revealed that zzso zzso killed significantly less bacteria than zzso zzso zzso Further, both zzso and zzso from zzso mice displayed significantly reduced zzso efficiency compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso using a zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso directly implicating zzso signaling in the zzso zzso We conclude that genetic deletion of zzso is associated with decreased clearance of zzso zzso Our data suggest that a zzso in zzso production and impaired bacterial zzso are two potential mechanisms responsible for this zzso
