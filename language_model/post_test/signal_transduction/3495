zzso in the zzso zzso which produces transcripts with either short or long 3' untranslated regions zzso zzso cause human zzso however, the precise role of zzso zzso factor zzso in the regulation of energy balance is zzso Here we show the relationship between zzso zzso with a long 3' zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and body zzso We found that long 3' zzso zzso zzso was enriched in the zzso of zzso zzso and that insulin and zzso could stimulate its translation in zzso Furthermore, mice harboring a truncated long zzso 3' zzso developed severe zzso zzso which was completely reversed by viral expression of long 3' zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In these mice, the ability of zzso to activate zzso zzso and inhibit food intake was compromised despite normal zzso of zzso zzso These results reveal a novel mechanism linking zzso action to zzso expression during zzso regulation of body weight, while also implicating zzso protein synthesis in this zzso
