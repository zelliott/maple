zzso targeting of membrane proteins is zzso by the universally zzso signal recognition particle zzso In zzso zzso zzso translation during zzso however, in zzso a simplified zzso is believed to carry out targeting during continuing zzso Here, we show a detailed zzso analysis of the targeting of zzso c of the zzso component of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso to the inner zzso We show that the first zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso forms a zzso structure within the zzso portion of the zzso zzso This structure is formed just prior to the interaction with zzso In the absence of zzso this structure is lost as the TM domain exits the zzso however in the presence of zzso it is zzso Our results suggest differences in early protein folding of zzso for zzso zzso membrane protein targeting zzso from that of zzso zzso zzso These results imply that early TM domain recognition by targeting factors acts to ensure that the efficiency of membrane targeting is zzso
