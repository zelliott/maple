zzso and zzso D1 have attracted considerable attention due to their zzso roles in human zzso The finding of zzso D1 as a direct target gene of zzso in colon cancer cells led to the assumption that zzso D1 zzso is pivotal to zzso zzso Our recent paper shows that this is not the zzso zzso D1 zzso the zzso of activated zzso zzso The relationships and zzso of zzso and zzso D1 point to zzso essential and sequential roles during zzso These results support the concept that both zzso and zzso zzso actions are more sophisticated than simple acceleration of the cell cycle zzso These proteins are employed at critical zzso involving cell fate decisions that we speculate require specific types of cell cycle to zzso
