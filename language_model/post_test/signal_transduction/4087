zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is the most common type of zzso cancer in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a fraction of sporadic zzso have lost the function of zzso zzso a Sonic zzso zzso zzso that acts zzso on this zzso zzso zzso of zzso can induce zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso in the embryonic zzso zzso results in the development of zzso that express zzso zzso We also show that zzso and the zzso genes are normally expressed in hair zzso and that human sporadic zzso consistently express zzso but not zzso or zzso Because zzso but not zzso acts as a target and zzso of zzso zzso our results suggest that expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Moreover, loss of zzso or zzso of zzso cannot be the sole causes of zzso induction and sporadic zzso formation, as they do not occur zzso Thus any zzso leading to the expression of zzso in zzso cells are predicted to induce zzso zzso
