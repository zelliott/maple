zzso II zzso helps to regulate overall zzso zzso zzso of salt and water, yet its effects in the zzso zzso have not been well zzso The purpose of these studies was to determine whether zzso stimulates zzso zzso transport in the cortical collecting duct zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso as a reflection of zzso transport across the zzso zzso was measured with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated, zzso zzso segments dissected from rabbit zzso Control zzso during zzso with 25 zzso zzso and a zzso solution in the bath containing the zzso zzso (10 zzso to eliminate zzso membrane zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 150 zzso elevated zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7; P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso added to the zzso significantly elevated baseline zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased the magnitude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and initial rate ( approximately 5 zzso of change in zzso to increased zzso zzso zzso when added to the bath had similar zzso zzso however, zzso was much more effective from the zzso Thus, zzso significantly increased the zzso entry of zzso in the zzso To determine if this zzso entry step occurred via the zzso zzso channel zzso studies were performed using the specific zzso blocker, zzso zzso zzso zzso When added to the zzso zzso almost completely inhibited the zzso in zzso to increased zzso zzso in both the presence and absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso directly stimulates zzso channel activity in the zzso zzso zzso blockade with zzso or zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso effects of zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso in health and zzso
