zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso chain zzso results in increased vulnerability to zzso zzso strains of zzso and zzso This zzso results from the combined lack of zzso and zzso signaling as both zzso receptors share zzso Such infections can be treated by administration of antibiotics and zzso however, patients can succumb to infections despite these zzso zzso of patients' zzso by corrective gene transfer could prevent the infectious episodes, thus providing a beneficial zzso We therefore evaluated the feasibility of zzso gene correction of T cells obtained from patients carrying zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso restored the expression of zzso and resulted in the zzso of a functional zzso signaling pathway, as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production in response to zzso was also corrected after gene zzso These results indicate that the biological defects of T cells from patients carrying zzso zzso can be corrected by gene transfer and form the basis for further development of gene therapy for this zzso
