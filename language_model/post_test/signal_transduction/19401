As zzso mature, the concentration of zzso zzso zzso increases in the zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the progressive zzso of zzso started from the zzso zone and peaked in the zzso zone of growth zzso Although zzso zzso is reported to be involved in the zzso and zzso of mature zzso its role in zzso zzso remains zzso Here we investigated this role utilizing zzso an established cell model of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, we found that the expression of zzso D1 was zzso and that of alkaline zzso zzso was zzso in response to an increase in zzso zzso within zzso Moreover, an increase in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, and treatment with a zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the effects on the expression of zzso D1 and zzso indicating that zzso zzso regulates the expression of these genes through the zzso zzso zzso with its zzso of zzso D1 zzso the zzso zzso facilitated the proliferation of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acid zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and gene expression induced by the increase in zzso zzso zzso down of the type III zzso zzso zzso diminished the responsiveness of zzso cells to the increase in zzso zzso Interestingly, the increased zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso which was also zzso by knocking down of the expression of zzso In primary zzso isolated from mouse rib cages as well, increased zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso in the expression of zzso D1 and zzso both of which were abolished by treatment with zzso These results suggest that signaling by zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso and leads to zzso of the zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso which zzso the proliferation of immature zzso
