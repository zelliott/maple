The zzso showed by zzso an interesting zzso of the title compounds, for zzso human colon cancer cells zzso value of zzso zzso zzso has been related to the induced cell death at the zzso phase and not to DNA zzso This compound promotes the degradation of components of the zzso checkpoint machinery, in particular zzso zzso B1 and zzso which represents a novel mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso seems to be zzso by zzso activity but degradation of zzso has to occur through a different zzso The activity of zzso on zzso cell cycle components suggests that tumor cells that are arrested in zzso by zzso drugs like zzso could be targeted by compound zzso increasing the zzso zzso and that their zzso zzso might be useful in the treatment of colon cancer through combination therapies with zzso or other zzso drugs that affect the zzso integrity such as zzso and zzso zzso studies with compounds obtained by manipulation of the zzso and zzso groups and the zzso of compound zzso have confirmed the importance of these structural features in the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives as compound 5 were zzso and the lack of activity found in the replacement of the zzso by a zzso function, as in compounds zzso could be explained considering that their zzso relative zzso makes them too stable to generate zzso zzso zzso
