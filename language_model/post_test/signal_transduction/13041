zzso have been implicated in regulating zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso but the structural features in the zzso required for this effect are zzso In the present study performed in zzso cells, we demonstrated that different zzso zzso of zzso are implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tail zzso selective zzso of the zzso tail to remove the sites of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the third zzso zzso zzso or in the third zzso loop zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in zzso protein zzso To better define the role of these zzso zzso we have tested the ability of these zzso zzso to associate with zzso by using three different zzso zzso 1) ability of zzso of zzso to restore the zzso of zzso protein for the zzso zzso 2) zzso of zzso trafficking of zzso and zzso fused to the green fluorescent protein with receptors by zzso zzso 3) zzso of zzso fluorescent protein zzso by Western zzso Our data reveal that the zzso zzso tail contains zzso of zzso interaction that are distinct from the zzso sites and are sufficient for transient association of zzso but stable association requires zzso zzso zzso in the zzso core zzso and zzso appear to regulate zzso of the zzso complex toward early zzso zzso during the initial step of zzso
