zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso involved in respiratory zzso in zzso Although this complex in zzso coli is known to operate with both zzso and zzso the location and the number of zzso binding sites remain zzso zzso strongly zzso a zzso radical located within the zzso anchor zzso zzso To identify its location and function, we used a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso no zzso signal of the zzso was zzso In contrast, a zzso was detected in the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso Its zzso properties and zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso are identical to those observed in the native zzso The substitution by Ala of the zzso zzso close to zzso zzso which was previously proposed to be in a zzso zzso site of zzso zzso also leads to the loss of the zzso signal of the zzso although both zzso are zzso zzso zzso carried out on the zzso zzso reveal that the substitution dramatically reduces the rate of zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that the zzso observed in zzso is strongly associated with zzso zzso and that zzso is required for its zzso Overall, our results indicate that the zzso is located within the zzso zzso site zzso Details of the possible binding motif of the zzso and zzso implications are zzso
