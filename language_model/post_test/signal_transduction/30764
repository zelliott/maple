zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been recently recognized as important zzso of cell zzso regulating basic cellular processes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso they can also act as first and second zzso Although their zzso of zzso zzso receptors has been studied zzso not much is known about heir zzso mechanism of action, and their target proteins are yet to be zzso We hypothesized that these zzso might bind to zzso zzso the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing intrinsic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance revealed that zzso binds to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso when compared with the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso carried out with the model zzso domain zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex, suggesting an zzso zzso The functional effect of the interaction was examined on two target zzso zzso and zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso Thus we propose that zzso might be an zzso zzso for zzso and raise the possibility of a novel zzso regulation of zzso
