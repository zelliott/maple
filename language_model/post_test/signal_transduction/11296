zzso of different components of the zzso complex zzso cause muscular zzso that vary in terms of severity, age of zzso and selective involvement of muscle zzso Although the primary zzso processes in the muscular zzso have clearly been identified as zzso and zzso muscle cell death, the zzso mechanisms that lead to cell death remain to be zzso Studies of components of the zzso in muscle and in zzso zzso have revealed that the zzso is undoubtedly a zzso complex and a highly dynamic structure, in contrast to the zzso concept of the zzso as a mechanical component in the zzso Analysis of the zzso reveals compelling analogies to two other zzso protein complexes, namely zzso and zzso Each of these complexes mediates signal zzso zzso in the cell, and disruption of each complex causes muscular zzso The signal zzso zzso associated with the zzso like those associated with zzso and zzso play important roles in cell survival zzso cellular defense mechanisms, and regulation of the balance between cell survival and cell zzso This review focuses on the functional components of the zzso highlighting the evidence of their participation in cellular signaling processes important for cell zzso zzso the link between these functional components and the zzso processes leading to cell death is the zzso challenge to understanding the mechanisms of disease expression in the muscular zzso due to defects in the zzso
