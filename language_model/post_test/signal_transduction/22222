zzso zzso stress induced by zzso oxygen species zzso has been strongly associated with the zzso of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease zzso We used zzso transgenic zzso cell zzso models of sporadic zzso zzso which zzso zzso compared to control zzso to investigate the protective effects of zzso an zzso zzso from Chinese herb zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso had increased zzso and increased zzso of zzso that was inhibited by zzso Western zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso had increased zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that were inhibited by zzso zzso was also found to decrease zzso zzso These results suggest that expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso activates zzso signaling pathways and reduces zzso and that the protective effects of zzso inhibit zzso zzso through zzso of zzso ratio, which blocks the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may act as an zzso zzso scavenger, and protect zzso against zzso zzso
