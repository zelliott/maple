Increased generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in vascular diseases such as zzso diabetes, chronic zzso failure and zzso readily leads to impaired zzso relaxation and vascular zzso To counteract zzso and zzso injury, cells can induce a number of genes zzso phase II detoxifying zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso regulatory element, designated as zzso response element zzso or zzso response element zzso mediates the zzso zzso of genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso are also involved in scavenging zzso Nuclear zzso zzso factor 2 zzso a member of the Cap zzso zzso family of basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, plays an important role in zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normally sequesters zzso in the zzso in association with the zzso zzso but upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the nucleus and binds to ARE sequences leading to zzso zzso of zzso and phase II detoxifying zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso We here review the evidence that the zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in vascular zzso and the defense of zzso and smooth muscle cells against sustained zzso stress associated with diseases such as zzso and zzso
