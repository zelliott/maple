During organ development, local changes in gene expression govern zzso and cell zzso We have generated a zzso zzso of zzso gene expression of embryonic zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso zzso first appears as a single mass of zzso cells surrounded by zzso and it zzso rapid branching zzso to form a complex zzso organ with zzso connected to an extensive zzso zzso Using laser capture zzso we collected samples from 14 distinct zzso locations at embryonic days zzso zzso 14, and 15, and characterized their gene expression by zzso zzso These zzso results were evaluated by zzso of biological replicates and by comparisons of the gene expression zzso with published expression zzso Using this gene expression zzso to search for novel regulators of branching zzso we found a substantial reduction in zzso levels of zzso at the base of forming zzso This unexpected finding was confirmed by zzso and zzso of zzso activity enhanced zzso zzso zzso This first zzso expression zzso of a developing zzso characterizes changes in local gene expression during zzso zzso development and zzso which should facilitate the identification of key genes involved in tissue zzso
