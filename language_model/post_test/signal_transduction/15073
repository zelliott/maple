zzso for zzso zzso cancer is rarely zzso The recently developed small zzso zzso a dual zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might improve this zzso Recent findings suggest that identifying which patients are likely to benefit from targeted therapies is zzso although controversy remains regarding what types of evaluation might yield optimal candidate zzso of zzso Here, we address this issue by developing and comparing zzso sensitivity prediction models for human zzso cancer zzso After zzso determining in zzso sensitivities zzso concentration necessary to cause a 50% growth zzso of a panel of 39 such lines to zzso treatment, we developed prediction models based on profiling the baseline zzso the zzso status of zzso zzso signaling targets, or a combination of both data zzso We observed that models derived from zzso gene expression data showed better prediction performance zzso zzso compared with models derived from zzso zzso profiling of 23 selected zzso known to be involved in zzso signaling zzso zzso or from a subset of the zzso data for transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Combining zzso data and zzso profiling provided a combination model with zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso profiling for zzso of zzso sensitivity in cancer cells provides models with excellent zzso performance and may be effectively combined with zzso zzso zzso profiling zzso These results have significant implications for the use of such tools in zzso the approach to zzso treated with zzso targeted zzso
