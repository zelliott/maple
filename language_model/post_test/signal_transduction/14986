Small zzso zzso zzso including zzso have been shown to be effective against a range of cancer cell types and zzso can inhibit growth of zzso zzso We compared the efficacy of zzso in three prostate cancer cell types and provide an insight into the mechanism of zzso 

zzso efficacy was measured using proliferation zzso cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso can specifically inhibit proliferation of zzso cells through cell cycle arrest and zzso This zzso with increased levels of the zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso and zzso and recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso also reduces zzso zzso levels, resulting in altered zzso recruitment to zzso 

Our study demonstrates that small zzso zzso zzso might be useful in the treatment of human prostate zzso that retain functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso
