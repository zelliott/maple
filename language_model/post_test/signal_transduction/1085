The expression of mouse zzso is zzso regulated and restricted in zzso zzso which depend largely on zzso signaling for their zzso We examined whether mouse zzso another zzso family member very close to zzso shows similar expression zzso zzso and zzso were expressed mostly in the same embryonic zzso but exhibited complementary patterns in various zzso the lens zzso cells in day zzso zzso expressed zzso whereas the zzso body and zzso zzso expressed zzso In the zzso of day zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the tail region, but zzso was predominantly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso bound to various zzso proteins and inhibited the signaling of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit signaling originated from a zzso active zzso zzso indicating that the zzso occurred upstream of the cell surface zzso zzso also showed zzso activities indistinguishable from those of zzso toward zzso and some zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was absolutely required for the zzso signal zzso zzso All these data suggest that zzso and zzso have the overlapping biological activities but can function in complementary fashion in certain types of zzso
