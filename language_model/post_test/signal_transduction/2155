zzso mature T cell zzso is the result of zzso zzso including the zzso for zzso zzso This raises the possibility that expression of this death zzso could affect bystander T cells that were not directly zzso zzso but that express the zzso zzso We show here that bystander T cells, even if they express the zzso zzso are not killed when exposed to T cells undergoing zzso zzso Rather, cell death is restricted to T cells that bear the zzso zzso that is specifically engaged by zzso zzso At least one mechanism of zzso restriction is a significant enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known ability of zzso to stimulate zzso by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso signals at the time of zzso engagement can effectively increase zzso zzso we put forward the hypothesis that strict zzso specificity is preserved when death zzso such as zzso zzso induce zzso mature T cell zzso at least in part through a zzso signal provided by the zzso zzso
