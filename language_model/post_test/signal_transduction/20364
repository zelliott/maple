zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso response among zzso This zzso stress adaptation and the mode of action involves zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of target gene zzso However, this zzso effect is slow acting and, therefore, a role for zzso in the rapid response to stress is zzso Here we show that stress levels of zzso the primary zzso in zzso rapidly zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso liver plasma zzso in zzso This involved incorporation of the steroid into the zzso zzso as cortisol coupled to a membrane zzso zzso zzso did not affect membrane zzso Studies confirmed that zzso but not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane zzso Atomic force zzso revealed zzso changes to membrane surface topography and zzso confirming changes to membrane zzso Treating trout zzso with stress levels of cortisol led to the zzso of cell signaling zzso including the zzso status of putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins within 10 zzso The zzso by protein zzso in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with zzso alcohol, a known membrane zzso Our results suggest that zzso changes to plasma membrane properties, triggered by zzso zzso zzso act as a zzso stress response and may rapidly zzso acute zzso zzso
