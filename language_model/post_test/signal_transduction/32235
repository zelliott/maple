This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of zzso on the expression patterns of zzso in the zzso of adulthood alone and zzso zzso followed by adulthood zzso rats using discover chips rat zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso X zzso zzso 1, zzso 9, zzso protein 3 and zzso were validated by the zzso The expressions of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and major zzso complex zzso II were assessed zzso however, zzso protein zzso and zzso c zzso and zzso expressions were checked at protein level by western zzso zzso zzso regulated 65 transcripts at one or the other stage of exposure and 21 transcripts exhibited more pronounced zzso in the zzso zzso and adulthood zzso zzso The results of zzso were in accordance with the zzso observations and the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso c and zzso II zzso were increased while the level of zzso zzso c was reduced in adulthood treated zzso The effects were more pronounced in the zzso zzso followed by adulthood zzso zzso The results obtained thus suggest that multiple pathways are involved in the zzso as well as in enhancing the vulnerability of zzso in zzso zzso zzso animals upon zzso during zzso
