The acute phase response is traditionally characterized by zzso synthesis of proteins as an inflammatory response to injury, with zzso zzso being the key zzso In contrast, zzso studies in human zzso transplant zzso zzso indicate a strong acute phase response in the deceased donor zzso associated with a significant zzso of zzso M zzso beta zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the kidney can generate a strong acute phase response, zzso by the zzso zzso Genes associated with the zzso zzso family and acute phase zzso were analyzed by real-time zzso in four groups of human zzso spanning a spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso were progressively more highly expressed from zzso living zzso deceased zzso to discarded donor zzso suggesting correlation with severity of injury and local zzso zzso Acute phase response gene expression was analyzed in human zzso zzso cells in culture in response to zzso zzso induced a significant increase in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso and a decrease in zzso These changes were largely attenuated by zzso with an zzso blocking zzso indicating the zzso effect was zzso through zzso zzso also resulted in a significantly altered expression of acute phase genes compared with zzso or leukemia zzso factor, suggesting that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso acute phase zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is capable of generating a strong acute phase response, likely zzso via zzso
