The expression and signaling of the vitamin D zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma was investigated in the melanoma cell line zzso Using real-time zzso the zzso of the nuclear receptors zzso was zzso The strongest expression was found for the zzso approximately zzso higher compared to the expression of zzso or zzso and the weakest expression was for zzso After treatment with corresponding zzso the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso was elevated up to zzso while the zzso expression was not significantly zzso Treatment with zzso D3 zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso that was associated with a zzso increase in zzso zzso Interestingly, cell proliferation was zzso modulated by treatment with the zzso zzso While zzso acid zzso treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase zzso zzso the other zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both had an zzso effect of approximately zzso These zzso effects were not associated with zzso of zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation of zzso proliferation by zzso was associated with a 3- and zzso increase in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso the zzso treatment resulted in an approximately zzso increase in expression of zzso and zzso while the expression of zzso was zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in an increase in the zzso expression zzso after 120 zzso The simultaneous treatment with zzso partially zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with the zzso zzso had no pronounced effect on the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in an up to zzso reduction of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso and zzso resulted in only marginal zzso of zzso zzso of cell zzso However, simultaneous treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in a statistically significant partial zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso have a role in growth regulation in melanoma cells and functionally relevant zzso between these nuclear signaling pathways is zzso but not at the level of cell zzso where zzso has a dominant zzso
