At the latest stage of terminal differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso a programmed cell death required for the establishment of a functional skin zzso A complex genetic regulatory network zzso the underlying zzso zzso but very few zzso factors specific to this zzso have been identified to zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso approach performed on cells zzso from normal human zzso primarily focusing on the identification of zzso We combined data from zzso analysis of cell zzso enriched in zzso or zzso zzso from an expressed sequence tag zzso library built from zzso and from an in zzso promoter analysis of 52 zzso zzso Among zzso genes potentially expressed in zzso zzso candidates were selected, and half were directly zzso for the first time in the different layers of the zzso by quantitative real-time zzso zzso genes zzso during terminal zzso associated with numerous function of zzso including zzso synthesis and zzso were zzso Of 94 zzso factors zzso 37 were found to be either positively or zzso zzso suggesting their involvement as regulators of gene expression in the zzso These results largely extend the number of genes known as involved in the latest step of the terminal differentiation of human zzso as well as the number of zzso factors known to control the expression of these zzso
