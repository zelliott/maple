zzso interactions induce the expression of zzso a cell surface zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso component of many organ rudiments including the zzso Experimental zzso cultures of early dental zzso and zzso were zzso by double zzso to compare the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso in the induced dental zzso After zzso zzso in culture expression of zzso and zzso as well as an increase in zzso incorporation were evident in the zzso cells adjacent to the zzso and the positive area enlarged with zzso zzso and zzso were zzso only partially in some zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso with their zzso expression pattern during early tooth development in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The area of increased cell proliferation in the zzso correlated closely with zzso zzso In none of the zzso was increased zzso incorporation observed in zzso negative zzso zzso induced also zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and spread of the zzso zone in the dental zzso required close and continuous contact with the zzso The mechanism by which the induction of zzso expression spreads in the zzso was studied in zzso zzso zzso cultures, using zzso zzso that recognize mouse but not rat zzso The rat zzso and zzso were first cultured in contact for 24 zzso Then the zzso was removed and freshly zzso zzso mouse zzso was placed in contact with different aspects of the rat zzso The rat zzso cells that had located next to the zzso tissue zzso zzso expression in adjacent mouse zzso The induction potential was gradually lost toward the periphery of the rat zzso Based on these findings we suggest that zzso signal molecules mediate the spread of zzso induction in the zzso and that zzso plays a role in the regulation of cell zzso
