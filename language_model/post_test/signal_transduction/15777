zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is activated following increases in zzso zzso zzso activates zzso protein zzso I, zzso protein zzso IV, and the zzso protein zzso in a number of zzso zzso including learning and memory formation, zzso zzso and regulation of energy zzso Here, we report the novel regulation of zzso activity by zzso zzso We identify three zzso sites in the N zzso of zzso which regulate its zzso autonomous zzso We then identify the zzso responsible for these zzso as zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso In addition to regulation of autonomous activity, we find that zzso of zzso regulates its zzso We find that cellular levels of zzso correlate with zzso activity and are regulated zzso in zzso Finally, we demonstrate that appropriate zzso of zzso is critical for its role in zzso zzso These results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for zzso signaling zzso
