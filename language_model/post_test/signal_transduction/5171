zzso zzso catalyze zzso deposition of zzso groups, enabling recruitment of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso 4 in zzso zzso a modification localized at the zzso start sites of active zzso is zzso by six zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose specific functions are largely zzso By using a zzso approach, we found that in zzso zzso (also known as zzso was required for the expression of zzso an essential component of the zzso zzso the zzso catalyzing the first step of zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso loading of proteins on the cell zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso the zzso for zzso zzso and other bacterial zzso markedly attenuated zzso zzso signals and gene expression zzso These data link a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso and indicate a specialized biological role for zzso in zzso function and zzso zzso
