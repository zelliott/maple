Experimental zzso zzso zzso is characterized by T zzso zzso inflammation and zzso zzso damage, which can result in the death of germ zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the roles of the zzso and zzso systems in the death of germ cells in mice with zzso that is induced by zzso with zzso zzso germ cells zzso The results using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso show that many terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso germ cells were present in zzso zzso during the active inflammation stage, and these cells were persistently observed in the zzso zzso until the zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso expression levels of both zzso and zzso were increased during the active inflammation stage and were dramatically decreased during the zzso inflammation zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso expression levels of both zzso and zzso did not show significant changes during the active inflammation stage but showed extreme increases during the zzso inflammation zzso zzso some zzso and zzso germ cells were detected during the active inflammation stage, but these were hardly found during the zzso inflammation zzso In contrast, some zzso and zzso germ cells were found during the active inflammation stage, and many of these were also observed during the zzso inflammation zzso These results indicate that germ cell death during zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso and zzso systems during the active inflammation stage but not during the zzso inflammation zzso
