Growing evidence has shown that the zzso of several zzso zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso can be zzso zzso from zzso or zzso cells and function actively in zzso nervous zzso By the zzso and zzso zzso zzso processing, mature zzso are generated and exert their functions in the developing, zzso and pathological zzso While mature zzso exhibit zzso roles via zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso show zzso biological effects that may induce zzso cell death of zzso by triggering zzso signaling zzso In addition, another key zzso factor named zzso zzso factor zzso also appears to be a product generated from zzso and its zzso and potential biological function of zzso remains an zzso zzso Obviously, accumulating studies indicated that the exact or timely zzso processing should be essential for the functional switch from zzso to mature zzso while dysfunction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso release, and abnormal zzso organization of binding receptors might be also zzso involved in zzso of the central zzso zzso and even disease progression of various neurodegenerative diseases in human zzso
