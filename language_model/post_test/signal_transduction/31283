zzso adapt to changes in their environment by the concerted action of many different regulatory zzso Examples of such mechanisms are feedback zzso by zzso of zzso zzso modification of zzso and changes in the abundance of zzso and zzso These mechanisms act in parallel at different levels in the cellular hierarchy while regulating a single zzso zzso zzso regulation analysis determines the relative importance of these mechanisms when the cell regulates a transition from one zzso to zzso Here, the analysis is extended to the regulation of zzso phenomena, for which two methods are introduced and illustrated with a kinetic model incorporating zzso and translation of zzso zzso
