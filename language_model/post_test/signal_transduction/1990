zzso zzso has been reported to zzso T cell behavior both positively and zzso We found that these opposing responses arise from interactions of zzso with two different T cell zzso The zzso zzso recognizes an zzso sequence in the zzso domain of zzso and was required for stimulation of T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression by zzso zzso of zzso by T cells depended on the zzso state of zzso zzso and zzso inhibited interaction of activated zzso zzso on T cells with its counter zzso vascular cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognition site is zzso in zzso A zzso piece of zzso containing this sequence zzso the zzso zzso activities of zzso The zzso zzso recognition sites in zzso however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for zzso of T cell proliferation and T cell zzso zzso signaling by zzso A second zzso zzso zzso was not required for some zzso responses to zzso but played a significant role in its T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the relative expression or function of these two zzso receptors could therefore alter the direction or magnitude of T cell responses to zzso
