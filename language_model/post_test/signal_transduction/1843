We demonstrate in this study that zzso + zzso zzso zzso production is substantially higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso bone zzso mast cells zzso Focusing on zzso we found that the repression of zzso zzso and protein production in zzso zzso requires the zzso activity of zzso because zzso zzso expressing zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso + zzso increase in zzso zzso and protein down to levels seen in zzso zzso Comparing the zzso of various signaling pathways to determine which ones might be responsible for the elevated zzso production in zzso zzso we found the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso pathways are all elevated in zzso + zzso zzso zzso Moreover, inhibitor studies suggested that all these pathways play an essential role in zzso zzso Looking zzso we found that zzso + zzso zzso production is dependent on the activity of zzso B and that I zzso B zzso and zzso B zzso DNA binding and zzso are much higher in zzso zzso Interestingly, using various zzso zzso it appears that the zzso zzso and zzso pathways elevate zzso zzso zzso at least in part, by enhancing the zzso of I zzso B and zzso B DNA binding while the zzso and zzso pathways enhance zzso zzso synthesis by increasing the zzso potential of zzso zzso Taken together, our data are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso regulates zzso B activity and zzso synthesis by reducing zzso + zzso zzso levels and thus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
