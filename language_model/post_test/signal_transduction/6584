We previously established a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is specific for human zzso zzso zzso beta chain zzso and does not inhibit zzso to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we first demonstrated the existence of a third zzso zzso of zzso tentatively named the gamma chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso not only the beta chain but also the alpha and gamma chains in the zzso of cells bearing the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso without any chemical zzso The gamma chain was also detected in zzso zzso alpha beta and zzso beta cells, which were zzso zzso with both alpha and beta zzso and with beta zzso alone, respectively, but not in zzso zzso alpha beta and zzso beta cells, which were zzso zzso with both alpha and beta zzso and with beta zzso alone, zzso Furthermore, zzso growth signals were zzso in the zzso zzso cells but not in the zzso zzso cells, suggesting the possibility that the gamma chain along with the beta chain has an essential role in the zzso of zzso growth zzso Using zzso zzso we zzso demonstrated that zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso of both the beta and gamma chains in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso of beta and gamma chains were also detected in the zzso zzso cells but not in the zzso zzso cells, indicating the correlation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso The beta chain was zzso in in zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the gamma chain was zzso in in zzso predominantly on zzso zzso suggesting the possibility that the gamma chain itself is a zzso zzso zzso
