zzso a novel synthetic zzso suppresses production of multiple zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso In this study, we investigated the target zzso of zzso and examined its therapeutic effect in a mouse zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso and nuclear zzso reporter zzso were used to identify the target zzso and binding site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso model using live zzso coli was used to estimate the efficacy of zzso in zzso 

zzso strongly bound to zzso but binding to zzso 3, 5, 9, zzso zzso molecules and zzso was either not observed or zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and its zzso effect was largely unaffected by zzso zzso concentration and types of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso change of zzso and zzso zzso In mouse zzso model, although zzso alone did not affect bacterial counts in blood, if zzso with zzso it inhibited the increases in serum zzso levels and improved survival of zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso zzso by binding directly to a specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of zzso When zzso with zzso zzso showed potent therapeutic effects in an zzso zzso zzso model using zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a promising therapeutic agent for zzso
