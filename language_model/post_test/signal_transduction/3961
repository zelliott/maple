During zzso migration to the developing cerebral cortex, zzso regulate zzso zzso cell function and zzso zzso cells, in turn, support zzso cell migration and zzso To study how zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells influence each others' function in the developing cerebral cortex, we examined the role of zzso growth factor (a soluble form of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is expressed by zzso cortical zzso and promotes their migration along zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also promotes the maintenance and zzso of zzso zzso cells, which are essential for guiding zzso migration to the zzso In the absence of zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso zzso development is zzso Furthermore, zzso regulation of zzso zzso development is zzso in part by brain zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously shown to be essential for the establishment and maintenance of zzso zzso fiber zzso The ability of zzso to influence both zzso migration and zzso zzso development in a mutually dependent manner suggests that it functions as a zzso of interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in the developing cerebral zzso
