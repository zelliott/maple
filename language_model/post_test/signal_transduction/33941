zzso growth zzso zzso zzso with zzso members of the Ras zzso to promote cellular transformation and tumor zzso Apart from the classic zzso zzso and zzso Ras zzso only the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has significant zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso transformation of zzso cells requires zzso zzso When zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso active zzso zzso they were no longer sensitive to zzso growth zzso and showed increased proliferation and transformation in response to zzso zzso zzso cells require zzso signaling for transformation to occur and they produce significantly elevated levels of zzso zzso which signals in an zzso zzso The effects of zzso are independent of zzso activity and require zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a novel link between zzso signaling and zzso zzso in the promotion of zzso
