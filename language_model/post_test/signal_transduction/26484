Small zzso regulate a wide range of zzso processes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration and zzso trafficking, as well as in zzso conditions such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso it is important to understand the regulation of small zzso zzso but this is complicated by the fact that zzso exists between different zzso families and that we have to understand how they signal in time and zzso The zzso apparatus represents a hub for several signaling molecules and its importance in this field is constantly zzso In this review we will discuss small zzso signaling at the zzso zzso Then, we will highlight recent work that contributed to a better understanding of zzso between different small zzso families, with a special emphasis on their zzso at the zzso zzso Finally, we will give a brief overview of available methods and tools to investigate zzso small zzso zzso
