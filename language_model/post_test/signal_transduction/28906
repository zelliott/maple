zzso stem cells sustain a zzso that zzso a balance of zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells, expressing a zzso embryonic zzso zzso engage in a dynamic zzso with a zzso that promotes plasticity and zzso However, the zzso milieu lacks the appropriate regulatory mechanisms to maintain a normal cellular zzso Previous work from our laboratory reported that aggressive melanoma and breast zzso express the embryonic zzso zzso which is essential for human embryonic stem cell zzso zzso Based on the zzso expression of this embryonic plasticity gene by tumor cells, this current study tested whether these cells could respond to regulatory cues controlling the zzso signaling pathway, which might be zzso within the zzso of zzso resulting in the suppression of the zzso zzso Specifically, we discovered that zzso tumor cells do not express the inhibitor to zzso zzso allowing them to zzso this embryonic zzso in an zzso zzso However, exposure of the tumor cells to a zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a dramatic zzso in their zzso expression zzso with a reduction in zzso and zzso accompanied by an increase in zzso Furthermore, this ability to suppress the zzso zzso is directly associated with the zzso of zzso exclusive to zzso because it is not detected in other stem cell types, normal cell types, or zzso The zzso effects of the zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso in aggressive tumor cells, provide previously unexplored therapeutic zzso for cancer zzso
