zzso cells zzso have long been recognized as potential therapeutic targets of zzso arthritis zzso zzso evidence has showed that zzso are capable of suppressing zzso by expanding zzso regulatory T cells zzso which in turn exert zzso by increasing zzso In the zzso mice, activated DC prime zzso T cells causing zzso production and an inflammatory zzso zzso Recently, we reported that zzso zzso deficient zzso mice had impaired zzso migration and reduced zzso zzso in the zzso mice strain and that these mice were more susceptible to collagen zzso arthritis zzso compared to wild type zzso To examine the mechanism by which zzso contribute to the increased zzso of arthritis in zzso mice, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso are protective zzso against zzso arthritis by examining the role of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

To examine the mechanism by which zzso defects lead to the development of arthritis, we used two zzso models of experimental zzso zzso arthritis zzso in zzso mice and zzso arthritis in zzso zzso zzso mice received zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso injections to expand zzso zzso populations or adoptive transfers of zzso zzso 

zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso resulted in heightened zzso of zzso In contrast, supplementation with zzso zzso zzso ameliorated arthritis in zzso mice and enhanced zzso production by T zzso Furthermore, zzso mice with genetic zzso of zzso did not affect the numbers of zzso nor improve the arthritis zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso to the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso heightened the sensitivity to arthritis in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso in zzso mice suggesting the arthritis in zzso mice was T zzso
