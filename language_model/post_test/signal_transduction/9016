The zzso effects of intermittent zzso hormone zzso treatment require zzso growth factor zzso signaling through the zzso zzso A major downstream target of the zzso zzso (via zzso is the zzso target of zzso zzso a zzso involved in protein zzso We investigated whether the zzso effects of intermittent zzso require functional zzso zzso Mice were treated with daily zzso zzso zzso 10, 30, or 90 zzso for 6 weeks in the presence or absence of zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso We found that all zzso doses were effective in enhancing bone mass, whether zzso was present or zzso zzso had little to no effect on the anabolic response at low (10 zzso zzso doses, small effects in a minority of anabolic measures at moderate doses (30 zzso but the anabolic effects of high-dose zzso (90 zzso were consistently and significantly suppressed by zzso ( approximately zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso a marker of zzso were significantly enhanced by zzso but these effects were observed whether zzso was absent or zzso Our data suggest that intermittent zzso particularly at lower doses, is effective in building bone mass in the presence of zzso However, the full anabolic effects of higher doses of zzso are significantly suppressed by zzso suggesting that zzso might normally activate additional pathways (including zzso for its enhanced high-dose anabolic zzso Clinical doses of intermittent zzso could be an effective treatment for maintaining or increasing bone mass among patients taking zzso zzso for unrelated health zzso
