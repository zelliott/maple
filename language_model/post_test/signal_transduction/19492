Selective enhancement of tumor response to radiation therapy is a highly attractive objective, but it has not been met zzso zzso Ras zzso signaling via zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso growth factor zzso zzso or via zzso zzso of Ras is shown to zzso zzso and requires the engagement of the zzso zzso However, upstream zzso of such interaction in cancer cells that could be targeted for zzso have not been identified and zzso Here, we provide original observations both in zzso and in zzso that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a new target for reversing zzso zzso zzso We employed zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and genetically defined the molecular function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso via genetic zzso of its expression or zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effect of radiation, and achieved zzso associated with zzso of DNA damage repair and enhancement of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso infusion leads to zzso in zzso zzso SCC and in zzso zzso zzso human zzso cell lung zzso These observations collectively establish zzso as a novel target for zzso and show the feasibility of using zzso zzso as a zzso for treating zzso zzso human zzso Identification of such zzso of zzso Ras signaling in response to zzso holds promises for improving the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy and our ability to eradicate zzso
