The effects of green tea zzso on cultured cancer cells have been well zzso especially the effects of zzso zzso since zzso suppresses zzso signaling pathways and zzso cell cycle arrest or zzso by regulating cell zzso zzso In the present study, we attempted to identify signaling pathways or target molecules regulated by each of or a mixture of green tea zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the human lung cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso and a zzso mixture, in addition to zzso significantly decreased cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activity, an zzso zzso was specifically induced by zzso By conducting a series of zzso reporter zzso we revealed that the zzso mixture only zzso the zzso zzso zzso was a more potent zzso of zzso transcription, and this induction was further supported by the induced level of zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso zzso completely abolished zzso zzso Finally, a zzso and western zzso analysis using approximately 70 different zzso failed to detect zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso among several green tea zzso is a potent zzso zzso that functions exclusively through a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
