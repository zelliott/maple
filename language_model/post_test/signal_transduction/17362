zzso of the functional pulmonary zzso requires intimate interaction between the zzso and zzso Previous genetic studies have led to inconsistent conclusions about the contribution of zzso zzso to pulmonary zzso zzso This zzso is possibly due to the functional zzso among different zzso Here, we use zzso to zzso delete zzso (the mouse zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein important for the sorting and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduces zzso signaling activity in both the zzso and zzso resulting in severe zzso and abnormal zzso accompanied by branching defects and abnormal zzso zzso We then used multiple mouse models to demonstrate that zzso signaling is not only required for the proliferation and differentiation of zzso but also is important for the maintenance of smooth muscle cells through the regulation of the zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso Together, our studies define a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso regulate the normal development and maintenance of pulmonary zzso These findings provide insight into the zzso of zzso lung diseases, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso that have abnormal zzso development and zzso pulmonary zzso
