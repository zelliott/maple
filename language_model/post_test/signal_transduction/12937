zzso is an important mechanism for the preservation of a healthy and balanced immune system in zzso Little is known, however, about how zzso processes regulate zzso immune zzso In the present study, we show that zzso a zzso produced by the neuroendocrine system and by immune cells in zzso is able to induce zzso of oyster zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso by zzso and blocked by zzso which indicates that zzso triggers zzso via a zzso signaling zzso Exposure to the zzso inhibitor zzso or expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso under the zzso control of a zzso zzso gene promoter reduced the number of zzso cells among zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso are involved in the zzso process triggered by zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso protein zzso and zzso a member of the Ras zzso family, may be involved in zzso mechanisms that zzso the zzso effect of zzso Taken together, these results provide a first insight into zzso processes in zzso immune zzso
