To demonstrate the relationship between prolonged alcohol intake and chronic zzso 

zzso rats were fed diet containing zzso concentration zzso of ethanol for 6 zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso was used to detect zzso muscle zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso 4 in rat zzso zzso was used to zzso determine the expression of nuclear factor zzso and the above inflammatory zzso zzso collagen content was zzso by measuring zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso 

In contrast to the control group, there was little zzso change in pancreatic tissue but obvious zzso changes in zzso cells of the ethanol zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found reduced in the ethanol zzso zzso ethanol intake did not elicit any change in the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso 4, nuclear factor zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso alcohol consumption did not cause chronic zzso but impaired zzso pancreatic zzso The mechanism behind it could be associated with decreased output of zzso zzso and lower concentration of pancreatic zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of ethanol metabolism was probably involved in zzso
