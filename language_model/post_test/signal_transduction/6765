In the zzso zzso zzso exactly four primordial germ cells zzso arise in early development and are subject to a transient zzso arrest until the animals enter zzso In order to unravel the mechanisms controlling the number of zzso in zzso we tested whether the steroid zzso zzso is able to induce zzso zzso as it had been described in other zzso Our data provide strong support for such a zzso showing that zzso significantly increases the occurrence of larvae with zzso zzso in zzso in a dose dependent zzso zzso responsiveness is restricted to early zzso zzso when the zzso are zzso During these zzso zzso exhibit high expression levels of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso eggs and zzso into the zzso during zzso zzso Nuclear zzso protein is found zzso distributed between daughter zzso Neither transcript nor protein is zzso in zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso suggesting that it is zzso by zzso zzso Our study reports for the first time an zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso in an zzso zzso
