We focused our attention on zzso gene 1 zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, and analyzed its role in zzso stem cell zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso from the correct concentration of these zzso which act at the highest level of gene regulation, may be deleterious for zzso We wanted to know what would happen if a cell had to cope with altered regulation of gene zzso either by zzso or zzso of zzso We assumed that cells would try to restore zzso or, zzso that the event could trigger zzso zzso To this end, in zzso we silenced zzso zzso of zzso expression induced a significant increase in zzso cells and decrease in zzso zzso It is interesting that zzso zzso also induced an increase in zzso At the molecular level, these phenomena were associated with zzso of zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by reduced expression of some zzso zzso This is consistent with our previous research, which showed that zzso zzso by zzso expression also induced zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso belongs to a class of genes whose expression is tightly zzso zzso subtle zzso in zzso activity seem to zzso affect mechanisms regulating zzso status and, in turn, impair cellular zzso
