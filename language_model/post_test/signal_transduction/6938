zzso cell zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso that is characterized by poor zzso zzso pharmacological profiling across more than 100 zzso cell line models identified a subset of zzso cell lines that are highly sensitive to the B cell zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso Sensitive zzso models exhibited chronic zzso of the zzso classical nuclear zzso zzso pathway, whereas insensitive cell lines displayed zzso of the alternative zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed genetic zzso in alternative zzso zzso signaling components in zzso cell lines, and sequencing of 165 samples from patients with zzso identified zzso zzso in zzso or zzso in zzso of these zzso Although they are associated with zzso to zzso zzso in the alternative zzso zzso zzso dependence on the protein zzso zzso (also called zzso protein 3 zzso 14 or zzso both in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso is a new therapeutic target for zzso treatment, particularly for zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal a pattern of mutually exclusive zzso of the zzso or zzso pathways in zzso and provide critical insights into patient zzso strategies for zzso zzso zzso
