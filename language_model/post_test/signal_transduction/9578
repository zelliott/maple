zzso zzso is often considered to arise from a zzso zzso population of cells, which is potentially responsible for its poor zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways play important roles in regulating zzso of stem cells and zzso zzso Both pathways are frequently implicated in gastrointestinal zzso However, their contributions to zzso zzso remain zzso 

We evaluated zzso and zzso signaling components in normal zzso Barrett's zzso and zzso zzso and cell lines via zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 

We observed loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Barrett's esophagus and zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso dramatically raised levels of zzso signaling components zzso and zzso occurred in zzso zzso and cell lines compared with normal zzso In normal zzso zzso cells are located in the zzso layer zzso per zzso representing a pool of zzso zzso We observed an expansion of this pool of zzso positive cells in zzso zzso (15 per zzso Furthermore, a panel of zzso proteins documented for stem cell markers exhibit increased expression in tumor cells, indicating expansion of putative cancer stem zzso Finally, we observed growth zzso in zzso cells with a zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Unlike zzso cells, zzso cells have activated zzso signaling with disruption of zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrated a potential therapeutic value for targeted therapy in zzso zzso in the setting of loss of zzso with zzso zzso active zzso zzso
