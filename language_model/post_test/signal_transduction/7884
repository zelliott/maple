Although zzso zzso is required for zzso functions and zzso lifespan in zzso zzso in zzso precursors have been reported to accelerate aging but not to extend zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso precursor that is converted to zzso zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we discovered that zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso repression of zzso improves gene zzso and extends lifespan without calorie zzso The mechanism of action of zzso zzso is totally dependent on increased net zzso synthesis through two zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso pathway, which is zzso zzso Additionally, the two zzso zzso salvage pathways contribute to zzso metabolism in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, like calorie restriction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso
