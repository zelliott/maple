Transport rates of zzso free fatty acids into zzso via zzso zzso I relative to overall zzso rates in zzso hearts remain poorly zzso Furthermore, the extent of zzso zzso despite increased zzso in zzso remains zzso The present study explores potential zzso mechanisms to sustain zzso acid cycle flux that resolve the apparent zzso of reduced fatty acid zzso without increased zzso zzso through zzso zzso complex in the zzso zzso zzso 

We studied flux through the zzso metabolism of intact adult rat hearts subjected to 10 weeks of pressure overload zzso zzso or sham operation zzso zzso using dynamic zzso magnetic zzso zzso hearts were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso (5 zzso in a zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso At similar zzso acid cycle rates, flux through zzso zzso I was zzso lower in zzso zzso compared with sham hearts and corresponded to a shift toward increased expression of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso complex did not compensate for reduced zzso zzso zzso However, zzso rats displayed an zzso increase in zzso flux into the zzso acid cycle zzso that was supported by zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso transcript levels for zzso zzso 

In cardiac zzso fatty acid zzso rates are reduced, whereas zzso increases in zzso maintain zzso acid cycle flux and account for a greater portion of zzso zzso than previously zzso The shift away from zzso zzso A production toward carbon influx via zzso zzso energy, yielding reactions contributing to a less energy-efficient zzso
