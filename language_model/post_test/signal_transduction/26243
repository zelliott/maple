Heart failure is associated with neurological deficits, including cognitive zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced cerebral blood flow in the early stages of heart failure, particularly when blood pressure is minimally affected, are not zzso 

Using a zzso zzso model in mice, we demonstrate a tumor necrosis zzso zzso enhancement of zzso cerebral artery tone that reduces cerebral blood flow before any overt changes in brain structure and zzso zzso expression is increased in mouse zzso cerebral artery smooth muscle cells at 6 weeks after zzso zzso zzso isolated zzso cerebral arteries display zzso zzso tone, which can be fully reversed in zzso by the competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates its effect via a zzso zzso zzso requiring zzso zzso 1 and the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso 1 deletion prevents and zzso zzso treatment initiated 6 weeks after zzso zzso reverses the reduction of cerebral blood flow, without improving cardiac zzso 

zzso artery zzso and decreased cerebral blood flow occur early in an animal model of heart zzso these zzso are reversed by interrupting zzso zzso This signaling zzso may represent a potential therapeutic target to improve cognitive function in heart zzso
