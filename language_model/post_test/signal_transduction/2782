zzso and/or zzso of zzso and zzso genes have been implicated in the development of cancer in zzso The fact that these zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently zzso in zzso cell lines and that zzso form high affinity binding sites for zzso zzso suggests a novel mechanism for signal definition, diversification or zzso In cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is markedly increased upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso of zzso and zzso demonstrate zzso of zzso by zzso but not vice zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a zzso zzso pattern distinct from zzso cells and enhances association of the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso relevance of zzso zzso is demonstrated by zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells zzso the two zzso These findings demonstrate the acquisition of expanded signaling capacities for zzso by zzso zzso with zzso and provide a molecular basis for the involvement of zzso zzso in the development of human zzso
