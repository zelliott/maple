Recent studies suggest zzso protein zzso zzso an zzso involved in energy zzso might be a novel signaling zzso in regulating inflammatory response, but the precise zzso mechanisms are not fully zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso protein expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells at the gene zzso zzso Data obtained from zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and promoter activity zzso have further confirmed the ability of zzso to block zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Regardless of the ability of zzso to activate zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso and zzso expression were not associated with zzso An zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which effectively abolished zzso zzso caused by zzso did not reverse the zzso effect of zzso Moreover, another zzso zzso zzso was not able to mimic the effects of zzso zzso addition of zzso in zzso zzso interrupted binding of zzso zzso and zzso to specific DNA zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates that the zzso effects of zzso against zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso are not associated with zzso zzso but might be resulting from the direct interference with DNA binding to zzso zzso
