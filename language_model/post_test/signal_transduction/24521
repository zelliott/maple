The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on a zzso zzso that harbors the zzso gene cluster and additional zzso zzso The zzso regulatory cascade of zzso comprises an zzso zzso zzso a zzso system; zzso zzso a zzso factor of the zzso family and zzso zzso an alternative zzso zzso zzso obtained suggest the following signal zzso model for zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso activates genes containing zzso zzso zzso This model was supported by studies on the effects of zzso in the regulatory genes on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso did not affect zzso or zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 57 in zzso suggested that its zzso is crucial for zzso the zzso regulatory zzso Studies on the effects of zzso in the zzso regulatory genes on zzso activity of downstream genes or of their isolated promoters in zzso showed dependency of zzso expression on active zzso of zzso expression on active zzso and of zzso or zzso expression on active zzso These results were also partially supported by zzso of regulatory genes under in zzso zzso The zzso is zzso expressed with high zzso levels under repressive conditions, in contrast to zzso and zzso which exhibit low zzso expression levels and are environmentally zzso
