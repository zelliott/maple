The gene early growth response zzso zzso encodes a zinc zzso factor involved in cell zzso Increased expression of zzso has been linked to heart and kidney zzso In mouse zzso cells, insulin zzso zzso expression more than zzso II, suggesting that insulin may play an important role in stimulating cell zzso leading to zzso and diabetic zzso zzso II inhibited zzso zzso expression but not zzso zzso and the decrease in zzso expression was concurrent with a decrease in insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression in mouse zzso cells is downstream of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso between zzso II and insulin signaling pathways led to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
