This investigation used zzso fraction of rat liver to examine the effects of insulin zzso on functional properties of zzso zzso zzso Male zzso rats zzso g zzso were injected with zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso and 18 h after zzso administration used for zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes was significantly increased by zzso compared to control zzso However, zzso treatment significantly zzso stability of zzso protein by zzso above control zzso Furthermore, results show that zzso zzso zzso of formed zzso zzso zzso complexes by zzso in respect to zzso zzso complexes from zzso treated animals could be activated and accumulated at higher rate in cell zzso of control zzso The zzso relevance of the data was confirmed by zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso It was observed that zzso zzso TO activity while zzso injected to zzso rats, exhibited less effects compared to zzso The results indicate that a zzso hormone zzso enhances zzso induced stimulation of TO activity, as evidenced by enhanced zzso zzso Presented data zzso that zzso treatment leads to modifications of the zzso protein and the nuclear components and that zzso activates the rat liver zzso signaling zzso which zzso in part, the activity of zzso
