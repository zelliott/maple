zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction is believed to contribute to developing zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso signaling pathway, including zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are mainly involved in this zzso The aim of this study is to investigate how these downstream signaling pathways are related to zzso collagen gel zzso We performed the gel contraction zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso in cultured zzso cells under the presence or absence of zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso for various zzso of zzso were also performed and the effect on zzso gel contraction was zzso zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso stimulation was evaluated using quantitative real-time zzso and flow zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso collagen gel contraction was attenuated under presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso all of which are critical subset for binding with type I zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was increased after zzso stimulation in both real-time zzso and flow zzso however zzso expression was not zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso did not have the same zzso In conclusion, zzso promotes zzso zzso gel contraction via both zzso and zzso This was probably due to an increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso which is zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso may regulate collagen gel contraction by another mechanism other than the zzso of zzso zzso
