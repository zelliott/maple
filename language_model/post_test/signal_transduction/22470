This work presents current ideas on embryonic heart development and is an attempt to zzso zzso of zzso heart zzso The heart develops from 2 areas, the so-called zzso zzso which differ in the expression of various genes and in sensitivity to certain substances (for example zzso zzso Heart fields are the source of zzso and zzso zzso cells for the developing heart zzso zzso crest cells attaining the heart take part in the formation of zzso media of great vessels and the zzso zzso An interaction between the cells of the secondary heart field and neural crest cells zzso to the heart plays a significant role in heart zzso This interaction is accomplished by various zzso released into the cell environment zzso zzso of zzso which zzso zzso of growth factors such as zzso zzso in signaling between these cellular populations lead to zzso of the cardiac zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the source of zzso cells of the coronary zzso whereas the zzso provides cells for the zzso smooth muscle cells and zzso
