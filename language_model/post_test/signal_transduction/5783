During zzso bone formation, zzso undergo terminal zzso during which the rate of proliferation zzso cells become zzso and the zzso zzso is altered by production of collagen X, as well as proteins required for zzso zzso This maturation process is responsible for most zzso bone growth, both during embryonic development and in zzso long bone growth zzso Among the major signaling molecules implicated in regulation of this process are the positive regulators zzso hormone zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso Both zzso and zzso are essential for zzso bone formation and cannot compensate for each other, suggesting interaction of the two signaling zzso We have analyzed the zzso and spatial expression patterns of numerous genes believed to play a role in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso stimulates collagen X gene expression in cultured zzso with zzso and magnitude similar to those observed in zzso zzso of collagen X gene expression by zzso occurs only after a significant zzso zzso that this hormone may act zzso We show further that zzso rapidly stimulates production of zzso 4, zzso with a decrease in the zzso inhibitor zzso potentially resulting in a net increase in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso signaling with zzso zzso prevents zzso stimulation of collagen X zzso indicating that zzso signaling is essential for this zzso These data position zzso hormone at the top of a zzso zzso potentially explaining why both pathways are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
