zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins are zzso of zzso signaling involved in negative feedback zzso We have recently shown that insulin increases zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso When zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and prevents zzso zzso zzso by zzso Here we show that in zzso cells zzso decreases zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso zzso This mechanism points to a function of zzso in insulin zzso Interestingly, zzso expression was found to be increased in the zzso tissue of obese mice, but not in the liver and muscle of these zzso Two zzso known to be elevated during zzso insulin and tumor necrosis zzso zzso induce zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso a transient expression of zzso in the liver, muscle, and the white zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained zzso zzso essentially in the zzso Moreover, transgenic zzso mice lacking both zzso receptors have a pronounced decrease in zzso expression in the zzso compared with zzso mice, providing genetic evidence for a function of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso As zzso appears as a zzso target gene that is elevated during zzso and as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we suggest that it is a player in the development of insulin zzso
