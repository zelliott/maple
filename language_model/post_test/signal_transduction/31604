Bone zzso protein zzso zzso is necessary for both the development of the tail bud and for tail zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using a stable transgenic line in which expression of the soluble zzso inhibitor zzso is under the control of the temperature zzso zzso promoter, we have investigated the timing of the requirement for zzso zzso during tail zzso If zzso expression is induced followed by partial zzso of the tail, then wound closure and the formation of the neural zzso occur normally but outgrowth of the zzso bud is zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso is also necessary for limb bud zzso which occurs in zzso zzso prior to zzso When zzso expression is zzso limb bud zzso fails at an early stage and a zzso is zzso The situation appears similar to the tail, with formation of the limb bud zzso occurring but renewed outgrowth zzso The zzso zzso zzso a direct target of zzso zzso with known roles in zzso zzso zzso fails to be zzso in both tail and limb in the presence of zzso DNA zzso studies show that proliferation in the zzso and spinal zzso of the tail, and of the zzso in the limb zzso is significantly inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that in the context of these zzso zzso zzso is mainly required, directly or zzso as a zzso zzso
