The gene locus zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso has been associated with inflammatory zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene product, T cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells has been shown to play an important role in the protection of zzso barrier function during periods of inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso agents that increase the activity of zzso are of general interest as zzso of inflammatory signaling zzso A previous study demonstrated that the small zzso zzso is a selective zzso of zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso of zzso by zzso was capable of alleviating zzso zzso signaling and barrier dysfunction in human zzso zzso zzso Studies revealed that treatment of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso increased both zzso protein levels and zzso activity, zzso with a decrease in the zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 and 3, downstream zzso of zzso zzso upon zzso of zzso to zzso zzso On a functional level, zzso protected barrier function in the setting of zzso restricting the decrease in zzso electrical resistance and the increase in zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso These data zzso zzso as a potential therapeutic agent to treat conditions associated with elevated zzso signaling and a faulty zzso zzso
