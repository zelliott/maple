zzso transmit information at chemical zzso by releasing zzso that are stored in synaptic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso After release, these zzso need to be efficiently retrieved in order to maintain synaptic zzso In zzso malfunctions in zzso recycling have been associated with cognitive zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso whose loss of function causes zzso mental zzso zzso is highly expressed in the brain and present both zzso and zzso in zzso Previous studies report that zzso zzso is important for zzso spine zzso but its function at the zzso site remains largely zzso Here, we present evidence that reduced or defective zzso signaling zzso zzso cycling at zzso zzso In particular, we show that zzso zzso affects the kinetic efficiency of zzso We further demonstrate that zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso a protein implicated in membrane zzso generation during zzso zzso and, importantly, that zzso interaction with zzso A1 and its zzso activity are important for its function in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that defects in efficient zzso retrieval may contribute to the zzso of zzso cognitive zzso
