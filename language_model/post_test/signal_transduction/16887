Previous studies demonstrated that a high zzso cholesterol zzso diet results in a loss of working memory in mice correlated with zzso changes and increased zzso processing zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso To further explore the nature of the molecular zzso of cognitive zzso in this study, we examined changes in zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso including zzso and levels of specific synaptic zzso zzso analysis of zzso tissue from zzso mice fed zzso for 2 months with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with activated zzso a prominent zzso zzso normally kept inactive under the control of zzso That zzso itself was impaired due to the zzso diet was confirmed by a zzso of insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although no significant changes in the levels of the zzso protein zzso zzso in response to zzso were apparent in zzso analysis, there was a clear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso indicative of altered synaptic zzso The results, in concert with previous findings with the same model, suggest that high dietary zzso elicits brain insulin resistance and altered zzso leading to Alzheimer's zzso cognitive impairment in zzso zzso
