The release of zzso by intrinsic zzso cells is an important mechanism for the regulation of zzso trafficking during zzso zzso The expression of zzso receptors by intrinsic zzso cells such as zzso cells zzso suggests an expanded role for zzso zzso biology in local zzso and potentially zzso zzso By zzso we found the zzso zzso zzso expressed in a zzso pattern while the zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso expression was further characterized by zzso zzso protection zzso and zzso analysis of cultured human zzso and was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso confirmed the expression of zzso A functional role for zzso was demonstrated for human zzso migration and zzso A protective effect of zzso was shown for zzso survival in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso was enhanced in the presence of zzso in an in zzso injury zzso The zzso zzso expression of zzso and its zzso zzso in adjacent cell types of the human kidney suggests novel biological functions of this zzso zzso pair and a potential role in processes involved in zzso zzso and zzso
