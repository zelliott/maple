zzso cells are very sensitive to zzso and the zzso and functional changes in zzso cells are believed to be at the basis of zzso cardiovascular zzso It has been shown that the zzso migration, and zzso differentiation of zzso cells play critical roles in zzso However, the influence of zzso on the ability of zzso cells to foster zzso remains to be explored in zzso In the present study, we used a zzso to simulate zzso and we observed tube formation, migration, and expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were added to the culture medium and zzso changes in the pathways that mediate zzso were zzso After 24 h of exposure to simulated zzso zzso tube formation and migration were significantly zzso was reversed by zzso with the specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression in the zzso was significantly elevated after simulated zzso zzso zzso observation via transmission electron microscope showed the number of zzso zzso in the membrane of zzso to be significantly zzso This was correlated with enhanced zzso zzso Western zzso analysis then showed that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both zzso after exposure to simulated zzso However, the specific inhibitor of zzso not only significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso but also zzso the zzso of zzso This suggested that the zzso signal zzso might participate in modulating the activity of zzso In conclusion, the present study indicates that 24 h of exposure to simulated zzso promote zzso among zzso and that this process is zzso through the zzso signal zzso
