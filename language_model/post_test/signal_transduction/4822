zzso zzso is a common Chinese herb extensively used in Chinese medical practice for the treatment of cardiovascular zzso The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of zzso zzso flower extract zzso on the zzso signal zzso zzso in heart zzso of human zzso transgenic zzso After treatment with zzso and soybean zzso inhibitor zzso the left zzso mass indexes zzso of transgenic and normal zzso zzso mice were zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso was assessed with zzso while the protein expression in zzso was detected by western zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso treatment led to a significant reduction in zzso in transgenic mice, indicating a beneficial effect on left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment attenuated the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the protein expression in the zzso zzso of the transgenic mouse zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso treatment markedly zzso the zzso and protein expression of zzso It was concluded that zzso was able to improve the zzso zzso state in human zzso transgenic mice through regulation of the expression of zzso and protein of zzso in zzso zzso
