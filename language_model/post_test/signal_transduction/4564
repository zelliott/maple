zzso Control of organ size and shape by cell proliferation and cell expansion is a fundamental zzso process, but the mechanisms that set the size and shape of zzso zzso are largely unknown in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches were used to characterize the roles of the zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso zzso gene in organ zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso zzso zzso which promotes zzso growth by increasing the period of cell zzso Both the zzso region and the zzso zzso of zzso are necessary for the function of zzso By contrast, analysis of a series of zzso derivatives with deletions in specific zzso showed that the deletion of any of these zzso cannot completely abolish the function of zzso The zzso fusion protein is localized to the plasma zzso The predicted zzso domain plays an important role in the plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso action requires a functional G protein zzso zzso zzso and G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso act in the same genetic zzso to influence organ size and shape in zzso zzso
