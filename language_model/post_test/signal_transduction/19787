The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are zzso receptors that are essential for normal function of the nervous and immune zzso Several studies have suggested that zzso is a key regulator of zzso in the zzso however, the molecular basis of the zzso interaction is not fully zzso and it may involve different mechanisms in zzso and zzso zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso stimulation specifically zzso the protein zzso heavy chain - an inhibitor of zzso - in zzso and suggested that additional mechanisms could be operative in zzso In this study, we investigated zzso function in brains and zzso cultures deprived of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was found in brain slices and tissue zzso of zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso zzso signaling was also reduced in zzso cultures from zzso mice, as shown by analysis of zzso downstream targets zzso and zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso interactions are implicated in the zzso of zzso in zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, increased zzso zzso was found in brain tissue and cultured zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso function was restored by zzso with a zzso zzso Overall, these findings indicate that zzso plays a crucial role in the regulation of zzso in zzso probably via silent zzso zzso The data also suggest that the zzso system interferes with normal zzso function in different ways, depending on zzso zzso
