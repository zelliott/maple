As part of the zzso zzso for the zzso of the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso zzso by consecutive zzso and zzso reduction zzso Because this zzso is essential to many infectious organisms but is absent in humans, zzso is a target for drug zzso In an attempt to characterize its kinetic mechanism and identify zzso steps, we present the first complete transient kinetic investigation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso bind to the free zzso and that the two bind together to generate a zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso coli zzso zzso exhibited a burst in the zzso of zzso during zzso zzso indicating a partially zzso step follows zzso By monitoring zzso zzso during these experiments, the transient generation of zzso was zzso Global kinetic analysis supports a model involving random zzso binding and ordered release of zzso followed by zzso The partially zzso release of zzso occurs via two zzso from the zzso complex and indirectly via the zzso zzso zzso being dependent on zzso zzso Previous zzso studies, including kinetic isotope effects and product zzso are discussed in light of this kinetic zzso
