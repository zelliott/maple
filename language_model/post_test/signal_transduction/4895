We investigated the effects of acute and chronic zzso exercise zzso on the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso expression and protein zzso associated with zzso zzso 

Ten healthy young adults zzso zzso three zzso performed the zzso trial, zzso three sets of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso with a zzso recovery between zzso and zzso zzso between zzso After 4 zzso of zzso training, three times per week, participants repeated the zzso A zzso zzso muscle biopsy was obtained at rest, immediately after, and 1 and 4 h after zzso before and after zzso zzso blood zzso and zzso were measured at rest and during zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso techniques were used to measure zzso expression and protein zzso zzso 

Acute zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso effect size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was increased after zzso Four weeks of training increased the abundance of zzso protein at rest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both acute and chronic zzso despite only 60 s and 12 zzso of exercise, respectively, altered the molecular signaling associated with zzso adaptations and zzso zzso expression in skeletal zzso However, the zzso changes in resting zzso protein abundance after training, together with the absence of changes in zzso zzso require further research to understand the functional significance of zzso in response to zzso
