In developing zzso zzso wingless expression is regulated by zzso signaling positively and zzso so that only zzso cells receiving optimal levels of zzso signals express wingless zzso et zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here, we show evidence that this zzso regulation of zzso wingless expression includes zzso mechanisms, involving zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a complex zzso et zzso zzso Genes zzso 11, zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is positively regulated by zzso signals emanating from the zzso zzso The zzso complex serves as a zzso and a zzso zzso respectively, for wingless and zzso zzso In the more lateral region, wingless expression is zzso by zzso zzso wingless expression is also zzso regulated by its own zzso
