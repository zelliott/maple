zzso of several signaling pathways contributes to long-term synaptic zzso but how brief stimuli produce coordinated zzso of these pathways is not zzso In zzso the long-term zzso zzso of sensory zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso requires the zzso of several zzso including zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the sensory zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso We find that zzso zzso of two signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and type II protein zzso A zzso regulate zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso produces a rapid increase in zzso zzso especially at zzso which precedes the zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso block zzso and the rapid synthesis of zzso at zzso even in the absence of sensory zzso cell zzso zzso of the newly zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso of the zzso responses of zzso to produce zzso require type II zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, long-term synaptic plasticity is produced when multiple signaling pathways that are important for regulating distinct cellular functions are activated in a specific sequence and recruit the zzso of a zzso to activate additional critical zzso
