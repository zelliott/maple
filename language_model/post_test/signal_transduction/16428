zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso is intimately related to the development of diabetic zzso zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso The present study was to investigate the expression of zzso in the zzso tissue of diabetic zzso zzso rats and explore its possible effect on development of zzso Sixteen zzso rats were divided into normal control group zzso zzso 8) and diabetic group zzso zzso 8) at zzso zzso injection was used to establish diabetic zzso After 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed to detect relative zzso parameters and zzso index, and to observe the changes of zzso by HE zzso as zzso In addition, zzso zzso and Western zzso were employed to detect the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso IV, zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso zzso was also examined by zzso The results indicated that the levels of blood zzso serum zzso and urine protein (24 zzso were increased remarkably in the diabetic group zzso zzso zzso compared with those in the control zzso Compared with those in the control group, the protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were increased in the diabetic group zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in the diabetic group was significantly reduced than that in the control group zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso increased remarkably in the diabetic group which had the similar trend to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly located in zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso had negative correlation to that of zzso zzso Compared with that in the control group, the expression of zzso zzso was decreased remarkably in the diabetic group zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso of zzso in zzso tissue of zzso rats may promote the zzso zzso zzso by zzso which zzso the initiation and development of zzso
