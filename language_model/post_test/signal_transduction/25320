Longevity of a zzso knockout strain zzso was previously attributed to increased stress resistance and altered zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated zzso in insulin zzso zzso with this zzso zzso mice were more insulin sensitive and zzso tolerant at zzso and tissue levels, as was a novel zzso knockout zzso zzso and decreasing zzso expression in cell lines decreased and increased insulin sensitivity, respectively - consistent with zzso function as a zzso of insulin zzso However, differences between the two zzso knockout strains were also zzso zzso mice were zzso and susceptible to fatty zzso and their fat was more insulin sensitive than zzso On the other hand, zzso mice were zzso and resisted fatty zzso and their zzso was less insulin sensitive than zzso zzso and zzso strains are both highly zzso on the zzso background, so we investigated gene expression at the zzso zzso which encodes three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is absent in both zzso thus, the remaining difference to which to attribute the zzso zzso is expression of the other two zzso zzso mice have a precise deletion of zzso and normal expression of zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso thus, a simple deletion of zzso results in a zzso zzso However, zzso mice in addition to zzso deletion have a fourfold increase in zzso expression in white zzso Thus, zzso zzso in fat, rather than zzso zzso is the likely cause of decreased zzso and reduced insulin sensitivity in the fat of zzso mice, which has implications for the longevity of the zzso
