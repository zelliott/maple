zzso zzso cancer zzso arises from the zzso layer covering the surface of zzso and zzso zzso is commonly observed at zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso signaling zzso is potentially involved in zzso zzso We have found that zzso is elevated in human zzso zzso We show that zzso relevant zzso of zzso stimulate migration and invasion of zzso cells but inhibit migration of human zzso surface zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso acid zzso cell migration in zzso but not in zzso zzso We have provided the first line of evidence that the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso are not the only zzso for how cells respond to zzso Although zzso is expressed and functional in zzso cells, the zzso effect zzso by zzso is dominant in those zzso The cellular zzso stress fibers are also important zzso for the migratory response to zzso zzso zzso zzso changes are noted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress fibers in zzso cells are further enhanced by zzso treatment, resulting in the negative migratory response to zzso By contrast, zzso cells lost stress fibers and zzso treatment zzso zzso structures at cell edges, which zzso with increased cell zzso In addition, zzso of the protein zzso C zzso is likely to be involved in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell migration in zzso zzso These findings are important for the development of new zzso targeting zzso and zzso in zzso
