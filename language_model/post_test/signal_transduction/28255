Plants are constantly exposed to environmental changes and have to integrate a variety of zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are implicated as important sensors of zzso flux in plants in response to these zzso zzso are zzso by zzso families, and expression levels of these genes are zzso and temporally controlled throughout zzso In addition, a subset of zzso genes responds to external zzso zzso evidence supports the idea that zzso are involved in signal zzso during stress zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso pathways leading to cold, salt, drought or pathogen resistance are zzso by specific zzso zzso
