zzso disruption of the focal zzso zzso zzso gene in mice is lethal at embryonic day zzso zzso zzso defects in zzso mice result from the inability of zzso zzso cells to organize themselves into vascular zzso We found that, although zzso zzso levels were similar, its organization was less zzso in both zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as in mouse embryonic zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and location in focal contacts were all required for proper allocation and patterning of zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso in focal zzso fail to zzso zzso complexes of zzso zzso and focal zzso proteins along zzso filaments to form mature zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that proper zzso allocation and organization are dependent on zzso zzso of focal zzso
