The carotid body is essential to detecting levels of oxygen in the blood and initiating the zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso and zzso make a key contribution to this signaling by the carotid zzso The zzso cells release zzso in response to zzso This released zzso can stimulate zzso receptors on the carotid body to elevate zzso zzso and to produce an zzso zzso This released zzso can be zzso to zzso by a series of zzso zzso which in turn can stimulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can also be altered by membrane zzso zzso zzso stimulates these receptors to increase the ventilation rate and may zzso the zzso release from the carotid zzso zzso zzso hypoxic challenge can alter the expression of zzso zzso suggesting a role in the zzso This review discusses evidence for a key role of zzso and zzso in the hypoxic response of the carotid body, and emphasizes areas of new contributions likely to be important in the zzso
