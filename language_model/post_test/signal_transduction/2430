In single zzso and in suspensions of zzso zzso evokes zzso transient increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso which are more prolonged than the zzso zzso evoked by other zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analog zzso and zzso As a quantity taking into account both the magnitude and length of the zzso response, we defined the zzso potency zzso of an zzso as the integrated rise in zzso during the time of the zzso zzso It was observed that: zzso the zzso increased with the zzso concentration in a zzso way, its zzso value being about zzso higher with zzso than with zzso zzso the high zzso of zzso was for only a small part due to zzso production of zzso or zzso and was mainly a consequence of prolonged influx of external zzso zzso the zzso declined when zzso was zzso during the course of the zzso zzso zzso zzso values increased with the zzso concentration upon sequential addition of increasing amounts of zzso or zzso zzso when zzso was gradually added to the zzso or formed by an in zzso zzso zzso system (with factor zzso factor zzso and zzso integrated zzso responses were a function of the product of the zzso concentration and the time of its zzso However, in these cases, the final zzso values were independent of the rate of zzso addition or zzso We conclude that zzso zzso signals in zzso rely largely upon zzso influx, are not, or only slightly, subjected to zzso zzso and reflect the zzso capacity of zzso to cleave zzso zzso Thus, the high and prolonged zzso signal induced by zzso is due to continuous zzso zzso without desensitizing effects of previously zzso zzso
