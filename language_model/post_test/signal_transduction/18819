The role of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in rats during a forced swim test was zzso The variation of zzso zzso level was studied in control rats and zzso zzso deprived zzso A forced swim test was carried out to estimate the zzso zzso The data showed that the zzso time of rats that received maternal deprivation in early life was longer than that of control rats and Western zzso analysis also showed that the zzso zzso level in zzso deprived rats was almost two times higher than in control zzso zzso infusion of zzso or zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso behavior during the forced swim test in both zzso Western zzso analysis also showed that the zzso zzso activities in both rats infused with zzso zzso were also suppressed in parallel with expression of zzso zzso The suppressed zzso activities as well as the restoration of zzso time returned to the original level 48 h zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso might play a role in the regulation of zzso behavior in rats during the forced swim zzso Moreover, it could provide a hint that zzso zzso zzso might be involved in the formation of zzso zzso
