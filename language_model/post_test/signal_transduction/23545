zzso a highly regulated zzso process of zzso cells, is a zzso zzso mechanism that can also promote tumor cell survival upon stress and treatment zzso Because of this zzso zzso is considered as a double-edged sword in zzso making zzso therapeutic approaches highly zzso In this review, we present how zzso knowledge on zzso regulation can help to develop new strategies and efficiently select novel zzso drug zzso We focus on the protein zzso and zzso regulators of zzso as the protein and regulatory networks significantly influence the activity of core zzso proteins during tumor zzso We list several network resources to identify zzso and regulators of zzso zzso As in zzso analysis of such networks often zzso experimental zzso we briefly zzso zzso model organisms to examine the role of zzso in zzso We also discuss zzso techniques for zzso monitoring of zzso in zzso Finally, the challenges of pharmacological zzso of zzso are zzso We suggest network-based concepts to overcome these zzso We point out that a zzso zzso of zzso would be favored in zzso therapy, where zzso is zzso in normal cells, while inhibited only in stressed cancer zzso To achieve this goal, we introduce the concept of zzso drugs targeting specific zzso factors or zzso families identified with network zzso The effect of zzso drugs zzso indirectly through zzso or zzso regulation of zzso zzso and, as a zzso intervention zzso they can both activate and inhibit specific proteins in the same zzso The future identification and validation of such zzso drug targets may serve as novel intervention points, where zzso can be effectively modulated in cancer zzso
