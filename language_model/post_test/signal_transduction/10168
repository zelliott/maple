Class switch zzso zzso of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso is controlled by zzso zzso modification of the accessibility of the highly repetitive switch regions zzso located upstream of the constant region zzso zzso of the 3' zzso zzso zzso is believed to regulate zzso during B cell terminal zzso although the detailed molecular mechanism remains zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso two essential zzso of zzso zzso complex, zzso associate with the zzso I hypersensitive region zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso signaling cause zzso complex to zzso from zzso and associate with their responsive zzso zzso promoter, suggesting the potential fluidity of zzso structure and specific regulatory mode for the zzso zzso remodeler during zzso More interesting, increase in zzso zzso is either inverse or parallel with the action of zzso complex at zzso zzso or zzso zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso has overall similarities in response to zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and reversed modification patterns at the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the specificity of zzso and zzso signaling in control of zzso could be partially coded by the specific zzso marking of zzso and zzso Our results further strengthen the notion that zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso
