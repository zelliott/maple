zzso zzso zzso zzso are regulated through zzso of zzso zzso zzso The importance of growth zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso has been documented for zzso however, despite the critical importance of zzso in zzso signal zzso neither the zzso zzso that directly zzso zzso nor the sites in zzso that become zzso after stimulation are zzso By measuring the ability of human zzso to restore calcium responses to the zzso zzso stimulation or zzso stress in a zzso line zzso deficient in zzso we have demonstrated that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were important for the zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, the double zzso zzso in zzso resulted in a loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Of the two zzso that previously have been proposed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had much greater ability to zzso zzso zzso in zzso whereas zzso efficiently zzso adapter protein zzso Using zzso proteins to analyze the formation of complexes, we suggest that function of zzso is to zzso zzso providing binding sites for zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and several zzso from the zzso family has suggested multiple sites of zzso and, in the context of a zzso incorporating zzso zzso and zzso shown preferential zzso of zzso
