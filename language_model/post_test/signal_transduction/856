In zzso zzso proper zzso formation requires activities of both zzso protein and zzso acid zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso protein and zzso signaling zzso interact to regulate zzso zzso The zzso of zzso protein prevented zzso activity from inducing zzso marker expression in both zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling zzso modulated zzso zzso Target genes that are jointly activated by either zzso or zzso activities could not be efficiently induced by zzso when zzso signaling was zzso However, zzso of an zzso target gene that is not an zzso target gene was zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Target genes jointly induced by zzso or zzso protein were zzso activated in the presence of both activities, while zzso treatment zzso the ability of zzso to activate zzso of neural genes that are not zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso gene was also identified as an zzso zzso zzso zzso protein acts downstream of zzso to induce zzso marker gene zzso To pattern the zzso zzso requires functional zzso protein zzso zzso protein appears crucial for initial zzso zzso whereas zzso signaling defines the spatial limits of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso protein zzso
