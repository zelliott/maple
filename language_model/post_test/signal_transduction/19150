In order to zzso how zzso regulates cellular functions, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe that zzso treatment of human zzso zzso cells results in a decrease of both zzso zzso levels and zzso activity, and in a cell growth zzso The zzso effects observed in zzso cells are not a widespread phenomenon regarding all cell lines, since other cell lines screened respond differently to parallel zzso zzso In zzso cell line, the zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by significant variations in the levels of some membrane proteins belonging to the zzso zzso zzso the above effects are blunted by pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and other zzso agents, such as zzso and zzso interestingly, prevent the cell growth zzso in response to zzso Our results enforce the increasing zzso of zzso as a signaling zzso identifying in zzso cell line the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso modulated by zzso to ultimately affect cell zzso
