zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso type 2 diabetes zzso and associated cardiovascular zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso zzso leads to insulin resistance and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We present several lines of evidence showing that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso gene zzso zzso zzso gene expression is zzso by a specific inhibitor of zzso In addition, serum zzso level is elevated in protein zzso zzso mice, whereas it is reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso known to release free zzso zzso zzso factor zzso which we have previously demonstrated to be a zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso peptides that disrupt zzso interaction, and thereby release free zzso are able to suppress zzso levels that are elevated during zzso zzso This study identifies a zzso signal zzso that zzso zzso in zzso zzso and proposes a previously zzso pharmacological paradigm of zzso zzso interaction to suppress zzso zzso
