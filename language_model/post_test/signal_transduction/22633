zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in human zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso is activated by a variety of growth factors and insulin via zzso zzso zzso However, its normal cellular role is not well zzso To gain insight into the function of zzso we performed zzso zzso system to screen for interacting zzso Using this technique, we identified a novel zzso designated zzso which contains a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso binding zzso domain and a zzso zzso classes of motifs defined in signaling molecules as functional interaction zzso with specific zzso The zzso domain of zzso shows similarity to those found in zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso whereas its zzso domain exhibits zzso with zzso an zzso protein that promotes zzso of zzso cells, and zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso zzso is zzso zzso interacts with the inactive form of zzso moreover, zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is an zzso that may zzso inactive zzso to zzso in the zzso and thereby may zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso to the cell membrane upon zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene was mapped to human zzso zzso where deletions and other zzso have often been reported in a variety of tumor zzso The identification of zzso may facilitate further analysis of the zzso and zzso activities of zzso
