Previous studies have suggested that bone zzso zzso zzso has a pronounced zzso in rat brains subjected to traumatic brain zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso growth factor that belongs to the zzso zzso To zzso the dynamic expression changes and cellular zzso of zzso during traumatic brain injury zzso we performed an acute traumatic brain injury model in adult zzso Western zzso analysis, zzso and zzso revealed that zzso expression in impaired cerebral zzso was more strongly induced not only at protein level but also at zzso level compared to that in normal zzso Double zzso labeling suggested that zzso was localized mainly in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso within 3 zzso from the zzso site at day 3 zzso And there was a specific zzso of zzso in zzso following brain zzso Besides, zzso of zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We also examined the expression profiles of zzso and zzso whose change was correlated with the expression profiles of zzso in the zzso injury model used zzso Another experiment in which zzso were treated with zzso was also performed to confirm the relationship between the zzso of zzso and proliferation of zzso following zzso Taken together, this is the first description of zzso expression during the central nervous system zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the present data suggested that zzso may be implicated in zzso zzso after zzso But, further studies are needed to understand the cell signal zzso which can direct the exact role of zzso following traumatic brain zzso
