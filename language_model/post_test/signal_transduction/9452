zzso is a hormone produced predominantly by the stomach that targets a number of specific areas in the central nervous system to promote a positive energy balance by increasing food intake and energy zzso In that respect, similarities exist with the effects of consuming a high-fat diet zzso which also increases caloric intake and the amount of stored zzso We determined whether the effects of zzso on feeding and zzso are influenced by the exposure to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased feeding in lean rats fed a low-fat control diet zzso zzso zzso 5 g zzso zzso 152 zzso 5 g zzso zzso zzso zzso but the combination of zzso plus zzso did not result in significantly greater zzso zzso zzso 7 g zzso zzso 136 zzso 4 g zzso Despite failing to increase food intake in rats fed the zzso zzso nonetheless increased zzso zzso mass increase of 14 zzso 2 g zzso zzso 1 zzso 1 g zzso zzso zzso the gene expression of zzso zzso in white zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that factors associated with high-fat feeding functionally interact with pathways regulating the effect of zzso on food zzso We conclude that zzso central effects on zzso intake and zzso zzso can be separated and suggest an opportunity to identify respective independent zzso zzso
