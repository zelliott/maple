The zzso Brain zzso Project is an initiative zzso zzso studies to zzso human and mouse brain zzso zzso identified in human brain samples during the project's pilot phase were put into biological context through integration with various zzso sources followed by a zzso zzso The data set was related to the zzso sequence via the genes zzso identified proteins including an assessment of zzso zzso identification as well as an analysis of tissue specificity of the respective zzso zzso were zzso zzso according to zzso zzso molecular function and biological process, grouped into protein families and mapped to biological pathways they are known to act zzso zzso in pathological conditions was examined based on association with entries in the online version of zzso zzso in Man and an interaction network was derived from curated zzso zzso zzso a zzso set of zzso proteins was identified in human brain zzso In the majority of cases zzso zzso could be zzso identified by unique zzso including matches to several hypothetical transcripts of known as well as predicted zzso
