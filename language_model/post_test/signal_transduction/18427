In a previous work we have reported zzso on the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso human zzso zzso In this work we have studied the zzso changes of some zzso related genes associated with the biological activity of zzso as well as the possible involvement of protein zzso zzso zzso and/or protein zzso C zzso in the zzso signal zzso The data obtained demonstrate that the growth factor activity of zzso is associated with: - a rapid transient zzso of early response zzso zzso zzso and zzso - the subsequent coordinated zzso of zzso and zzso - the constant expression of the zzso zzso in every phase of the cell zzso zzso zzso cells did not express zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, but upon stimulation with zzso zzso calf serum zzso zzso zzso the zzso A zzso expression was observed in zzso with the zzso of DNA zzso Therefore zzso zzso and zzso similarly zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A with only slight differences likely related to the time required for zzso of DNA zzso The zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells was associated with the zzso of their zzso as revealed by zzso The biological activity of zzso zzso as well as that of limiting concentration of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was involved in the zzso of the zzso response of basic zzso growth factor in the same experimental zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso can zzso two different zzso one depending on zzso and the other on zzso in a way similar to the zzso activity induced by low concentration of zzso zzso
