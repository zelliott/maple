To gain biological insights into lung zzso from zzso zzso zzso we compared the zzso sequencing profiles of primary zzso and paired lung zzso 

We used zzso sequencing at zzso coverage to profile zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso 2 years zzso 

In total, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in primary zzso and lung zzso zzso Generally, zzso of zzso detected in zzso were present in primary zzso We identified zzso structural variations zzso in primary tumors and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso shows very similar and largely overlapped zzso segments between primary and zzso zzso Copy number zzso between primary and zzso pairs were also found to be closely zzso Together, these zzso in zzso profiles from liver primary tumors to zzso lung zzso indicate that the zzso features during zzso may be retained during zzso 

We found very similar zzso zzso between primary and zzso tumors, with a few zzso found specifically in lung zzso which may explain the clinical observation that both primary and zzso tumors are usually sensitive or resistant to the same systemic zzso
