zzso of human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso is a zzso zzso for viral gene expression and is also a transforming protein through inducing the expression of several cellular genes under the control of zzso zzso We identified the zzso boxes as a zzso zzso element for the cellular immediate early genes zzso zzso and zzso Using a zzso protein consisting of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso domain of a zzso zzso factor zzso we demonstrated that zzso activates the zzso activity of zzso through the zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso which lacks zzso for zzso zzso and zzso complex formation with zzso was sufficient for the zzso by zzso zzso produced in zzso coli bound zzso in zzso The complex formation in zzso was also indicated by the finding that the zzso zzso domain of zzso by fusion to zzso can complement the zzso zzso function of a zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso activates zzso zzso without zzso signals through interaction with a zzso factor, zzso This must be one of the primary steps by which zzso causes aberration in growth control of the infected zzso
