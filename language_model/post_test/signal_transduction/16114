zzso oxide zzso is a zzso signaling zzso and the zzso species responsible for a variety of zzso disorders including bone zzso High NO levels induce the zzso of zzso and decrease the bone mineral zzso We investigated the influence of zzso A zzso zzso on zzso in cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso NO donor sodium zzso zzso that has been recognized as an zzso of zzso in various cell lines significantly induced cell death and NO production in zzso zzso zzso of zzso A in zzso zzso cells resulted in a significant protection against zzso cell zzso This is associated with increase in zzso zzso oxygen species zzso scavenging activity and the zzso of decrease in zzso membrane potential zzso by zzso zzso We also found that zzso A inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso whereas the level of zzso expression was decreased by zzso A treatment in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso A inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso reduction in zzso and zzso activities, implicating that protective effect of zzso A may occur through the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso A has a protective effect against zzso zzso zzso and might be a plausible candidate for treatment of inflammatory bone diseases relevant to zzso cell zzso
