Gene networks are commonly interpreted as zzso functional information in their zzso An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share zzso zzso by association provides the central zzso principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in zzso functional zzso In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the zzso In effect, the apparent zzso of function within networks has been largely driven by zzso whose zzso cannot even be generalized to individual zzso let alone to the network at zzso While zzso analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale zzso analyses have typically assumed that zzso zzso in a network is due to a zzso zzso of zzso Because we find that gene function is not zzso zzso in networks, but dependent on specific and critical zzso we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks zzso function and what information zzso analyses use to extract functional zzso We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as zzso zzso do not map onto the functional connectivity within zzso
