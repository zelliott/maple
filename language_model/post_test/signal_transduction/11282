The purpose of the present work was to investigate the participation of zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso from 16 day zzso male rat fetuses were cultured with or without zzso at 1 zzso zzso M in zzso medium or medium zzso by zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso After 48 zzso in zzso zzso outgrowth was zzso by zzso zzso An zzso effect could be demonstrated for zzso added to zzso With zzso the zzso transcript for zzso was found in the donor zzso as well as in the zzso zzso In this model two specific nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were ineffective in blocking the zzso effect, and a zzso zzso construct zzso was as effective as zzso These results indicate that the zzso effect of zzso at zzso is not exerted through the classical zzso zzso signal zzso system and suggest the possibility of a zzso zzso The data are discussed in light of our previous findings pointing to the zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso factor signaling pathways that mediate zzso zzso zzso
