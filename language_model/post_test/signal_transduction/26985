The actual dilemma in studying the binding and triggering capacity of zzso from allergic patients is the lack of cultured zzso or mast cell zzso of human zzso Human zzso binds with exquisite species specificity to the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on the surface of these zzso In zzso this zzso has been characterized as a zzso plasma membrane protein composed of an zzso alpha chain, a beta chain and two zzso gamma zzso In order to establish a cell line expressing the alpha chain of human zzso zzso zzso which can be triggered with zzso from human patients and specific zzso we zzso the zzso coding for the human alpha zzso into rat zzso leukemia zzso The resulting zzso express the human alpha chain on the cell surface in the form of a hybrid complex associated with zzso rat gamma zzso After zzso with human zzso from zzso patients, the zzso produces a calcium response upon incubation with zzso The established cell line can be used as a model system to study the mechanism of mast cell triggering through zzso from allergic zzso
