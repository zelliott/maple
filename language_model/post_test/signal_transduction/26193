zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso produces rapid zzso zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso which is involved in transmission of the zzso zzso zzso signaling by way of zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso knockout mice zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso were given a single dose of zzso (3 zzso by oral zzso Mice were sacrificed at days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after zzso zzso zzso mice showed maximum proliferation on days 1 and 2, which came back to baseline levels by days 5 and 7 after zzso zzso The zzso mice, on the other hand, showed a prolonged and a sustained zzso response as evident by an increased number of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso cells even at days 5 and 7 after zzso zzso At day 7 the zzso mice showed close to a zzso increase in liver weight, whereas the zzso mice showed a zzso increase in liver zzso The prolonged zzso response in the zzso mice seems to be due to sustained induction of zzso leading to sustained induction of zzso which is known to be a key zzso of zzso induced direct liver zzso 

The data indicate that zzso signaling by way of zzso is essential for adjustment of final liver size and proper termination of zzso proliferation of zzso
