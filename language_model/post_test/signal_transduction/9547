A central issue of zzso is the acquisition of identity by individual zzso In zzso at the time muscle zzso are singled out, they already express unique combinations of muscle identity zzso This muscle code results from the integration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we zzso by means of zzso and zzso expression approaches, the zzso Complex zzso genes zzso and zzso as novel muscle identity genes that zzso lateral zzso muscle zzso The acquisition of this fate requires that zzso repress other muscle identity genes such as zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso expression depends on the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This provides a comprehensive insight into the way zzso genes integrate in muscle zzso zzso zzso that zzso gene expression and protein zzso
