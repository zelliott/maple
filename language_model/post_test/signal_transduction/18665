Recent studies in human and animal models of zzso have suggested that obesity in zzso may be due to zzso of zzso zzso and is also under the influence of environmental factors and the genetic zzso In the current study, using two zzso deficient zzso mouse models zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso transgenic zzso zzso with zzso zzso we have further analyzed factors affecting zzso We found that both zzso and zzso zzso mice with mixed genetic backgrounds zzso zzso genetic composition of zzso tended to be heavier than wild type zzso mice of zzso days zzso The body weight of zzso mice was intermediate between those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was more prominent in females in both zzso and zzso zzso mice and was associated with higher serum zzso levels, suggesting a partial zzso zzso zzso is less prominent in the zzso zzso zzso mice, but is still evident in zzso Our results confirmed that zzso zzso zzso is one of the critical factors for the obese tendency in zzso However, multiple factors are also likely to affect this zzso and a sex difference specific zzso of zzso signaling may be zzso
