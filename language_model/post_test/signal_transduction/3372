Signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor zzso family are generated from zzso precursors containing zzso sequences that are typically removed to allow signaling by the mature zzso A form of a zzso family zzso that remains zzso attached to its zzso but retains signaling activity has been zzso Glass bottom boat zzso a zzso zzso of the bone zzso protein zzso zzso is active as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that is generated by a conventional processing event common to zzso zzso zzso a larger form zzso produced by processing at a newly identified zzso site in the zzso is also zzso and zzso zzso to the present paradigm in which zzso zzso require zzso of the entire zzso for activity, zzso is active in cell culture and in zzso without additional processing at conventional zzso The large form can restore the viability of zzso zzso animals but has distinct signaling properties compared with the conventional zzso zzso of multiple functional zzso from one zzso is a potential mechanism to fine-tune zzso signaling zzso zzso in zzso family members have been linked to human diseases, several of which affect potential zzso zzso sites in zzso However, given the diversity of potential zzso processing sites and zzso functions, direct zzso will be required to determine whether production of active jumbo zzso is a general feature of zzso zzso zzso
