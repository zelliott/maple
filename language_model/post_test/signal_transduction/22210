The recent identification of zzso expression in zzso zzso and its demonstrated interaction with the zzso factor zzso zzso an unanticipated role of zzso in muscle zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions in zzso cells increased upon zzso of zzso and peaked at around zzso after induction but were zzso in adult skeletal zzso Surprisingly, stable expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso strongly suppressed zzso formation upon serum zzso and the zzso active zzso zzso exerted more pronounced zzso zzso activities of reporter genes responsive to early zzso zzso and zzso and late zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy zzso zzso markers were reduced by zzso expressed zzso zzso attachment of zzso was apparently required for the zzso effects because a fatty zzso zzso zzso could not inhibit zzso zzso Introduction of zzso against zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity and increased zzso heavy chain zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso showed delayed nuclear expression of zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso expression was accompanied by reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso enhanced expression of zzso and a reduction of zzso zzso reporter zzso These results support a novel role of zzso in restraining zzso differentiation through the disruption of zzso zzso
