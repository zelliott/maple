zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso However, the regulating mechanism of zzso zzso metabolism by Ad in dairy cows is zzso zzso from a newborn female calf were cultured in zzso and treated with different zzso of Ad and zzso (an zzso zzso The results showed that Ad significantly increased the expression of two Ad zzso Furthermore, the zzso and activity of zzso as well as the expression levels and zzso activity of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and its target genes involved in zzso zzso showed a corresponding trend of zzso However, the expression levels and zzso activity of zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso decreased in a similar zzso When zzso was added, the zzso level as well as the expression and activity of zzso and its target genes were significantly zzso However, the expression levels of zzso zzso and their target genes showed a trend of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso content was significantly decreased in the zzso zzso These results indicate that Ad activates the zzso signaling zzso and mediates zzso metabolism in bovine zzso cultured in zzso by promoting zzso zzso suppressing zzso synthesis and reducing zzso zzso zzso
