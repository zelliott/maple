zzso zzso are protein zzso that usually interact with the zzso tail of a wide variety of growth factor zzso In so doing, they mediate the zzso of zzso information to specific downstream targets within the cell that ultimately determine the fate of a number of important biological processes such as cell growth and zzso cell cycle regulation and zzso Recent structural and functional studies of zzso zzso from a variety of cellular proteins have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of action of these important protein zzso In the present review, we provide an account of such studies and suggest that zzso zzso can be subdivided into three distinct categories on the basis of their zzso zzso We also discuss the various mechanisms employed by the zzso zzso in recognition of a diverse set of zzso without a consensus zzso Finally, we discuss the role of molecular plasticity as a possible zzso of functional versatility of zzso zzso
