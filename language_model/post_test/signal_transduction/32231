The zzso process of zzso selection requires a rapid burst in zzso zzso and this involves a zzso shift to provide energy and the building blocks of new zzso After zzso zzso and memory T cells switch from the zzso of free fatty acids to zzso and zzso to meet these zzso Beyond this, however, the availability of specific zzso and the pathways that process them zzso with signaling events in the cell to influence cell cycle, zzso cell death and zzso zzso Here we define zzso zzso that represent such zzso and provide examples of how these checkpoints sense zzso status and zzso signals to affect T zzso zzso
