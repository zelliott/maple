The zzso II of zzso zzso zzso contains several proteins zzso by zzso protein zzso The mechanism of the zzso zzso of the zzso antenna complex II zzso zzso is one of the best understood and related to the regulation of energy transfer to zzso II or I, thereby zzso their relative zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso from the complex upon zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso occurs via dynamic zzso changes in the zzso zzso complex taking place during zzso zzso zzso of the zzso involves its zzso with an oxidized zzso zzso A zzso zzso regulatory loop zzso the zzso of the zzso via reduction of protein zzso groups, possibly involving the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is further modulated by zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso by respective zzso and zzso is under strict regulation in response to environmental zzso
