zzso protein zzso zzso zzso have been shown to play key roles in regulating zzso guidance and zzso zzso one of two closely related zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso is expressed in a few central zzso and in a unique zzso peripheral cell, the comb cell zzso Here we show that zzso zzso has a zzso pattern of expression in the growth cones of the zzso particularly at the tips of extending zzso Moreover, although expression of the zzso zzso zzso does not affect zzso growth cone zzso expression of a putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso leads to the enlargement of the growth cones, a zzso of zzso and errors in cellular zzso zzso of several candidate zzso signaling zzso Lena zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso particular aspects of the effects of zzso zzso For zzso which zzso with zzso at growth cone zzso zzso led to a reduction in the number of such zzso Together, our data suggests that zzso regulates the zzso of the growth cone by controlling zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso
