Although many studies using zzso zzso and zzso cell lines have been performed to determine the role of insulin in the regulation of zzso function, the zzso effect of insulin on insulin gene expression is still controversial, and no consensus has yet been zzso Because very little is known about the insulin signaling zzso in human zzso we used zzso zzso to profile the expression of genes potentially involved in the insulin signaling cascade in human zzso The detection of zzso for insulin zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso population suggests the presence of a functional insulin signaling cascade in human zzso Small interfering zzso reductions in zzso expression in human zzso completely suppressed zzso insulin gene zzso suggesting that insulin regulates its own gene expression in human zzso zzso in this regulation may accentuate the zzso dysfunction associated with type 2 zzso
