Recently a novel plasma zzso zzso with high affinity to zzso acid and zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso has been described and termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso releasing the zzso zzso zzso and activates zzso zzso suggesting a vascular zzso zzso function of this novel plasma zzso Here we show that zzso stimulates human zzso vein zzso cells zzso by zzso two distinct zzso zzso On the one hand, zzso releases zzso from cell zzso or soluble zzso and triggers a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade independent of the zzso but involving the zzso growth factor zzso and basic zzso growth zzso This zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso also affects the gene expression level through zzso of two zzso factors, the zzso element binding protein zzso and the zzso zzso Our results indicate a zzso potential of zzso which, in combination with a zzso activity, directs the zzso function of this plasma zzso to processes in which zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso are pivotal zzso zzso in wound healing, tissue repair and zzso zzso
