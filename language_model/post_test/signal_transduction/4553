zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso regulatory zzso The involvement of zzso in normal zzso implies that zzso zzso might contribute to zzso To date, although certain zzso have been established a clear zzso role in zzso zzso other individual zzso potentially involved in human zzso still remain zzso In this report, we showed that zzso was zzso in human zzso cell lines and primary zzso cells isolated from zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso patients and its expressive levels were correlated with patients' zzso Such an zzso role of zzso could be explained by its targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso High levels of zzso resulted in low levels of zzso and weak activity of zzso thus zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso Meanwhile, zzso decreased zzso protein expression by directly targeting the zzso region of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor effectively converted zzso resistance, because of the zzso increase of zzso expression and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is critical in zzso zzso and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso
