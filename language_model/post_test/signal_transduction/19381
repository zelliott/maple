The maintenance of a zzso cell population as a zzso of zzso cells is required for organ development and zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso zzso cells are maintained during zzso are poorly zzso We report that removal of the zzso zzso in mouse zzso organ culture decreased the number and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects were rescued with an zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso increased zzso zzso and proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maintained the zzso zzso cell population in an zzso state, which was required for zzso This mechanism for zzso zzso cell maintenance may be targeted for organ repair or zzso
