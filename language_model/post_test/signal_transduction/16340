zzso zzso family members play crucial roles in a variety of defense, zzso injury, and stress zzso Although they have been widely investigated in zzso little is known about zzso in ancient zzso In this study, we report a novel double zzso zzso related zzso zzso from three model fish zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso adding a previously unknown zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso in the zzso region, one zzso zzso domain in the zzso region, and a unique zzso distribution within the zzso zzso These characteristics distinguish zzso from other known family zzso In zzso injection of zzso into zzso zzso dramatically inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso significantly promoted the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso liver and kidney zzso and in zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is an important negative regulator of zzso and zzso signaling pathways and inflammatory zzso The zzso site disrupted the signal zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso we propose a hypothesis that zzso and single zzso zzso related zzso zzso might originate from a common ancient zzso zzso that lost one (in zzso or two (in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso might be an evolutionary zzso zzso between zzso and zzso representing a shift from a potent zzso to a negative zzso These results help define the evolutionary history of zzso family members and their associated signaling pathways and zzso
