An improved method allowing incorporation of zzso into the zzso pool of human zzso cells is zzso The procedure devised involves cell zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso labeling and zzso In these conditions 4 to zzso of the added zzso is found zzso and half of this amount zzso is incorporated into the zzso pool in only 1 h as compared to the classical zzso to zzso incorporation obtained after 10 to 20 zzso The integrity of zzso between receptors and zzso C was assessed by the zzso zzso production after cell stimulation by various zzso
