The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that gave the name to the evolutionary highly zzso zzso signaling zzso It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes such as zzso stem cell maintenance and differentiation during embryonic and adult zzso After specific zzso zzso the zzso part of the zzso zzso is zzso off and zzso to the nucleus, where it binds to the zzso factor zzso In the absence of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso target genes by recruiting a zzso zzso Here, we review zzso signaling with a focus on gene regulatory events at zzso target zzso This is of utmost importance to understand zzso signaling since certain zzso associated zzso and particular zzso marks determine the specificity of zzso target gene expression in different cell zzso We subsequently zzso the current knowledge about zzso target genes and the zzso significance of zzso signaling in development and zzso
