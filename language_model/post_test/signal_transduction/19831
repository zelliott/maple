zzso toxins zzso comprise a large, structurally zzso group of bacterial protein zzso zzso target cells mount complex responses which allow them to survive moderate membrane damage by zzso zzso has recently been implicated in responses to various zzso but how this process is triggered is not known, and the significance of the phenomenon is not zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O and zzso coli zzso activate two pathways leading to zzso The first zzso is triggered via zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a major energy sensor which zzso zzso by zzso the target of zzso complex 1 zzso in response to a drop of the cellular zzso as is also observed in response to membrane zzso The second zzso is activated by the zzso zzso zzso which causes global zzso arrest and promotes zzso in response to zzso The latter could be accounted for by impaired zzso acid transport into target zzso zzso zzso an zzso which has been implicated in zzso induction during viral infection, was also activated upon membrane zzso and evidence was obtained that zzso of zzso is required for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibited zzso and disrupted the ability of cells to recover from zzso attack by zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso induce zzso signals through membrane zzso zzso and energy zzso and that an important function of zzso in this context is to maintain zzso zzso
