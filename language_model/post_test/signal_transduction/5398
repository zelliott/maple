One outcome of infection is the formation of zzso zzso memory, which provides durable protection from symptomatic zzso In response to infection or zzso T cells undergo dramatic proliferation and differentiate into zzso T cells that mediate removal of the zzso Following pathogen zzso the majority of zzso cells die, restoring zzso zzso However, a small number of zzso cells survive and seed the memory T cell zzso Here, we focus on recent advances in identifying the key proteins and zzso factors that allow a portion of zzso zzso T cells to persist after contraction of the immune response, forming a memory cell population programmed for long-term zzso and zzso We also examine new findings addressing the role of environmental cues such as zzso and zzso molecules in zzso memory T cell formation and how the zzso cues influence the molecular players of zzso pathways important for memory zzso
