zzso has been shown to stimulate zzso of zzso a zzso highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Here, we investigated the contribution of zzso and zzso zzso receptors in the regulation of zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors had opposing effects on the state of zzso zzso The D1 zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso as well as D1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The ability of zzso to decrease zzso zzso zzso was zzso and was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso A, suggesting that the zzso effect involved an increase in zzso calcium and zzso of zzso In support of this zzso zzso medium induced a greater than zzso increase in zzso zzso and abolished the ability of zzso to zzso zzso The antipsychotic drug zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso under zzso conditions and in zzso zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso exerts a zzso control on the state of zzso of zzso
