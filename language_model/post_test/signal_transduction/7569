Previously, we found that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso contains cancer zzso zzso Here, we characterize zzso zzso in a model of zzso zzso and identify zzso of zzso zzso cells that possess zzso zzso 1 zzso We found that these cells show enhanced migration potential compared with zzso zzso zzso We also found that the zzso agent zzso can target these zzso zzso cells, reduce zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and decrease zzso and zzso colony zzso Furthermore, we characterized zzso trafficking of zzso in zzso and found that several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso from zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment could zzso zzso zzso cells as evidenced by significant changes in zzso zzso more closely resembling that of zzso cancer zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso might impact signaling in nearby breast cancer zzso
