zzso is an increasingly economically and environmentally important C4 grass, used for the production of sugar and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso originated from crosses of zzso species and is noted for its unique capacity to accumulate high amounts of zzso in its zzso Environmental stresses limit enormously zzso productivity zzso To investigate zzso changes in response to environmental zzso that alter yield we used zzso zzso to profile expression of zzso genes in plants submitted to drought, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the response to zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso The arrayed elements zzso mostly to genes involved in signal zzso hormone zzso zzso factors, novel genes and genes corresponding to unknown zzso 

zzso an zzso searching method 179 genes with zzso different expression levels were identified as zzso expressed in at least one of the treatments zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to cluster the expression profiles of zzso genes that showed a highly correlated expression pattern among zzso The expression data for 22 genes was evaluated for 36 experimental data points by quantitative zzso indicating a validation rate of zzso using three biological experimental zzso The zzso Database was created that provides public access to the data described in this work, linked to tissue expression profiling and the zzso gene category and sequence zzso The zzso database also includes a categorization of the zzso zzso based on a zzso grouping that included 182 undefined zzso 

An extensive study on the zzso zzso was zzso zzso genes responsive to zzso and to challenges zzso commonly deals with in the field were zzso Additionally, the protein zzso were zzso based on a zzso zzso The experimental design and statistical analysis applied proved robust to unravel genes associated with a diverse array of conditions zzso novel functions to previously unknown or undefined zzso The data consolidated in the zzso database resource can guide further studies and be useful for the development of improved zzso zzso
