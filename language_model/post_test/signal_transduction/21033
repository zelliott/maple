The zzso and zzso hormones elicit divergent and often opposing effects in cells, zzso and zzso A wide range of zzso and molecular biological evidence suggests that the receptors that mediate these effects, the zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso respectively), influence each other's zzso zzso We now show that zzso zzso and zzso indeed do interact at the zzso level and that this interaction is correlated with their ability to form zzso at a common DNA site, in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso that cannot zzso do not inhibit each other's zzso These observations provide the first evidence that the opposing zzso effects of the zzso and zzso hormones are due to the direct physical interaction between their receptors at the zzso zzso
