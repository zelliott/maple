Patients with zzso expressing high levels of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have a shorter overall survival zzso Moreover, zzso enhances zzso expression in zzso zzso Although multiple known signaling zzso are activated by zzso in zzso cells, we show for the first time that zzso enhances expression of zzso via sequential zzso of zzso protein zzso C delta zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso the zzso that produces zzso zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso to the plasma zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso but enhanced its zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso activity by zzso blocked both zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane and zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was indispensable for both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our results provide a functional link between three critical downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have all been implicated in regulating zzso and invasion of zzso zzso
