zzso zzso is a known zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso acts is zzso In this study, we found that zzso increased the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso calcium zzso which is reflected by increased zzso intensity under zzso zzso zzso Either zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of calcium in zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso down of zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso using an zzso inhibitor compound C blocked zzso expression of zzso indicating that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased fatty acid zzso in zzso The promoter activity of zzso was increased by zzso in an zzso zzso Moreover, the induction of zzso zzso zzso a target gene of zzso was blocked under the zzso knock down zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso blocked zzso zzso This blockade was not observed under the zzso zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression via the zzso zzso signal zzso and suppresses zzso zzso
