zzso box zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor essential for cell cycle zzso Numerous studies have documented that zzso has multiple functions in zzso and its elevated levels are frequently associated with cancer zzso Here, we characterized the role of zzso signaling in zzso the zzso potential of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses found that both zzso and zzso were frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly correlated to high-grade zzso tumors with aggressive behavior such as zzso zzso zzso (5 out of zzso Moreover, the expressions of zzso and zzso had significantly positive correlation zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso remarkably enhanced cell zzso while zzso not only increased cell proliferation but also promoted cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by either zzso or zzso could significantly impair zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso by either zzso or zzso required the presence of zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso of zzso might stem from the zzso active zzso which zzso the zzso capabilities to zzso cancer zzso The impairment of zzso potential of cancer cells by zzso zzso underscores its therapeutic value in advanced zzso zzso
