The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso sequences in a variety of zzso zzso This reaction is widely used to manipulate DNA molecules in applications ranging from zzso cloning to zzso modifications in transgenic zzso Despite the simple, highly zzso nature of the zzso system, there is strong evidence that the reaction is zzso the zzso strands in the zzso zzso sites are zzso exchanged before the zzso zzso Here, we address the zzso basis for ordered strand exchange in the zzso zzso zzso Using suicide zzso containing zzso zzso linkages at both zzso sites, zzso resonance energy transfer between zzso zzso sites and a zzso zzso that can cleave the bridging zzso linkage but not a normal zzso linkage, we showed that preferential formation of a specific synaptic complex between zzso sites zzso ordered strand exchange during zzso and that zzso stimulates zzso of zzso zzso
