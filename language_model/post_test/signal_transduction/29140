In human zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso stimulates cell zzso In the present study, we analyzed the response of acute zzso leukemia zzso cells to zzso stimulation in conjunction with zzso zzso In all zzso cells tested, zzso cells were resistant to zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso and zzso was responsible for the resistance of zzso cells to the zzso actions of zzso Moreover, after zzso with zzso zzso the resistance to zzso cell death signals of zzso cells was zzso The zzso promoter region contains zzso elements that can bind the zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso We further demonstrated that zzso was activated by zzso under zzso conditions, to play the major role in zzso zzso expression and ultimately the fate of zzso zzso These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which zzso cell death is inhibited in zzso cells through the induction of zzso via zzso zzso
