The zzso regulatory system zzso has been identified in many bacterial zzso However, the role of zzso in regulating zzso gene expression in zzso bacteria has been characterized only in zzso zzso We have identified, zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso was constructed by using a zzso zzso zzso The protein profiles of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso grown at either 28 or 37 degrees C, revealed more than 20 differences, indicating that zzso has zzso effects on gene expression in zzso zzso The zzso showed a reduced ability to survive in zzso zzso cell cultures and under conditions of low pH and zzso stress in zzso The mean lethal dose of the zzso zzso in mice was increased zzso in comparison with that of the zzso strain, indicating that the zzso system plays a key role in regulating the zzso of zzso zzso
