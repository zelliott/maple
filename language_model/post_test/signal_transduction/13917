The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prime target in clinical zzso due to its zzso zzso and involvement in the zzso of a broad spectrum of zzso Similar to other targeted zzso primary and secondary zzso seem to represent an important resistance mechanism to zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso activity of a novel zzso zzso zzso on cells that zzso express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results show a zzso decrease in zzso zzso in response to zzso in five of the eight cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was accompanied by a reduced zzso of downstream zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso In all sensitive zzso lines, zzso altered zzso distribution, primarily with an increase in zzso zzso zzso strongly influenced zzso zzso functions, such as cellular zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso To assess the in zzso efficacy of zzso we used a zzso tumor model in zzso mice bearing zzso cells expressing sensitive and resistant zzso zzso Animals were zzso for the treatment with zzso zzso zzso or vehicle zzso zzso five days of zzso treatment resulted in a complete zzso of the sensitive zzso tumors, whereas tumor growth remained unaffected in mice with zzso tumors and in zzso zzso zzso the current data identifies zzso as a potent zzso zzso inhibitor with selective activity towards zzso zzso zzso
