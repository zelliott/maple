zzso growth factor zzso which is a potent zzso for vascular zzso cells zzso also zzso the expression of specific zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso in these zzso The goal of this study was to identify zzso pathways zzso these distinct zzso In rat zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid zzso of Ras and zzso leading to the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso active Ras zzso expressed low levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso cells or controls zzso zzso with a zzso lacking an zzso failed to do so in cells zzso expressing zzso The effects of Ras on suppression of zzso expression were not zzso by the zzso pathway, since cells zzso expressing zzso active zzso zzso had normal levels of zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso promoter activity by zzso was unaffected in cells zzso expressing zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso or stable expression of Ras but not zzso also resulted in zzso increases in zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, which was zzso by an increased expression of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso inhibited the stimulation of zzso promoter activity by zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso expression is zzso through a zzso independent zzso involving the induction of zzso and zzso zzso
