The process of zzso renewal persists throughout the entire life of an zzso It begins when a zzso zzso leaves the stem cell zzso zzso a limited number of zzso zzso exits the cell cycle, and commits to terminal zzso At the end of this phase, the zzso zzso zzso from the basement membrane to build up the zzso zzso zzso Although highly zzso this sequence of events is endowed with a remarkable versatility, which enables the zzso zzso to zzso into the cell cycle and become migratory when necessary, for example after zzso It is this versatility that represents the Achilles heel of zzso cells allowing for the development of severe zzso Over the past decade, compelling evidence has been provided that zzso cancer cells achieve uncontrolled proliferation following zzso of a zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso zzso with growth factor zzso signaling at its zzso Recent insights into zzso zzso signaling now propose that zzso but also zzso can centrally control these zzso It is suggested that the two types of zzso receptors act as sensors to transmit zzso stimuli in an zzso mode, to zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling and ensure cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors likely play a more powerful and wide-ranging role than initially zzso This zzso article discusses the relevance of this emerging field for zzso growth and zzso which can be of importance for severe zzso such as zzso and invasive zzso as well as psoriasis and zzso zzso
