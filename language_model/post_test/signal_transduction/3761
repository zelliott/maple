zzso analysis of primary human zzso cells using zzso zzso suggests that there are low, intermediate and high affinity classes of the zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis of this, we generated a clone of zzso zzso cells that zzso expressed the human zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso beta chain and zzso expressed the human zzso R alpha zzso In the cells fully induced to express the alpha chain the overall level of expression of the alpha and beta chains at the cell surface was comparable with that found in primary zzso cells and cell zzso When cells were partially induced to express the alpha chain, the zzso ratio determined by zzso binding was approximately zzso and zzso analysis revealed a single class of intermediate affinity receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso In cells with fully induced alpha chain zzso the zzso ratio was approximately zzso and there was a switch to a dual high and low affinity zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The change from intermediate to high affinity was not associated with changes in zzso zzso as detected by zzso with zzso zzso and gel zzso Both the high and intermediate affinity receptors were able to activate the zzso 5 and the zzso zzso zzso although there was a difference in the zzso zzso zzso which was compatible with the different affinities of the zzso It is proposed that the switch from an intermediate to high affinity zzso was due to the availability of free alpha chains presenting zzso to the zzso chain complexes at the surface of the cell zzso
