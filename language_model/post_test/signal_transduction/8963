The zzso system is essential for fluid zzso immune responses, and fat zzso and is involved in many pathological zzso including tumor zzso and zzso Despite its importance, progress in understanding the origins and early development of this system has been hampered by lack of defining molecular markers and difficulties in observing zzso cells in zzso and performing genetic and experimental manipulation of the zzso zzso Recent identification of new molecular zzso new genes with important functional roles in zzso development, and new experimental models for studying zzso has begun to yield important insights into the emergence and assembly of this important zzso This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating development of the zzso zzso during zzso
