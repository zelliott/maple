Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso activate the Ras zzso and the downstream zzso signaling zzso Here we report that zzso or zzso rapidly and zzso activates zzso a zzso family zzso in zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in a zzso clone that zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso or the Ras zzso zzso exchange factor zzso which forms a complex with zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was enhanced or inhibited in cells zzso expressing an activated Ras zzso zzso or a dominant negative Ras zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which also inhibited the zzso zzso A dominant negative zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso downstream of zzso was found to play an zzso role in zzso zzso of zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is activated by zzso or zzso at downstream of the zzso zzso in parallel with zzso and plays a role in zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso
