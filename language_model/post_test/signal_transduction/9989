zzso movements are key zzso events in animal zzso They are driven by multiple mechanisms, including zzso changes in zzso organization and in cell zzso Such processes must be controlled precisely and coordinated to accurately zzso the three-dimensional form of the developing zzso By observing the zzso zzso during embryonic development using zzso zzso zzso we have investigated how signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the tissue sheet movements that result in zzso closure zzso We find that zzso controls the zzso of zzso into a cable at the zzso leading edge as previously suggested, as well as the joining zzso of the zzso zzso cell zzso Here, we show that zipping is zzso by regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso signaling regulates a set of target genes that cooperate to facilitate zzso movement and zzso
