Genes do not act in isolation but perform their biological functions within genetic pathways that are connected in larger zzso Investigation of zzso variation within genetic pathways and networks has shown that zzso can affect the rate of protein zzso however, it remains unclear whether a same pattern of zzso variation is expected within functionally similar networks and whether it may be due to similar or different biological zzso We address these questions by investigating zzso variation in the context of the structure of the zzso zzso in zzso which is well characterized and is functionally zzso across zzso In zzso and zzso the rate of protein evolution is zzso correlated with the position of a gene within the zzso zzso Similarly, we find that in zzso the rate of zzso acid replacement is lower for downstream zzso However, in zzso the rate of synonymous substitution is also strongly affected by the position of a gene in the pathway, and we show that the distribution of selective pressure along the zzso is driven by differential expression zzso A full understanding of the effect of zzso structure on selective constraints is therefore likely to require inclusion of specific biological function into more general network zzso
