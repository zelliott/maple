In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso by nerve growth factor zzso was measured by the western zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of the zzso zzso in 30 zzso and zzso the level at 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso A dominant negative form of zzso suppressed the induction of the zzso of zzso by zzso but not by zzso This result is consistent with the idea that zzso zzso zzso of zzso through the Ras signaling zzso The reduction of zzso activity caused by zzso of zzso inhibitor may be a mechanism for zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso blocked the zzso outgrowth initiated by zzso It was also found that zzso 71 zzso with zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso These results suggested the dual role of zzso in the withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle and zzso differentiation in zzso zzso
