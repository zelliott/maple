zzso are natural hosts of several zzso which are plant pathogens composed exclusively of a zzso small zzso circular zzso that is able to replicate autonomously in susceptible zzso They are responsible for symptoms such as zzso leaf zzso and zzso zzso zzso III zzso has been long regarded as a possible zzso agent of citrus grafted on zzso orange and its zzso To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in zzso the zzso zzso zzso differential display technique was here applied to identify genes whose zzso was significantly altered in leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso infected by zzso zzso zzso Of zzso genes identified, thirteen were zzso by zzso infection, while five were zzso Except for two genes that zzso proteins of unknown function, the remaining genes are mainly involved in plant zzso responses, signal zzso zzso acid zzso and cell wall zzso Among the zzso zzso it is noteworthy a zzso of zzso zzso that might be involved in zzso and virus zzso The functions of these genes are zzso
