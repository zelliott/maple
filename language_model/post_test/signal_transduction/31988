zzso encounter physical cues such as zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso replete with zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which cells integrate physical and zzso cues to guide cellular decision making are not well zzso Here we investigate mechanisms by which zzso generate an integrated response to zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells grown on zzso zzso deposit more zzso and express more zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to cells exposed to zzso of any other zzso The zzso effect of this discrete zzso which falls within the range reported for zzso cartilage, requires the zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso activity are specifically increased in cells grown on zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso cells for a synergistic response, such that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression more robustly than either cue alone through a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In this way, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to efficiently promote zzso zzso This work reveals novel mechanisms by which cells integrate physical and zzso cues to exert a coordinated response to their unique cellular zzso
