zzso are a family of zzso cell surface molecules that function as zzso receptors in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family are found on zzso clustered at sites of zzso junctions both in culture and in normal zzso The possibility that these zzso function in zzso zzso has been both supported and zzso in recent conflicting zzso Rather than testing further for the presence or absence of an interaction, we present evidence to show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso junctions are in the zzso zzso We zzso zzso with a construct that expresses a zzso cell surface zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is thought to mimic the zzso zzso and has previously been shown to be actively localized to focal zzso in zzso We find that zzso are also able to zzso this zzso in focal zzso but do not zzso it to areas of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso that has been previously shown to zzso recognize zzso zzso receptors was used to stain zzso This zzso showed zzso of focal zzso with little or no zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, four other zzso zzso showed strong, preferential zzso at zzso Double zzso confirmed that both the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were capable of recognizing the same focal zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso in zzso cell junctions of zzso are in the zzso zzso Although we do not directly prove the absence of an zzso interaction at this site, we show that any such interaction does not induce the zzso zzso and, therefore, is less likely to play a major role in zzso zzso or signal zzso
