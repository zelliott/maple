zzso peptides have been shown to increase zzso zzso in the zzso zzso differences in airway responsiveness to zzso where reported in zzso The present study compared the airway zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso mice, the involvement of zzso on this zzso and zzso levels in lung zzso Whole airway zzso was analyzed by means of an isolated lung preparation where lungs were zzso through the trachea with warm zzso zzso solution at 5 zzso and changes in zzso pressure triggered by zzso at increasing zzso doses zzso zzso were zzso We found that the zzso airway response to zzso was much greater in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 30 zzso before zzso reduced lung responsiveness to zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso but had no effect in zzso mouse zzso This effect seems to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso since it was significantly reduced by the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso than in zzso lungs zzso vs zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, airway zzso to zzso and lung zzso content varies markedly between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lung responsiveness to zzso only in zzso an effect achieved through the zzso zzso zzso
