Studies were performed to determine the unknown status of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso state in the human internal zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso We determined the effects of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and ROCK II zzso in the human zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso state, following zzso and before and after zzso inhibitor zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and ROCK inhibitor Y zzso zzso zzso We also determined changes in the zzso lengths via computerized digital zzso In the zzso state zzso was distributed almost zzso throughout the cell, whereas zzso and ROCK II were located in the higher zzso toward the zzso zzso caused significant zzso of zzso zzso and ROCK zzso zzso zzso of zzso was attenuated by zzso C and not by zzso zzso and Y zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso and that of ROCK II was attenuated by both zzso zzso and Y zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso caused by zzso in parallel with zzso II zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso and Y zzso but not by zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso are zzso active, and zzso by zzso is associated with zzso zzso rather than zzso The relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and potential therapy for the zzso dysfunction remains to be zzso
