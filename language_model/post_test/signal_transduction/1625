zzso of basic zzso growth factor zzso to its high affinity receptors requires the presence of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface that act as zzso To determine the contribution of zzso HS to zzso of zzso cell growth, we studied the changes in the cell mass and zzso binding of zzso cell HS under zzso and hypoxic conditions in zzso Both large vein and cardiac zzso zzso cells cultured under hypoxic conditions demonstrated an increase in the ratio of zzso HS to zzso zzso zzso as well as an increase in the number of low affinity zzso binding sites for zzso with no change in the apparent zzso This increase in the number of zzso binding sites, in the absence of a significant change in zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced responsiveness of zzso compared with zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso Gene expression studies demonstrated increased expression of the key regulatory zzso responsible for HS chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as increased expression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso responsible for zzso of zzso a crucial part of the zzso binding zzso zzso of cells with an zzso zzso a zzso expression construct resulted in a similar increase in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso increases zzso cell responsiveness to zzso by promoting preferential synthesis of HS rather than zzso chains and increasing the number of zzso sites on HS zzso Both of these events are zzso by a zzso increase in expression of the zzso zzso and zzso This shift in zzso HS composition results in enhanced cell sensitivity to zzso growth zzso
