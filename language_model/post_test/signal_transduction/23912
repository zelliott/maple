In zzso the zzso oxide zzso zzso response is indicative of a highly regulated interplay of zzso formation and zzso zzso Recently, we showed that within the zzso zzso response in human zzso zzso and zzso of zzso type 5 zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso protein zzso I as the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso However, we demonstrate that zzso can directly activate zzso without zzso in zzso zzso most likely via binding to the regulatory zzso zzso The reversal of zzso was slow, and was not completed after 60 zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso allowing it to occur at lower zzso zzso Also, in intact zzso a sustained zzso zzso of zzso for as long as 60 zzso was zzso Finally, the long-term zzso of the zzso response induced by a low NO concentration reveals the zzso relevance of the zzso zzso within zzso zzso In sum, we suggest zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as the mechanism for a long-lasting negative feedback loop shaping the zzso response in human zzso in order to adapt to the amount of NO zzso
