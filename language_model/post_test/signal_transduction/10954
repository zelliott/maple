Many bacterial pathogens manipulate the host cell zzso during zzso Such zzso zzso can occur at several points of contact between the pathogen and the host, and involves zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso proteins zzso The field of bacterial zzso has progressed dramatically over the past decade, such that structural knowledge is both timely and essential for a full appreciation of the biology at the zzso zzso Several recent examples involving bacterial proteins that target zzso zzso family zzso and zzso receptors have contributed to a structural understanding of zzso zzso zzso by zzso
