zzso belongs to a family of low molecular weight zzso proteins and exhibits zzso zzso acid identity to zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso cell death caused by zzso zzso withdrawal in zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso also zzso zzso cells from the zzso cell zzso To do this, several zzso zzso were established, in which expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso was regulated by an zzso zzso Using these zzso we found that expression of an activated zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the death of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, expression of the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso showed no zzso effect on cell death, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death caused by deprivation of zzso Furthermore, it was found that zzso in serum was required for the zzso activity of zzso zzso of cell death by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso a specific zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, we have shown that, in zzso cells, zzso and zzso could activate zzso zzso Also, zzso activity was zzso with an activated zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso in collaboration with zzso suppressed zzso cell death of zzso caused by zzso zzso presumably by modulating the zzso of zzso and zzso
