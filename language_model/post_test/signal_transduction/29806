Our view of biological zzso has evolved dramatically over the last few zzso In the zzso model from Singer & Nicholson zzso zzso both proteins and lipids freely diffuse within the plane of the zzso Currently, however, zzso are viewed as a mosaic of different compartments or zzso maintained by an active zzso network zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to interactions between membrane zzso several types of zzso can form with different characteristics and zzso zzso are likely to play an important role in the formation of so-called zzso zzso or zzso zzso adding another order of complexity to the membrane zzso zzso represent a type of domain wherein lipids of specific chemistry may zzso associate with each other, to form platforms important for membrane protein sorting and construction of signaling complexes zzso & zzso Nat Rev zzso Cell zzso zzso Currently, there are several hypotheses concerning the nature of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The most commonly cited one, proposed by zzso zzso zzso & zzso Nature zzso zzso et zzso J Cell zzso zzso suggests that zzso are relatively small structures ( approximately 50 zzso enriched in cholesterol and zzso within which associated proteins are likely to be zzso Another proposal zzso & zzso Science zzso suggests that zzso are constructed of zzso zzso These are small dynamic zzso wherein zzso proteins are zzso associated with certain types of zzso These zzso are zzso stable mobile entities in the plane of the membrane that are able to target the protein they zzso to zzso zzso zzso In this review we zzso the data suggesting a specific role for zzso zzso in zzso trafficking and sorting and present a modification of the raft model that may help explain the observed zzso
