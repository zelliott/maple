The zzso model of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso that zzso of zzso zzso a product of zzso precursor protein zzso processing, cause zzso However, zzso of normal zzso functions could contribute to zzso zzso and it is therefore important to understand the role of zzso zzso is a member of a gene family that shows functional zzso as documented by the evidence that single zzso mice are viable, whereas mice with combined deletions of zzso family genes die shortly after zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso region, zzso is indispensable for these essential functions of zzso It is therefore important to identify pathways that regulate zzso of zzso as well as the role of zzso in zzso zzso is associated with both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso processing, suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso links zzso processing and zzso signaling to zzso pathways associated with cellular differentiation and zzso Here we have tested whether the zzso signaling zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso interacts with zzso and this interaction requires zzso zzso we also uncover that zzso and specifically zzso regulates zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso the zzso distribution of zzso and the sensitivity of zzso to the zzso action of zzso This evidence suggests that these two membrane zzso functions are strictly interconnected and that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in zzso zzso and can be used as a therapeutic zzso
