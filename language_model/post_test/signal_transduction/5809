zzso deprivation leads to large reductions in plant growth and zzso How plants sense and zzso the stress signals initiated by zzso deprivation is poorly zzso Both zzso production and the zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso increase when plants are deprived of zzso To zzso the role of zzso in low zzso signaling zzso we used both genetic and chemical zzso Our results showed that zzso is important in tolerance to low zzso and for changes in both root hair and primary root growth in zzso zzso We show that zzso acts upstream of zzso oxygen species in response to zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was used as a marker of zzso deprivation and was found to be dependent on zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso low zzso responses were not completely zzso suggesting that some zzso zzso responses are either zzso independent or zzso zzso zzso signaling is a component of the plant's response to low zzso that stimulates the production of zzso oxygen species and is important for changes in root zzso and whole plant tolerance to low zzso zzso
