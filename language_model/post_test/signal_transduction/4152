zzso play an important role in the control of and resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso infections are characterized by suppression of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms zzso zzso zzso host zzso we investigated whether the zzso elicits the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso and determined the signal zzso pathways involved in zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid and transient expression of zzso and low levels of zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did zzso zzso of the protein zzso C zzso zzso with the pharmacological inhibitor zzso and by zzso depletion with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated and zzso zzso to the membrane fraction in zzso demonstrating a rapid and direct effect on zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso had reduced stability of both zzso and zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso and failed to zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso proteins and zzso with zzso or zzso zzso resulted in a zzso and 50% reduction in zzso zzso levels, zzso These data argue that although zzso zzso stimulates zzso and zzso gene expression through zzso signal zzso the rapid degradation of the zzso the lack of zzso zzso protein and the observed decreased responsiveness to a zzso signal may be a novel mechanism zzso the zzso zzso host zzso zzso
