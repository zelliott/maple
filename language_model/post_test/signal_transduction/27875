zzso and zzso receptors belong to a zzso of G zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso present a particular zzso zzso they present a polarized zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and in zzso cells zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso is expressed zzso in target zzso zzso We expressed these receptors in zzso cells (a well characterized model of polarized zzso zzso to understand this difference of zzso We show that the three receptors have a polarized zzso expression in these zzso All contain a zzso targeting zzso Furthermore, zzso receptors undergo a partial zzso which is not observed for the zzso zzso We show that zzso G proteins play a role in this mechanism of zzso This effect is not zzso by zzso zzso zzso and involves a population of G proteins different from that involved in signal zzso We thus used in zzso zzso to delineate the zzso zzso signal of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the signal is localized in the zzso tail of the zzso domain which is not zzso between the three zzso It contains 14 zzso and its activity is mainly dependent on a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal of the zzso is not zzso with its zzso zzso This signal is autonomous and dominant because, when transferred to an zzso targeted membrane zzso the zzso zzso it zzso the zzso construct to the zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal of the zzso zzso is thus the first signal identified for a G zzso zzso and more generally for a hormone zzso
