zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso being intimately involved in the regulation of zzso reaction, zzso and zzso Here we describe briefly the mechanisms of calcium regulation in zzso cells and the ways in which these mechanisms have been adapted to function in mature zzso We then consider recent data from this and other laboratories on the responses of zzso to three zzso zzso and zzso oxide (both products of the zzso zzso and zzso All of these compounds induce calcium signals in the zzso zzso head and neck region and, when applied at appropriate zzso modify zzso activity, causing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We argue that these effects reflect a common mode of action, zzso of calcium stored in the zzso neck zzso Finally we consider the nature of calcium zzso pathways in zzso We suggest that this highly zzso and extremely zzso cell, though working with the same calcium zzso zzso as those of zzso cells, employs them to generate unusually zzso calcium signals that do not act to integrate zzso zzso between these calcium zzso pathways will generate inappropriate responses, compromising functioning of the zzso
