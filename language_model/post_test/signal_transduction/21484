Previous studies have shown that the ability of zzso tuberculosis to block a zzso flux is an important step in its capacity to halt zzso zzso This affect on zzso release results from zzso tuberculosis zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these studies did not address the potential role of zzso and zzso in other aspects of zzso zzso including production of zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso activate zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso However, whether zzso functions in promoting zzso zzso upon zzso infection was not defined in these zzso In the present work we found that zzso is required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso infected with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and conventional protein zzso C zzso were also important for zzso zzso Moreover, there was increased zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso infected with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso This zzso and zzso zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso Finally, in zzso infected with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso we observed enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and found production of these inflammatory zzso to be dependent on zzso zzso zzso and zzso These studies are the first to show that the zzso zzso response following a zzso infection is regulated by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
