Using zzso zzso and antagonists, and zzso directed against zzso and zzso it has been shown in single zzso of rat portal vein that both alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso channels through two distinct zzso zzso alpha zzso couple with a zzso protein to activate a zzso C zzso which zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso releases zzso stored zzso as evidenced by zzso with zzso The large and transient increase in zzso activates zzso channels leading to a membrane zzso that opens zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso activates zzso protein zzso C zzso which increases the opening probability of zzso channels through a zzso zzso alpha zzso do not induce zzso release from zzso stores but promote sustained zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso The zzso involves a zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso These two zzso pathways may be involved in the zzso action of zzso in vascular smooth zzso
