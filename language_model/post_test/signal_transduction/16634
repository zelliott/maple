We investigated the mechanism of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell death and found this mechanism differs from that of zzso zzso cell zzso In the presence of 20 zzso zzso zzso initiated zzso and necrosis in the majority of zzso cells as measured by an zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso transition zzso inhibitor zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso plus zzso increased zzso expression without affecting zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso plus zzso caused persistent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso effectively reversed the cell death which was zzso by zzso and zzso plus zzso also caused zzso zzso to an 85 zzso zzso These results indicate that in the presence of zzso zzso further zzso cell death which requires the zzso zzso transition and the zzso zzso However, we did not detect the changes in zzso c expression and the participation of zzso in this process, suggesting that there might exist an unknown signal zzso from the zzso to the downstream protein zzso which is zzso in a zzso zzso
