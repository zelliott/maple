Using partial zzso acid sequence information for zzso obtained from zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso zzso with significant similarity to the sequence of Old Yellow zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso reduction of the zzso bond of zzso zzso Specifically, all zzso required for binding of zzso in Old Yellow zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as are all zzso associated with zzso zzso The zzso was functionally expressed from its zzso in zzso coli and thus proven to zzso zzso zzso Further similarities of zzso zzso and zzso Old Yellow zzso include their binding to and zzso by zzso from zzso the zzso of zzso Old Yellow zzso with an zzso raised against plant zzso zzso and the demonstration that Old Yellow zzso is an active zzso zzso It is thus conceivable that the zzso role of Old Yellow zzso now known from bacteria, zzso and higher plants, is in zzso zzso
