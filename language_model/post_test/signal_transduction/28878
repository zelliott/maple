zzso traffic is tightly regulated and the zzso protein family of small zzso plays a central role in this zzso One member of this family is the zzso zzso protein zzso To search for new genes interacting with zzso zzso we performed a genetic screen for high copy zzso of zzso temperature sensitivity at 35 degrees zzso Among the zzso zzso was also able to suppress the temperature sensitive zzso lacking zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso exchanging factor complex zzso zzso is characterized by a coiled zzso region and a zzso domain, a protein module binding zzso zzso zzso is able to bind zzso but is also associated with larger structures zzso in zzso zzso By zzso zzso shows a zzso pattern as well as small zzso zzso of zzso influences nuclear envelope zzso and high levels are zzso This zzso is rescued when the zzso region, containing the zzso domain, is zzso The zzso profile of a zzso strain shows effects on genes involved in nuclear migration, Ras zzso and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a novel factor linked to the zzso zzso and important cellular regulatory zzso
