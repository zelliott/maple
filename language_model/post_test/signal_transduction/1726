During the growth of zzso zzso discs a process called zzso zzso eliminates zzso but otherwise viable zzso We report here that cell competition requires the function of the zzso zzso zzso whose expression is normally zzso by zzso zzso zzso but is zzso in zzso zzso zzso Excess zzso expression activates the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which in turn triggers zzso in these zzso We propose that zzso cells zzso zzso levels zzso to a disadvantage in competing for, or in zzso the zzso survival zzso This sequence of events might represent a general mechanism by which weaker cells are eliminated from a growing population, and might serve as a method of controlling cell number and zzso tissue fitness and hence organ zzso
