The zzso and zzso growth factor zzso systems are central to the control of zzso brain processes and are thought to partly exert these tasks by zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Here we show that beyond zzso zzso zzso prevent the zzso zzso of the zzso We unravel that zzso abrogate zzso of the zzso by either promoting the formation of zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso We further provide evidence that this zzso is operational in the control of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we establish that the zzso effects exerted by zzso on zzso as well as zzso expression of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, are a direct consequence of the zzso retention of the zzso at the cell zzso Together our findings unravel a previously unknown zzso between zzso and zzso growth factor zzso which may have implications for a variety of pathological zzso
