zzso zzso rhythms are synchronized to the external time by daily zzso of the zzso nucleus zzso in response to zzso As the master zzso zzso the zzso coordinates the timing of diverse cellular zzso in multiple zzso zzso regulation of clock timing is linked to numerous human conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, zzso various neurological disorders and the zzso disorder familial advanced sleep phase zzso Additionally, mechanisms that zzso clock zzso factor into the sleep and zzso disturbances experienced by zzso workers and travelers with jet zzso The zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced by light within the zzso and zzso its capacity to zzso or zzso the zzso However, the specific targets that are regulated by zzso and zzso its effects on clock zzso remained elusive until zzso Here, we show that genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control zzso zzso are direct targets of zzso in the mouse zzso zzso regulation of these targets zzso zzso zzso of Period gene expression and clock zzso the zzso and zzso promoters are bound to and zzso activated by zzso whereas zzso and zzso suppress the translation of the zzso proteins by enhancing zzso zzso We propose that zzso is selectively enriched for zzso and zzso target genes and is an zzso of zzso zzso and protein translation within the zzso clock, thereby zzso clock zzso These findings will further our understanding of mechanisms governing clock zzso and its involvement in human zzso
