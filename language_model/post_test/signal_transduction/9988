zzso signaling has been implicated as an important regulator of retinal zzso As a first step in characterizing potential downstream targets of zzso signaling in the zzso we have analyzed expression of zzso a member of the zzso class of zzso zzso factors, in the developing zzso We find that zzso is expressed in the developing zzso and its zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso signaling activates zzso a gene necessary for retinal zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso factors that in turn control retinal zzso cell zzso
