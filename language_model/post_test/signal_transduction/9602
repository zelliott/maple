A large body of evidence indicates that zzso oxide zzso and zzso contribute to central zzso of pain pathways during inflammatory zzso Here, we investigated the distribution of zzso zzso zzso channels in the spinal cord, and identified the zzso channel zzso zzso as a putative zzso target in zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso is localized to zzso zzso of the zzso horn of the spinal cord, whereas its distribution in zzso root zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in the superficial zzso horn of the mouse spinal zzso and in zzso root zzso following zzso inflammation evoked by zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso zzso exhibited an increased zzso behavior in models of inflammatory pain, whereas their behavior in models of acute or zzso pain was zzso Moreover, zzso mice developed an exaggerated pain hypersensitivity induced by zzso administration of zzso zzso or NO zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso contributes in an zzso manner to the central zzso of pain pathways during inflammatory pain as a target of zzso zzso
