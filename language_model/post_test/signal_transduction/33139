The large and functionally diverse group of zzso receptors includes receptors for many different zzso zzso including zzso and zzso hormones and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their principal function is to transmit information about the zzso environment to the interior of the cell by interacting with the zzso zzso and they thereby participate in many aspects of zzso Cellular responses to zzso of these receptors are usually rapidly zzso zzso of signal zzso include removal of zzso from the zzso fluid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are removed by zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interaction of zzso receptors with zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributes to zzso by depleting the cell surface of zzso zzso and recycling of zzso receptors contributes to zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso is a form of zzso that occurs during zzso long-term exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso which may occur during the development of drug zzso is characterized by depletion of the cellular zzso content, and is probably zzso by zzso in the rates of zzso degradation and zzso These regulatory mechanisms are important, as they govern the ability of cells to respond to zzso A greater understanding of the mechanisms that zzso zzso may lead to the development of new therapies and may help to explain the mechanism of drug zzso
