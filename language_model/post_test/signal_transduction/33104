The zzso of the sex zzso in zzso zzso zzso involve two guidance zzso a zzso attraction that zzso precise positioning of the sex zzso and a zzso mechanism that is sufficient for coarse positioning in the absence of the zzso (Thomas et zzso zzso Here we show that zzso in zzso zzso and zzso disrupt sex zzso positioning in the absence of the zzso while they do not affect positioning in the presence of the zzso Thus, zzso in these genes appear to compromise the zzso mechanism without affecting zzso or the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso dramatic sex zzso positioning defects in double zzso combinations with zzso zzso or zzso zzso even in the presence of the zzso This suggests that zzso is required for the zzso attractive zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso also zzso sex zzso migration defects in an zzso background, implicating these genes in zzso positioning as zzso
