zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso Most of their functions have been attributed to zzso of the zzso zzso receptors and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain are abundantly expressed during development and in the zzso however, their function and signaling capacity is largely zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the scaffold protein zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso initiation of this complex leads to zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso zzso factor 6 zzso At the cellular level, zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso which in turn causes membrane zzso and the formation of cellular zzso Thus, our data identify a new signaling zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we establish zzso as an upstream regulator of zzso
