The mechanism of the zzso action of zzso in the heart was investigated by examining the effects of zzso zzso an zzso A1 zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso activity of guinea-pig zzso zzso These zzso contained zzso A1 receptors zzso 80 zzso and at least one zzso G protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40 zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso release in this membrane zzso However, zzso had no significant effect on zzso or zzso activated zzso zzso Additionally, zzso did not change the sensitivity of the zzso to either zzso or zzso in these zzso The zzso of zzso activity appeared to be dependent on the zzso state of the zzso such that the degree of zzso zzso decreased with increasing zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity occurs predominantly by modulating zzso zzso signal zzso and that zzso of zzso may be involved in this zzso
