The regulatory zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the inactive zzso zzso complex separates into two active zzso zzso zzso and a zzso R zzso Thus far, only zzso R structures have been zzso which fell short in explaining differences of zzso binding for the full-length protein as compared to the truncated R zzso Here we solved a full-length zzso structure that reflects the biologically relevant zzso and this structure agrees well with small angle X-ray zzso An zzso interface is revealed between the zzso This interface acts as an zzso sensor for zzso and explains the cooperative character of zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso on this interface not only leads to structural and zzso changes, but is also linked to Carney complex zzso
