zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a loss of more than zzso of the zzso in the outer molecular layer of the zzso However, the loss of zzso is zzso Beginning a few days after zzso new zzso are formed, virtually replacing the lost zzso within 2 zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso is associated with specific modifications of zzso hormones and growth zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso plays important functional roles in zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is also involved in various aspects of synaptic zzso such as cellular growth and zzso To investigate further the potential roles of zzso in synaptic plasticity observed in the zzso model, zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative marker of zzso was examined at different times zzso zzso binding sites zzso decreased zzso at 2 and 8 days zzso zzso in different zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso but returned to control values at 14 and 30 days zzso In zzso portion of the zzso zzso binding was also decreased at 2 days zzso but only on the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso binding sites in the zzso increased by up to zzso in the zzso side while no significant change was observed in the zzso side at any time zzso It is known that zzso can be regulated by different systems following zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that these could be involved in the response of zzso and zzso binding sites following zzso Moreover, zzso seemed to be modified in different brain areas in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso
