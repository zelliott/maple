zzso in the zzso expressed gene zzso zzso 1 zzso cause zzso zzso Parkinson's zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso with an zzso zzso targeting zzso The mechanism that leads to selective zzso of zzso zzso via zzso zzso is zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso and an zzso truncated mature form (55 zzso have been described in human zzso Here, we report that the zzso 66 zzso and 55 zzso zzso forms in cultured cells are not exclusive to zzso but also occur in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 66 zzso is the zzso zzso in cultured zzso Using unbiased analyses of zzso zzso complexes by mass zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor studies, we identify zzso as a novel zzso client zzso This zzso system influences both the zzso distribution and the zzso zzso protein ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease whereas zzso expression increases the zzso zzso zzso protein ratio, zzso linking zzso and zzso and highlighting the potential relevance of this ratio for zzso zzso Finally, we document the influence of zzso on zzso zzso distribution, providing further evidence for a common zzso zzso in zzso zzso
