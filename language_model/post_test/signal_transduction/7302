The zzso zzso zzso represents an important zzso target because it has been implicated in cancer cell growth, survival, and zzso Recent studies show that zzso may also play a role in the development of resistance to currently available zzso In a broad range of zzso various components of the zzso zzso signaling axis are genetically zzso and the zzso can be activated through many different zzso The frequency of genetic zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, coupled with the impact in zzso and disease zzso make this signaling axis an attractive target in zzso zzso A better understanding of the critical function of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso has led to the clinical evaluation of novel rationally designed zzso in this zzso Three main categories of zzso zzso zzso have been developed so far: agents that target zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that target all class I zzso and zzso zzso that selectively target the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Emerging data highlight the promise of zzso zzso zzso in combination with other therapies for the treatment of patients with zzso zzso Further evaluation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso or subsequent regimens may improve clinical zzso This article reviews the role of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso and the potential clinical utility of zzso that target this zzso
