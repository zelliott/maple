zzso deposition of zzso zzso zzso zzso a condition known as fibrosis, is a hallmark of zzso muscular zzso Among the factors that trigger muscle zzso are transforming growth factor beta zzso and zzso II zzso zzso belongs to the zzso system, and its biological effects are exerted by zzso receptors type 1 and type 2 zzso and zzso zzso This study aims to determine the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in skeletal zzso C2 zzso zzso exposed to zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso expression but with no effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the skeletal muscle of mice increased the levels of zzso and zzso protein but unchanged zzso zzso We also detected higher expression levels of zzso zzso in zzso skeletal muscle of zzso mice than in normal zzso The induction of zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso because under the zzso conditions of the zzso activity of zzso zzso I or the zzso of zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso increase was strongly zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso activity in response to zzso is also required for zzso increase as evaluated by a zzso zzso Our results show that the levels of zzso but not zzso zzso are modulated by the zzso factor zzso in zzso and mouse skeletal zzso This finding suggests that zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso in zzso skeletal zzso
