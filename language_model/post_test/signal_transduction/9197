zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso transfer domain containing 7 zzso is a poorly characterized member of the zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso in zzso cells, involved in zzso transport and metabolism of zzso Previous studies dealing with the mechanisms underlying the human zzso gene expression led us to define the zzso regulatory sequences in the zzso promoter using as a model zzso zzso These include a functional T zzso zzso factor 4 zzso site involved in zzso zzso To understand these mechanisms in more depth, we examined the zzso factor 1 zzso contribution to zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso cells point out that the zzso promoter is activated by zzso and this effect is increased by zzso zzso using zzso nuclear proteins demonstrated that zzso binds to the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso and zzso are bound in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in combination with zzso in the zzso and zzso binding sites revealed that the zzso promoter is zzso activated by zzso and zzso and that the zzso binding site zzso plays an important role in this zzso zzso zzso acid zzso involved in the physical interaction with zzso abolished this zzso thus demonstrating that the contact between the two proteins is necessary for an efficient zzso zzso zzso Finally, these data suggest that zzso could function as a bridge between zzso and zzso forming a zzso complex, which would stimulate zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso convergence on zzso expression may have important implications in the zzso zzso and zzso contributing to the normal zzso zzso
