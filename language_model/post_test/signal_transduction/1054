The bone zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is an important positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso and other members of the transforming growth zzso zzso family have distinct effects on zzso zzso depending on cell type and cell differentiation zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso differentiation can be blocked by zzso In a search for key regulators of zzso differentiation we have used zzso analysis to identify genes which are zzso regulated by zzso and zzso Within the first 24 h following the onset of zzso 61 zzso genes were identified of which the zzso effect was zzso by zzso The majority of these zzso expressed transcripts are related to signal zzso zzso our data show that three zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso regulated by zzso and zzso This suggests that these genes might function as the focal point for interaction of zzso and zzso signaling during zzso zzso
