In zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of cardiac zzso zzso has been found to be markedly reduced compared to that of healthy zzso In order to test the hypothesis that the functional zzso of zzso in diseased zzso hearts is due to zzso zzso we investigated the effects of prolonged treatment with zzso zzso on cardiac zzso zzso Groups of zzso aged 240 days received either drinking water, or drinking water containing zzso (10 or 100 zzso or zzso (4 or 40 zzso After 4 zzso treatment animals were killed and heart zzso were prepared for determination of zzso and zzso zzso and their functional contribution to stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso absolute and relative zzso weight and zzso activity, were not affected by the different treatment zzso Neither absolute zzso nor relative proportions of zzso zzso differed between zzso and treated zzso zzso zzso had no effects on the functional efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso treated with high dose zzso showed unchanged zzso function but reduced zzso stimulation of zzso zzso The findings of the present study demonstrate that the disturbed zzso of cardiac zzso to zzso zzso cannot be reversed by in zzso treatment with zzso zzso and, therefore, is unlikely to be due to zzso zzso
