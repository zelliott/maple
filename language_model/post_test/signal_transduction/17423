The recently proposed binding mode of zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso group of these zzso interacts with zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 5 of this zzso Interestingly, zzso at the zzso of this zzso are also in close proximity to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We hypothesized that an zzso group at this position will form a zzso bond with zzso by functioning as a Michael zzso A zzso zzso analogue will not only prove this proposed binding mode, but will also provide a valuable tool for zzso zzso zzso 

We designed and zzso zzso and zzso characterized this compound in zzso zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso and zzso recruitment zzso The ability of zzso to act as a zzso zzso was assessed both chemically and zzso 

zzso was shown to be a partial zzso of zzso zzso G protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso prevented this zzso zzso 

zzso is thought to bind zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and partially induce zzso zzso G protein zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, these observations confirm our previously proposed binding mode of zzso zzso will be a useful tool to stabilize the zzso into an active confirmation and further investigate the structure of the active zzso zzso
