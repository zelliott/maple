Different levels of abstraction are needed to represent a living zzso Unfortunately information of different nature is not zzso in an obvious way, but requires a dedicated zzso Because biological zzso zzso zzso or zzso information, can be easily represented as zzso it is intuitive to integrate them into a unique zzso in which one can perform graph analysis for investigating a given biological zzso This study follows such a philosophy and completes a zzso and zzso zzso In a such integrated framework and as zzso we applied a graph analysis that automatically investigates impacts of the gene zzso to predict functional relationships between genes and zzso Our approach, called zzso creates a weighted zzso in which the weights rely on the given relationship between zzso and zzso zzso chains of reactions zzso by zzso This method, as a zzso of methods already published, can be easily adapted to several biological zzso properties or zzso This paper evaluates zzso on zzso zzso We automatically extract zzso called zzso and zzso their interest in both zzso and zzso contexts by showing functional compounds like zzso or functional zzso
