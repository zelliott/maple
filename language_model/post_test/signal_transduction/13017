zzso body formation in zzso zzso involves three zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which are induced by the cell zzso zzso We analyzed the function of the zzso zzso a novel component in the zzso response zzso A zzso carrying an zzso deletion in the zzso gene displays delayed zzso and a cell autonomous zzso zzso whereas it remains zzso zzso To further define the function of zzso the zzso pattern of zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was examined in the Delta zzso zzso and we found that zzso is required for zzso of zzso during zzso Specifically, zzso was found to be required for the zzso zzso of zzso The Delta zzso zzso produced zzso levels of zzso However, zzso of the zzso response regulator zzso which is essential for the execution of the zzso responses, was reduced in the Delta zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to stimulate the zzso activated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso acts independently of the A- and zzso to stimulate zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso defects of the Delta zzso zzso are associated with a lack of zzso to ensure a proper response to the zzso during the zzso and zzso stages of zzso
