The zzso and zzso cellular and molecular changes occurring with age in the human colon affect both the inflammatory process leading to zzso injury and the zzso capacity of the zzso On the one hand, age-related zzso zzso and zzso may lead to the development of zzso zzso which results in zzso zzso On the other hand, the altered migration and function of zzso stem cells, the age-related zzso of zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso of growth factor signaling with age, may be involved in delayed zzso zzso The connections of these zzso to the process of zzso are not fully zzso The understanding and zzso modification of these mechanisms are of great clinical importance with regard to disease prevention and modern therapeutic zzso Here, we aim to zzso the age-related microscopic and molecular changes of the human zzso as well as their role in altered zzso zzso
