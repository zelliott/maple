zzso zzso expansion is an early zzso leading to zzso and chronic zzso zzso A beneficial effect is achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which also favor zzso zzso B2 zzso zzso zzso To define the underlying zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso could be a negative regulator of collagen synthesis in zzso cells zzso We investigated the effect of BK on collagen synthesis and signaling in zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso BK inhibited collagen I and IV synthesis zzso by high zzso zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso but did not alter zzso zzso of collagen synthesis was zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the BK zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor prevented BK zzso The in zzso impact of zzso on zzso zzso expansion was assessed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso expansion and zzso in diabetic zzso In diabetic rats, zzso expansion and zzso were prevented by zzso but not by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the lowered BK content of diabetic zzso was restored by zzso In conclusion, deficient zzso zzso aggravated zzso zzso expansion in diabetic zzso whereas zzso zzso reduced zzso collagen synthesis by a mechanism targeting zzso and zzso common pathways activated by zzso and zzso Taken together, the data support the hypothesis of an zzso effect of zzso zzso
