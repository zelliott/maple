Sonic zzso zzso signaling by the polarizing region, at the zzso of the zzso limb zzso is pivotal in determining zzso number and zzso zzso establishes a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high levels of full-length zzso zzso in the zzso zzso where digits form, and high levels of shorter zzso zzso in the zzso zzso formation depends on protein zzso A zzso but in zzso zzso also plays a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in chick limb development using zzso had no effect on zzso polarizing activity but weak polarizing activity, based on zzso zzso zzso was induced in anterior limb bud cells resulting in extra zzso zzso zzso activity levels directly with a zzso expressing activated zzso induced extra digits similar to those induced by zzso treatment suggesting that zzso may have a previously zzso positive role in zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso dominant negative zzso also induced zzso sometimes multiple digits, from anterior limb bud demonstrating the negative role in zzso zzso zzso levels in the limb bud are high zzso and low zzso suggesting that zzso activity may influence the outcome of zzso signaling in normal zzso
