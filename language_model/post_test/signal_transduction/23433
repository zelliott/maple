In zzso cells, the first line of defense against viral pathogens is the innate immune response, which is characterized by induction of type I zzso zzso and other zzso zzso that establish an zzso milieu both in infected cells and in neighboring zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso virus of the zzso family, is the primary zzso agent of severe zzso in young children zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso replication zzso a zzso type I zzso response that involves both zzso and zzso two zzso viral zzso zzso This study reports the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso that activate zzso zzso Using an in zzso approach with zzso zzso zzso zzso nascent zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso in zzso zzso were found to be potent zzso zzso In addition, large zzso isolated from zzso cells six hours zzso zzso in zzso 6 zzso large zzso also activated zzso zzso whereas a comparable large zzso fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this zzso zzso zzso using knockout zzso embryonic zzso showed that zzso is required for and zzso partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in zzso zzso and in zzso 6 zzso large zzso zzso studies demonstrated that in zzso zzso and in zzso 6 zzso large zzso samples contain zzso zzso with exposed zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso cap structures were also detected in the in zzso 6 zzso large zzso zzso Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso zzso which encodes both zzso and zzso activities, is not completely efficient at either zzso capping or zzso of the zzso cap structures of viral zzso and in this way produces zzso patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the zzso zzso
