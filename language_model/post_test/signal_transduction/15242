zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso However, the zzso itself cannot give rise to a robust zzso response zzso to the limited numbers of zzso resident stem cells present in the zzso It has been shown that zzso stem cells zzso can enhance cardiac repair via the release of zzso factors such as zzso growth factor zzso We investigated whether the increased expression of zzso in zzso mediates the beneficial effects of zzso on cardiac zzso zzso and zzso were prepared from Lewis rats and zzso in a zzso system, which allowed the diffusion of zzso factors but prevented cell contact between the two cell zzso The proliferation of zzso was determined by zzso zzso The expression of zzso was assessed by real-time zzso and flow zzso The zzso rate of zzso in response to zzso was determined by flow zzso We found that the expression of zzso in zzso was increased by zzso factors released by zzso The effect of zzso factors on zzso expression was attenuated by IGF-1 zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that increased zzso expression requires IGF-1 zzso zzso via the zzso 3 zzso zzso These findings provide a new paradigm for the biological effects of IGF-1 and have significant implications for understanding the beneficial effects of zzso on zzso zzso
