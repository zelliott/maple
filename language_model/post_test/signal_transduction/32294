During the development of the peripheral nervous system there is extensive zzso and these zzso corpses need to be cleared to prevent an inflammatory zzso Recently, zzso and zzso both expressed in zzso precursor cells, were identified in mouse as having an essential role in this zzso zzso et zzso zzso however, the mechanisms by which they promote zzso remained zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso the zzso zzso of zzso as a signal zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with each zzso independently through the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso in their zzso zzso The interaction was enhanced by zzso of the zzso in the zzso by zzso family zzso zzso zzso association with zzso and zzso of the zzso was also induced by exposure to dead zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso cells facilitated zzso of zzso zzso to a similar extent, and there was no additive effect when they were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso prevented zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso or a selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso also blocked zzso Similarly, in zzso of zzso precursors and dying sensory zzso from embryonic mice, addition of zzso or knock down of zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso can mediate zzso independently through the recruitment of zzso
