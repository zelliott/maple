zzso zzso 1 zzso is the major copper zzso influx zzso in zzso zzso We report here that zzso is required for the zzso of signaling to the zzso zzso by the zzso of three major zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was compared in zzso wild type zzso and zzso zzso Whereas all three zzso increased zzso in the zzso cells, they failed to do this in zzso zzso While zzso did not enhance the zzso of zzso in the zzso cells, both zzso and zzso increased zzso in the zzso but not zzso zzso The deficit in zzso zzso in the zzso cells was rescued by adding zzso to the zzso and it was induced in zzso cells by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso availability was reduced in the zzso cells as reflected by increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso The failure of zzso signaling to both zzso and zzso suggested the presence of a zzso step upstream of zzso The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for generating the hydrogen zzso in response to zzso zzso that serves to inhibit zzso that normally limit zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced by a factor of zzso in the zzso cells, and addition of hydrogen zzso restored zzso We conclude that zzso acquired from zzso is required for signaling in pathways regulated by zzso that play major roles in development and zzso
