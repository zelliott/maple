To investigate the expression and significance of zzso differentiation protein zzso in pancreatic zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso specimens of pancreatic zzso was detected by tissue zzso and zzso The correlations were analyzed between zzso and zzso zzso neural invasion, zzso zzso zzso around the zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso zzso zzso and age, zzso location of tumors, zzso types and differentiation of pancreatic zzso 

The positive rates of zzso zzso and zzso expression were higher in pancreatic zzso than those in zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso expression in pancreatic zzso was related to that of zzso and zzso and neural invasion zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was found between zzso and age, zzso tumor location, zzso types and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso 

zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso The zzso of zzso may contribute to the zzso and development of pancreatic zzso and is closely correlated to the cancer cell zzso zzso signal zzso and neural invasion in pancreatic zzso
