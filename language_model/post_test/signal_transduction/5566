The zzso protein of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso plays a crucial role in AIDS zzso by zzso host cell signaling zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso complex, a key zzso involved in the generation of zzso oxygen species during the respiratory burst in human zzso We have recently shown that the zzso expression of zzso zzso in human zzso cell line zzso in zzso mode the zzso zzso release by zzso zzso inducing a fast increase of the zzso production, followed by a delayed strong zzso zzso by zzso soluble zzso Our study is focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cells zzso zzso with different zzso zzso we found that both zzso membrane zzso and intact zzso domain are needed to induce zzso zzso The lack of effect during treatment with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso release is independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced the zzso and then the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso complex zzso to the plasma zzso Adding the inhibitor zzso prevented this process, zzso the involvement of the zzso family zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso inhibited both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso regulates the zzso zzso activity through the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso
