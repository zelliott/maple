The zzso agent zzso acid zzso is known to enhance zzso resistance to the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso by zzso salicylic acid zzso zzso zzso notably zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain zzso A zzso zzso analysis of BABA zzso during zzso zzso infection revealed direct and primed zzso of genes that are responsive to zzso the zzso analogue zzso and zzso In addition, BABA was found to inhibit the zzso response to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to promote bacterial zzso by inducing the zzso acid zzso response to antagonize zzso zzso zzso BABA specifically zzso the zzso response induced by zzso without affecting other plant zzso zzso This repression was largely zzso suggesting that it is not caused by negative zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment with relatively high zzso of zzso zzso zzso BABA zzso Under these conditions, BABA failed to protect zzso against zzso zzso BABA did not induce zzso and resistance in plants zzso with a zzso strain of zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, BABA blocked the zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that BABA zzso for enhanced resistance to zzso zzso by interfering with the bacterial suppression of zzso zzso zzso This study also suggests the existence of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso from other zzso zzso
