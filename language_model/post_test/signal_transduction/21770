To investigate the inflammatory signal zzso of high mobility group zzso protein zzso induced inflammatory response in rat zzso zzso 

zzso zzso obtained from male zzso rats were seeded in zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso tissue culture zzso The cells were incubated for 3 days before they were zzso with zzso and treated with zzso zzso specific inhibitor of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso or zzso (the specific inhibitor of zzso The zzso and zzso responses between zzso stimulation and tumor necrosis zzso zzso gene expression as well as release were analyzed zzso Moreover, the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso expression and protein release were also zzso 

zzso After zzso challenge, zzso zzso expressions were zzso zzso peaked at 24 hours, and decreased at 36 zzso When zzso was used at a concentration of 10 zzso zzso zzso expression increased most zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso release in rat zzso zzso with zzso at 4 hours and decreasing at 8 hours zzso When the concentration of zzso stimulation increased from 5 zzso to 25 zzso zzso release was persistently zzso zzso It was also showed that zzso zzso expression was significantly inhibited by treatment of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso while zzso release was not markedly zzso 

zzso and zzso might be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso but not in zzso early release zzso 24 zzso induced by zzso stimulation in rat zzso zzso
