zzso zzso of zzso signaling and subsequent zzso of zzso response zzso zzso is a critical event in the development of human colon zzso Thus, zzso signaling is an attractive target for the development of zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso as an inhibitor of zzso signaling from zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonized zzso that was zzso by zzso medium by promoting the degradation of zzso This degradation zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso which is a known zzso target zzso and zzso the growth of colon cancer zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso
