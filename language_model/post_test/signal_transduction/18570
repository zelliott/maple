The remarkably wide dynamic range of the zzso zzso of zzso coli, a model signal zzso system, is achieved by zzso of the zzso zzso that regulate the zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso cluster at a cell pole together with zzso and the zzso zzso Several lines of evidence have led to models that assume high zzso and sensitivity via collaboration of zzso zzso within a zzso Here, using in zzso zzso zzso zzso we have demonstrated a well defined arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso The differential effects of zzso on zzso at different positions indicate that zzso alters the relative orientation of zzso zzso to each other (presumably inducing zzso zzso without much affecting the zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the effect of zzso on zzso at any position tested was roughly opposite to that of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso attenuated the effects of zzso by several orders of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso modification controls signal gain by altering the arrangement or packing of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
