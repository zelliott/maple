zzso acid is an zzso signaling zzso derived from zzso zzso So far, zzso zzso (including the free acid and a number of zzso has been shown to regulate or zzso a wide range of processes in plants, from responses to zzso and zzso stresses to the zzso maturation of zzso and zzso in zzso This review focuses on discoveries in several of these zzso Most work described is from studies in zzso While the results are expected to be broadly zzso to other higher plants, there are cases where related but distinct zzso have been observed in other species zzso zzso Investigation of zzso action in zzso and zzso responses has established that this compound is an essential component of the systemic signal that activates defense genes throughout the zzso It is possible that zzso acts indirectly through the production of zzso oxygen species including hydrogen zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso deficient in zzso synthesis has been central to the identification of additional roles for zzso in defense against microbial pathogens and in zzso zzso Currently, the key issues in zzso action are to understand the role of the zzso zzso complex, zzso and to identify additional protein components that act in the early steps of zzso zzso
