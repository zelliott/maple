zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso has critical roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation during animal development and adult zzso Here, we show that human zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso comprised of a C2 domain, 4 WW zzso and a zzso domain, regulates zzso and zzso of zzso zzso binds directly to and zzso activated zzso by interacting primarily via its zzso domain with a novel zzso sequence zzso zzso on zzso zzso of this recognition motif zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of activated zzso as also observed upon zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso exhibits sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in human embryonic neural stem cells strongly promotes zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso patterning zzso zzso consistent with excessive zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a key regulator of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso differentiation and embryonic zzso
