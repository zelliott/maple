Pulmonary zzso protein A zzso plays an important role in zzso of the innate immune system of the zzso zzso zzso a cell wall component of zzso bacteria, is known to elicit excessive zzso zzso production from immune zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso interacts with zzso and alters zzso cellular zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is not a zzso for zzso However, zzso significantly reduced zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso by zzso cells and rat zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso was dependent upon zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with human embryonic kidney zzso cells that had been zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso a cell signaling zzso for zzso significantly attenuated zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso directly bound to a soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso with zzso significantly reduced the binding of zzso to zzso These results indicate that the direct interaction of zzso with zzso alters zzso cell zzso We propose that zzso zzso inflammatory responses against the bacterial components by interactions with zzso zzso
