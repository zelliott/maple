zzso of the molecular details of signal zzso through zzso coupled receptors zzso awaits the solution of high-resolution structures of the zzso species involved in passing the zzso information across the plasma zzso The critical challenge in this effort is the production of sufficient quantities of active and homogeneous zzso species amenable to zzso zzso We describe here the high-level expression in zzso cells and characterization of a fusion complex between the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso alpha zzso G zzso zzso of growth conditions resulted in the highest level of active binding sites reported to date for either zzso receptors or zzso alpha zzso In cells, the zzso zzso zzso was stabilized against zzso in the context of the fusion protein and was competent to bind both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the G alpha zzso was demonstrated by changes in zzso affinity in the presence of zzso zzso and by zzso increases in the rate of zzso zzso zzso In addition to representing a zzso relevant signaling complex, the additional zzso surface area provided by the zzso may enhance the chances of producing zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
