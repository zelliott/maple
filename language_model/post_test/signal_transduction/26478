The zzso signaling zzso is central for liver functions and frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the early zzso and molecular events following zzso zzso is therefore essential for better understanding zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is a putative zzso target gene and promotes zzso survival, zzso and liver zzso suggesting that zzso may be a key target of zzso signaling in the zzso 

To address this issue, the immediate zzso zzso following deletion of the tumor zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso The contribution of zzso to these zzso was dissected in double zzso animals lacking both, zzso and zzso zzso was rapidly activated in virtually all zzso zzso zzso while zzso was induced only after several days, suggesting that its expression was rather a secondary event following zzso deletion in the zzso Loss of zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and premature zzso Interestingly, additional deletion of zzso did not affect zzso proliferation but resulted in increased liver damage and zzso This zzso correlated with impaired expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso is not a primary target of zzso signaling in the liver, but rather protects against liver damage, which in turn may promote liver zzso
