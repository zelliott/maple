The present study addressed the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso innate immunity and explored the underlying molecular zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso mice were resistant to both septic zzso induced by zzso zzso and puncture zzso and zzso zzso zzso In bone zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice, zzso pathways of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were impaired compared to zzso zzso zzso While zzso expression was not altered, the intensity of zzso zzso DNA was increased in zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso inhibitor studies revealed that impaired zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso could be responsible for decreased zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso exhibited an alternatively activated zzso zzso and the impaired zzso signal zzso responses in zzso cells were similar to the signaling responses observed in zzso zzso skewed to an alternatively activated zzso These results indicate that zzso deficient in zzso impart a regulatory influence on zzso innate zzso
