zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso however, the effects of zzso on zzso during zzso differentiation have not been zzso This study investigated whether human dental pulp cells zzso treated with zzso could express zzso during differentiation into zzso cells and sought to identify its underlying mechanism of zzso 

To analyze zzso we measured alkaline zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso formation by zzso red zzso and marker zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso 

zzso activity, the zzso and zzso expression for zzso markers were enhanced by zzso in zzso zzso also zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso 

Taken together, these data suggest that zzso plays a role not only as a differentiation inducing factor in the injury repair processes of zzso tissue but also as a positive regulator of zzso zzso which may help in tissue engineering and pulp zzso using zzso However, the fate of zzso or zzso zzso effective local delivery for zzso interaction of zzso and zzso factors, and other limitations will need to be overcome before a major zzso for the treatment of pulp zzso
