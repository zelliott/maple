B cell development is a complex process involving interactions between B cell zzso zzso and known and unknown zzso and zzso In order to more fully understand the requirements for zzso in that development we have created transgenic mice that carry a gamma zzso zzso and express it early in B cell zzso Previously it was believed that these B cells arrested in their development prior to the zzso to zzso cell zzso We show here that in conventional gamma zzso mice, B cell development actually arrests later, at the zzso cell zzso This shows for the first time that a constant region different from zzso can allow signaling through the zzso cell zzso but cannot promote complete zzso The zzso and zzso cells in the conventional gamma zzso zzso are not fully functional since they cannot grow in zzso without zzso zzso This is a novel zzso separating development from zzso zzso The few, mature B cells that do develop in these mice express both zzso and gamma zzso zzso and are zzso zzso of a zzso zzso allows survival of gamma zzso transgenic immature B cells, but does not promote full zzso indicating that normally zzso provides both an zzso signal and a differentiation zzso One line of gamma zzso mice, the C line, does not have this zzso B cell development is accelerated in this unconventional line, and the developing B cells have a very different zzso from both normal mice and conventional gamma zzso mouse lines, but are very similar to zzso zzso zzso B cells are largely zzso gamma zzso zzso This unique zzso is apparently due to the zzso in B cell precursors of a gene at the zzso site of the zzso zzso the need for zzso zzso of conventional gamma zzso zzso with the C line and zzso zzso reveals the multiple signals required throughout B cell zzso
