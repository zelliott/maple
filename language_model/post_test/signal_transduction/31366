The zzso physiology of zzso coli is dominated by its zzso zzso zzso which are expressed under zzso growth zzso zzso activity in zzso coli requires the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso by zzso in the presence of excess zzso Recently, a zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso This study examines the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, deletion of zzso increased zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso expression required the newly identified zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso zzso expression and a corresponding decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso promoter DNA zzso and this interaction is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso is affected differently among deletion strains with impaired zzso zzso Surprisingly, in low zzso growth conditions zzso expression is required for zzso import via zzso The data support a model with two distinct pools of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso bridges these two pools by controlling the levels of the zzso pool based on the zzso levels in the second zzso
