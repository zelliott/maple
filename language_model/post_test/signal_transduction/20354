zzso plays a key role in the development of zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso is a possible therapeutic approach for preventing this disease, and reports have suggested that zzso protects against zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso This study examines whether zzso zzso which stimulates zzso prevents zzso zzso via the zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso increased nuclear levels of zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and type 1 collagen expression in zzso rat zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso which was restored by zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso response element zzso zzso target genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not reverse the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso genes or zzso zzso zzso suggesting an zzso zzso activity of zzso Finally, zzso suppressed unilateral zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and type 1 collagen expression in the zzso zzso from zzso mice, along with increased and decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso via the zzso zzso of zzso signaling in an zzso manner, suggesting that zzso could be used to treat zzso zzso
