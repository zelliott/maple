zzso zzso infection is thought to be involved in the development of several gastric zzso Two zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso A and zzso gene zzso reportedly interact with zzso zzso in gastric zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso infection has been investigated extensively in host zzso However, the zzso molecules in zzso zzso that are involved in zzso zzso innate sensing have not been well zzso This study investigated whether zzso zzso play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and thereby contribute to inflammation in gastric zzso zzso We observed that both zzso and zzso zzso and protein levels were significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso cells than in zzso zzso Moreover, significantly more zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso cells than in those extracted from zzso zzso However, this effect was attenuated by the treatment of cells with zzso agents, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso signaling is dependent on zzso zzso Similarly, the level of cellular zzso was elevated and zzso was zzso into zzso zzso after zzso zzso infection, leading to zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso inhibitor zzso we observed that zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso These results indicate the zzso of zzso and zzso into zzso zzso by zzso zzso infection in response to inflammation in gastric zzso zzso
