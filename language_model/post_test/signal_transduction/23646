Nerve growth factor zzso regulates the zzso differentiation and survival of cells and is also involved in the wound healing and tissue zzso zzso The biological effects of zzso are dependent upon zzso zzso functions, which differ between zzso This study attempted to investigate the zzso effect and possible mechanism of zzso on zzso zzso human liver zzso cell zzso We demonstrated that zzso cells expressed the zzso receptors zzso zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso markedly reduced cell injury and promoted the proliferation of zzso cells damaged by zzso However, this proliferation effect was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were released at reduced levels in the zzso cell culture zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso content in the cell medium and zzso zzso zzso levels were markedly zzso and the zzso of the zzso membrane of the zzso cells was improved by zzso Our results suggested that zzso zzso protects zzso cells from zzso injury through the zzso zzso signaling zzso
