Much attention has been paid to the ability of zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso to protect zzso from zzso insults in the central nervous system zzso However, little is known about zzso action on zzso zzso that also can express zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on primary rat zzso that function as resident zzso in the zzso and as the source of zzso zzso upon zzso We found that treatment of primary rat zzso with zzso had no effect on the zzso of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso but it increased the zzso oxide zzso production to some zzso In addition, zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso the gene expression of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the production of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso capability in primary rat zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in the mouse zzso cell line zzso by zzso indicated that the zzso zzso signaling zzso may be involved in the regulation of NO and zzso zzso production by zzso In zzso evidence also showed that zzso cells with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso appeared in zzso spinal zzso zzso at the zzso site 1 week post spinal zzso injury zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the mouse zzso cell line zzso by zzso indicated that the zzso zzso signaling zzso may be involved in the regulation of NO and zzso zzso production by zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso has a positive regulatory effect on zzso activities, such as zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso
