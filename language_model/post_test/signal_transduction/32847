During zzso zzso development, zzso zzso complexes are expressed at the cell surface before the zzso cell zzso zzso Signaling through zzso zzso complexes is required for expression of rearranged zzso zzso On expression of a zzso zzso chain, the zzso is zzso and zzso locus zzso exclusion is zzso We investigated the putative contribution of zzso zzso complex signaling to zzso locus zzso exclusion in mice zzso or zzso for zzso and/or zzso These mice display defects in the expression of zzso zzso genes in immature zzso zzso to the severity of zzso complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity, zzso zzso by a functional zzso zzso was severely compromised in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso mice, most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso mice failed to express the zzso zzso suggesting defective expression of the zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso In the zzso mice, a proportion of zzso zzso zzso that failed to express the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Many zzso cells of the zzso mice zzso zzso and transgenic zzso chains or more than one zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that signaling through zzso zzso complexes may contribute to zzso exclusion of the zzso locus by inducing the expression of rearranged zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso
