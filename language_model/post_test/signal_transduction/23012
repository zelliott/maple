To investigate the roles of tumor necrosis factor zzso and the zzso interaction in zzso zzso production by zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso tissue and culture zzso of SC from patients with zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso production by SC were zzso zzso of immobilized zzso treatment and depletion of zzso T cells on zzso production were also zzso zzso expression by zzso T cells and zzso zzso production during culture were analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso tissue and spontaneous zzso zzso production by SC from zzso patients were significantly higher than the levels in zzso and AS zzso zzso zzso production by SC from zzso patients significantly decreased after depletion of zzso T cells from SC or after application of zzso zzso but not by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation increased spontaneous zzso zzso production and zzso expression by zzso T zzso The zzso of zzso zzso production by zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso production was also increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso production was inhibited by zzso zzso but not by T cell depletion and zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso production by zzso SC more strongly than spontaneous zzso zzso restored zzso zzso production that had been inhibited by zzso 

zzso production in zzso is regulated by 2 different zzso One zzso is T cell dependent, predominantly through a zzso interaction, while the other is T cell independent, zzso through zzso zzso of zzso production by interference with zzso interaction and zzso production may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating zzso
