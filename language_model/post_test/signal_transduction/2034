zzso is an important zzso for zzso zzso and plays a major role in zzso and zzso zzso activates zzso mainly through zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to cause zzso zzso by zzso signaling through zzso and zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways is the general mechanism by which zzso and zzso zzso also activate zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso but not in the presence of either zzso zzso a protein zzso C selective inhibitor that zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also blocked by zzso zzso or zzso In zzso from a zzso zzso patient, zzso zzso and zzso also failed to inhibit zzso zzso In zzso from mice lacking the zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso caused a rightward shift of human zzso zzso induced by the lower zzso of zzso and zzso but had no effect at higher zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso from mice deficient in the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso depends exclusively on zzso zzso zzso that stimulates zzso signaling pathways and zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides cause zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso
