B cells originate from zzso zzso stem cells and differentiate in the bone zzso into mature B zzso The differentiation of a stem cell into a mature B cell can be subdivided into five steps: early zzso cells, late zzso cell stage, zzso cell stage, immature B cells, and mature B zzso Each differentiation step appears to be regulated by zzso and zzso The earliest zzso zzso are bound to the zzso cell surface by adhesive interactions through cell surface molecules to promote the binding of zzso to stem cell factor zzso At the late zzso cell stage, zzso zzso zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells to zzso zzso Surface zzso mature B cells leave bone zzso and circulate into peripheral zzso zzso in which they can be activated to zzso and to differentiate into zzso cells by encountering zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso cells activate B cells by their products, zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso molecules including zzso zzso Each zzso has zzso activity on B cells and other cell types, and acts through a specific zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso causes functional zzso of B zzso
