Plant seeds can sense diverse environmental signals and integrate the information to regulate zzso responses, such as dormancy and zzso The zzso clock zzso a growth advantage on plants and uses environmental information for zzso Here, we show that normal zzso clock gene function is essential for the response to zzso signals in zzso We show that zzso in the clock genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause zzso defects in response to low temperature, alternating temperatures, and dry zzso We demonstrate that the zzso clock is arrested in an zzso state in dry seeds but rapidly zzso to zzso cycles in ambient temperatures upon zzso zzso with a role for clock genes in seed dormancy control, zzso expression is zzso induced in response to dry zzso and that zzso affects the zzso of subsequent zzso clock gene zzso Control of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in seeds requires normal zzso function, and zzso and TIMING OF zzso zzso regulate the response to zzso and zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso clock genes play a key role in the integration of environmental signaling controlling dormancy release in zzso
