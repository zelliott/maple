The zzso zzso capacity is essential for the maintenance of zzso function, and the impairment of energy metabolism and zzso zzso is a hallmark of brain aging, which is particularly zzso in the early stages of neurodegenerative zzso 

The communications between zzso and the rest of the cell by zzso and zzso signaling establish a master regulatory device that controls cellular energy levels and the zzso zzso zzso of this regulatory devise is critical for aging and the early stages of neurodegenerative zzso 

This review focuses on a coordinated zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation, and zzso zzso controls the cellular energy levels and zzso status as well as factors which impair this zzso network during brain aging and zzso 

zzso of zzso function and zzso communications will provide pivotal opportunities for identifying targets and developing new strategies aimed at restoring the zzso zzso axis that is compromised in brain aging and zzso
