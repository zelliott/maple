Exposure to zzso induced zzso zzso and animal studies have shown that zzso cell death is correlated with zzso zzso following cerebral zzso Thus, it is likely that toxic inflammatory zzso produced by activated zzso under hypoxic conditions may exacerbate zzso injury following cerebral zzso The zzso zzso zzso is primarily involved in the sensing and adapting of cells to changes in the zzso level, which is regulated by many zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso under zzso has not yet been zzso In the current work, we investigate the signaling pathways of zzso involved in the regulation of zzso zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso in zzso Exposure of primary rat zzso cultures as well as established zzso cell line zzso to zzso induced the expression of zzso indicating that zzso could lead to the inflammatory zzso of zzso zzso induction was accompanied with NO zzso Moreover, the molecular analysis of these events indicated that zzso expression was regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, during cerebral zzso zzso may not only directly damage zzso but also promote zzso injury indirectly via zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso induced zzso expression by regulation of zzso in zzso
