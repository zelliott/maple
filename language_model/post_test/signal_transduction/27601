Only mature B zzso can enter the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and thus efficiently participate in the immune zzso zzso zzso B zzso derive from short-lived precursors generated in the bone zzso We show that selection into the mature pool is an active process and takes place in the zzso Two populations of zzso B cells were identified as precursors for mature B zzso Transitional B cells of type 1 zzso are recent immigrants from the bone zzso They develop into the transitional B cells of type 2 zzso which are cycling and found exclusively in the primary zzso of the zzso zzso B cells can be generated from zzso or zzso B zzso Mice with genetic deletions of elements participating in the B cell zzso signaling cascade display zzso arrest at the zzso or zzso zzso The analysis of these defects showed that the development of zzso and mature B cells from zzso precursors requires defined qualitative and quantitative signals derived from the B cell zzso and that the induction of longevity and maturation requires different zzso
