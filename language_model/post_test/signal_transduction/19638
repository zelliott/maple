As a tumor marker for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso potential of cancer zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso and is zzso in a wide variety of human zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso mediates zzso remain to be zzso zzso growth zzso zzso signaling regulates both tumor suppression and zzso and also contributes to the stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cancer zzso However, it remains unknown whether zzso in turn, influences zzso functions and if a regulatory zzso exists between zzso and the zzso signaling zzso Here, we report that zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso response in zzso cancer cell lines with elevated zzso thereby restoring the zzso effects of zzso signaling on zzso zzso also enhances the survival of zzso cancer cells in both local colonization and liver zzso in animal zzso Our study provides novel insights into the interaction between zzso and zzso signaling zzso and establishes a negative feedback loop in amplifying the progression of colon cancer cells to more invasive zzso These findings offer new therapeutic opportunities to inhibit zzso cancer cell proliferation by zzso zzso in promoting zzso action of the zzso zzso
