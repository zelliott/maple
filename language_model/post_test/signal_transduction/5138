zzso is a soft tissue zzso mainly seen in zzso Despite considerable progress within the last few years, therapeutic approaches for this type of tumor are still zzso The respective tumor cells originate from zzso precursor cells and are characterized by a blockade in their differentiation zzso Interestingly, there is a direct inverse correlation between the differentiation status of a specific zzso cell and its zzso zzso Thus, here, we tested whether the ubiquitous zzso factor zzso which regulates zzso differentiation and is also a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of other types of tumors, might be an interesting candidate for the development of novel zzso treatment zzso For this purpose, we analyzed zzso activity zzso zzso in zzso with different differentiation potential, specifically in three different zzso cell zzso In addition, we inhibited zzso activity in these cells and analyzed the effects on zzso zzso We show that after the induction of zzso zzso activity declines rapidly in normal zzso but only slightly in zzso zzso However, after treatment of the cells with two different zzso zzso compounds, the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso we found that neither zzso nor zzso promoted zzso differentiation in either normal zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that treatment with zzso or zzso might not be a suitable approach in the treatment of zzso
