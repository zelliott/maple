zzso zzso binding cassette zzso family zzso is a cellular membrane zzso that zzso the delivery of zzso to zzso zzso bodies in zzso a process that is critical for zzso barrier zzso Following zzso of zzso bodies into the stratum zzso zzso are zzso to zzso which comprise approximately 50% of the zzso in stratum zzso Gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a devastating skin disorder characterized by abnormal zzso bodies and a severe barrier zzso Recently we reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver X zzso zzso increase zzso expression in human zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso increases zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and small interfering zzso zzso of human alkaline zzso which all increase zzso zzso levels, also increased zzso zzso zzso Moreover, simultaneous treatment with zzso and each of these same zzso zzso increased zzso zzso indicating that zzso is an important zzso of zzso expression and that the conversion of zzso to other zzso or zzso is not zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso expression (but not other zzso or liver X zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso zzso specifically diminished the zzso increase in zzso zzso levels, indicating that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso Together, these results show that zzso an important zzso component of zzso zzso zzso expression via the zzso signaling pathway, providing a zzso zzso mechanism for regulating this key zzso zzso
