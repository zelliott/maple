The central neural mechanisms underlying differences in cardiovascular zzso between zzso zzso sleep zzso and zzso sleep zzso remain poorly zzso These mechanisms may involve zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is linked to zzso states, involved in central zzso control, and impaired in zzso zzso Thus, we investigated whether zzso signaling plays a role in controlling cardiovascular zzso during spontaneous behavior in zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice lacking zzso zzso zzso knockout mice lacking zzso peptides zzso and zzso controls zzso were zzso with zzso for sleep recordings and a zzso blood pressure zzso zzso of zzso blood pressure zzso and heart period zzso during undisturbed zzso behavior were analyzed with the sequence technique, zzso functions, and coherent averaging of zzso zzso During zzso all mice had lower zzso zzso greater zzso contribution to zzso control at low zzso and greater zzso of the central zzso and zzso changes in zzso associated with zzso surges than during zzso During zzso all mice had higher zzso zzso and depressed central zzso and zzso zzso controls relative to zzso zzso zzso during zzso was higher than during zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso also had lower zzso of the cardiac zzso response to zzso surges during zzso than zzso These results indicate that chronic lack of zzso signaling may cause subtle zzso in the control of zzso during spontaneous zzso zzso the integrity of zzso signaling is not necessary for the occurrence of zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso
