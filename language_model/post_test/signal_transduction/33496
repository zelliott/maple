We have used zzso interference previously to demonstrate that G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso regulates zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso In this report, we investigate the regulation of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso significantly increased zzso calcium zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso reduced calcium zzso after zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso defective in zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on calcium zzso suggesting that zzso primarily regulates zzso after zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso also significantly increased zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso also significantly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso whereas prolonged zzso zzso was only observed with zzso or zzso zzso We also investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso of zzso increased calcium zzso but not zzso zzso In zzso our data suggest that multiple proteins zzso regulate zzso zzso calcium zzso whereas zzso and zzso play the primary role in regulating zzso zzso
