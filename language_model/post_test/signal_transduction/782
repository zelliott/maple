zzso nuclear proteins are selectively imported into the nucleus by transport factors such as zzso alpha and zzso The relationship between the efficiency of nuclear protein import and the cell cycle was measured using specific import zzso for the zzso zzso zzso After the zzso of zzso T zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso into the zzso of synchronized culture cells at a certain phase of the cell cycle, the nuclear import of the zzso was measured zzso Cell zzso change in import efficiency, but not capacity, was zzso That is, import efficiency was found low in the early zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with other zzso In addition, we found that the extent of zzso of zzso alpha with zzso beta from cell extracts was strongly associated with import zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso nuclear import machinery is regulated in a cell zzso manner through the zzso of interaction modes between zzso alpha and zzso
