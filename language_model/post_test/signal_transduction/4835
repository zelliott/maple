Our previous research found that structural changes of the zzso network influence zzso in zzso by regulating the zzso factor zzso during the early stages of zzso However, little is known about the underlying regulatory mechanism of the changes of zzso caused by zzso network zzso The von zzso tumor zzso protein zzso as a zzso zzso is best understood as a negative regulator of zzso 

In primary rat zzso and zzso cardiac cells, zzso was achieved by zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso protein 4 zzso zzso plasmids and zzso was achieved by zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso of zzso expression were constructed and zzso in primary rat zzso and zzso zzso With different zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated that the protein levels of zzso were zzso through zzso of zzso and were zzso through zzso of zzso in hypoxic zzso zzso zzso structure breakdown activated zzso pathway, accompanied with the zzso of zzso In coincidence, we found that zzso a zzso inhibitor decreased zzso while zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in the zzso network zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso caused by the changes of zzso structure and the zzso zzso zzso in the process of zzso change following zzso network zzso in hypoxic zzso
