The expression pattern of zzso zzso receptors with predominance during fetal life and zzso under pathological conditions during tissue zzso process suggests that zzso receptors may exert an important action in zzso zzso zzso Less is known about zzso receptors in acute zzso cardiac zzso We aimed here to zzso the role of zzso receptors after acute zzso zzso Double zzso zzso showed that cardiac zzso receptors were mainly detected in clusters of small zzso cells accumulating in zzso zone and zzso cells increased in response to acute cardiac zzso Further, we isolated cardiac zzso cell population by modified magnetic activated cell sorting and zzso activated cell zzso These cardiac zzso cells, represented approximately zzso of total cardiac cells in zzso heart, were characterized by zzso zzso factors implicated in zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso and genes required for zzso zzso zzso zzso When adult zzso and cardiac zzso cells isolated from zzso rat hearts were zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso inhibited zzso of these zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso stimulation led to an increased zzso cell population in the zzso zzso and reduced zzso of zzso in rats with acute zzso zzso These data suggest that cardiac zzso cell population exists and increases after acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supports performance of zzso thus contributing to zzso via cardiac zzso cell zzso
