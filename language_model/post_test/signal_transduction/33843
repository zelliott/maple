The zzso tract maintains proper function by replacing aged cells with freshly produced cells that arise from a population of zzso zzso stem cells zzso In the zzso zzso zzso self renewal, amplification and differentiation take place along the zzso zzso and are controlled by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms that specify zzso within the developing zzso zzso or about the zzso zzso that help maintain them in their zzso stem cell zzso Here we show that in adult zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are confined to an anterior narrow segment, which we name the zzso proliferation zone zzso Within the zzso self renewal of zzso as well as subsequent proliferation and differentiation of zzso descendants, are controlled by locally emanating zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso restricted expression of zzso in the zzso acts as a niche signal that maintains cells in a zzso zzso zzso As cells divide and move zzso away from the zzso source, they enter a phase of rapid zzso During this phase, zzso signal is required for zzso the cell cycle and the onset of zzso The zzso with its characteristic proliferation dynamics and zzso properties, is set up during the embryonic phase and becomes active in the zzso where it generates all adult zzso cells including zzso The mechanism and genetic control of cell renewal in the zzso zzso exhibits a large degree of similarity with what is seen in the zzso zzso Our analysis of the zzso zzso provides an insight into the zzso and control of stem cells, highlighting the way in which the spatial pattern of signals that promote self renewal, growth and differentiation is set up within a genetically zzso model zzso
