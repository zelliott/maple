zzso zzso of G zzso receptors zzso consist of zzso related side chains that mediate discrete zzso The zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso was identified because the zzso hormone zzso zzso appears to have zzso the zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in zzso zzso 2 and 7 of zzso zzso We now demonstrate that different side chains of this zzso contribute specifically to zzso zzso zzso G zzso and small G zzso zzso An zzso zzso is required in position zzso for expression of the zzso zzso at the cell surface, most likely through an interaction with the zzso zzso zzso which we also find is required for zzso zzso Most zzso require an zzso side chain at either the zzso 2 or zzso 7 locus of the zzso for zzso to zzso G zzso but the zzso zzso has transferred the requirement for an zzso zzso from zzso 2 to zzso However, the presence of zzso at the zzso 7 locus zzso small G zzso zzso to zzso zzso These results zzso specific components of the zzso zzso 7 zzso in zzso expression and in determining the ability of the zzso to adopt distinct activated zzso that are optimal for interaction with zzso and small G zzso
