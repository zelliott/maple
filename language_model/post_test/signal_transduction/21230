We have recently reported the identification and cloning of the gene zzso zzso a novel protein zzso zzso that is found in zzso complexes with beta zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso that appears to function in zzso signal zzso by beta 1 family zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso free zzso fibers localized zzso to zzso This position was also confirmed by zzso mapping using zzso zzso with zzso in zzso band zzso Our results indicate that zzso maps between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso band zzso This location may be important in evaluating the potential role of zzso in zzso since it has been shown that this region is associated with both zzso zzso and loss of zzso in certain types of zzso
