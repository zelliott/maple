zzso migration is directed by zzso of zzso growth factor zzso during wound zzso As in other zzso systems, it has been shown recently that localized stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and production of 3' zzso lipids in the plasma membrane are important events in the signaling of zzso biased zzso zzso In turn, 3' zzso zzso depends on the effective diffusion zzso D, and turnover rate constant, zzso of these zzso Here we present a systematic and direct comparison of mathematical model calculations and experimental zzso to estimate the values of the effective 3' zzso diffusion zzso D, turnover rate constant, zzso and other parameters in individual zzso zzso zzso with zzso In the context of our uniform stimulation model, the values of D and k in each cell were typically estimated within zzso or less, and the mean values across all of the cells analyzed were D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and k zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we report that 3' zzso turnover is not affected by zzso zzso signaling in our cells, allowing us to focus our attention on the regulation of 3' zzso production as this system is studied zzso
