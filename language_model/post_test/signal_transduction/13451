The expression patterns of zzso zzso genes and zzso analyses in zzso zzso suggest that zzso neural development is initiated by zzso signals, distinct from zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso This notion is further supported by the zzso of a zzso active form of zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It effectively suppressed the anterior neural marker, zzso but not the zzso marker, zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cells in the zzso zzso neural region lose their neural fate only when zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso are zzso The indications are that zzso signaling is involved in the formation of the zzso neural region, zzso the zzso signaling zzso within the target zzso We then examined the functions of zzso in zzso neural zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the correct place zzso zzso and at the correct time zzso zzso to early zzso zzso the same point that the most precocious zzso neural marker, zzso is first zzso Unlike other members of the zzso family, zzso had little zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso expands the neural region with suppression of anterior neural zzso However, this effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso and zzso neural expansion was substantially suppressed in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The results obtained in the present study reveal multiple actions of the zzso signal on neural development: it zzso zzso signaling within zzso neural cells, zzso the expression of zzso zzso antagonists, and suppresses anterior neural zzso
