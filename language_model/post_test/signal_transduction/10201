Free fatty acids zzso in addition to zzso have been shown to stimulate insulin release through the G zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso free calcium concentration zzso in zzso is elevated by zzso although the mechanism underlying the zzso increase is still zzso In this study, we investigated the action of zzso acid on zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings were performed on identified rat zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso currents were zzso The transient current represents less than zzso whereas the delayed zzso current comprises more than zzso of the total zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso acid (10 zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso currents (to less than zzso This reduction was abolished by the zzso zzso A system zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso (10 zzso but was not affected by protein zzso C zzso In addition, zzso and zzso induced a similar reduction in the zzso current as that evoked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were also increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a similar structure to zzso acid but no binding affinity to zzso did not change zzso zzso Treatment of cultured cells with zzso small interfering zzso significantly reduced the decrease in zzso current induced by zzso acid, whereas the zzso reduction of zzso current was not zzso We conclude that zzso acid reduces the zzso zzso current in rat zzso through zzso and the zzso zzso A system, leading to an increase in zzso and insulin zzso
