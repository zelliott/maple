zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso that regulates key processes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso organization and calcium zzso Maintaining proper levels of zzso at the plasma membrane zzso is crucial for cell survival and zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms zzso zzso structures at the PM that we term zzso zzso The dynamic assembly and zzso of zzso zzso patches may provide a mechanism to precisely zzso zzso zzso activity, as needed, for localized regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify a tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso protein that partially zzso with zzso zzso Based upon zzso cell zzso and zzso data, we propose that zzso functions as a coincidence detector of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and serves as a negative regulator of zzso synthesis at the zzso Our results also suggest that additional zzso tandem zzso zzso proteins may play important roles in regulating zzso zzso
