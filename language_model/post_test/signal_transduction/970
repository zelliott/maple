zzso signaling proteins of the zzso family are known to regulate a diverse range of zzso zzso and their signaling zzso through zzso is frequently activated in zzso The identification of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins as components of zzso receptors for zzso proteins has raised questions about their individual zzso We have investigated this issue through a zzso analysis of zzso and zzso proteins that have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso with other reports, we find that zzso proteins deleted for their zzso domain are able to activate the zzso signaling zzso zzso our results demonstrate that this signaling from zzso derivatives can occur in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso motifs within the zzso domain of zzso are required for zzso In contrast to results with zzso zzso of zzso proteins did not activate the zzso Based on evidence of zzso binding to both zzso and zzso current models suggest that both proteins are components of a zzso zzso complex that signals to zzso In light of these models, our data imply that zzso proteins constitute the zzso zzso component of these zzso The results also support the notion that zzso are candidate zzso
