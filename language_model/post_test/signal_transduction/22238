The zzso polarity within a zzso is primarily determined by the zzso state of zzso zzso but the mechanism by which zzso is zzso has remained zzso Here, we present genetic and zzso evidence that the suppression of zzso signaling is essential for the establishment of zzso polarity within a zzso and that zzso acts as a novel negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso We generated a zzso mouse in which a zzso form of zzso is introduced into the zzso zzso zzso this resulted in an almost complete rescue of the zzso defects in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by inducing the zzso of zzso 1, a core regulator of this zzso Surprisingly, this function of zzso is found to be independent of its function as a zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso is a novel component involved in the suppression of zzso target zzso
