zzso Group zzso proteins silence critical zzso genes and zzso cell zzso Using the zzso zzso eye as a model system, we show that cells with zzso in the gene locus zzso that encodes the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and lose both the ability to differentiate and their normal zzso They invade the neighboring zzso and, when combined with an activated form of the Ras zzso they trigger the formation of zzso zzso proteins bind to multiple genes in the zzso zzso and control their zzso as well as zzso zzso The massive zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell clones can be rescued by zzso expression of a dominant negative form of zzso or by zzso interference zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is rescued by zzso of zzso zzso These data show that zzso is a tumor zzso locus that controls cellular proliferation by zzso multiple zzso signaling zzso
