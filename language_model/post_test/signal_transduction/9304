The cell zzso serves as a critical zzso between the zzso zzso membrane and the underlying zzso and zzso In many cells, the cell zzso is organized and maintained by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which have the ability to interact with both the plasma membrane and zzso zzso Although this zzso linkage function is critical to stability of the cell cortex, recent studies indicate that this is only a part of what zzso do in many zzso In addition to their role in binding zzso zzso zzso regulate signaling pathways through their ability to bind zzso receptors and link them to downstream signaling zzso In this review we discuss recent evidence in a variety of cells indicating that zzso serve as scaffolds to facilitate efficient signal zzso on the zzso face of the plasma zzso
