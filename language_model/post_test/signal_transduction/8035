Information regarding the response of brain cells to infection with zzso zzso virus zzso is needed for a complete understanding of viral zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso cells respond to zzso infection by producing a number of zzso zzso and zzso through a mechanism involving zzso zzso 2 zzso Following this zzso burst, zzso cells rapidly undergo cell death by zzso We hypothesized that zzso signaling might mediate the cell death process as zzso 

To test this hypothesis, we investigated zzso cell death of zzso obtained from both zzso and zzso zzso Cell death was studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the mechanisms of zzso were further analyzed using zzso zzso zzso The data obtained from zzso analysis were then validated using quantitative real-time zzso zzso 

zzso infection induced zzso cell death in zzso cells from zzso as well as zzso zzso However, the cell death at 24 h zzso was markedly lower in knockout zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses clearly showed that the expression of zzso genes was zzso at the time when zzso cells were actively undergoing zzso indicating a differential response to zzso in cells with or without zzso 

We demonstrate here that zzso zzso an zzso response in zzso cells which is zzso through zzso zzso
