Various methods are now available to identify the molecular partners of the component of a signal zzso zzso Some zzso however, can be technically difficult to detect because they depend upon transient zzso zzso Here, we present a simple affinity zzso approach based on synthetic zzso to purify potential partners of zzso zzso With this approach, we confirm the previously characterized interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso and we identify novel partners of the IGF-1 zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a potential zzso of zzso dependent zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso was identified as one of four proteins recruited by a zzso mimicking a motif zzso in all zzso family zzso
