To investigate zzso interference targeting signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on invasion of human pancreatic cancer zzso 

We constructed three plasmids of zzso interference targeting the zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso small interfering zzso the zzso was zzso into the human pancreatic cell line, zzso and cell proliferation was measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess cell zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were examined by quantitative zzso and western zzso zzso The invasion ability of zzso cells was determined by cell invasion zzso 

We successfully constructed the zzso zzso zzso and proved that it can suppress expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso interference of zzso by the zzso construct significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells, in addition to significantly decreasing both zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso by zzso decreased the invasion ability of zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer since it zzso the invasion ability of pancreatic cancer zzso
