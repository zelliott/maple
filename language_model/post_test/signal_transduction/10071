zzso is expected to play a crucial role in the initiation of immune responses and zzso zzso However, expression of zzso in zzso virus zzso diseases has not been zzso We examined the contribution of zzso infection and zzso zzso membrane protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso induced zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and the embryonic kidney cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso expression in an zzso zzso cell zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter showed that it was activated by zzso zzso zzso region zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso necrosis factor zzso factor 2 zzso zzso with zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso The requirement for the zzso site in the zzso promoter in zzso responsiveness was zzso Our results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso
