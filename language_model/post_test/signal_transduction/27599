We examined the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in the signal zzso of basic zzso growth factor zzso effects in zzso cells zzso When zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso or of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tube formation by zzso cells in type I collagen zzso zzso formation in type I collagen gel requires proliferation and migration of these cells, and degradation of the zzso zzso by these zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso DNA synthesis as well as migration of zzso zzso Cell migration requires zzso reorganization and cell zzso zzso induced zzso reorganization and zzso assembly in the focal zzso zzso both of which were inhibited by zzso but not by zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the expression of zzso as well as zzso beta 3 zzso in zzso and converts zzso to invasive zzso zzso inhibited this induction of zzso whereas zzso did zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso are requisite for the signal zzso of zzso in zzso The roles of these two zzso zzso zzso are not zzso but these zzso work in a coordinated zzso
