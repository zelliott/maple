The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso Stem Cell Factor zzso are critical in zzso but pathways linking zzso zzso to specific responses in zzso cells are still zzso We have investigated the role of zzso expression level and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in survival and cell division of early zzso cells in response to zzso Two zzso zzso early zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso to express zzso zzso or a zzso form of the zzso zzso that lacks the major recruitment site for the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso Several clones expressing different zzso levels were zzso in each zzso Growth of cells expressing either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso was strongly dependent on zzso level within the zzso zzso Using an zzso that allows quantitative measurement of the contributions of cell survival and cell division, diminished cell growth in response to zzso under limiting conditions of zzso copy number or zzso recruitment was shown to be almost entirely due to decreased cell zzso Further studies with the zzso inhibitor zzso indicated that zzso zzso was also required for cell zzso zzso binding and/or indirect zzso of zzso could support cell division zzso by zzso zzso zzso but was insufficient for the survival zzso
