zzso cells are derived from human zzso and demonstrated to express a zzso zzso sensing zzso which elicits zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and mediates zzso regulation of zzso zzso protein zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso zzso of external zzso from zzso to zzso zzso induced only a sluggish rise in zzso and no stimulation of zzso production despite a more than twofold zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizing functionally zzso zzso of the zzso sensor protein substantiated zzso of this sensor in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C by a zzso zzso strongly zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sensor was partially zzso This functional differentiation was associated with reduced zzso incorporation in zzso zzso zzso of these cells was inhibited by zzso upon rise of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and this zzso was abolished by zzso interference with the zzso sensor zzso zzso and zzso at zzso up to zzso M decreased proliferation and zzso the zzso content of zzso zzso The findings support zzso zzso sensor and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, and that zzso zzso proliferation by actions on the zzso sensor as well as by stimulation of zzso release possibly zzso zzso growth zzso
