zzso induction and patterning are primarily regulated by the concentration of locally expressed zzso such as members of the zzso zzso functions as a zzso factor to regulate expression of zzso genes downstream of such zzso We have identified zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, by zzso zzso screening using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso During zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the animal half of zzso with a zzso zzso low zzso at the marginal zzso zzso expression is positively and zzso regulated by activities of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso of animal caps with induction of zzso genes even in the absence of their zzso zzso In addition, their introduction into the zzso marginal zone results in a secondary axis zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso induction by specific and direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso functions as an essential negative regulator of the zzso zzso to ensure proper zzso induction at the appropriate time and in the appropriate region, and suggest that both the initial step of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and regulation of the final downstream zzso step have crucial roles in zzso induction and zzso
