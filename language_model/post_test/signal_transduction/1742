The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is involved in limiting cell and tissue interactions via a repulsive zzso The mechanism of zzso involves zzso the zzso zzso but little is known of the molecular components that connect the zzso to the zzso zzso Recent studies in retinal zzso cells have demonstrated that zzso activates the small zzso zzso We have investigated the involvement of zzso in signaling downstream from zzso As a model system, we have used a zzso zzso called zzso that we express and activate in early zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso zzso and change in cell shape, plus loss of aspects of cell polarity in zzso cells, such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In this study, we show that injecting zzso of zzso zzso into early zzso zzso produces a zzso very similar to that resulting from zzso zzso More importantly, expression of a zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso concurrent with activated zzso rescued zzso from the loss of zzso zzso and change in cell shape associated with zzso These data argue that, in contrast to the case in retinal zzso cells, zzso in early zzso zzso acts to inhibit zzso suggesting that this zzso may regulate zzso differently (and therefore affect the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso a novel zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso family zzso also blocks zzso zzso This suggests that zzso which has been demonstrated to activate zzso in cultured zzso cells, may also target zzso zzso via an zzso zzso
