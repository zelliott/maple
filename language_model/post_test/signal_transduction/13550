Ion channels in excised patches of plasma membrane are generally considered to be isolated from any zzso regulation zzso For example, in excised patches of zzso rod outer segment plasma zzso the zzso zzso channels have traditionally been studied in room light because the zzso cascade linking zzso zzso to channel closure was assumed to be zzso To investigate the possibility that, in fact, such excised patches retain a functional zzso zzso zzso this same preparation was studied in zzso zzso excised in the dark were found to retain the light sensitivity of their zzso zzso and the ability to zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso light suppresses the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity reduce light sensitivity, whereas activated zzso or activated zzso does not directly affect the zzso These results zzso establish that excised patches from rod outer segment retain functional zzso zzso zzso support the classical view that channel opening is modulated by zzso zzso zzso and, most surprisingly, zzso demonstrate that diffusion in excised patches is so restricted that local zzso can induce variations in the concentration of small zzso The indication that excised patches are not as simple as usually zzso opens the possibility of using them to study other zzso zzso zzso
