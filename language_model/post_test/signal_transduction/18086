zzso an zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is most abundant in the zzso zzso zzso cells, where it is implicated in the zzso of a number of molecules filtered through the zzso The zzso tail zzso of zzso contains a number of sequence similarities, which indicate that zzso might be involved in signal zzso To find zzso proteins that would interact with the zzso CT, a human kidney zzso library was screened by using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction domain zzso of the zzso protein 2 zzso a zzso structural analogue of zzso zzso was found to bind to the zzso CT in this zzso The interaction between these two proteins was confirmed by a binding zzso in zzso and by the zzso of both proteins from zzso cell zzso The zzso CT contains three zzso motifs (in which zzso represents a zzso zzso that are potentially able to interact with zzso Analysis of the CT deletion and zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso system revealed that the third zzso motif is most probably involved in this zzso zzso is a zzso zzso thought to be an zzso zzso involved in signal zzso and a suggested negative regulator of cell zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso identified for zzso zzso is the first known zzso zzso that interacts with the zzso protein zzso We speculate that their interaction might involve zzso in signal zzso pathways or might mediate the zzso trafficking of this zzso
