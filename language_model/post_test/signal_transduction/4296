zzso metabolism was investigated in pancreatic zzso that underwent zzso of zzso proteins by zzso zzso Both the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were much more severely affected at high zzso zzso than at low zzso zzso concentration of the zzso when comparing zzso to control zzso The preferential stimulation of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso resulting from an increase in zzso zzso was not zzso however, in zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso did not appear to be impaired in zzso zzso the zzso content in zzso zzso zzso generated from zzso failing to be increased in zzso zzso It is proposed, therefore, that the impaired responsiveness of zzso zzso to a rise in zzso concentration might be attributable to an altered regulation of zzso as possibly resulting from a missing interaction of the zzso with zzso
