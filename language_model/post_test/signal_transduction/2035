zzso zzso is a recently cloned zzso with zzso to zzso zzso and zzso In this study we examined the effects of zzso on human myeloma zzso We found that zzso induced proliferation and inhibited zzso of the zzso human myeloma cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The potency of zzso was close to that of zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso or the zzso zzso zzso chain zzso did not affect zzso DNA zzso indicating that zzso proliferation was not zzso through these zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso another zzso of myeloma cell growth, zzso the expression level of zzso zzso zzso and combinations of zzso and zzso gave synergistic effects on myeloma cell zzso Furthermore, 4 of 9 zzso samples of primary myeloma cells showed a significant increase in DNA synthesis on stimulation of the cells by zzso By Western zzso analysis, we demonstrated that the zzso signaling pathways of zzso in myeloma cells involved zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a novel growth and survival factor in multiple myeloma and may represent a target for future zzso
