The zzso complex resulting from association of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso mediates zzso zzso signal zzso across the cell zzso We prepared a zzso structure model of zzso based on the known structures of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of circular zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed zzso indicates high content of zzso secondary structure, in agreement with the structural zzso zzso expressed zzso was able to zzso zzso responsiveness to cells expressing zzso despite lacking zzso We identified several clusters of basic zzso on the surface of zzso zzso of each of two clusters encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased the signal zzso of the respective zzso zzso either upon zzso with zzso or upon addition as soluble protein into the zzso of cells zzso zzso These basic clusters lie at the edge of the zzso zzso which in zzso protein connected to zzso disease C2 zzso dust zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein form a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of another basic cluster composed of zzso which according to the model lies further apart from the zzso pocket only zzso decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of the zzso zzso the surface loop between zzso and zzso predicted by model, particularly in oxidized form, decreased zzso production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso upon application to zzso cells and zzso respectively, supporting its involvement in zzso zzso Our structural model of zzso is zzso by zzso analysis and contributes to the unraveling of molecular interactions in zzso zzso
