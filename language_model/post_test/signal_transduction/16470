zzso receptors zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso These zzso signal via the common zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso zzso zzso also signals through zzso but zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The role of the two signaling pathways in cardiac dysfunction during zzso zzso and zzso shock is zzso 

zzso was generated by zzso zzso and zzso Mice were divided into sham and zzso zzso and puncture groups or subjected to saline or zzso Left zzso function was assessed in a zzso apparatus or by zzso zzso were examined using a multiplex zzso zzso migratory and zzso functions were assessed using flow zzso 

In comparison with zzso mice, zzso but not zzso mice had markedly improved cardiac function and survival after zzso zzso and zzso In comparison, both zzso and zzso mice were protected from cardiac depression and mortality during zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso mice had diminished zzso production in serum and in zzso space in comparison with zzso mice after zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso mice had attenuated serum zzso in comparison with zzso mice after zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso signaling had any effect on zzso zzso function or bacterial clearance at 24 h of zzso zzso 

These studies establish that zzso but not zzso signaling plays a critical role in zzso cardiac dysfunction, systemic zzso and mortality during zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are essential for cardiac depression and mortality during zzso zzso
