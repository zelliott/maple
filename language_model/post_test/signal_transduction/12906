In zzso zzso the majority of zzso zzso proteins are concentrated in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Most zzso studies, whose objective is to study the functional relevance of zzso zzso are, however, performed using the zzso of cells zzso in zzso zzso buffers zzso zzso zzso This observation prompted us to develop an alternative zzso zzso We established a procedure involving the sequential zzso of zzso in buffers of increasing zzso that not only preserved and zzso zzso zzso proteins but also retained their zzso zzso The sequential zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso buffers containing zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of a significant fraction of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that in zzso zzso zzso zzso Lyn activity was enhanced in the soluble fraction recovered from the zzso zzso but not from that of the first zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso proteins between the zzso soluble and zzso zzso was both zzso and zzso In zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins were mostly zzso On the other hand, in zzso cells, the zzso were more equally distributed between the two zzso The results of this study provide a new experimental procedure for the investigation of zzso zzso pathways in activated human zzso which may also be zzso to other cell zzso
