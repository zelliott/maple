zzso are located both in the zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso Active transport of these complexes through the nuclear pores has been proposed to be zzso by nuclear zzso signals zzso which have been found in several of the zzso zzso zzso We have tested three different putative zzso sequences from human zzso zzso zzso zzso iota, zzso and zzso as well as a putative zzso sequence from the zzso zzso zzso for their ability to direct zzso proteins to the zzso zzso peptides containing these putative zzso sequences were generated and zzso to large fluorescent reporter zzso zzso or zzso bovine serum zzso The zzso were introduced into zzso zzso and zzso cells in the presence of cell zzso and zzso and nuclear import was monitored by zzso zzso All three putative zzso sequences from human zzso zzso were able to direct the reporter molecules to the nucleus in both cell types, although differences in efficiency were zzso zzso of zzso for the first zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motifs inhibited nuclear import zzso Interestingly, the putative zzso sequence found in zzso zzso was also functional as a nuclear targeting zzso
