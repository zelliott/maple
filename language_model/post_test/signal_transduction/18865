zzso zzso promote zzso zzso and their engagement activates zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso However, the significance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso has been difficult to zzso Here, in a model of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso on zzso recognized complement zzso deposited within vessel walls and triggered a signaling zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This led to zzso zzso release, causing zzso zzso deposition, and zzso Mice genetically deficient in any of these components zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were resistant to disease despite normal tissue zzso zzso Disease was restored in zzso mice infused with zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso release in the inflamed tissue was reduced in zzso mice, and a zzso of zzso or the zzso blocked zzso zzso release in zzso These data suggest that zzso engagement of complement activates zzso zzso to promote zzso blood vessel injury in zzso
