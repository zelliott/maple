Plant response to mechanical injury includes gene zzso both at the wound site and zzso in zzso zzso The model developed for the zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor II zzso gene in potato zzso zzso and tomato zzso zzso establishes the involvement of the plant hormones zzso acid and zzso acid zzso as key components of the wound signal zzso zzso To assess in zzso zzso the role of these plant hormones in regulating zzso gene zzso we isolated zzso and zzso genes by the differential zzso display zzso Their patterns of expression upon mechanical wounding and hormonal treatments revealed differences in the spatial distribution of the transcripts and in the responsiveness of the analyzed genes to zzso acid and zzso A correlation can be established between sensitivity to zzso and the zzso of the transcripts in systemic zzso upon zzso A comparative study of the wound response in zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants indicated that in zzso zzso wound signals are transmitted via at least two different zzso One of them does not involve zzso as a zzso and is zzso responsible for gene zzso in the vicinity of the wound site, whereas the other requires zzso perception and activates gene expression throughout the aerial part of the zzso
