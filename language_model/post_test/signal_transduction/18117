The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso receptors and associated G proteins in zzso of spontaneously zzso rats zzso at different stages of zzso The zzso and zzso zzso and zzso distribution, and zzso protein zzso were studied by zzso zzso and levels of zzso zzso and zzso protein species were determined by Western zzso in zzso and zzso zzso control rats aged zzso weeks, 3 months, and 8 zzso In zzso zzso both the zzso density and the percentage of zzso zzso binding sites were higher than in zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution, the zzso density, and the zzso distribution were similar in rats of both strains at all zzso Although essentially no differences in zzso levels between zzso and zzso rats were zzso higher zzso and lower zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso In zzso zzso increased levels of zzso proteins were zzso In zzso zzso none of the parameters was different from those of zzso We conclude that the differences in properties of the zzso signal zzso system between zzso and zzso rats are exclusively zzso before and at the onset of the overt zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso apparently affects G proteins more readily than zzso
