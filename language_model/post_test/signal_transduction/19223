G zzso receptors zzso are considered to represent the most promising drug zzso it has been repeatedly said that a large fraction of the currently marketed drugs elicit their actions by binding to zzso (with cited numbers varying from zzso Closer zzso however, shows that only a modest fraction of zzso zzso are, in fact, exploited as drug targets, only zzso of which are zzso zzso The vast majority of receptors in the humane zzso have not yet been explored as sites of action for zzso Given the zzso of this zzso class, it appears that opportunities for drug discovery zzso In addition, zzso provide for binding sites other than the zzso binding sites zzso to as the zzso zzso These additional sites include zzso binding sites for zzso zzso to as zzso zzso that zzso the affinity and efficacy of zzso zzso zzso the interaction surface that recruits G proteins and zzso zzso the interaction sites of additional proteins zzso zzso interacting proteins that regulate G protein signaling or give rise to G zzso zzso These sites can also be targeted by zzso zzso and natural zzso libraries are therefore likely to play a major role in identifying new zzso zzso at each of these zzso In particular the diverse natural zzso libraries such as the zzso peptides from marine zzso and plant zzso have been established as a rich source of drug zzso zzso screening and zzso chemistry approaches allow for progressing from these starting points to potential drug zzso This will be illustrated by focusing on the zzso drug design of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using natural zzso leads as starting zzso
