The strength and duration of zzso protein zzso zzso signaling have been shown to regulate cell fate in different cell zzso In this study, a general mechanism is described that explains how subtle differences in signaling zzso are translated into a specific biological zzso In zzso the expression of immediate early gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and early growth response gene 1 zzso zzso factors is significantly extended by sustained zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso Several of these proteins contain functional zzso site for zzso zzso zzso zzso that serve to locally concentrate the active zzso thus showing that they can function as zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates the zzso modifications of these zzso sensors, which contributes to their sustained expression during the zzso zzso zzso zzso sensors can also interpret the small changes in zzso signal strength that arise from less than a zzso reduction in zzso zzso As a result, downstream target gene expression and cell cycle progression are significantly zzso
