zzso derivatives have been used in the treatment of acne and have shown zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular basis for these pharmacological properties, although nuclear factor zzso zzso is closely linked to inflammation and cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso value of 1 zzso by blocking zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and suppresses zzso expression of inflammatory genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulting in sequential prevention of downstream events, including zzso degradation of zzso DNA binding ability, and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the cells and zzso activity of highly zzso zzso Moreover, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso was abolished by substitution of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso to zzso acid zzso indicating a direct interaction site of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of inflammatory genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso or expression zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increases the survival rates of zzso zzso zzso
