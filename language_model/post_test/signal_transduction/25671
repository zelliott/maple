Previously, we found that male zzso mice developed type 2 diabetes but female mice did not, and that decreased expression levels of zzso were correlated with the development of a diabetic zzso in these zzso zzso we hypothesized that sex hormones affect the expression of zzso and contribute to the development of insulin resistance and zzso in zzso zzso We used zzso and insulin tolerance tests to examine insulin sensitivity in male, female and zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso zzso We also examined zzso molecules and zzso proteins in various zzso in these mice by Western zzso In addition, we examined changes of zzso expression in zzso skeletal muscle cells treated with zzso zzso or zzso We found that zzso and insulin tolerance were impaired and zzso developed in male, but not female, zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecules such as insulin zzso protein zzso B, and zzso zzso were decreased in male zzso mice compared with female zzso zzso zzso male mice showed improved zzso and insulin tolerance with a zzso increase in the expression of zzso molecules and zzso in zzso tissue and skeletal zzso Moreover, zzso treatment increased the expression of zzso in differentiated skeletal muscle zzso We conclude that sex hormones zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso subsequently affecting insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes in zzso zzso
