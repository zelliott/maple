zzso factor zzso signaling zzso zzso responses to stress and ethanol, and may zzso observed increases in ethanol consumption following exposure to stressful zzso The current experiment was conducted to further characterize the role of zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso increases in ethanol consumption in zzso and zzso zzso 

Male zzso and zzso mice were given continuous access to zzso zzso ethanol and water for the duration of the zzso When a baseline of ethanol consumption was established, animals were exposed to 5 minutes of forced swim stress on each of 5 consecutive zzso Thirty minutes before each forced swim session, animals were given an zzso injection of a 10 zzso dose of zzso a selective zzso zzso or an equal volume of zzso The effect of forced swim stress exposure on consumption of a zzso zzso zzso solution was also investigated in an zzso group of zzso zzso 

Exposure to forced swim stress significantly increased ethanol consumption by the zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso increases in ethanol consumption were delayed and became evident approximately 3 weeks after the first zzso Additionally, forced swim stress did not cause increases of food or water intake and did not promote delayed increases of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso with the zzso zzso showed blunted zzso increases in ethanol zzso and the zzso zzso did not influence the ethanol drinking of zzso zzso 

The present results provide evidence that zzso signaling zzso the delayed increase of ethanol consumption stemming from repeated exposure to a stressful event in zzso zzso
