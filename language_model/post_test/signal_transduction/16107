zzso zzso coli zzso is the leading cause of zzso zzso and children's zzso zzso Among its zzso factors, zzso produces zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso is associated with outer membrane zzso that are rich in zzso The majority of prior studies have focused on soluble zzso zzso from zzso zzso We investigated the hypothesis that the zzso zzso context of toxin presentation might be important in zzso immune zzso We compared the polarized zzso cell responses to zzso applied soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as controls using a zzso inactive zzso of zzso and zzso lacking zzso Although zzso treatments with no or zzso inactive zzso induced a modest amount of zzso zzso samples containing zzso active zzso zzso higher zzso A combination of soluble zzso and zzso zzso induced significantly higher zzso levels than either zzso or zzso zzso zzso The responses to zzso zzso were found to be independent of the zzso zzso pathway, because the zzso of zzso zzso response element zzso protein zzso zzso did not lead to a decrease in zzso gene expression zzso Furthermore, soluble zzso caused earlier zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to the zzso of zzso protein 1, whereas zzso zzso zzso responses appeared to be zzso by zzso In zzso the results demonstrate that soluble zzso and zzso zzso elicit ultimately similar zzso responses through distinct different zzso zzso
