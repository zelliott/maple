The attachment of zzso to zzso zzso of proteins is an abundant and highly zzso essential modification in zzso The zzso process includes two principal zzso the assembly of a zzso zzso zzso and the transfer of the zzso to selected zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso takes place at both sides of the zzso zzso zzso membrane and it involves a series of specific zzso that catalyze the assembly of the zzso zzso in a highly defined zzso zzso zzso selects the zzso consensus sequence on zzso chains and generates the zzso linkage between the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso This zzso zzso results in a systemic modification of the zzso the basis for the zzso modification of the zzso zzso generating the large diversity of zzso in zzso zzso This article focuses on the processes in the zzso Based on the highly zzso nature of this zzso we concentrate on the mechanisms in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso
