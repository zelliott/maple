zzso pulp stem cells zzso are a unique precursor population isolated from zzso human dental pulp and have the ability to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in tooth development and stem cell zzso through zzso In this study, the regulation of zzso differentiation of zzso by zzso zzso signaling was zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso or the active form of zzso with zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis found that zzso strongly induced the expression of zzso protein zzso and modestly enhanced the expression of type I collagen in zzso zzso zzso inhibited alkaline zzso zzso activity and the formation of zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso was also sufficient to suppress the differentiation and zzso of zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates the zzso differentiation of zzso
