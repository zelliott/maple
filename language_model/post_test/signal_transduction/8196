The zzso product of zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso during zzso zzso zzso we investigated the role of elevated zzso zzso zzso in the zzso activity of zzso by increasing zzso zzso expression in zzso human zzso cancer zzso cells zzso by stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells increased resistance to spontaneous zzso and promoted zzso growth, but had no effect on proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells also led to development of zzso zzso which was associated with increased tight junction protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells led to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso which was explained by zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity downstream of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, which was associated with zzso of zzso element binding zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a small increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 protein levels but zzso of zzso zzso did not abrogate the zzso activity of zzso However, zzso zzso zzso did not lead to zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a potential strategy for zzso therapy that may avoid the toxicity associated with systemic zzso zzso
