We demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso activated zzso washed human zzso and increased zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso C measured as zzso zzso These parameters were prevented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso C zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso No effect on zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso in the presence of zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso In addition we have shown that zzso zzso increased NO and zzso zzso These effects were abolished by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso calcium zzso zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced zzso activity through the zzso of its positive regulatory zzso zzso and by zzso of the negative one zzso The zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso but it was unaffected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was reversed by low zzso of zzso zzso Taken together these data suggest that zzso behaves as a true zzso zzso stimulating zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso by increasing NO levels through zzso zzso
