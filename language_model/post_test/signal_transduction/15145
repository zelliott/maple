To test the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

We used zzso rat zzso and an acute mouse model of zzso zzso to examine the protective effect of zzso 

In the mouse model, administration of zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso including animal zzso zzso changes, and levels of serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was able to zzso the increased zzso zzso and decreased reduced zzso zzso caused by zzso In in zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso ameliorated zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Further studies showed that zzso inhibited zzso oxygen species zzso generation and prevented zzso loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso We observed a protective response against damage after zzso zzso The level of zzso protein was zzso Additionally, zzso inhibited a zzso zzso zzso 

These results showed that zzso protected against zzso zzso by decreasing zzso generation and zzso zzso and by zzso zzso signaling zzso
