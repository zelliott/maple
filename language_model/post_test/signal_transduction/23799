zzso transmission of information despite the presence of variation is a fundamental problem in cellular zzso However, the capability and characteristics of information transmission in signaling pathways remain poorly zzso We describe zzso and compensation of information transmission of signaling pathways at the cell population zzso We calculated the mutual information transmitted through signaling pathways for the growth zzso gene zzso Growth factors appeared to carry only information sufficient for a zzso zzso Information transmission was generally more robust than average signal intensity despite pharmacological zzso and compensation of information transmission zzso Information transmission to the biological output of zzso extension appeared zzso zzso may use information zzso as information so that messages can be robustly transmitted despite variation in molecular activities among individual zzso
