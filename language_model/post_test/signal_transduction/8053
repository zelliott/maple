Most zzso zzso in animal cells, including the bipolar zzso required for cell division, are organized by zzso Thus, strict control of zzso numbers is crucial for accurate zzso zzso Each zzso comprises two zzso which need to be duplicated exactly once in every cell zzso Recent work has begun to illuminate the mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso First, genetic and structural studies zzso to delineate a zzso assembly zzso in zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso previously known to trigger sister zzso zzso has been implicated in a licensing mechanism that restricts zzso zzso to a single occurrence per cell zzso Finally, zzso (also called zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, has been identified as a novel positive regulator of zzso zzso
