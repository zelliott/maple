The possible zzso activity of zzso zzso on normal and zzso cells of the zzso lineage was tested by zzso zzso human melanoma cells and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso fashion to immobilized zzso as determined by zzso zzso cell cycle analysis, and change in cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso on melanoma cells was not zzso through zzso release of growth factors and was observed with primary or zzso melanoma cells and with clones isolated from the same zzso but only on cells expressing very late zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of melanoma cells to zzso was significantly inhibited by a zzso to the beta 1 zzso of zzso zzso and by a combination of zzso to the alpha zzso of zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso did not act zzso zzso on human zzso expressing zzso and zzso and cultured in zzso zzso However, a zzso activity of immobilized zzso for proliferation of zzso was observed in the presence of a second signal provided by a set of different growth zzso The zzso activity of zzso on zzso could be significantly inhibited by zzso directed to the alpha and beta chain of zzso but not to zzso These data suggest that zzso itself, and not growth factors possibly associated with it, can exert a zzso activity on zzso human melanoma cells and that a change in the signal requirements for response to zzso occurs upon zzso transformation in the zzso zzso Furthermore, beta 1 zzso are zzso involved in the response of the normal and the zzso cells to zzso since zzso and zzso cooperate in the proliferation of zzso cells, while zzso is relevant for the response of zzso
