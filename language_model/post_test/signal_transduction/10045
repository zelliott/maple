The mechanisms underlying zzso zzso loss in Parkinson's disease zzso are not clearly zzso Here, we delineate a zzso by which zzso loss induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled in zzso We reported previously that zzso play a central required role in zzso loss after zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that the downstream zzso zzso of zzso is through zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso We show that zzso conversion of the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso form is dependent on zzso activity in zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss and behavioral zzso Moreover, zzso is zzso on zzso an zzso site, after zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on both zzso and zzso activity, consistent with the model that zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso in zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso is critical for zzso loss because zzso zzso site zzso of zzso provides zzso in an zzso mouse model of zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in zzso loss in zzso
