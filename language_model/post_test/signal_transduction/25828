Despite advances in our understanding of the ways in which zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso little is known about the zzso responsible for regulating zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a major zzso in zzso zzso although its role in the liver is largely zzso Thus, we tested the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso in mice and decreased zzso of zzso in primary zzso cultures and in zzso zzso In addition to altering zzso zzso zzso was shown to play a significant role in zzso zzso fatty acids between zzso zzso Although zzso gain and loss of function did not alter zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso was increased by zzso zzso and decreased by zzso zzso The effects on fatty acid zzso coincided with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its target genes in mice with suppressed zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was unable to zzso the effects of zzso zzso on zzso target gene zzso and this suggests that zzso influences zzso activity independently of zzso zzso 

Taken together, these data show that zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso that plays an integral role in fatty acid zzso and signaling to control energy zzso
