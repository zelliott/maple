The development of zzso veins and zzso from pre-existing vessels are intimately linked processes controlled by a number of well-studied zzso acting zzso zzso To delineate the mechanisms governing vessel formation in zzso we performed a forward genetic screen in zzso and isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso in the highly zzso zzso insert region of zzso zzso with previous reports, zzso zzso were deficient in zzso vascular zzso Recent studies have demonstrated a role for zzso in blood vessels and showed that zzso limits zzso potential by limiting zzso function in developing blood zzso We found that zzso zzso proceeded zzso yet the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso zzso zzso drives zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso arteries were zzso to increased zzso levels and the zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso functions to suppress the ability of developing zzso arteries to respond to zzso zzso zzso in zzso We propose that this mechanism contributes to the differential response of developing arteries and veins to a constant source of zzso present in the zzso during zzso
