The zzso zzso zzso occupies zzso and plasma zzso in both native and zzso expression zzso Based on multiple independent lines of evidence, we demonstrate the zzso at the cell surface occupies membrane zzso but exits from zzso following zzso In zzso raft zzso zzso zzso is present in low density membrane zzso and zzso with its G protein zzso on density zzso zzso disruption by cholesterol depletion with zzso eliminates these light zzso To confirm the presence of the zzso in plasma membrane zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso were used to demonstrate zzso of surface zzso and the raft marker, zzso toxin zzso This zzso was largely lost following zzso stimulation with zzso Similarly, zzso stimulation causes exit of the zzso from light zzso within zzso zzso in contrast to the G zzso which largely remain in light zzso zzso this delayed exit of the zzso suggests acute zzso signaling and zzso occur entirely within zzso Interestingly, both zzso analysis and measurement of surface zzso levels indicate modest zzso zzso during the 10 zzso following zzso suggesting most of the zzso has entered zzso plasma zzso Nevertheless, zzso does increase the rate of zzso zzso as does disruption of zzso with zzso suggesting raft exit enables zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso reveals that zzso and zzso zzso occupies zzso pits in fixed cells consistent with previous indirect zzso The evidence presented here strongly suggests the zzso is a zzso raft protein under zzso conditions and implies zzso signaling occurs from zzso
