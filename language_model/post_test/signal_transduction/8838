The zzso central brain is composed of thousands of zzso that derive from approximately 100 zzso per zzso zzso circuits in the brain require precise zzso wiring and tight control of zzso zzso How this accurate control of zzso numbers is achieved during neural development is largely zzso Specifically, the role of programmed cell death in control of cell numbers has not been studied in the central brain zzso zzso Here, we focus on four zzso zzso lineages in the central brain identified on the basis that they express the zzso gene zzso zzso For each zzso we determine the total number of zzso zzso generated as well as number and pattern of zzso zzso We then demonstrate that programmed cell death has a pronounced effect on the number of cells in the four zzso approximately half of the immature zzso zzso in three of the four lineages are eliminated by cell death during zzso zzso Moreover, we show that programmed cell death selectively affects zzso versus zzso cells in a zzso manner and, thus, controls the relative number of zzso zzso in each zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that zzso signaling is involved in the regulation of en zzso Based on our findings, we conclude that zzso programmed cell death plays a prominent role in the generation of zzso number and lineage diversity in the zzso zzso
