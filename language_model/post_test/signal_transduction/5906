zzso disease virus zzso has been previously shown to possess zzso activity, causing specific zzso of zzso but not normal zzso Here we show that despite these findings, the zzso efficiency of naturally occurring zzso strains can still be relatively low, as many tumors exhibit strong innate immune responses that suppress viral replication and zzso To overcome this problem, we generated a zzso zzso zzso expressing influenza zzso zzso a protein exhibiting zzso zzso and zzso functions in human and mouse zzso Interestingly, the zzso virus was dramatically enhanced in its ability to form zzso lyse a variety of human and mouse tumor cell lines, and suppressed the induction of the cellular zzso zzso Using the aggressive zzso zzso melanoma model, we show that the zzso virus is more effective than virus not expressing zzso in clearing the established zzso tumors and results in higher overall long-term animal zzso In addition, mice treated with zzso exhibited no signs of toxicity to the virus and developed zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso of innate immune responses by zzso results in enhancement of its zzso properties and warrant further investigation of this strategy in design of zzso zzso zzso against human zzso
