The electrical activity of the human stomach, which normally shows a frequency of about zzso zzso may be studied zzso by either zzso zzso zzso or surface zzso zzso zzso of changes in frequency with time may be useful to characterize gastric zzso The fast zzso transform zzso has been the most commonly used method for the automated spectral analysis of the signals obtained from the zzso or the zzso We have used an zzso zzso zzso spectrum zzso to zzso simulated signals of gastric electrical activity, and to evaluate the results of human studies using zzso and zzso In comparison with the zzso our results showed that the zzso spectrum zzso provided more detailed qualitative information about frequency variations of short duration simulated signals than the zzso In the human studies, the zzso zzso was as good as the conventional zzso methods in detecting zzso changes in frequency and in identifying abnormal zzso We conclude that the zzso spectral zzso may provide a better qualitative analysis of frequency variations in small portions of the zzso and is as useful as the zzso to zzso human zzso or zzso zzso
