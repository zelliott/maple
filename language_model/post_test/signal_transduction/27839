The discovery of zzso zzso membrane anchors has had a significant impact on several areas of zzso cell zzso Studies of the African zzso which expresses a dense surface coat of zzso zzso surface zzso have played important roles in establishing the general structure of zzso membrane anchors and in zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The major zzso molecules of related zzso are also rich in zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and differences in zzso specificity between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso may have potential for the development of zzso zzso Apart from providing stable membrane zzso zzso anchors have been implicated in the zzso of zzso proteins into zzso membrane zzso known as zzso zzso and in signal zzso zzso
