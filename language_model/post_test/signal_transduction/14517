Cellular signaling pathways zzso zzso signals into appropriate zzso These pathways are typically interconnected to form networks, often with different pathways sharing similar or identical zzso A consequence of this connectedness is the potential for cross talk, some of which may be zzso Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that cells have evolved insulating mechanisms to partially suppress zzso between zzso Here we characterize mathematical models of simple signaling networks and obtain exact zzso expressions for two measures of cross talk called specificity and zzso The performance of several insulating zzso zzso zzso the zzso of one zzso by another, and the selective zzso of scaffold zzso evaluated with respect to the zzso between the specificity they provide and the constraints they place on the zzso The effects of noise are also zzso The insights gained from this analysis are applied to understanding specificity in the zzso mating and invasive growth zzso zzso signaling zzso
