zzso and zzso II zzso zzso contribute to the development and progression of zzso zzso Here we investigated the effects of bone zzso proteins zzso on zzso cell proliferation evoked by zzso and zzso II with mouse zzso cells, which express zzso receptors zzso zzso II type 1 zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso cell zzso and activated zzso and zzso zzso These zzso effects were neutralized by the MR zzso zzso and zzso of zzso or translation, suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling more zzso than zzso and zzso leading to suppression of zzso cell zzso and MR zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso but not zzso suppressed zzso cellular DNA zzso zzso that zzso and zzso pathways play crucial roles in zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso while zzso zzso pathway, resulting in zzso of zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso modulated the zzso zzso system by decreasing expression of zzso zzso and zzso while increasing zzso zzso zzso Thus novel functional cross talk between the zzso zzso system and zzso signaling was uncovered, in which zzso of zzso signaling and MR expression by zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso zzso damage due to zzso proliferation caused by zzso
