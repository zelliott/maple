zzso brain injury zzso zzso tissue zzso resulting in pathological zzso zzso Recently, zzso was reported to be induced and activated by the unfolded protein response following excess zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examined rat zzso expression using the controlled cortical impact zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso found elevated zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso and processed form zzso 12 zzso with peak induction observed within 24 h zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction peaked at 24 h zzso zzso while processed form induction peaked at 6 h zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis confirmed elevated zzso zzso levels after zzso zzso severity zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso at 5 days in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 6 h in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso induction in zzso in both the zzso and zzso as well as in zzso at the zzso zzso This is the first report of increased expression of zzso following zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in rat zzso pathology independent of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso
