zzso zzso signaling zzso the control of complex behaviors, and its deregulation has been implicated in a wide range of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso and type 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso control of zzso activity and behavioral zzso Conventional and zzso zzso zzso knockout mice show attenuated zzso of G zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso by cocaine and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in attenuated zzso reduction of locomotion and an enhanced sensitivity to the zzso and zzso actions of zzso Analysis of global zzso zzso modification of zzso using zzso zzso zzso coupled with next-generation sequencing in the zzso and zzso of zzso mice revealed increased zzso zzso in a subset of zzso important for zzso zzso including many in the zzso signaling zzso Several proteins zzso by these zzso had altered expression zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso of specific zzso in zzso and this activity relates to the control of zzso zzso
