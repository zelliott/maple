The transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in various biological zzso zzso of zzso a central cellular zzso of zzso zzso is implicated in a wide range of human diseases and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso are not fully zzso Using a functional screening approach based on zzso reporter zzso we identified 39 zzso zzso as potential regulators of zzso from an expression library of 388 human zzso The screening was supported by zzso analysis, as 24 of 39 identified zzso were also predicted to target zzso zzso one of the identified zzso was zzso correlated with zzso expression in various human cancer cell lines and gastric cancer zzso and zzso zzso expression and blocked zzso zzso zzso responses in cell zzso These effects were dependent on the presence of a zzso but not perfect seed zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso region zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the ability of zzso to induce gastric cancer cell growth arrest and zzso in zzso and promoted zzso growth in soft zzso suggesting that zzso plays an zzso role in human gastric zzso In conclusion, our functional screening zzso multiple zzso that regulate the cellular responsiveness to zzso zzso and reveals important roles of zzso in gastric cancer by directly targeting zzso
