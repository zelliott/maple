zzso zzso systems zzso and small regulatory zzso zzso form densely interconnected networks that integrate and zzso information from the environment into fine-tuned changes of gene zzso Many zzso control target genes indirectly through regulation of zzso which in turn regulate gene expression by zzso with zzso or targeting a zzso zzso zzso may control zzso zzso thereby recruiting the zzso zzso to other regulatory zzso Several zzso control expression of multiple zzso zzso providing the regulatory networks with further zzso These zzso act zzso zzso or zzso on zzso The regulatory speed of zzso and their unique features in gene regulation make them ideal players extending the flexibility, dynamic range or timing of zzso zzso
