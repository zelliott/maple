zzso is a zzso gene expressed in multiple embryonic zzso which functions as a key zzso of numerous zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein that serves as a zzso or zzso to a variety of zzso The role of zzso during zzso remains zzso In this study, we report that zzso is regulated by zzso through zzso zzso During zzso the expression pattern of zzso was observed to overlap in part with that of zzso Most notably, during first zzso arch and limb development, both zzso and zzso were highly zzso and their patterns were zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso regulates zzso gene zzso zzso zzso cells were used in a number of expression and binding zzso We discovered that, in these cells, zzso activated zzso zzso gene expression as well as zzso zzso fusion gene zzso These biological activities were dependent on both the DNA binding and zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso bound specifically to three zzso binding sites on the zzso promoter of zzso that accounted for this zzso zzso introduced to these sites reduced the level of zzso zzso As bone zzso protein type 4 zzso regulates zzso expression in embryonic zzso and in zzso cells, we further tested whether zzso is the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso did not induce the expression of zzso in early mouse zzso zzso nor in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is not a required zzso of the zzso zzso in these zzso at this zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso functions as an zzso for the zzso zzso and that this regulation, which is independent of the zzso pathway, may be required during early mouse zzso and limb zzso
