In zzso most zzso genes contain zzso which are removed by precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso Alternative zzso is a process by which multiple zzso zzso zzso are generated from a single zzso resulting in functionally distinct zzso Recent zzso analyses of alternative zzso indicated that in higher zzso alternative zzso is an important mechanism that generates zzso complexity and regulates gene zzso zzso of zzso causes a wide range of human zzso This review describes the current understanding of zzso zzso and the mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso zzso It also discusses emerging directions in the field of alternative zzso
