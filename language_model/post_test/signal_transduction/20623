zzso presence of zzso zzso is evident in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease zzso in contrast to the rare detection of zzso in a normal zzso However, the actual cause and pathological significance of these observations remain zzso Here, we demonstrate a role for zzso metabolism in the regulation of the zzso zzso in ex zzso and in zzso models of zzso We show that transferring zzso from zzso patients into cells previously depleted of zzso DNA is sufficient to reproduce the zzso in the zzso system observed in zzso patient zzso Although the initial steps of this zzso are not compromised, there is an increased zzso of zzso associated with a defective zzso zzso We prove that this functional decline was originated from a deficient zzso of zzso from their site of formation toward zzso due to disruption in zzso zzso This contributed directly to a decreased zzso flux of zzso and other zzso zzso Our results lend strong support for a direct impact of zzso in zzso as defective zzso clearance ability secondary to impaired zzso trafficking is driven by dysfunctional zzso We uncover zzso and zzso zzso traffic as main players in the regulation of zzso in zzso
