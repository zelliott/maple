zzso zzso zzso initiation and outgrowth involve coordinated zzso of surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso development appears to mirror that of the zzso Although zzso is essential for the development of both zzso its role in zzso development is much less clear than in the zzso Here, by removing zzso at different stages during zzso development in mice, we demonstrate a continuous requirement for zzso in zzso initiation and subsequent zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we investigated the zzso responsiveness of different tissue layers by removing or zzso its signal zzso zzso with zzso zzso lines, and established zzso zzso as the primary target tissue of zzso zzso Lastly, we showed that zzso is required for the maintenance of the zzso signaling center zzso zzso zzso zzso By restoring zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso we revealed that zzso zzso its signal partly through the zzso but regulates zzso and zzso expression independently of zzso zzso Altogether, we propose that zzso plays a central role in zzso development by simultaneously regulating patterning of the zzso field and supporting an outgrowth zzso
