zzso zzso forward signaling from zzso zzso guides the zzso of lateral motor column zzso motor zzso zzso zzso also express zzso while their zzso receptors are expressed in the limb zzso In zzso studies have suggested that reverse signaling from zzso zzso to zzso zzso might result in attraction of zzso zzso However, genetic evidence for this function is zzso Here we use the zzso chamber turning zzso to show that zzso proteins are zzso and elicit fast turning responses in zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso in chick zzso changes the limb trajectory of zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso in mice resulted in fewer zzso zzso projection errors than the ubiquitous deletion of zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso zzso partially rescued guidance errors in the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso contributes to the establishment of zzso zzso In zzso we provide evidence for a role of zzso attractive reverse signaling in motor zzso guidance and in zzso evidence of zzso forward zzso and reverse zzso signaling function in the same zzso zzso
