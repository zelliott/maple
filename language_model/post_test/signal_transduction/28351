zzso skeletal muscles comprise distinct fiber types that differ in their zzso zzso function, zzso content and zzso zzso Recent studies identified the zzso zzso zzso as a key zzso of the zzso stimuli that zzso zzso plasticity in zzso zzso Although zzso become zzso to differentiate into distinct kinds of fibers early in development, the identities of regulatory proteins that determine embryonic zzso zzso are still zzso Here we show that the gene zzso zzso a zzso in which zzso the induction of embryonic zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor that promotes the terminal differentiation of B zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso zzso signaling in prospective slow muscle zzso and its activity alone is sufficient to direct zzso zzso development by zzso zzso Our data provide the first molecular insight into the mechanism by which a specific group of muscle precursors is driven along a distinct zzso of zzso differentiation in response to zzso cues in the zzso zzso
