The last decade has seen an increased focus on the development of zzso for vaccines, and several novel zzso are now in licensed products or in late-stage clinical zzso These zzso have been aided by the discovery of receptors and signaling pathways of the innate immune system and an increased understanding of how these innate responses influence the zzso immune zzso zzso vaccine development relies on knowledge of which zzso to use and the proper zzso of zzso and zzso to achieve safe, stable and zzso zzso In this review, the authors focus on the current use of natural and synthetic zzso zzso that retain their zzso properties with reduced toxicity compared with the parent compound for use in emerging zzso The authors review how these compounds initiate signal zzso through zzso zzso 4, insights from zzso studies and how zzso parameters can influence their effectiveness as vaccine zzso
