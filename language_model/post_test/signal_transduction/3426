zzso growth factor I zzso zzso signaling controls zzso zzso growth, and cell survival in many zzso and its zzso activity is involved in zzso Although important during fetal growth and zzso life, a function for the zzso zzso during zzso development has not been zzso We show that zzso zzso signaling with specific zzso blocks zzso formation and compromises zzso survival during zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso total zzso is present throughout the zzso whereas the activated form is found exclusively at cell contact sites, zzso with zzso Using genetic domain zzso we show a requirement for zzso to maintain proper zzso of zzso zzso expressing exclusively a zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to form a zzso and cells die by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso show zzso survival and zzso zzso indicating a crucial and zzso role of the zzso zzso for these zzso zzso zzso formation can be rescued in zzso zzso zzso by restoring zzso zzso which enhances cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso integrity, independent of its zzso function, blocked zzso signaling and induced cell death in the zzso Our results reveal an important and yet undiscovered function of zzso during zzso development zzso by a unique physical interaction between zzso and zzso indispensable for proper zzso zzso and zzso zzso We provide novel insights into how zzso zzso activity is additionally gated to sense zzso potential in zzso and into a zzso role of zzso molecules in contact formation and zzso
