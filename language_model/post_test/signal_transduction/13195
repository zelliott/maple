We studied the effects of membrane stretch and zzso on the gating of single zzso zzso channels in zzso from zzso zzso zzso In earlier studies of zzso channels in zzso zzso we found a novel class of zzso zzso In the present experiments, we used a gentle zzso protocol to determine whether seal formation damaged the membrane and altered zzso channel zzso since zzso is known to be associated with an increased zzso to mechanically induced zzso In some recordings from zzso zzso zzso channel open probability gradually increased to levels approaching unity following seal zzso In these recordings, channels remained open for the duration of the zzso In other recordings, zzso channel open probability remained low after seal formation and applying weak zzso evoked conventional zzso zzso zzso strong zzso or very positive zzso however, caused some channels to enter a high open probability gating zzso The shift to a high open probability gating mode coincided with the appearance of zzso zzso These findings suggested that mechanical stimulation altered the mechanical properties of the patch causing some zzso channels to enter a novel gating zzso In support of this idea, zzso and zzso channels were not detected in the same membrane patch and channel zzso occurred at lower pressures than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other experiments showed that zzso gating was not due to a simple loss of zzso channel activity from a zzso process such as zzso or zzso zzso channel zzso by zzso was readily zzso stable over tens of minutes, and followed the predictions of the zzso zzso for independent, randomly gating zzso In addition, the zzso gating of zzso channels was similar to that of zzso zzso The results show that zzso channels in zzso muscle exist in two distinct gating modes and that mechanical stimuli cause an irreversible conversion between zzso We discuss possible mechanisms for the changes in zzso channel gating in relation to the known zzso abnormalities of zzso muscle and its possible implications for the zzso of zzso zzso
