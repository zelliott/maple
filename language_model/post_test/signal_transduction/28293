The zzso growth factors zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso are potent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor signaling is regulated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso a recently described zzso regulates growth signaling in zzso 

zzso of zzso in human zzso tumors was determined by real-time zzso zzso of zzso expression was investigated by analyzing loss of zzso zzso at the zzso locus and the effect of the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso The zzso location of zzso and zzso state of zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso and zzso signaling was examined by zzso zzso zzso Cell growth was measured by zzso blue zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso expression was decreased in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso cell zzso There was zzso at the zzso locus in zzso of zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cell zzso Low zzso cells showed increased zzso of zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso and increased zzso cell zzso zzso forced expression of zzso decreased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso cells with high-level zzso expression were sensitive to zzso or zzso zzso whereas low expressing cells were zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells restored zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso contributes to zzso by enhancing zzso growth factor signaling and resistance to zzso
