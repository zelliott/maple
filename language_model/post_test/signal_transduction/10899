Members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of receptors such as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso induce zzso by recruiting zzso molecules and zzso The central zzso zzso for these receptors is a death zzso zzso zzso which binds to the activated zzso via death zzso domain zzso Here, we show that in addition to the death domain, the zzso tails of zzso and zzso positively regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the corresponding region in the zzso zzso has the opposite effect and zzso binding to the zzso death zzso Replacement of zzso or zzso zzso molecules into zzso zzso cells indicates that some zzso zzso display an absolute requirement for the zzso tail for zzso binding and signaling while other zzso can function in the absence of this zzso These data demonstrate that regions outside the death zzso of zzso and zzso have opposite effects to that of zzso in regulating zzso recruitment and show that different death zzso zzso can use distinct molecular mechanisms to activate signaling from the same zzso
