Drugs targeting memory zzso may allow for a better control of rejection in zzso particularly in zzso zzso In this article the rationale of targeting zzso 7 zzso alpha zzso a zzso expressed by both memory and zzso T cells, is reviewed in the context of zzso Whereas zzso T cells are partly responsible for acute rejection and are targeted by current zzso drugs that block zzso signals zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso memory T cells are resistant to zzso zzso As such, memory cells are an obstacle to experimental tolerance induction and may be involved in chronic zzso There is thus much scientific interest in developing molecules able to target these zzso The role of the zzso zzso in transplantation rejection has been suggested by the effect of an zzso zzso zzso which, when associated with zzso zzso prolonged heart zzso survival in zzso Here the hypothesis that targeting zzso would preserve zzso T cells that are less dependent on zzso for survival while sparing regulatory zzso zzso zzso T cells is zzso An zzso zzso could also help achieve zzso tolerance by reducing zzso zzso
