zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso has been described in culture and also during zzso of the artery following zzso However, the zzso that regulate zzso in zzso are zzso Because zzso a family of related zzso growth factors, including nerve growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be strongly expressed in zzso zzso the present study was undertaken to evaluate in zzso the activity of zzso with regard to zzso of zzso cultures of human zzso zzso We report here that zzso induced zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso This effect was detected from the concentration of 1 zzso and reached a maximum at 100 zzso The concentration that induced a zzso effect was zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was time dependent and was significant after 3 h of zzso The zzso activity of zzso was blocked in a zzso manner by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso signal zzso zzso could activate zzso cell death programs in human zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso showing that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso At a zzso concentration that strongly induced zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been identified several times as a protective factor, dose zzso inhibited the zzso effect of zzso The zzso value was zzso zzso These results indicate that, at least in zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso activity of zzso for zzso therefore suggesting that zzso has the capacity to diminish the deleterious consequences of an zzso or zzso injury that might occur during zzso or following zzso
