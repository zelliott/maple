Recent evidence has shown that bone zzso zzso cells zzso may exhibit zzso activities through soluble zzso and direct zzso zzso but how these processes are modulated has been poorly zzso In this study, we show that the zzso signaling zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso to elicit their zzso zzso In a zzso lethal acute graft versus host disease zzso model, zzso deficient for zzso the critical zzso factor zzso signaling from all four zzso zzso zzso failed to delay the development of the zzso zzso deficient zzso were not able to inhibit the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso deficient zzso could not zzso the expression of zzso II and zzso molecules zzso and zzso on zzso cells zzso The zzso presentation capacity of zzso zzso with zzso deficient zzso was not impaired in contrast to wild type zzso Furthermore, we showed that the productions of zzso and zzso two critical molecules zzso the zzso activities of zzso were reduced significantly in zzso deficient zzso Both of the two molecules were zzso involved in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggests that the zzso effects of zzso in zzso are dependent on zzso zzso which regulates the productions of zzso and zzso
