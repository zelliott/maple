The fate and function of zzso and zzso are tightly zzso Their zzso is linked through common zzso zzso and their growth and division is zzso by common zzso zzso Recently, these two zzso have been linked in a much more direct manner, where zzso derived zzso deliver specific cargo into a population of zzso There are a number of concepts that emerge from this zzso including the idea that zzso are able to segregate their contents into zzso and that zzso may represent a new mechanism for zzso communication with zzso and potentially other zzso zzso By considering the function of their bacterial relatives, we can develop hypothesis about the origin and mechanism of zzso zzso zzso The zzso released from bacteria have numerous functions in signaling within the colony and zzso host zzso zzso the first observation that the zzso form zzso that are transported within the cell defines a new, zzso zzso process in zzso cell biology and zzso This review will explore the mechanism and function of zzso zzso transport with an eye toward the evolutionary implications of this new zzso in cell zzso
