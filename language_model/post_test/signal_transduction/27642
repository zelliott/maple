The major zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso These compounds are also known zzso in zzso zzso We have previously shown that their common precursor zzso acid was formed by the zzso of zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bosch, zzso zzso and zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we determine the zzso of the zzso produced as zzso and zzso in the ratio zzso zzso We further show that zzso from zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acids in the presence of zzso to form the corresponding zzso zzso The reactions were not zzso by zzso from zzso transformed with a void zzso or in absence of zzso After incubation of a synthetic zzso mixture of zzso acid with zzso of zzso expressing zzso the zzso of the residual zzso was shifted to zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso were incubated separately and zzso values of 16 and zzso zzso per zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively were determined, demonstrating that zzso is zzso for the zzso zzso which is zzso formed in zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso the zzso zzso acid was a much poorer zzso for the zzso with a measured zzso of zzso zzso per zzso of zzso Our results indicate that the activity of zzso is strongly influenced by the zzso of the 9, zzso and the nature of zzso on zzso 9 and 10, with zzso values for zzso zzso
