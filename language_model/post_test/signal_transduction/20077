There have been many recent studies from both experimental and simulation perspectives in order to understand the effects of spatial crowding in molecular zzso These effects manifest themselves in protein zzso on the plasma zzso on chemical zzso within the cell and in gene zzso zzso are usually done with zzso or zzso random walks but insights can also be gained through the zzso of the underlying probability density functions of these zzso zzso Until recently much of the focus had been on continuous time random walks, but some very recent work has suggested that fractional zzso motion may be a good zzso of spatial crowding effects in some zzso The study compares both fractional zzso motion and continuous time random walks and highlights how well they can represent different types of spatial crowding and physical zzso zzso spatial data, mimicking experimental data, was first generated by using the package zzso We then attempted to zzso this data through continuous time zzso zzso random walks and zzso zzso motion zzso by obtaining zzso paths that match the statistical properties of our sample zzso Although diffusion around zzso obstacles can be reasonably zzso by a single zzso zzso we find that diffusion in a crowded environment seems to exhibit zzso properties in the form of a different zzso and long-time zzso
