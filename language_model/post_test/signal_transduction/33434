The majority of patients with zzso zzso breast cancer who initially respond to the zzso zzso zzso show disease progression within 1 zzso The identification of novel agents that effectively inhibit survival of cancer cells that have progressed on zzso is critical for improving outcome for this patient zzso In the current study, we show that the zzso compound zzso acid zzso promoted cell death of zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso induced DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of colony zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso and zzso signaling in zzso cells, with reduced downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso combination treatment with zzso and zzso suppressed proliferation and survival of zzso cells to a greater degree than either agent alone, suggesting that zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso of zzso are currently in clinical trial for other solid zzso Our data strongly support further study of zzso as a potential therapeutic against breast zzso that have progressed on zzso
