We have previously shown that the zzso prostate cancer cells zzso despite expressing zzso and zzso were resistant to zzso zzso and that this resistance could be overcome by zzso the cells with zzso doses of zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso activity is required for zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was shown to activate zzso in a zzso manner, and to induce zzso zzso The effects were more prominent in cells treated with both zzso and zzso The expression levels of zzso a zzso which regulates zzso and which has been implicated in prostate cancer resistance to zzso remained zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is an upstream event in the zzso pathway, and is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted to zzso and zzso reversed the effect of zzso These results suggest that stress zzso zzso can significantly influence the fate of zzso prostate cancer cells following zzso zzso zzso
