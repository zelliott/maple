In the present study, we show that the zzso zzso inducing compound zzso stimulates the zzso release, but not the influx, of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso alpha zzso on rat zzso and zzso capping of zzso alpha zzso zzso with the effects of zzso B together with the finding that zzso also inhibited capping of zzso whereas zzso of zzso did not cause a zzso suggest that zzso interferes with zzso alpha zzso by selective interference with zzso zzso The responding zzso were zzso and zzso thus possibly including the non zzso counterpart of the presumed immature zzso cells of zzso The present effects may therefore relate to the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
