The structure of human zzso hormone zzso related protein zzso zzso containing an Ala zzso for an zzso in position 15 was studied by two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso This zzso retains quite high levels of zzso zzso activity based on slightly reduced zzso zzso binding zzso Three segments of zzso were revealed extending from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso with a decided zzso between the first two zzso around zzso zzso and zzso zzso were stabilized by charged and zzso side chain interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso resulting in a zzso zzso occupying a single zzso While the structure of the entire zzso region differed greatly from the structure of the native zzso the structure of both zzso and zzso regions remains essentially zzso The zzso responsible for initiating signal zzso in the zzso are located in the vicinity of the zzso responsible for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso forming the zzso binding site exhibits reduced binding as a result of the closely applied zzso signal zzso zzso Although not contributing directly to zzso zzso the zzso region can zzso affect hormone binding through modifications to certain zzso side zzso
