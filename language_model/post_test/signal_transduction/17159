zzso is zzso together with zinc oxide in zzso clinical for the zzso of temporary zzso and the temporary restoration of teeth and zzso This work explored the zzso effects of the zzso in different models of acute pain in mice and investigated its possible zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways of zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso or zzso 30 zzso inhibited 82 zzso zzso and 90 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso test, zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the response behavior by 62 zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso (10 zzso zzso in the zzso test was prevented by the zzso treatment for mice with zzso The zzso of mice with zzso (10 zzso zzso was able to inhibit the zzso induced by the zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (41 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso (55 zzso zzso and substance P zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso (10 zzso zzso also inhibited biting induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso 65 zzso zzso These results extend our current knowledge of zzso and confirm that it promotes significant zzso against different mouse models of acute zzso The mechanism of action appears to involve the zzso of the zzso system and zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso could represent an important compound in the treatment for acute zzso
