A new era in osteoporosis management began with the recent approval of zzso hormone zzso for zzso and idiopathic osteoporosis zzso zzso zzso dramatically increases spine bone mineral density and significantly reduces fragility zzso However, the skeletal response to zzso varies greatly and there are few large scale, randomized, zzso trials in conditions such as zzso zzso Moreover, the mechanisms of zzso action are complex, involving multiple pathways linked to common signaling peptides regulating zzso gene zzso In addition, important interactions between zzso and zzso are activated by zzso This review presents recent findings on zzso signaling in bone and discusses how they could be used to design zzso trials and establish clinical practice guidelines for this novel anabolic zzso
