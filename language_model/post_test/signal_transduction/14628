zzso growth factor 8 zzso is expressed at the zzso boundary and is an important signal emanating from the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso juxtaposed to zzso expression and has been implicated in its zzso In this study, we examine the requirement for continuous zzso signaling in the maintenance of zzso expression at the zzso We demonstrate that prior to zzso ongoing zzso signaling is required to maintain the normal pattern of zzso zzso expression in zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso sustained zzso signaling is essential to maintain zzso expression in zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso expression is likely to be a maintenance response rather than an zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso maintenance of zzso expression is dependent upon positive feedback by zzso signaling itself, and that zzso 1 does not receive zzso cues from the zzso zzso In zzso these findings establish that a sustained zzso interaction between zzso and zzso signaling is essential to maintain zzso zzso
