zzso zzso is the smallest known type I intermediate filament and is used as a marker for reverse zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the functional analysis of zzso in human breast zzso 

Using a short hairpin zzso system, we silenced zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso was verified by Western zzso analysis and zzso We further examined the effect of zzso zzso on breast cancer cells by cell zzso migration, invasion, colony formation zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in increased cell zzso migration, invasion, and zzso These effects were zzso by zzso of zzso signaling as a result of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the nuclear import of early growth zzso zzso a zzso factor for zzso transcription, through reduced association between zzso and zzso We also confirmed that zzso of zzso increased tumor formation in a zzso zzso 

zzso is a potential tumor zzso that zzso regulates zzso signaling through zzso of zzso nuclear zzso
