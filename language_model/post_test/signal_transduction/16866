zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso and zzso 2 zzso are major regulators of vascular tone and cardiovascular development in zzso Recent research into their functions in reproduction has illuminated the role of these peptides and their zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso blood zzso zzso development, female zzso development, and zzso movement in the zzso Although zzso family peptides function in a temporally and zzso specific manner in various zzso zzso they appear to act via a similar set of second zzso including zzso oxide, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channels in different zzso These discoveries supported the view that zzso receptors were recruited to perform a variety of newly evolved zzso functions during the evolution of internal reproduction in zzso These advances also provided insight into how zzso zzso signaling pathways coordinate with other zzso zzso to accommodate the extra zzso needs during pregnancy, and captured some important details as to how zzso vascular communications are generated in the first zzso Furthermore, these findings have revealed novel, promising opportunities for the prevention and treatment of zzso zzso such as zzso hypertension, zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, significant efforts are still needed to clarify the relationships between certain components of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso before zzso receptors can become targets for clinical zzso With this understanding, this review summarizes recent zzso with particular focus on clinical zzso
