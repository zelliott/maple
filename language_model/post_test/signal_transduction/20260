zzso zzso development in the zzso generates a zzso population of conventional zzso cells, along with minor populations of zzso T cells that resemble memory zzso Recent studies analyzing a variety of zzso or zzso mice have indicated that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso produce increased numbers of innate zzso T cells, characterized by their high expression of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor, zzso zzso One component of this altered development is a zzso T zzso role for zzso To determine whether reduced zzso signaling within the zzso T cells might also contribute to this pathway, we investigated the role of the zzso factor, zzso regulatory factor 4 zzso zzso is zzso following zzso stimulation in zzso T zzso further, this zzso is impaired in T cells treated with a zzso inhibitor of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso T cells leads to rapid and robust expression of zzso which is further enhanced by zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso together with zzso increases zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso and that this signaling zzso normally suppresses zzso zzso thereby regulating the differentiation zzso of zzso T zzso
