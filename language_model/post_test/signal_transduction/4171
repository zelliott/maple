We studied zzso responses induced by zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso cells after 24 h treatment with a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso After this treatment, meant to zzso zzso activity, all tested zzso responses were attenuated and were indeed accompanied by a decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity was not altered and zzso zzso number was only slightly lowered after 24 h zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of the zzso responses by 24 h zzso treatment was mainly caused by a general impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent culture for 2 days rendered the cells zzso to zzso the zzso zzso response was 2 to 3 times higher than in control zzso Again no change in binding affinity of the zzso zzso was observed and zzso number was just zzso lower than in control zzso The zzso and zzso zzso responses were not higher than zzso So, transient zzso zzso treatment leads to a zzso zzso restoration of the zzso zzso zzso
