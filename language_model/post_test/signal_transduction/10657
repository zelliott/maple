zzso a form of programmed cell death, is a pivotal defense against the occurrence of cancer and is essential to zzso in maintaining tissue zzso zzso exhibits a distinctive zzso and involves elimination of potentially deleterious zzso Many diseases have been associated with zzso regulated zzso cell death, ultimately leading to zzso of zzso and propagation of diseases such as zzso zzso of the critical events associated with zzso provides the opportunity for dietary intervention to prevent cancer development through induction of zzso particularly by zzso agents or functional zzso Diet is a significant environmental factor in the overall cancer process and can exacerbate or interfere with zzso zzso occurs primarily through two zzso pathways in cells, including the zzso or zzso zzso mechanism and the zzso or death zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso effects on protein expression and function, evidence is also accumulating that a large number of dietary food components can exert effects on the human zzso either directly or zzso to zzso gene zzso In fact, many zzso genes are involved in zzso as well as zzso and thus are ultimately molecular targets for dietary zzso There are multiple steps within pathways in which dietary components can alter gene expression and zzso of cells and thus influence cancer outcomes zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an emerging therapeutic target of zzso agents of zzso In this review, the process of zzso is discussed and the potential zzso interaction of zzso agents, as components of functional foods, is explored within the context of zzso
