The family of zzso small zzso including zzso zzso and zzso regulate numerous cellular zzso Since the cellular functions of zzso have not been zzso zzso active zzso was used to identify targets that zzso its zzso We here identify human zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a complex with activated zzso zzso contains a zzso domain and exhibits an associated zzso zzso zzso represents a novel family of zzso zzso proteins with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells failed to activate possible downstream targets of zzso including the zzso pathway, the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso failed to zzso with zzso stress fibers or zzso or with the zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso caused a dramatic zzso of the zzso marker zzso to more peripheral locations within the cell, consistent with an impairment of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and activated zzso zzso to zzso and at the cell periphery in zzso These results suggest that zzso functions in zzso trafficking and may be directed to specific zzso locations through interaction with small zzso of the zzso zzso
