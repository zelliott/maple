zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso is regulated by four upstream zzso present in the zzso leader sequence zzso zzso of all four upstream zzso zzso results in zzso higher levels of zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso have zzso higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso production than wild type zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is present in heavier zzso than the zzso transcript, and zzso more zzso protein is produced by in zzso translation from zzso transcripts compared with zzso zzso The zzso comprises 3 zzso zzso 3 zzso encodes the entire open reading frame and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso and 52 zzso of zzso zzso the zzso The zzso in both zzso contribute to the zzso effect on zzso expression but not to the same zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso 2 zzso zzso half of the zzso whereas disruption of the zzso in zzso 1 zzso is without zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso 2 results in levels of zzso expression and translation that are indistinguishable from the alternative zzso zzso zzso which we previously showed was more efficiently translated than the zzso zzso Individual zzso revealed that only the fourth zzso increased zzso zzso In conclusion, all four zzso present in the zzso function zzso to suppress zzso expression and signaling by zzso zzso These data also show that both zzso in zzso contribute to the zzso zzso element present in this alternatively spliced zzso
