zzso defined as the diminution of zzso signaling in the presence of continued or repeated zzso is critical to cellular zzso G zzso receptors zzso undergo multiple zzso zzso including zzso and zzso through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the relative importance of individual and combined zzso and zzso zzso to these processes is not well zzso We examined this mechanism in the context of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso member of the zzso family of zzso critical to zzso zzso To evaluate the contributions of individual and zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 30 zzso forms of the zzso expressed in the human zzso zzso cell line, were zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are individually critical, and indeed zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso but that the presence of neighboring zzso zzso can inhibit these zzso Additionally, we observed no absolute correlation between zzso binding and either zzso or zzso suggesting the existence of zzso mechanisms for these zzso Our results suggest zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso represent a zzso code, capable of both positively and zzso regulating signaling and zzso This study is among the first detailed analyses of a complex regulatory site in a zzso and provides insight into zzso regulatory zzso
