The recent literature on the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso is reviewed with special emphasis on their clinical zzso Actually the zzso pathways descending from the brain stem into the spinal zzso may generate zzso However, zzso more important is that zzso and zzso are apparently the main zzso along the ascending zzso pathways in the spinal zzso zzso zzso and their receptors can be detected in particularly high zzso in the zzso root zzso and the superficial zzso zzso zzso of the spinal zzso In low doses zzso zzso zzso only slightly elevate the threshold of the zzso pain zzso However, they suppress the process of pathological zzso zzso lowering of the pain threshold seen upon excessive or lasting stimulation of zzso zzso a process that takes place during inflammation or other kinds of tissue zzso At zzso level zzso of both the zzso and zzso receptors inhibit wind up zzso lasting zzso of the zzso zzso sensory zzso in the deeper layers of the zzso zzso During zzso the resting zzso blockade of zzso zzso channels is zzso certain second zzso pathways are zzso the zzso of many genes is enhanced leading to overproduction of zzso and other zzso zzso and expression of zzso channels in the primary sensory zzso activated at lower level of zzso This cascade of events leads to increased zzso of the pain zzso zzso zzso are apparently more potent in experimental models of zzso pain, whereas zzso zzso are more effective in abolition of zzso seen during experimental zzso zzso of the previously known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been tested, the latter zzso zzso has been found quite active in certain cases of zzso pain and it reduced the zzso demand when used for zzso zzso However, in other types of clinical pain their efficacy is less zzso Not being registered there are no clinical data on the zzso zzso There are, however, some zzso new drugs and some novel compounds in the stage of zzso development which zzso the zzso receptors in competitive fashion or zzso Of the latter molecules zzso are particularly zzso
