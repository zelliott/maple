To investigate the relation between the function of zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso we have examined the zzso and pharmacological characteristics of zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors in rat zzso zzso cells during development using the zzso method combined with zzso zzso The typical response to zzso obtained from a rat on zzso day zzso 21 consisted of three zzso zzso a fast zzso inward zzso zzso a slow inward zzso and zzso a slow outward zzso The slow inward current was abolished in zzso zzso while the fast zzso inward current and the slow outward current remained zzso The slow outward current which appeared to be activated via a zzso zzso was not observed in the zzso cell of zzso 7 zzso in which zzso were poorly developed but its zzso increased zzso with zzso zzso caused significant increases in zzso in the fully developed zzso region of the zzso cells even in zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
