We have investigated the functional zzso of alpha and beta zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso members of the zzso and zzso families of zzso G proteins in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cell lines zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, using zzso cells which zzso a zzso of zzso truncated at the point of divergence of zzso and zzso we investigated the requirement of the zzso per zzso in zzso G protein zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso couple similarly to zzso to affect increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso calcium zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso neither zzso generated corresponding increases in zzso indicating that the zzso increases in zzso do not involve zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso dependent zzso channels, reduced zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso to approximately zzso of that zzso in its absence, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso release, had no effect on zzso zzso by either zzso zzso zzso with zzso Despite the lack of differential zzso specificity by zzso and zzso zzso zzso more efficiently in the absence of a zzso G protein compared to the wild type receptors but, on the other hand, displayed an impaired ability to couple to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In studies investigating the role of the zzso in influencing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso but not zzso zzso coupled to zzso leading to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than to zzso Whereas zzso zzso more efficiently in the absence of zzso G protein compared to the wild type zzso zzso of zzso did not augment zzso generation by zzso zzso from these studies involving the wild type zzso zzso and zzso we conclude that the zzso sequences of zzso are not a major zzso of G protein zzso specificity to zzso and zzso members of the zzso family or to zzso it may play a role in determining zzso versus zzso zzso and may act as a zzso of zzso zzso
