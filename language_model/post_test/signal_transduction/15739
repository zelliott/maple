zzso of zzso zzso expression in various zzso and body zzso has been demonstrated to be associated with several diseases, including Type 2 Diabetes zzso zzso Here, we compare zzso expression profiles in different zzso zzso liver, zzso and skeletal zzso as well as in blood samples from zzso rat model and highlight the potential of circulating zzso as zzso of zzso In zzso we have examined the expression profiles of zzso in blood samples from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso male zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso real-time zzso we identify four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to four previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as potential signature zzso that distinguished zzso and zzso Of these zzso zzso that promotes zzso has been found to be highly zzso Increased circulating level of zzso has been found to correlate with zzso of its predicted target, insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso at both zzso and protein zzso We could also zzso demonstrate that zzso is indeed the target of zzso 

We demonstrate that peripheral blood zzso can be developed as unique zzso that are reflective and zzso of zzso health and zzso We have also identified signature zzso which could possibly explain the zzso of zzso and the significance of zzso in insulin zzso
