In response to DNA damage, cells activate a complex, zzso signaling network that consist of two zzso rapid zzso signaling cascade that results in immediate zzso of zzso complexes to arrest the cell cycle along with recruitment of repair machinery to damaged DNA, followed by a delayed zzso response that promotes cell cycle arrest through the induction of zzso zzso such as zzso In recent years a third layer of complexity has emerged that involves zzso control of zzso stability, zzso and translation as a critical part of the DNA damage zzso Here, we describe recent work implicating DNA zzso modification of zzso proteins that are responsible for some of these zzso effects, highlighting recent work on zzso regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso zzso by the checkpoint zzso zzso zzso
