zzso zzso encompasses a temporally regulated set of zzso changes that zzso cells undergo to generate a network of interconnected zzso Such a complex process inevitably involves multiple cell signaling pathways that must be tightly coordinated in time and zzso The formation of a new zzso involves zzso cell zzso migration, zzso zzso tube formation, zzso zzso and maturation of zzso junctions and the surrounding basement zzso Each of these stages is either known or suspected to fall under the influence of the vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso protein signaling zzso zzso zzso growth factor is essential for initiation of zzso zzso and also regulates migration of zzso tip cells, proliferation of trunk cells, and gene expression in zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell fate decisions in the zzso especially the choice between zzso and zzso zzso cells, and between tip and trunk cell zzso zzso growth zzso regulates cell migration and zzso as well as zzso zzso In this review, we emphasize how zzso between these pathways is essential for proper patterning of the zzso and offer a zzso zzso model to explain how these pathways might interact to generate new tip cells during retinal zzso
