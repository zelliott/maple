zzso disease zzso is a zzso zzso of unknown zzso with coronary artery zzso occurring in majority of zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso is the zzso inflammatory zzso elevated during the acute phase of zzso which zzso damage to vascular zzso cells to cause systemic zzso We here investigated the potential role of zzso a novel zzso zzso on zzso expression in zzso zzso and in zzso cultured peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of acute zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression and production in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells and bone zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso administration zzso zzso production in zzso isolated from acute zzso zzso For the mechanism study, we found that zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling in both patients' zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, although zzso is generally known as an zzso zzso our data suggested that zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso were possibly involved in zzso zzso against zzso production in zzso In conclusion, our data suggested that zzso significantly inhibited zzso production via regulation multiple signaling zzso The results of this study should have significant zzso relevance in managing this devastating zzso
