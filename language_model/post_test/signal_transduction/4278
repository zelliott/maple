zzso growth zzso factor zzso can elicit a wide variety of effects upon cells expressing its zzso the zzso zzso zzso product Met, including zzso zzso and zzso Normally, met expression is restricted to zzso cells and is activated in a zzso fashion by zzso zzso from cells of zzso zzso In this chapter, we review data showing that: zzso met zzso in zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso and zzso via an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs to a low level in normal zzso and to a much greater extent in human zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso met expression is enhanced as zzso zzso are zzso in zzso and zzso met and zzso zzso are selected for during zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, loss of zzso zzso a zzso cell to zzso met and high level zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells promotes both zzso and zzso through inappropriate induction of the zzso responses to zzso zzso
