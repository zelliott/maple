Severe asthma zzso in children requiring hospitalization are typically associated with viral infection and occur almost exclusively among zzso but the significance of these zzso is zzso We hypothesized that underlying interactions between zzso pathways related to responses to zzso and virus are involved, and that evidence of these interactions is zzso in circulating cells during zzso To address this hypothesis we used a zzso approach involving profiling of zzso zzso collected during zzso vs zzso by zzso and flow zzso We demonstrate that circulating T cells manifest the zzso zzso zzso during zzso whereas zzso cell populations display zzso zzso expression accompanied by zzso changes that have strong potential for enhancing local inflammation after their recruitment to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is known to markedly amplify capacity for zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso capture, and zzso programming of zzso zzso alternatively activated zzso that have been demonstrated in experimental settings to be a potent source of zzso zzso zzso We additionally show that this zzso zzso profile can be reproduced in zzso by zzso exposure of zzso zzso and zzso that zzso can exert both positive and negative roles in the zzso Our findings suggest that respiratory viral infection in zzso children may initiate an zzso cascade that zzso and sustains airway inflammation initiated by innate zzso immunity via harnessing underlying zzso zzso These interactions may account for the unique zzso of zzso to severe zzso asthma zzso
