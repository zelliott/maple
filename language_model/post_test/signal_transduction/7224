zzso occurs in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso but is generally considered to be zzso One of the major challenges in zzso research is to understand the causes of zzso failure and to identify therapeutic targets that promote zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso stress zzso cell viability and function under stressful zzso There is evidence that zzso is activated in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in both zzso and its animal model, experimental zzso zzso zzso In this study, we sought to determine the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso using transgenic mice that allow temporally controlled zzso of zzso signaling specifically in zzso We demonstrated that persistent zzso zzso was not deleterious to zzso zzso in young, developing mice or to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that enhancing zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso protected the cells and zzso against the zzso effects of zzso a key zzso zzso in zzso and zzso More important, we showed that enhancing zzso zzso in zzso zzso at the recovery stage of zzso promoted cell survival and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data provide direct evidence that zzso zzso zzso enhances the survival and preserves function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
