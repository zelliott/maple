zzso zzso zzso an incurable zzso is reportedly an zzso zzso zzso zzso The pathological significance of zzso zzso in this zzso however, has remained zzso We investigated the biological functions of zzso in zzso Five zzso cell lines were analyzed for zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso Of them, 2 produced high levels of zzso 2 produced intermediate levels and 1 cell line showed no zzso All zzso cell lines used in this study expressed very small amounts of zzso zzso We compensated for this low level of zzso expression in zzso by adding zzso soluble zzso zzso to mediate the zzso zzso zzso together with zzso was found to promote cell growth of zzso and zzso zzso classified as high-level zzso producers in a zzso zzso Moreover, a humanized zzso zzso zzso capable of blocking zzso signaling suppressed the cell growth of zzso induced by zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso serves as an zzso growth factor in the development of zzso In addition, zzso stimulation increased the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in 4 out of 5 cell lines, and this induction was inhibited by zzso zzso The involvement of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso in both cell growth and zzso induction by zzso was verified by dominant negative zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso through the zzso pathway, zzso zzso could not inhibit the zzso cell growth observed in zzso and zzso We concluded that zzso growth does not occur via zzso zzso These results suggest that treatment with zzso zzso may constitute a potential molecular targeting therapy for zzso
