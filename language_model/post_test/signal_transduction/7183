We have generated transgenic mice that harbor humanized type I zzso receptors zzso enabling the study of type I human zzso zzso in zzso These zzso zzso zzso mice zzso transgenic zzso of zzso and zzso with the human zzso zzso being fused to zzso and zzso segments of mouse zzso zzso mouse melanoma cells harboring the zzso construct specifically bound zzso and were rendered sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso response gene zzso zzso mice were crossed with a transgenic strain expressing the zzso reporter gene under the control of the zzso zzso promoter zzso Both the zzso and zzso mice were responsive to all zzso tested, inclusive of zzso zzso and a human zzso termed zzso The mice displayed zzso zzso responses to zzso injection, as assessed by measuring the expression of zzso zzso Our studies also demonstrated a weak zzso of zzso mouse zzso response, especially after high dose administration of zzso In sharp contrast to data published for humans, our zzso zzso demonstrate a very short-lived zzso response in mice, which is not enhanced by zzso zzso injections in comparison to other administration zzso With zzso differences between humans and mice taken into account, the zzso mice provides a convenient zzso zzso model to advance the study of human zzso
