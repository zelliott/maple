The small zzso zzso which regulates cell shape, is thought to contribute to zzso Recently, Citron was characterized as a zzso zzso This large protein contains a zzso zzso domain related to that of zzso another zzso zzso Both zzso Citron and zzso Citron zzso to the zzso zzso in dividing cells and to the zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of Citron deleted from its zzso sequence caused abnormal zzso specifically during zzso resulting in the formation of zzso zzso Cell shape, zzso intermediate zzso and zzso appeared essentially normal in these cells during zzso Thus, Citron is a zzso zzso that appears to function during zzso modulating its zzso zzso In brain, however, Citron is highly expressed in a subset of zzso as a zzso zzso that lacks a zzso domain, zzso This protein accumulates in zzso and associates to the zzso zzso via interaction with the zzso protein zzso suggesting that the function of Citron is specialized in the zzso
