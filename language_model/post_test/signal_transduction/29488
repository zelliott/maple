Diabetes zzso zzso is one of the independent risk factors for zzso zzso zzso Our previous study has indicated that zzso causes zzso structural zzso with zzso zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that the advanced zzso end products zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso which have been implicated in diabetic zzso are responsible for the zzso structural zzso 

Diabetes was induced by zzso (65 zzso zzso in zzso female zzso zzso When 24 weeks old, their zzso were subjected to zzso Western zzso and zzso The zzso value of zzso rats was significantly higher than that of control zzso zzso and zzso examinations revealed that the zzso of diabetic rats showed remarkable structural changes characterized by diffuse zzso zzso with abundant expressions of zzso and zzso tissue growth factor zzso which findings were also confirmed by Western zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was remarkably prevented by administration of an inhibitor of zzso formation, zzso along with reduction of zzso zzso 

zzso promoted zzso structural zzso via the zzso of the zzso system with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso formation could be a novel upstream therapeutic approach for zzso zzso zzso
