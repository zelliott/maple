Growth factor stimulation of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso neither nerve growth zzso zzso zzso zzso nor differentiation in zzso zzso zzso Instead, in zzso cells zzso activates zzso zzso Since one of the major differences between the zzso zzso zzso of these cell types is the expression of zzso in zzso cells, we compared the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso In zzso cells maintained in zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso whereas zzso was effectively zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso is thus dependent upon growth conditions, with zzso being resistant to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso These results were extended by studies of zzso zzso into which zzso had been introduced by zzso As in zzso cells, zzso was resistant to zzso by zzso in the presence of serum, whereas zzso was effectively zzso In addition, the expression of zzso rendered zzso cells resistant to the zzso effects of zzso on both growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso sensitive to zzso by zzso and that zzso expression can contribute to cell zzso differences in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the situation in zzso cells, zzso by itself did not stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative Ras zzso indicating that zzso acts on a target upstream of zzso Thus, it appears that a signaling component upstream of Ras is also require for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
