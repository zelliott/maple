In an effort to develop therapies for promoting neurological recovery after spinal zzso injury, much work has been done to identify the cellular and molecular factors that control zzso zzso within the injured central nervous zzso This review summarizes the current understanding of a number of the elements within the spinal zzso environment that inhibit zzso growth and outlines the factors that influence the zzso ability to zzso its zzso after zzso Recent insights in these areas have identified important molecular pathways that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention, raising hope for victims of spinal zzso zzso
