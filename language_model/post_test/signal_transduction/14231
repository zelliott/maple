The zzso protein zzso protein zzso 1 zzso is known to play an important role in learning and memory by zzso local and downstream aspects of synaptic zzso but how zzso activity is controlled in different forms of synaptic plasticity remains zzso We find that synaptic zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso leads to zzso of zzso through a mechanism involving zzso zzso at zzso by zzso zzso stimulation led to zzso degradation of the zzso regulator zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso of zzso of zzso We also found that neither zzso nor zzso were involved in the control of zzso activity in response to synaptic zzso zzso zzso Rather, the zzso regulatory zzso zzso formed a complex with zzso that was controlled by synaptic zzso Finally, we found that zzso was critical for the induction of long-term depression in primary zzso Our work fills a major gap regarding the regulation of zzso in synaptic zzso
