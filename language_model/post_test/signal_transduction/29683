It is here demonstrated that the set of gene expressions underlying the zzso balance in zzso can be zzso reset en masse by a single zzso Using zzso expression zzso coupled with zzso and zzso analysis, we show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso many signaling pathways in human zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to zzso many zzso zzso The result is a unique alignment between the direction of gene regulation and zzso zzso zzso further reveals the regulation of genes not zzso associated with zzso Our analysis of zzso genes shows complex zzso communications in an intricate signaling network that both zzso and extends on current understanding of the zzso zzso More generally, insights into the nature of genetic networking from the cell zzso and therapeutic perspectives are zzso
