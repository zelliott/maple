zzso zzso stimulates both zzso pumping and egg laying in zzso zzso Four distinct zzso receptors have been partially zzso but little is known about their function in zzso zzso exhibits most sequence identity to the zzso zzso receptors and couples to a stimulation of zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso However, many zzso zzso have low affinity for zzso zzso fails to stimulate zzso pumping and the firing of the zzso zzso in animals containing the putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, although pumping on bacteria is zzso in zzso animals, pumping is more zzso A similar failure to maintain zzso zzso on bacteria also was observed in zzso and zzso animals that contain putative zzso zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that zzso zzso although not essential for the zzso of pumping on bacteria, zzso zzso the zzso zzso also fails to stimulate egg laying in zzso zzso and zzso zzso animals, but only the zzso zzso double zzso exhibit an zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso zzso are rescued by the expression of full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso egg laying and zzso pumping in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of egg zzso but not zzso is abolished in zzso double zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is essential for the zzso stimulation of both egg laying and zzso zzso but that other signaling pathways can probably fulfill similar roles in zzso
