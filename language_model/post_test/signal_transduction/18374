zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most broadly active zzso potentially inducing zzso of all zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the regulation of zzso zzso and protein production in zzso cells by protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On stimulation of zzso cells with 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso increased to zzso the zzso level at 3 zzso and rapidly declined to zzso the zzso level at 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein production of human zzso cells were partially inhibited by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso increase was almost zzso when cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso Following zzso stimulation for 3 zzso subsequent addition of zzso D suppressed the rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso gene through de zzso protein synthesis and the rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso through de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso element binding proteins and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso
