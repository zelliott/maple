zzso of zzso zzso is crucial in zzso plants for controlling water loss and gaseous exchange with zzso While much is known of signaling for zzso opening induced by blue light and the role of hormones, little is known about the regulation of zzso closing in zzso The present study was aimed to verify their role in zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso from the leaves of zzso zzso were incubated in a defined medium in darkness for 1 h followed by a 1 h incubation in different test solutions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso separately and in zzso before zzso zzso were measured under the zzso In the dark zzso remained closed under treatments with zzso and zzso zzso but opened widely in the presence of zzso and zzso The opening effect was largely unaffected by supplementing the treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso except that opening was significantly inhibited by the latter in presence of zzso On the other hand, zzso could not override the closing effect of zzso at any zzso while a marginal opening of zzso was found when zzso zzso treatment was given together with zzso zzso zzso treatment opened zzso in the darkness while zzso maintained zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso strongly promoted zzso zzso A probable action of zzso in closing zzso of zzso zzso in dark has been zzso
