zzso zzso factor zzso is the major regulator of zzso zzso Studies in cell lines have established that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso contribute significantly to zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso However, it is unclear whether these zzso are equally important under more zzso zzso Here, we investigated how individual zzso zzso affect zzso responses of primary zzso zzso We generated zzso mice and zzso their bone zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were determined in primary colony zzso serial zzso and suspension zzso We show that removal of all zzso had no major influence on primary colony zzso However, adding back zzso strongly enhanced zzso responses, which was reverted by zzso of zzso zzso zzso which we found to be associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso had a negative effect on colony zzso After repetitive zzso the zzso capacities of cells expressing zzso gradually dropped compared with zzso The presence of zzso but also zzso and zzso both involved in zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso further reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly elevated the zzso abilities of zzso zzso resulting in a more than zzso increase of zzso cells over zzso after the fifth zzso These findings suggest that zzso in the zzso domain of zzso although zzso for zzso colony growth, recruit signaling mechanisms that regulate the maintenance and outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso
