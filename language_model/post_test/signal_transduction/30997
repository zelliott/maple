In previous zzso zzso expression zzso we identified 32 genes zzso putative zzso factors, signaling zzso and unknown proteins that are rapidly and robustly induced by zzso zzso light zzso zzso that they are the most likely to be direct targets of zzso signaling and to function in the primary zzso regulatory circuitry, we examined the impact of targeted zzso in these genes on the zzso zzso zzso process in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso of zzso and stimulation of zzso growth as diagnostic criteria for normal zzso we identified three major zzso response zzso Seven zzso lines displayed statistically zzso zzso zzso zzso in the two zzso suggesting disruption of normal zzso 13 zzso lines displayed significant defects either zzso in both zzso or in zzso only, suggesting global effects not directly related to zzso zzso and 12 zzso lines displayed no significant difference in zzso from the wild zzso Potential reasons for the high proportion of rapidly zzso genes apparently unnecessary for the zzso zzso are zzso One of the seven disrupted genes displaying a significant zzso zzso the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be necessary for rapid zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a regulatory function in the early zzso zzso zzso
