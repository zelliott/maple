zzso airways protect themselves from bacterial infection by using multiple defense mechanisms including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We asked whether airways might also target a key bacterial zzso communication system, zzso The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso uses two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to control production of zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso We found that differentiated human airway zzso zzso zzso zzso was selective for zzso with certain zzso side zzso and zzso was not zzso In addition, the capacity for zzso varied widely in different cell zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso activity rather than a zzso zzso These data suggest that the ability of human airway zzso to zzso zzso signal molecules could play a role in the innate defense against bacterial zzso
