As an uncommon cancer, zzso is very hard to treat with a low average survival rate zzso to its usual late detection and being highly zzso The link between zzso exposure and the development of zzso in humans is zzso zzso a zzso protein that is induced by transforming growth zzso in various human cell types, has been shown to be associated with zzso in various types of zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso expression is markedly suppressed in zzso zzso cells, while an zzso expression of zzso significantly suppresses zzso and progression in human zzso zzso zzso In order to delineate a potential role of zzso in zzso the molecular events that occur in zzso zzso we generated stable zzso zzso zzso from the zzso cell line zzso by using an zzso approach, and zzso created zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso cell line zzso in which zzso is zzso We observed that in the absence of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso cell lines exhibited an elevated proliferation rate, enhanced zzso efficiency, increased zzso growth, as well as an increased cellular protein synthesis rate as compared with their respective zzso Furthermore, cell cycle regulatory proteins zzso zzso were zzso a more active zzso signaling zzso was also detected in zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso may repress zzso zzso and progression via the zzso signaling zzso
