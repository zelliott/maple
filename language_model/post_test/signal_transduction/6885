The zzso of tissue stem cells from their zzso state represents the initial step in the complex process of organ zzso and tissue zzso While the identity and location of tissue stem cells are becoming known, how key regulators control the balance of zzso and zzso remains zzso The zzso hair is an ideal model system where hair cycling between growth and resting zzso is precisely regulated by zzso signaling zzso but how these events are coordinated to promote orderly signaling in a spatial and zzso manner remains zzso Here, we show that hair cycle timing depends on regulated stability of signaling zzso by the zzso zzso zzso application of partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity throughout the hair zzso zzso prevent the destruction of the key zzso signal zzso resulting in more rapid hair growth and dramatically shortened zzso We show that zzso induce excess zzso act similarly to the zzso zzso zzso and antagonize zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso thus represent a novel class of hair growth agents that act through zzso zzso the balance of stem cell zzso and zzso zzso
