The zzso of three key signal zzso components was indicated in rat heart tissue by zzso and zzso zzso It was shown that: zzso The zzso zzso receptors are localized along outer cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso but additionally at zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso was found along outer cell zzso of zzso and other cells of the heart and also inside the cells of the zzso space in close contact to the zzso envelope and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be associated mainly in zzso zzso especially at the zzso zzso endings located among the cardiac muscle zzso This was shown in parallel incubation with specific zzso zzso as a marker for these zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized along the zzso and the zzso zzso in normal zzso of rat and guinea pig zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso was also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso The reasons for this changed zzso need further zzso zzso of the zzso zzso within the molecular structure of the membrane or variation of the marker penetration remain to be zzso
