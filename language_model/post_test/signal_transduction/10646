Automatic tools to extract information from biomedical texts are needed to help researchers leverage the vast and increasing body of biomedical zzso While several biomedical relation extraction systems have been created and tested, little work has been done to zzso organize the extracted zzso zzso processes should consolidate multiple references to the same objects over various levels of zzso connect those references to other resources, and capture contextual zzso We propose a feature decomposition approach to relation zzso to support a zzso zzso zzso Our zzso zzso uses this approach to identify key features in extracted relation name zzso We show encouraging feature assignment accuracy and report substantial consolidation in a network of extracted zzso
