The tumor zzso and zzso factor zzso is a key zzso of cellular stress responses, and zzso of zzso can trigger zzso in many cell types, including zzso We found that this nuclear protein was significantly zzso when human zzso zzso cells were exposed to in zzso oxidized zzso fatty zzso To identify an oxidized zzso that zzso zzso zzso we conducted a screening of zzso zzso products in human zzso zzso cells and identified zzso zzso a recently identified zzso originating from the zzso of zzso zzso fatty zzso as a potential zzso of the zzso zzso We also found that ONE induced the zzso of zzso zzso which plays an essential role in zzso DNA damage signals by the zzso of zzso In addition, exposure of the cells to ONE resulted in an zzso of zzso proteins and in a significant zzso of zzso activities, suggesting that ONE acted on the zzso pathway, a regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso In addition, the observation that the zzso zzso response was associated with the induction of zzso suggested that ONE activated the zzso zzso mechanism via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, we observed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was accumulated in the spinal zzso motor zzso of patients with sporadic zzso lateral zzso These data may suggest the potential critical role for ONE in the induction of a zzso zzso program during zzso zzso
