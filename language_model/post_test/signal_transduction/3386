One of the main challenges in automatic controller synthesis is to develop methods that can successfully be applied for complex zzso The difficulty is increased even more in the case of settings with multiple interacting zzso We apply the artificial zzso hormone system zzso approach, which is inspired by the signaling network of zzso organisms, to control a system of several independently acting agents zzso The approach is designed for zzso artificial evolution in order to be zzso to complex modular zzso zzso The performance of zzso controllers is compared with zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso controllers are found to be better for zzso zzso We analyze the evolved controllers with regard to the usage of sensory zzso and the emerging zzso and we give a zzso dynamics zzso The zzso of evolved controllers to initial conditions far from the original conditions is investigated and found to be zzso Similarly, the performance of controllers scales well even with module numbers different from the original domain the controller was evolved zzso Two reference zzso of a similar controller approach are reported and shown to have zzso We discuss the related work and conclude by zzso the main contributions of our zzso
