To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the cellular zzso of zzso genes zzso on the zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso the human internal zzso zzso zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso infected cells were obtained by screening the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells infected with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso induced by serum zzso accompanied with decreased expression of zzso zzso detected by zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso were significantly enhanced in zzso cells infected with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso protein expression in cells infected with zzso promoted the zzso spontaneous zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso when cells were cultured with zzso fetal bovine serum zzso zzso These results zzso that the zzso protein has the ability to regulate zzso zzso in which the zzso of zzso zzso is possibly zzso To further identify the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso was used to inhibit zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso signaling zzso was zzso the effects that zzso of zzso protein inhibited zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the present work indicates that zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and this zzso effect is partly zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso
