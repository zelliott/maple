There is now clear evidence that signals can be generated when cells make zzso This happens when contacts are made with the zzso zzso with other cells or with experimental zzso It is shown that zzso signals are triggered in a variety of situations by the zzso of zzso zzso Such zzso occurs at zzso sites, and it is suggested that zzso molecules which are capable of lateral diffusion become trapped at developing zzso sites because their zzso bind to zzso of external zzso zzso generated by molecular zzso can influence cell spreading and zzso via familiar zzso zzso Although it is not yet possible to reconstruct with confidence the entire sequence of events between initial zzso zzso and zzso there is a lot of information which points to the identities of the molecular zzso I shall focus the discussion on the thin peripheral zzso extensions produced by cell types ranging from zzso to zzso nerve growth cones, and discuss the experimental evidence relating to their zzso architecture and zzso Finally I shall try to construct models of zzso consistent with the experimental data, and suggest how zzso zzso may be modulated by signals generated by clustered zzso zzso
