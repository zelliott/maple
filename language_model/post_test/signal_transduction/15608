zzso zzso are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in zzso zzso zzso zzso and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding zzso zzso zzso and the intricate working of the zzso zzso In this paper, we make a detailed comparison between the calcium zzso networks in zzso cells and those in zzso cardiac zzso This comparison covers not only the zzso structure and function of the networks but also includes existing knowledge on the measured and simulated network dynamics using mathematical zzso Surprisingly, most of the factors known in the zzso calcium zzso network are zzso and operate similarly in zzso cells, including cardiac zzso Moreover, the budding zzso zzso zzso is a simple zzso that zzso powerful genetic and zzso zzso Thus, exploring and understanding the calcium zzso system in zzso can provide a shortcut to help understand calcium zzso systems in zzso cardiac zzso In turn, this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac zzso and heart zzso
