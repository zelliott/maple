The roles of zzso proteins in determining cell fate characteristics have been described in many contexts during zzso zzso organ and tissue zzso and cancer zzso Although much of the accumulated work on these proteins involves their ability to zzso target genes when zzso by zzso zzso proteins can repress target genes in the absence of stabilized zzso By zzso zzso function, we have uncovered an important requirement for a zzso function of zzso proteins during early mouse zzso zzso zzso proceed through zzso to form zzso but they develop expanded and often duplicated zzso zzso structures, including zzso and zzso These zzso are preceded by zzso expression of zzso an zzso zzso gene involved in zzso zzso with a zzso reduction in zzso a marker for lateral zzso By contrast, expression of a zzso zzso reporter zzso is not zzso activated but is faithfully maintained in the primitive zzso Taken together, these data reveal a unique requirement for zzso zzso function in restricting induction of the zzso zzso
