Gap junctions are channels that connect the interiors of neighboring cells and are formed by the zzso zzso zzso A reduction in gap zzso zzso communication zzso often zzso with increased growth and zzso zzso zzso is a widely expressed zzso which can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and this reduces zzso However, zzso activates multiple zzso pathways such as the zzso and zzso zzso C, which can also zzso zzso and interrupt zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso function, binds zzso to suppress gap zzso zzso In sharp contrast, zzso of a different zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is not required for the zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso is actually required for the maintenance of gap zzso communication in normal cells with high zzso
