zzso zzso resonance zzso studies of the zzso protein zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso of zzso in solution changes upon binding of zzso allowing the protein to bind to target proteins existing in the red blood cell zzso In this study a zzso spin label, zzso attached to the single zzso zzso of zzso located in the first zzso domain, was used to monitor zzso zzso changes induced by interaction of zzso with zzso and subsequently with the red blood cell zzso The results show, relative to zzso a significant increase in the apparent zzso correlation time, zzso of the spin label when zzso was present in solution zzso less than zzso When zzso exposed to red blood cell membrane ghosts in the absence of zzso no significant difference in spin label motion was seen relative to solution, consistent with the idea that zzso is required for zzso to bind to skeletal zzso When zzso was added to zzso which was then exposed to zzso a highly significant increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso less than zzso relative to zzso exposed to ghosts was zzso This latter increase in zzso is significantly greater than that produced by the addition of zzso to zzso in solution zzso less than zzso The major interaction sites of zzso were found by zzso labeling and zzso on zzso to be on the principal skeletal zzso zzso zzso was also used to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was bound to the membrane skeleton in the presence of zzso On the opposite side of the zzso membrane a zzso was bound to the external zzso of Band 3, the major zzso protein of the zzso A highly significant increase in T of the zzso spin probe was found relative to the control system in which the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that electron zzso resonance zzso of zzso zzso can provide useful information about protein structure and function when in solution and when bound to zzso
