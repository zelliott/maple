The effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso oxide zzso oxide zzso cascade in zzso signal zzso was examined in the intact rat spinal zzso All rats were implanted with an zzso zzso zzso some were also implanted with an zzso zzso zzso The paw withdrawal zzso to radiant heat was used to assess zzso zzso The zzso protein expression in the spinal zzso zzso horn was examined by western zzso analysis and zzso activity zzso NO production in the zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso from 4 to 24 h after zzso zzso The zzso protein expression was induced at 4 h after zzso zzso injection, peaked at the 6th hour, and disappeared at 24 zzso The zzso activity showed a similar zzso change as the zzso protein zzso NO release increased by zzso to zzso between 4 and 12 zzso also with a peak at the 6th hour, after zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso zzso 1 h before zzso zzso injection prevented all the responses of zzso Neither zzso nor artificial zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso threshold and NO zzso These results demonstrate that zzso administration of zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso the zzso cascade in the rat spinal zzso On the basis of the present findings, we suggest that zzso administration of zzso zzso may have potential in the treatment of inflammatory and zzso pain zzso
