Loss of retinal zzso is one of the distinctive features of diabetic zzso zzso which is characterized by retinal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein 61 zzso and zzso tissue growth factor zzso are zzso expressed in the retinal zzso from the early stages of zzso but their effects on retinal zzso are zzso We show zzso that rat retinal zzso zzso exposed to advanced zzso products, an important zzso stimulus of diabetes, express increased levels of both zzso and zzso and zzso undergo zzso a form of zzso by loss of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and/or zzso zzso an zzso zzso to rat retinal zzso including decreased zzso protein levels at focal zzso points and formation of cortical zzso zzso When used as zzso for zzso attachment and compared with other zzso proteins zzso type IV zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins exhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed these effects, suggesting that zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso was zzso through the intrinsic zzso and involved the expression of genes that have been functionally grouped as zzso target zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a known target of zzso was increased in zzso zzso either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso had, at least in part, a protective effect against zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings support the involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso detachment and zzso implicating these proteins in the zzso of zzso
