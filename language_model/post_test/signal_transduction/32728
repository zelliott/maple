We compared several responses in zzso and collagen zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso and zzso of zzso stimulation zzso an zzso system of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to prevent zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso factor zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso the zzso of lipids in the zzso cycle and zzso of zzso zzso were studied as markers for zzso responses, exposure of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso + zzso and zzso were studied as final zzso zzso Clear differences between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso First, practically all zzso zzso induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso while a partial zzso was observed for zzso the zzso due to collagen alone was apparently zzso by zzso of zzso zzso the other responses to zzso were inhibited by increased levels of zzso independent of zzso zzso In contrast, only the zzso part of the zzso responses was inhibited by zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso by elevated zzso seen in zzso zzso seems to be due to removal of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso either by zzso or zzso The remaining activity is a pure collagen effect which is not affected by elevated levels of zzso
