zzso of the nucleus locus zzso zzso discharge with zzso bursts of activity superimposed on highly regular zzso discharge zzso zzso bursts are zzso by bottom-up input mechanisms involving zzso sensory stimuli and zzso decision making zzso whereas zzso rates largely zzso according to zzso levels and behavioral zzso Although it is generally believed that these two modes of activity zzso zzso information processing in zzso targets, the unique role of zzso versus zzso zzso output on signal processing in cells, zzso and neural networks of waking animals is not well zzso In the current study, simultaneous recordings of individual zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and barrel field zzso of conscious rats provided evidence that each mode of zzso output produces a unique zzso impact on single zzso responsiveness to zzso synaptic input and representations of sensory information across ensembles of simultaneously recorded zzso Each mode of zzso zzso specifically modulated the relationship between zzso intensity and the subsequent responses of individual zzso and neural zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso versus zzso modes of zzso discharge exert fundamentally different zzso effects on target zzso circuits within the zzso zzso zzso zzso As such, each mode of zzso output may zzso influence signal processing as a means of zzso zzso relevant neural zzso within this sensory zzso zzso the ability of the zzso system to zzso regulate neural responses and local circuit operations according to behavioral demands extends to other brain regions including those involved in higher cognitive zzso
