zzso is not only a central player involved in storage and release of energy, but also in regulation of energy metabolism in other zzso via zzso of peptides and zzso During the zzso of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, zzso are subjected to the increased levels of insulin, which may have a major impact on the zzso of zzso We have undertaken zzso zzso affinity tag zzso and zzso zzso approaches to identify and zzso zzso factors that are zzso zzso by zzso zzso with or without insulin zzso Combination of zzso and zzso results, there are 317 proteins predicted or zzso as zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso 179 proteins and 53 proteins were significantly zzso and zzso zzso A total of 77 reported zzso were zzso in our study, such as zzso zzso D, zzso C, zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis of these zzso confirmed the quantitative results from mass zzso and revealed individualized zzso patterns of these proteins by increasing insulin zzso In addition, 240 proteins were newly identified and zzso as zzso proteins from zzso zzso in our study, most of which were zzso upon insulin zzso Further comprehensive zzso analysis revealed that the zzso proteins in zzso zzso interaction zzso and zzso structure degradation zzso were significantly zzso by insulin zzso
