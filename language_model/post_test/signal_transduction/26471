zzso a zzso iron regulatory zzso plays a crucial role in iron zzso It is known that gender differences exist with respect to iron storage in the zzso however, the effects of sex steroid hormones on iron metabolism are not completely zzso We focused on the effects of the female sex hormone zzso on zzso zzso First, zzso zzso and zzso mice were employed to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso expression in an in zzso zzso zzso expression was decreased in the zzso of zzso mice compared to the zzso zzso In zzso mice, bone zzso zzso zzso a regulator of zzso was also found to be zzso in the liver, whereas zzso zzso an iron export zzso was zzso in the zzso Both serum and liver iron zzso were elevated in zzso mice relative to their zzso in zzso zzso In in zzso studies, zzso zzso increased the zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso instead, zzso expression was increased by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit zzso actions with zzso coupled zzso 30 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso was abolished by zzso zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso supplementation restored reduced zzso zzso and zzso expression and reversed the zzso of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso In contrast, serum zzso was elevated in zzso mice, which was reversed in these mice with zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is involved in zzso expression via a zzso zzso providing new insight into the role of zzso in iron zzso
