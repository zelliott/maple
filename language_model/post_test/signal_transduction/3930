zzso influx through zzso receptors and zzso calcium channels zzso mediates an array of zzso processes in zzso and may also contribute to zzso zzso and death in neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke and severe zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is expressed in zzso wherein it may mediate zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured from mice lacking zzso exhibited decreased zzso filament zzso and enhanced zzso influx after exposure to zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that currents through zzso receptors and zzso were enhanced in zzso zzso lacking zzso as a result of decreased current zzso zzso currents were similar in zzso containing and lacking zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso to zzso toxicity was greater in cells lacking zzso zzso damage to zzso zzso zzso was exacerbated in adult zzso zzso These findings identify novel roles for zzso in controlling zzso feedback regulation of zzso influx and in zzso injury zzso The data further suggest roles for zzso and the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso events that involve zzso of zzso receptors and zzso
