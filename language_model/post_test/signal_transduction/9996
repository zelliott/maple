The zzso zzso acid zzso regulates zzso important zzso processes and stress zzso Previously, we reported on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are hypersensitive to zzso during zzso and early zzso Among them, zzso zzso zzso showed the strongest zzso zzso In this study, we found that the zzso gene is identical to zzso which encodes a protein zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has been reported to be involved in the zzso response on the basis of results obtained by zzso approaches, its zzso relevance in the zzso response has not been clarified zzso We demonstrate in zzso and in zzso that the zzso zzso zzso causes the loss of zzso activity, providing concrete confirmation that this zzso functions as a negative regulator in zzso zzso Furthermore, we compared the effects of disruption zzso of eight structurally related zzso genes of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and found that the zzso zzso of zzso had the strongest zzso hypersensitivity during zzso but it did not display any significant zzso in adult zzso zzso analysis clearly showed that zzso is the most active among those zzso genes in zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a major role among zzso in the zzso response in seeds and that the functions of those zzso zzso but their unique zzso or zzso expression zzso distinct and indispensable zzso functions in the zzso zzso
