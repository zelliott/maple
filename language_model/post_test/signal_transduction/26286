Recent studies have demonstrated that the function of zzso is not restricted to the support of zzso zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso activity in the zzso zzso actively participate in zzso formation and brain information processing by releasing or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the central nervous system, zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso activity as well as in controlling other neurotransmitter systems such as zzso zzso and zzso Ethanol zzso increases zzso zzso levels, which regulates the zzso and zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso signaling is also involved in the zzso of major zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso through zzso zzso which regulates the effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso release regulates zzso or synaptic zzso zzso zzso then exerts its function through several zzso receptors and regulates zzso levels in the zzso This review presents novel findings on how zzso zzso particularly zzso signaling and zzso zzso activity involving zzso zzso 1 zzso are implicated in alcoholism and sleep zzso
