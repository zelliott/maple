zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso inhibited by more than 90 percent its response to the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso member of the regulators of zzso signaling zzso protein family of zzso proteins zzso zzso both decreased the affinity of zzso GAP for the zzso form of zzso by at least 90 percent and decreased the maximum rate of zzso zzso zzso was reversed by removal of the zzso group by zzso zzso of zzso also inhibited its response to the GAP activity of zzso protein zzso another zzso zzso and zzso of zzso inhibited its response to zzso The extent of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated roughly with their intrinsic GAP activities for the zzso target used in the zzso zzso zzso is thus a major zzso of zzso zzso after its stimulation by zzso and may be a general mechanism for zzso or zzso zzso zzso
