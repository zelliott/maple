Although the role of zzso in T cell zzso is firmly established, the mechanisms by which it exerts its zzso actions are less zzso In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of zzso from subsequent actions of zzso such as zzso on T cell zzso Here, we report a model of zzso zzso using zzso plus the natural zzso zzso that resulted in very limited stimulation of zzso as evidenced by both zzso production and zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso effects on both zzso and zzso but not on zzso or the intact zzso zzso In addition, T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking zzso to both zzso and the zzso zzso demonstrating that this form of zzso by zzso was independent of zzso We also investigated the effects of stimulating T cell blasts with zzso alone and found that there was a limited requirement for zzso in this zzso We conclude that zzso zzso can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the absence of zzso which is driven by a soluble factor independent of zzso zzso
