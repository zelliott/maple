zzso zzso signals must be precisely integrated in order to elicit specific biological zzso During zzso of muscle and cardiac zzso from clusters of equivalent cells in the zzso embryonic zzso the zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso growth factor zzso as an zzso cellular determination zzso while lateral zzso zzso by zzso zzso this zzso A critical balance between these signals must be achieved to enable one cell of an zzso group to segregate as a zzso while its neighbors assume a zzso zzso We have investigated whether these opposing signals directly interact with each other, and we have examined how they are integrated by the responding cells to specify their unique zzso Our findings reveal that Ras and zzso do not function zzso rather, we have uncovered several modes of zzso between these zzso Ras zzso zzso its zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso We show that Delta and zzso then zzso to zzso block a positive zzso feedback loop that zzso a zzso Ras zzso This feedback loop is characterized by zzso zzso of zzso components of both the zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso In turn, zzso zzso in zzso zzso its own expression and simultaneously suppresses both Delta and zzso levels, thereby reinforcing a zzso zzso zzso These zzso interactions combine to generate the signal thresholds that are essential for proper zzso of zzso and zzso from groups of initially equivalent zzso
