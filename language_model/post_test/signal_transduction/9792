Human embryonic stem cells can be differentiated along different zzso providing the possibility of a precise analysis of genes profiles associated with specific zzso zzso gene expression profiling between differentiated and zzso cells provides lists of potential actors in this zzso This zzso however, genes that are specifically associated with development and others that are over expressed because of zzso differentiation zzso As a way to establish gene profiles associated with the neural and/or to the zzso commitments of human embryonic stem cells more precisely, we have carried out a zzso zzso We first performed a zzso analysis of gene profiles of each of these lineages as compared to the zzso zzso Then, we extended the analysis by comparing the 2 sets of results with each zzso This strategy has allowed us to eliminate large numbers of genes that were over expressed in both sets of results and to uniquely associate different gene networks with either the neural or the zzso zzso
