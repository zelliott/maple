zzso variations of pathological changes were observed in the zzso zzso Gene expressions vary depending on the zones in the zzso For example, the expressions of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso were enhanced in the superficial zone whereas the expression of zzso proteins enhanced at the deep zzso Many factors such as mechanical stress, aging, genetic background, inflammation and zzso changes of zzso influence the zzso of zzso suggesting the involvement of many regulatory mechanisms in the gene zzso However, discoveries of regulatory factors that provide common pathways for the various phenomenon observed in the zzso cartilage suggest the interaction and zzso of these important factors to conduct the pathology of degenerative zzso
