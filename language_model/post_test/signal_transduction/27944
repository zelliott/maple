The cloning of numerous orphan members from the zzso family of G zzso receptors implies the existence of many as yet undiscovered zzso and zzso Recently, new technologies were developed to isolate natural zzso for orphan zzso using the zzso as a biological sensor during the zzso zzso This manuscript will present the concept and technology of an approach which starts from a cloned zzso to ultimately describe the zzso functions of the zzso zzso This strategy zzso the classical order of biomedical research and was thus termed zzso zzso The first natural zzso isolated by this strategy is a zzso with significant similarity to the zzso peptides and has been named zzso zzso or zzso zzso Evidence for characterizing zzso as a genuine zzso will be zzso zzso is zzso derived from a larger precursor protein which may zzso additional zzso zzso Since its discovery, a large number of studies have described numerous zzso functions of zzso Because of its relation to the zzso system, much attention has been focused on the involvement of zzso in zzso sometimes with controversial zzso However, the pharmacological profile of the zzso system suggests a clear separation from the zzso The discovery of zzso and the subsequent analyses of its zzso functions is an example which has already been followed by the identification of two other novel zzso The orphan zzso strategy holds a lot of promises for the zzso era, helping to fill the vast amount of sequence data with zzso
