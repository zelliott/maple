zzso receptors alter membrane zzso and synaptic efficacy by generating zzso signals that ultimately change the properties of zzso zzso Through expression studies in zzso zzso and zzso cells, we found that the G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses a cloned delayed zzso zzso channel through a zzso involving zzso C zzso and direct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso cells revealed that a similar zzso zzso zzso links zzso G zzso receptors to suppression of the native zzso zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism by which zzso and hormones may regulate a specific type of zzso channel that is widely expressed in the zzso brain and zzso
