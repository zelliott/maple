The zzso arrested zzso zzso zzso resumes development only after encountering specific zzso cues during zzso These cues activate a signaling zzso that culminates in the resumption of zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the resumption of feeding and the release of zzso products required for zzso The zzso stage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso arrested stage analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae exit zzso arrest in response to environmental cues that indicate favorable conditions for reproduction and zzso Because of the similarity between zzso recovery and zzso exit from zzso provides a model for zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso has been implicated in controlling exit from zzso arrest in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the role of insulin signaling in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was tested for its effect on in zzso zzso using the resumption of feeding as a marker for zzso zzso prevented feeding in zzso zzso zzso larvae zzso with host serum zzso and a zzso the zzso zzso zzso or the cell permeable zzso zzso Similar results were seen with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that an zzso zzso mediates zzso in zzso larvae, as in zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso inhibitor acts downstream of the zzso and zzso signaling steps in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the release of zzso products associated with zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso These results provide additional support for the zzso zzso as the primarily zzso for zzso to zzso in zzso zzso
