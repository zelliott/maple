zzso cell death zzso of T cells is one of the major mechanisms of peripheral zzso The regulation of zzso by zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we report that zzso in zzso T cells is significantly reduced compared with that in zzso T zzso This impaired zzso zzso with the failure to induce degradation of cellular zzso zzso enhancement of zzso and cellular zzso degradation requires a zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso these effects of zzso could be blocked by a zzso zzso zzso and addition of zzso could completely restore the defective zzso in zzso T zzso Furthermore, zzso regulates the T cell thresholds for zzso signaling during zzso These data suggest that zzso promotes zzso via an zzso zzso
