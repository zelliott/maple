We show that zzso degree zzso in observed zzso zzso of complex networks can emerge as a consequence of the exponential expansion of hidden zzso zzso zzso statistics provides a physical interpretation of zzso distances as energies of zzso The hidden space zzso affects the zzso of the degree distribution, while zzso is a function of zzso We zzso the zzso into the zzso plane and find a remarkable zzso between the embedding and our zzso zzso Besides proving our model zzso this embedding may be used for zzso with only local information, which holds significant promise for improving the performance of zzso zzso
