Systems biology aims to study the properties of biological systems in terms of the properties of their molecular zzso This occurs frequently by a process of mathematical zzso The first step in this zzso process is to unravel the interaction structure of biological systems from experimental zzso Previously, an zzso for gene network zzso from gene expression zzso data was zzso Here, the zzso is extended by using zzso with subset zzso The performance of the zzso is extensively evaluated on a set of data produced with gene network models at different levels of simulated experimental zzso zzso with subset selection zzso the previously stated zzso inverse approach in the presence of experimental zzso Furthermore, this zzso approach enables us to deal with zzso that is, when not all genes are zzso The results on incomplete data sets show that the new method performs well at higher number of zzso even when noise levels are zzso At lower number of zzso although still being able to recover the majority of the connections, less confidence can be placed in the recovered zzso
