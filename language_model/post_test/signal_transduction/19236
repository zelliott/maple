Natural zzso is achieved by polarized release of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso for zzso polarization and zzso can be zzso in zzso cells, which raises the question of their respective sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso on the human cell line zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso cell clones that expressed zzso receptors of matching zzso zzso To test zzso of signals for polarization and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso with either zzso or zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not fully zzso suggesting that other zzso zzso which occur with zzso cells, contribute to zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso on zzso cells zzso zzso or zzso were sufficient to block zzso polarization induced by either zzso or zzso even during zzso zzso zzso Similarly, expression of a zzso for zzso on zzso cells inhibited zzso polarization but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso is the preferred target of zzso receptors in zzso zzso
