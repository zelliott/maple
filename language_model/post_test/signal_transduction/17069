zzso has an important role in maintaining tissue zzso in cellular stress responses such as zzso zzso zzso stress, and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 51 zzso is a member of the zzso zzso domain family and was first identified as a zzso gene in zzso zzso cell zzso However, its zzso function remains zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell death in mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso expression was highly increased by zzso stress zzso In response to zzso stress, the production of zzso zzso oxygen species was significantly enhanced in zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso promotes zzso cell death in zzso and these results indicate that zzso has a protective role in zzso zzso cell death in zzso
