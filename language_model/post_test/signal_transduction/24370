zzso of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso (by zzso of its zzso zzso a zzso zzso are associated with the growth of zzso prostate tumor cells in the bone zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocks the zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso given alone or with zzso zzso on tumor growth in a mouse model of prostate cancer zzso 

Human prostate cancer zzso cells were injected into the zzso of male nude zzso Three days later the mice (20 per zzso were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of treatment with oral and injected water zzso daily oral zzso weekly injected zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso in bone and the surrounding muscles were then harvested and analyzed by zzso western zzso (for zzso zzso zzso (for expression of zzso zzso and double zzso (to identify zzso cells and zzso tumor zzso Growth of bone zzso was monitored by digital zzso Bone zzso from control mice were used to establish short-term cell cultures for analysis of zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso cells cultured from bone zzso and treated in zzso with zzso had less zzso zzso than zzso zzso In control mice, bone zzso expressed high levels of zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso in the adjacent zzso did zzso zzso zzso was present on the surface of zzso cells within the bone zzso but not in zzso cells of zzso zzso Mice treated with zzso or zzso plus zzso had a lower tumor zzso smaller tumors, and less bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso than mice treated with water or zzso alone zzso for zzso Mice treated with zzso or zzso plus zzso had less zzso zzso on tumor cells and zzso zzso cells, less tumor cell zzso statistically significantly more zzso tumor cells (all zzso and fewer zzso zzso cells zzso than control zzso 

zzso cells appear to express zzso zzso when they are exposed to tumor cells that express zzso Using zzso to inhibit zzso zzso may, especially in combination with zzso produce substantial therapeutic effects against prostate cancer bone zzso
