Over the past 10 years, molecular cloning has revealed the presence of 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be subdivided in seven zzso Except for the zzso zzso which are zzso zzso channels, all zzso receptors belong to the zzso of zzso zzso The large zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to be a direct result of the evolutionary age of the zzso zzso zzso information on zzso zzso receptors is currently available for several zzso species as well as for a limited number of zzso species zzso zzso The aim of this review is to give an overview of all cloned zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso of zzso receptors with specific emphasis on the pharmacological and signaling properties of the receptors upon expression in several zzso expression zzso
