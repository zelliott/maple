Although antipsychotic drugs can reduce psychotic behavior within a few hours, full efficacy is not achieved for several weeks, zzso that there may be zzso short-term changes in zzso function, which are consolidated into long-lasting zzso We showed that the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, a zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to activate the zzso translation zzso zzso by the zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso In primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso protein zzso zzso mass zzso revealed marked changes in the pattern of protein synthesis after acute exposure of cultured zzso zzso to haloperidol, including increased abundance of zzso proteins and proteins associated with translation zzso These zzso changes coincided with increased zzso complexity of zzso that was diminished by zzso of downstream zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso translation enhances zzso complexity in response to zzso In zzso we observed rapid zzso changes with a zzso increase in the abundance of zzso proteins in cortical zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest a mechanism for both the acute and long-term actions of zzso
