Here we report an unexpected role for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as an inhibitor of the zzso zzso reaction that controls zzso signaling during zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that the zzso domain of zzso regulates the activity of zzso zzso a zzso that degrades zzso through the following molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso has similar affinities for its zzso zzso zzso and for its competitive inhibitor zzso which is resistant to zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso reaction zzso were all in the zzso M range, consistent with a zzso role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso is also a natural inhibitor of zzso a zzso zzso of medical zzso Furthermore, mouse zzso inhibited zzso suggesting a wider role for this molecular zzso
