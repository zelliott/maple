The zzso gene product is required for several outer membrane transport processes in zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso was zzso and found to be similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso and includes an unusual segment consisting of multiple zzso zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to this segment has been used to raise zzso zzso zzso was shown to be associated with the zzso zzso apparently anchored via a single zzso zzso zzso zzso accessibility studies, and the use of a series of zzso zzso showed that the rest of the zzso protein is zzso zzso export of zzso is not accompanied by zzso of the zzso signal zzso In the accompanying paper, we show that zzso interacts directly with the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso must span the zzso providing a link between the zzso membrane and receptors in the outer zzso On the basis of these data, and those published by other laboratories, we propose a model zzso zzso serves as a zzso linkage that, by zzso protein zzso changes from the zzso membrane across the zzso acts as a means of zzso energy to outer membrane transport zzso Such a mechanism has general implications for signal zzso within and between zzso
