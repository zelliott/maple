zzso and zzso are complex phenomena that involve the interplay of several growth factors and zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice, not only zzso but also zzso is zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso is involved in zzso remains zzso 

To examine how important the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is in zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice, we crossed the zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso mice to generate double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit a remarkable decrease in zzso as well as zzso in subcutaneous zzso To address the mechanism underlying the decrease in zzso we investigated the recruitment of zzso cells into the zzso The recruitment of zzso zzso driven by zzso was reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice that received zzso bone zzso showed a reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with those in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signaling promotes zzso as well as zzso mainly by increasing bone zzso zzso zzso
