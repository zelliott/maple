The zzso zzso surrounding the egg and zzso zzso is required for in zzso fertility and early zzso zzso models of zzso recognition need to take into account the ability of zzso to bind to zzso eggs, but not to zzso zzso For the last two decades, investigators have sought to identify an individual protein or zzso side chain as the zzso zzso However, recent genetic data in mice are more consistent with the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso rather than a single protein (or zzso determining zzso zzso The mouse and human zzso zzso contain three zzso zzso zzso zzso and, following zzso zzso is zzso zzso The replacement of zzso mouse proteins with human zzso zzso or both does not alter zzso specificity of zzso binding or prevent zzso Surprisingly, human zzso is not zzso following zzso and intact zzso zzso with persistent zzso binding to zzso zzso Taken together, these data support a model in which the zzso status of zzso zzso the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso and determines whether zzso bind zzso or do not zzso
