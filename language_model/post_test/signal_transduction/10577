zzso T cells, particularly those of the zzso 1 zzso zzso are important zzso in zzso diseases, such as zzso disease, and in controlling infections with zzso zzso Thus, it is plausible that impaired zzso zzso zzso immunity might contribute to the low zzso of acute zzso disease after zzso transplantation of zzso stem cells using zzso blood zzso compared with adult sources of zzso stem zzso In support of this hypothesis, we found that CB zzso zzso T cells had reduced zzso and impaired early zzso differentiation compared with adult peripheral blood zzso zzso T cells after stimulation by zzso zzso cells derived from adult zzso Early zzso polarization was dependent on zzso and zzso and CB zzso T zzso cell zzso had impaired expression of both zzso CB zzso zzso T cells had low zzso levels of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso and, after zzso zzso reduced zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 4 zzso zzso compared with adult peripheral blood zzso T zzso Lastly, zzso protein zzso a marker for regulatory zzso zzso T cells, was lower for zzso zzso T cells of CB compared with those of adult peripheral blood, which argued against increased zzso activity as a mechanism for the decreased zzso differentiation of CB zzso T zzso Together, these intrinsic limitations in zzso zzso and zzso differentiation may impair the ability of T cells in CB and the zzso to respond to zzso or infectious zzso
