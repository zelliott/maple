In the vascular system, elevated levels of zzso oxygen species zzso produce zzso stress and zzso to the development of zzso zzso it is important to understand the systems producing and those scavenging vascular zzso Here, we analyzed the zzso capability of zzso zzso in different vascular cells and its involvement in the zzso zzso stress zzso known as the unfolded protein zzso 

zzso real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso revealed that zzso is equally expressed in vascular cells and appears in 2 distinct zzso zzso By determining zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso markedly reduced zzso whereas its zzso increased zzso levels zzso Using microscopic and zzso methods, we found zzso mainly in the nuclear membrane and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was induced at both the promoter and protein levels by zzso zzso stress zzso unfolded protein zzso This zzso may promote both zzso and survival zzso zzso zzso reduced unfolded protein zzso zzso stress and unfolded protein zzso zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso represents an zzso defense mechanism against vascular zzso stress and unfolded protein zzso cell death, thereby contributing to the prevention of zzso
