Little is known about the signaling mechanisms that determine the highly regular patterning of the zzso zzso into zzso and zzso With the use of mouse models, we show that bone zzso protein zzso expression occurs exclusively in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells respond to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by transgenic expression of zzso results in the formation of numerous zzso zzso units perpendicular to the zzso zzso These changes zzso the zzso zzso of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile zzso zzso including the frequent occurrence of zzso zzso Many zzso cases are known to harbor zzso in zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso signaling zzso de zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso
