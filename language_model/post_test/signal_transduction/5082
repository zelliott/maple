Numerous reports have demonstrated that zzso regulatory T cells zzso from individuals with a range of human zzso diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control zzso zzso responses when compared with zzso control zzso zzso dysfunction could be a primary, zzso event or may result from zzso in the immune system during disease zzso zzso in genes associated with zzso function, such as zzso zzso a higher risk of zzso zzso Although this suggests a primary role for defective zzso in zzso a link between zzso gene zzso and zzso function has not been zzso We addressed this by examining the impact of an zzso zzso associated with type 1 diabetes on zzso fitness and zzso zzso Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any zzso effects of zzso We demonstrated that the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with diminished zzso responsiveness in zzso zzso T cells, as measured by zzso of zzso and is associated with lower levels of zzso expression by zzso and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of zzso zzso T zzso These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which zzso in the zzso gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon zzso to zzso and inflammatory zzso
