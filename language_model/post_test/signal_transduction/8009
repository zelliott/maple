To determine the relationship between pain intensity and the rate of fluid flow through zzso in human zzso 

The experiments were carried out on 16 zzso in 13 human subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso was exposed at the tip of the zzso zzso etched with acid and covered with zzso A series of 5 s zzso pressure stimuli between 400 zzso above and 400 zzso below atmospheric were applied to the zzso in steps of 50 zzso The subject indicated the intensity of any pain produced on a visual analogue scale zzso The fluid flow through zzso during application of the same stimuli was measured in zzso within 3 h after tooth zzso 

The median pain threshold with negative zzso stimuli was zzso zzso and, with positive pressure zzso 200 zzso which corresponded to zzso fluid flow rates of zzso zzso zzso exposed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the median pressure and the mean rate of flow at threshold with negative pressures were significantly lower than with positive zzso The zzso relating zzso score to stimulus intensity were similar with both negative and positive zzso 

The sensory zzso mechanism for pain in human teeth is more sensitive to outward than inward flow through zzso zzso The difference in sensitivity was however much less than that of the zzso receptors in the cat, which respond very much more strongly to negative than positive pressure zzso
