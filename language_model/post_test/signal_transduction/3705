The zzso requirements for the generation of a zzso response were examined using zzso zzso zzso with Con zzso In agreement with previous reports, zzso alone can generate a strong zzso zzso To determine whether zzso was required for this response, we added either a zzso zzso against zzso or an zzso of zzso function, zzso Both zzso and zzso were found to inhibit the generation of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso with these data, zzso zzso was found to zzso with zzso particularly, when zzso was added at levels unable to generate a zzso response zzso This synergistic response was observed whether zzso was added at the beginning of culture along with zzso or after the first day to cultures initiated with zzso Likewise, the combination of zzso plus zzso evoked a strong synergistic response when cultures were initiated with zzso and zzso was added initially or after the first day of zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso alone did not generate a zzso In contrast to these data showing that zzso was able to signal late in culture, zzso inhibited zzso generation in response to zzso only when added at the beginning of zzso These results imply that zzso induction involves a crucial early zzso zzso which once delivered permits cells to respond to a later zzso zzso These data are consistent with the idea that free circulating zzso could inhibit the generation of zzso by zzso the early zzso zzso zzso
