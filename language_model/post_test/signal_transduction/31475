Growth zzso signal zzso zzso can be regulated zzso by signaling zzso such as zzso zzso The four zzso zzso family members are zzso zzso that can zzso or zzso numerous growth zzso signaling zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso and zzso associate with zzso the major structural protein of zzso Like zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that all four zzso zzso family members physically interact with zzso The C zzso of zzso is the major zzso site, whereas zzso binds zzso via its zzso zzso zzso A single point zzso in this domain results in loss of zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the various zzso zzso differ dramatically in their cooperation with zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and that such cooperation is also highly dependent on the type of growth factor investigated and on cell zzso Together, the data suggest that the zzso interaction zzso signaling in a growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso
