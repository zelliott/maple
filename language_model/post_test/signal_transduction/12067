The zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso in the zzso zzso family with important roles in regulating zzso organization, cell migration, and zzso The zzso zzso family comprises six members subdivided into two groups: Group I, represented by zzso 2, and 3, and Group II, represented by zzso 4, 5, and 6, based on sequence and structural zzso Individual zzso zzso were found to be zzso and amplified in a variety of human zzso and in zzso and in zzso studies using genetically engineered systems as well as zzso tool compounds have suggested therapeutic utility of zzso as zzso zzso The identification of potent and zzso zzso zzso zzso has proven challenging, likely caused by the openness and unique plasticity of the zzso site of zzso zzso Progress in achieving increased zzso selectivity has been achieved with certain zzso but at the expense of increased molecular zzso zzso zzso such as zzso leverage the unique Group I zzso zzso domain for selective zzso and this approach might provide an outlet to evade the zzso selectivity challenges observed with zzso zzso zzso
