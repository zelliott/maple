The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso from a wide variety of both zzso and zzso zzso It functions as a neurotransmitter and plays an important role in regulation of cell proliferation and zzso zzso exerts its effects through binding to specific surface membrane zzso 

The article presents a zzso review of the zzso zzso zzso family, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based upon zzso expression in neuroendocrine zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Five different human zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and their genes zzso The receptors are zzso zzso and binding activates several different signal zzso zzso have a characteristic expression pattern both in the central nervous system and in peripheral zzso Many zzso cell lines as well as the majority of human zzso express zzso zzso usually more than one zzso The frequency of expression is especially high in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has become an important diagnostic tool for staging of zzso zzso zzso and it may also predict sensitivity to treatment with zzso zzso These are regarded as the main choice for symptomatic treatment of hormone related syndromes related to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso effects of zzso zzso in patients have been rather zzso More zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has more recently been carried out with survival zzso Gene therapy has shown promising results in animal zzso 

Increased molecular understanding of the zzso family and especially how the receptors are being regulated will probably lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against zzso
