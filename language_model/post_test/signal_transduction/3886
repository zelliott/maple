F3 is a zzso regulated adhesive zzso expressed by zzso of central and peripheral zzso which mediates zzso growth and zzso via zzso and zzso with zzso or zzso zzso We previously reported on the characterization of the F3 gene zzso zzso region in which we identified promoter and zzso zzso Here, we report on the functional organization of the F3 gene regulatory zzso We show that the F3 promoter is built of zzso arranged positive and negative elements scattered through the zzso zzso region of the F3 gene and the 1st zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso expression of F3 appears to be governed by elements located in the most zzso promoter region which includes a zzso zzso In zzso zzso all these zzso elements bind nuclear zzso three of which interact with the identified zzso element while a single species interacts with sequences located within zzso zzso Some of these proteins are also specifically expressed within the brain, indicating that they could zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso located immediately upstream of the cell zzso zzso and within zzso 0 are responsible for regulation of F3 expression by zzso and zzso zzso
