zzso zzso zzso leaves produce a burst of zzso zzso I) between 1 and 15 zzso then of zzso and zzso zzso zzso between 1 and 3 zzso Our previous results suggest zzso oxygen species zzso may provide signals to zzso early (6 zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were used to zzso how the suppression of zzso production at different time points by zzso zzso affects the expression of zzso Rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso of phase I zzso production suppressed the differential regulation of 7 out of 19 zzso which were consequently classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso of only phase II zzso production failed to suppress the wound regulation of 18 out of 19 zzso but led to the altered expression of 1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso The data indicates Group B proteins are alternatively targeted via the zzso of phase II zzso zzso This reinforces an important role for phase I zzso zzso in the early wound response, but indicates that this response is partly regulated by phase II of the zzso zzso This data provides an informed basis for further zzso studies aimed at identifying early activated zzso zzso components in wounded zzso
