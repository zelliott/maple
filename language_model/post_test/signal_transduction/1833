The requirements for zzso tolerance induction in favor of memory T cell development are poorly zzso Although two signals zzso and zzso are necessary to drive effective T cell zzso expansion, few memory T cells remain after the response zzso The zzso zzso can increase numbers of zzso zzso T cells, but its mechanism of action is not zzso In this report, it is shown that zzso when combined with zzso zzso profoundly enhances T cell survival in zzso This survival does not appear to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor is it dependent on the zzso factor zzso zzso However, in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso T cells was comparable to that of zzso T cells, yet their early zzso in the zzso zzso was severely reduced unless the mice were treated with zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, we found that zzso of two different zzso signals, zzso and zzso could not substitute for zzso in rescuing T cells from peripheral zzso Perhaps surprisingly, these data show that zzso delivers a zzso different signal than multiple zzso zzso
