The zzso zzso T zzso protein is a likely component of the zzso signal that plays a crucial role in regulating the transition from zzso to zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of full-length zzso and the corresponding zzso clones zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso of London plane zzso zzso zzso Two genes with high sequence identity were isolated zzso but 34 different transcript products were identified, zzso 21 zzso forms produced by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the alternative zzso forms of zzso varied according to tissue type and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected throughout adult trees, whereas in juvenile trees they were only detected in dormant zzso zzso In adult trees, levels of the various alternative zzso zzso forms were related to flower development stage and tree zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso form of zzso in tobacco and zzso developed multiple altered zzso notably early flowering and zzso of zzso zzso The evidence in this study indicates that complex alternative processing of zzso transcripts in zzso may be associated with multiple regulatory roles, including initiation of zzso flower development, zzso dominance, tree dormancy and dormancy zzso
