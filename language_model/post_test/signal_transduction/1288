A recent publication describes a novel mechanism by which a zzso zzso might be zzso These results concern a zzso of zzso expression along the zzso axis of the chick zzso with a high level of transcripts at the tail, fading off in an anterior zzso zzso for zzso zzso it is shown that zzso is transcribed only in the tail cells and that the zzso of zzso transcripts is produced by growth and zzso zzso This possible mechanism of zzso formation can operate only when growth is involved, as is the case in many examples including the zzso axis formation of zzso but is not in some other zzso
