The zzso is susceptible to diverse insults during human zzso The expression of the protein zzso zzso gene 1 zzso is regulated during cell zzso zzso and in response to zzso Nevertheless, the function of this protein in humans remains zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso is zzso in hypoxic primary human zzso and that zzso zzso zzso response to zzso We initially demonstrated that the expression of zzso is enhanced in primary human zzso exposed to zzso zzso we found a similar increase in zzso expression in zzso samples derived from either singleton zzso complicated by zzso growth restriction or from zzso twin gestation where one twin exhibited growth zzso Having established efficient zzso zzso of primary human zzso we zzso zzso in zzso which resulted in enhanced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso short interfering zzso zzso of zzso diminished zzso viability and zzso zzso with these results, zzso reduced the expression level of zzso in zzso cultured in standard or hypoxic zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was regulated by the activity of zzso zzso protein 1), which promotes cell zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso interacts with zzso signaling to zzso hypoxic injury in human zzso
