We present a system, zzso zzso zzso Analysis in zzso for analysis of biological data in the context of zzso zzso supports data zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso but, more importantly, addresses the problems of zzso recognition and zzso zzso 

Given a set of genes hypothesized to be part of a zzso or a coordinated process, zzso is able to reliably distinguish true pathways from zzso using zzso expression zzso Relying on the observation that only some of the experiments within a zzso are relevant to a specific zzso pathway, zzso zzso selection of this subset using an zzso zzso We present data on all human and zzso pathways found in the zzso zzso zzso In 117 out of 191 cases zzso zzso was able to correctly identify these positive cases as bona fide pathways with zzso measured using rigorous zzso zzso Success in recognizing pathways was dependent on zzso size, with the largest zzso of pathways yielding zzso zzso In zzso tests of zzso membership zzso zzso was able to yield zzso for predicted zzso genes over random genes at rates of zzso or better the majority of the time, with rates of zzso or better zzso of the zzso
