The balance between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso regulates zzso zzso expression increases in zzso arteries and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso are one of major constituents of zzso We investigated the impact of zzso zzso an active component of oxidized zzso zzso on the zzso zzso system of the rat zzso The zzso zzso the protein and gene expressions of zzso but did not affect the protein expression of zzso zzso overlay zzso revealed that zzso increased the activity of zzso in the zzso media, while zzso decreasing that of free zzso Vitamin E inhibited the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso increased the zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso blocked this zzso zzso Indeed, zzso induced the zzso zzso activity as measured by zzso reporter zzso In addition, zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso effect, while zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso does not affect zzso expression but zzso zzso expression in the zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signaling pathways via zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of zzso and suppresses that of zzso
