The mechanisms by which zzso zzso cells are directed to alternative cell identities during the zzso of the zzso central nervous system are likely to involve several different types of signaling zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso zzso acid, which acts through members of the zzso zzso of zzso directs zzso cells to the rod zzso cell zzso We now report that another zzso of this family of zzso zzso hormone, zzso an increase in the number of cone zzso that develop in embryonic rat retinal cultures, and that combinations of zzso zzso acid and zzso cause isolated zzso cells to differentiate as either rods or cones, depending on the relative zzso of the zzso These results zzso zzso hormone in zzso cell fate determination, and suggest that different zzso zzso may be modulated through the formation of zzso zzso zzso
