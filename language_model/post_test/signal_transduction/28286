The zzso eye is a highly ordered zzso tissue composed of approximately 750 zzso called zzso arranged in a reiterated zzso zzso At higher resolution, observation of the constituent zzso cone cells, and zzso cells of the eye reveals a highly ordered mosaic of amazing zzso This relatively simple organization belies the repeated requirement for zzso and temporally coordinated zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso This review will discuss how signaling zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso superimposed on the zzso history of a cell, facilitate zzso and appropriate cell fate zzso decisions in the developing fly zzso zzso learned from investigating the zzso signal integration strategies underlying zzso eye development will likely reveal zzso communication zzso relevant to many aspects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
