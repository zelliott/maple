Stem cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that identifies many tissue zzso zzso We originally identified zzso as a marker of zzso precursor cells and subsequently demonstrated that zzso regulates proliferation of activated zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in skeletal muscle zzso Beyond its functional role in regulating zzso however, little is known about the zzso that drive zzso zzso We now report that zzso zzso organization is essential for normal zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso to these zzso during zzso proliferation and zzso We also demonstrate that zzso associates with insulin degrading zzso zzso a zzso protein responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that chemical zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso that is, sustained zzso proliferation and delayed zzso zzso These findings identify the first signaling protein that physically and functionally associates with zzso in zzso precursor cells, and suggest a potential zzso for zzso zzso Future efforts to manipulate this zzso may lead to new strategies for zzso the zzso zzso response, and ultimately muscle zzso
