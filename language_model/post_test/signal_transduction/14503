zzso zzso zzso also called zzso is a zzso viral zzso zzso that interacts with zzso (also called zzso zzso or zzso to induce type I zzso host protective innate immunity against viral zzso Furthermore, members of the zzso motif zzso protein family, which contain a cluster of a zzso domain, a B zzso domain and a zzso domain, are involved in various cellular zzso including cell proliferation and zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso recruitment zzso zzso of zzso undergo robust zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso this interaction effectively delivers the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso resulting in a marked increase in zzso downstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso is critical for efficient zzso zzso and for zzso zzso as well as the ability of zzso to induce zzso signal zzso Furthermore, gene targeting demonstrates that zzso is essential not only for zzso zzso but also for zzso zzso production and zzso activity in response to zzso virus zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is crucial for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to elicit host zzso innate zzso
