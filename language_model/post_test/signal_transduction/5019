zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso cells by zzso carriers zzso cell zzso zzso zzso providing zzso delivery of zzso This zzso differs from classical zzso mechanisms and zzso aspects of zzso signaling during zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso during zzso but it is unclear how this regulates zzso and zzso zzso We studied such aspects in this zzso 

We used zzso and electron zzso zzso and knockout tools, cell culture, and mouse zzso zzso engagement by zzso carriers induced zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso zzso an zzso zzso that zzso zzso into zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso redistributed to zzso sites at zzso zzso This induced zzso stress fibers and carrier zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso enrichment, zzso structures, zzso zzso and carrier zzso which was rescued by zzso this zzso activity zzso zzso with zzso rendered similar zzso suggesting that zzso exchange might provide an zzso zzso for zzso at the zzso 

These findings are consistent with the ability of zzso cells to zzso relatively large zzso zzso drug carriers and expand our knowledge on the regulation of the zzso zzso by the vascular zzso
