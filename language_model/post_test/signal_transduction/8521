There is increasing evidence that the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso plays an important role in controlling cell zzso and that zzso zzso can modify inflammatory and zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zzso in a mouse model of skin zzso in which mice bearing a zzso deletion of zzso were zzso 

zzso sclerosis was induced by subcutaneous injection of zzso while zzso control groups were injected with zzso zzso zzso Mice bearing a zzso deletion of zzso were investigated for changes in zzso zzso zzso collagen content, and the number of zzso muscle zzso zzso The quantity of the zzso zzso acid zzso was also zzso In addition, the effect of zzso deletion on transforming growth factor zzso zzso signaling in the zzso was zzso 

zzso treatment induced marked zzso zzso and zzso in all treated zzso zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso to zzso skin fibrosis, as indicated by increases in all measures of skin zzso and enhanced sensitivity of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso of zzso may therefore alleviate the extent of the development of zzso zzso
