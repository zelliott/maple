Taste zzso cells are responsible for zzso chemical stimuli from the environment and relaying information to the nervous zzso zzso sweet and zzso stimuli zzso zzso coupled receptors which activate the zzso C zzso signaling zzso in Type II taste zzso However, it is not known how these cells communicate with the nervous zzso Previous studies have shown that the subset of taste cells that expresses the zzso bitter receptors lack zzso zzso channels, which are normally required for synaptic transmission at conventional zzso Here we use two lines of transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein zzso from two zzso promoters to examine zzso signaling in zzso of Type II zzso zzso mice were used to identify zzso and zzso taste cells, while zzso mice were used to identify all cells that zzso the zzso signaling zzso for zzso zzso zzso currents were assessed with zzso imaging and whole cell recording, while zzso was used to detect expression of zzso a zzso zzso protein that is associated with conventional zzso in taste zzso 

zzso with high zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso in a small subset of zzso labeled cells of both transgenic mouse zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso responses were observed in zzso taste cells of either zzso but zzso cells responded to the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these cells were zzso Whole cell recording indicated that the zzso cells of both zzso had small zzso zzso and zzso zzso but no evidence of zzso zzso A subset of zzso labeled taste cells exhibited large zzso zzso and zzso currents and a high threshold zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso was expressed in a separate population of taste cells from those expressing zzso or zzso These data indicate that G zzso taste receptors and conventional synaptic signaling mechanisms are expressed in separate populations of taste zzso 

The taste zzso cells responsible for the zzso of bitter, sweet, and zzso stimuli are unlikely to communicate with nerve fibers by using conventional chemical zzso
