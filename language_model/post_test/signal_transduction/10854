zzso in zzso , a zzso zzso cause zzso syndrome zzso a disorder characterized by a paucity of zzso zzso ducts zzso The mechanism underlying the contribution of the zzso signaling zzso to zzso formation, however, remains zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso 

The expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso during mouse liver development were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso The zzso maturation level and zzso development were studied in zzso zzso mice in comparison with zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso differentiation was assessed by using an in zzso zzso zzso system with zzso cells, a cell line derived from normal adult rat zzso 

zzso was expressed in the portal zzso during the zzso zzso During the same period, zzso and zzso expression was observed in the zzso zzso cells adjacent to the zzso zzso During zzso plate zzso zzso and zzso were zzso exclusively in the zzso zzso cells that form zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso formation of zzso was completely absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the zzso promoter and increased expression of zzso lineage zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso signaling has an important role in the differentiation of zzso zzso cells and is essential for their zzso formation during zzso zzso
