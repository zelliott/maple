This study used a comparative zzso approach to identify the effects of the antipsychotic drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso protein of the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso statistical test partial least zzso analysis zzso was applied to build the models for screening out the variable important plot zzso The zzso models were able to distinguish each drug treatment group and the control zzso more importantly, the zzso zzso expressed protein spots were capable of being verified by the zzso of the zzso The zzso among the identified proteins were analyzed using zzso correlation analysis and zzso zzso Through the zzso zzso experiments, we established that the energy production of the zzso function and zzso were involved in the response to antipsychotic zzso Furthermore, the G zzso signal zzso system was also inhibited by antipsychotic zzso The result of our study should contribute to the understanding of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on synaptic zzso
