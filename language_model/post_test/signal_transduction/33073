To determine the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and to determine if the components of the zzso signaling zzso for protein zzso also are zzso 

zzso studies using conventional zzso zzso or zzso zzso were performed on fixed sections from rat zzso zzso using zzso raised against zzso types I and II, and four zzso against five zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso III, IV, zzso zzso zzso binding zzso proteins were detected by Western zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso were measured on zzso zzso in response to zzso The effect of a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of protein zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was tested on zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso types I and II, were found on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells and on zzso zzso Western zzso showed the presence of alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso and G zzso The zzso II was found exclusively on zzso zzso zzso IV was located zzso in all zzso zzso III was found on ducts and possibly zzso no zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso caused a small but significant increase in zzso of 26 zzso 9 zzso The zzso protein zzso was inhibited zzso by zzso 

All components of the zzso signal zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso These findings are consistent with a zzso where zzso released from zzso nerves binds to zzso types I and II, zzso G zzso which in turn stimulate zzso present on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso which activates zzso to stimulate protein zzso The zzso also zzso zzso influx, which could play a role in zzso
