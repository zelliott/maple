zzso zzso zzso is a stress response zzso which presents with cardiovascular protective and zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso in zzso has been previously reported as a model of right zzso zzso failure related to the RV zzso of zzso and inflammatory zzso We hypothesized that altered zzso zzso could be involved in both pulmonary vascular and RV zzso Fifteen growing zzso were assigned to a sham operation zzso zzso 8) or to an zzso of the left zzso artery to the pulmonary zzso trunk zzso zzso zzso Six months later, zzso was evaluated after closure of the zzso After euthanasia of the animals, pulmonary and zzso tissue was sampled for zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a tendency to decreased pulmonary gene and protein expressions of zzso while pulmonary gene expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Pulmonary expressions of zzso zzso and zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso remained zzso Pulmonary vascular resistance zzso by zzso zzso was zzso correlated to pulmonary zzso protein and zzso gene expressions, and correlated to pulmonary zzso gene zzso Pulmonary zzso zzso thickness and zzso were zzso correlated to pulmonary zzso zzso RV expression of zzso was zzso while RV gene expressions zzso and zzso were zzso There was a correlation between RV ratio of zzso to pulmonary zzso zzso and RV zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso is associated to zzso and RV zzso
