Plant defense responses to wounding and zzso attack are regulated by signal zzso pathways that operate both at the site of wounding and in undamaged zzso zzso zzso analysis in tomato indicates that zzso and its precursor zzso zzso are upstream components of a zzso zzso signaling zzso that involves both the zzso and action of zzso acid zzso To examine the role of zzso in systemic zzso zzso zzso experiments were used to analyze zzso expression of the zzso inhibitor II gene in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso response zzso zzso The results showed that zzso plants are defective in the production, but not recognition, of a zzso wound zzso zzso zzso plants are compromised in the recognition of this signal but not its zzso It was also determined that a zzso signal produced in response to zzso expression of zzso in zzso was recognized by zzso but not by zzso zzso Taken together, the results show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in response to wounding or zzso is required for the production of a long-distance signal whose recognition in zzso leaves depends on zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso or a related compound derived from the zzso pathway, may act as a zzso wound zzso
