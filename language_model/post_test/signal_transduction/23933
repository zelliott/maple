We earlier reported that zzso zzso the relaxation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso smooth muscle contracted with zzso However, the mechanism of that zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso relaxation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso responses to zzso in zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso smooth muscle but had no effect on the zzso effects of zzso in preparations contracted with 100 zzso M zzso Treatment of zzso preparations with zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso relaxation and this treatment abolished the synergistic action of zzso on zzso In zzso experiments, zzso concentration zzso displaced the specific binding of zzso zzso zzso to cloned human zzso and zzso zzso receptors expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso responses to zzso in the bovine zzso smooth muscle contracted with zzso zzso zzso
