zzso zzso or zzso zzso from plants zzso are important components of hormone zzso pathways in zzso Based on zzso several groups can be zzso and the underlying premise is that members of different groups perform distinct functions in the zzso zzso is zzso unique among 11 zzso zzso and here it was shown that it functions as a zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso a dual role not previously assigned to these small zzso Plants with reduced levels of zzso had increased sensitivity to zzso and were less sensitive to zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso activated zzso gene expression but zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, both hormones regulated the activity of the zzso promoter, suggesting a feedback mechanism to zzso the zzso output from the zzso molecular zzso High levels of zzso were detected specifically in zzso and lateral roots, zzso the important role of this protein during zzso development and lateral root zzso These results place zzso as an important signal zzso in recently described pathways that integrate zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso
