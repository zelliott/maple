zzso stimulating factor zzso is an essential zzso which contributes to proliferation and differentiation of zzso precursor cells in the bone zzso Despite recent progress in understanding zzso signaling events, the mechanisms that zzso the distinct spectrum of biological functions attributed to zzso gene expression remain zzso Previous studies have identified a number of zzso which are zzso in zzso zzso precursor zzso In this study, we sought to identify additional target genes of zzso proliferation and/or zzso zzso zzso difference analysis was used with the zzso cell line as a model system to isolate zzso which are zzso in an zzso manner upon zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso protein of unknown function, and confirmed its expression by Northern zzso analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation of a mouse zzso zzso clone revealed the presence of a signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso site in the first zzso of the zzso We demonstrate the importance of zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso response with respect to zzso expression by transient zzso analysis, zzso pull-down zzso and the loss of zzso expression in the bone zzso of mice lacking normal zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells revealed normal, zzso maturation and growth characteristics but loss of zzso zzso a marker of normal zzso zzso suggesting that inappropriate expression of the zzso gene can result in zzso zzso zzso
