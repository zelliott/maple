The zzso anemia zzso zzso maintains zzso stability in replicating zzso Some sporadic breast, zzso zzso and zzso tumors are deficient in zzso zzso function, resulting in sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in these tumors may result in zzso on alternative DNA repair pathways that could be targeted as a treatment zzso We used a zzso zzso screening approach that identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a critical zzso for zzso zzso human zzso Human zzso and zzso embryonic zzso deficient for the zzso zzso were observed to have zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were found to be zzso zzso of zzso function in zzso zzso cells resulted in DNA zzso cell cycle arrest, and zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso anemia zzso group zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic tumor lines were more sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso than zzso corrected zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso genes function in parallel and zzso roles to maintain zzso integrity and cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso may have a role in the treatment of zzso zzso human zzso
