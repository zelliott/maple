zzso of zzso signaling zzso was shown to inhibit some zzso processes in zzso cells zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and whether it can, via zzso suppress the generation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso and proliferation of cells in zzso With the use of an zzso technique zzso was detected in zzso and zzso areas of rat zzso zzso grown in primary culture zzso zzso and the synthesis was zzso by zzso alpha and zzso beta but not by zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso generation in zzso zzso and caused in zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso In zzso zzso line zzso zzso generation was about four times higher than in zzso and was inhibited by zzso in a similar way as in zzso The rate of zzso zzso measured by zzso and the activity of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso were zzso inhibited by zzso the maximum zzso (at 10 zzso zzso was about zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activity when zzso to a similar extent by zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso to a significantly zzso zzso zzso lesser degree zzso Further, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso was reversed by the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso Taken together, results indicate the zzso zzso generated in zzso cells zzso can zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso signaling pathway, zzso oxygen zzso zzso generation in zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso We suggest that zzso zzso may serve as a zzso zzso that suppresses zzso processes evoked by zzso injury of zzso
