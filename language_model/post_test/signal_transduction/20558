zzso zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso through zzso zzso is suggested to activate zzso zzso which are implicated in zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso up regulates zzso zzso to reduce zzso signaling and zzso actions of zzso zzso Whether zzso peptides participate in long-term regulation of these systems in the brain is not zzso zzso we determined tissue and zzso zzso as well as expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso zzso tissue of zzso transgenic zzso rats exhibiting higher zzso zzso tone or zzso transgenic rats with targeted decreased zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso exhibiting lower zzso zzso tone compared with zzso zzso zzso rats that serve as the control zzso zzso zzso rats showed higher zzso tissue zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in isolated zzso zzso zzso or AS zzso zzso zzso protein 2 was lower in AS and unchanged in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were higher in AS and unchanged in zzso compared with zzso zzso AS rats also had lower zzso zzso and zzso consistent with higher zzso zzso Thus, an altered brain zzso system influences zzso stress status and regulates zzso zzso However, there is a zzso between these effects and the zzso zzso Higher zzso was associated with hypertension in zzso and normal zzso whereas the higher zzso was associated with zzso in zzso where zzso was normal relative to zzso zzso
