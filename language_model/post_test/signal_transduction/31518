zzso how mineral particles trigger cellular responses is crucial in order to zzso what characteristics determine their harmful zzso It is not clear whether cellular effects are triggered through the cell membrane or require particle zzso However, studies with zzso suggest that zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso may be zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso release from human lung zzso cells zzso was regulated through zzso family zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The present study shows that zzso and zzso zzso increased almost immediately upon zzso zzso exposure, whereas zzso zzso increased after 10 zzso of zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity may zzso zzso of zzso zzso electron zzso showed that some zzso particles were zzso between 1 and zzso of exposure, but that the majority remained bound by zzso on the cell zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated both zzso zzso release and zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso also inhibited the respective background levels, and the zzso was not zzso at the onset of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso triggers zzso and zzso signaling through interactions with membrane components as both pathways were rapidly activated prior to particle zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso release through the zzso zzso does not appear to be initiated through zzso of the zzso although zzso zzso activity may affect the magnitude of the zzso
