The release of insulin from pancreatic zzso is regulated by a considerable number of G zzso zzso During the past several years, we have focused on the zzso importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso At the molecular level, the zzso selectively activates G proteins of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of several zzso zzso mouse models, including a mouse strain that lacks zzso only in pancreatic zzso indicated that zzso zzso play a key role in maintaining blood zzso levels within a normal zzso Additional studies with transgenic zzso mouse models strongly suggest that strategies aimed to enhance signaling through zzso zzso may prove useful in the treatment of type 2 zzso More recently, we analyzed transgenic mice that expressed an zzso designer zzso in a zzso fashion, which enabled us to chronically activate a zzso zzso zzso by a drug that is otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso of this designer zzso zzso the sequential zzso of zzso zzso C, zzso and insulin zzso zzso 2 zzso thus triggering a series of events that greatly improved zzso zzso Most importantly, chronic stimulation of this zzso protected mice against zzso induced diabetes and zzso zzso induced either by zzso or by the consumption of an zzso high-fat zzso Because zzso are endowed with numerous receptors that mediate their cellular effects via zzso of zzso G zzso these findings provide a rational basis for the development of novel zzso drugs targeting this class of zzso
