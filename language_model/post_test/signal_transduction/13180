zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules on zzso presenting cells play important roles in providing zzso signals required for zzso and expansion of zzso T zzso Moreover, some reports have suggested that these molecules may have distinct functions in the differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice is characterized by zzso of T and B cells, serum increases in zzso and zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms responsible for the various manifestations of this syndrome have yet to be zzso To examine the contributions of B7 zzso molecules to this model, susceptible mice were treated with zzso to zzso zzso or both during the development of zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso prevented zzso disease in zzso zzso Additionally, single zzso zzso treatment was sufficient to prevent zzso zzso production, but not zzso and zzso zzso Further, single zzso treatment with zzso resulted in a partial reduction of zzso zzso but had no significant effect on total serum zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso molecules are critical for the development of zzso zzso and suggest that the different manifestations of the syndrome are regulated by independent zzso
