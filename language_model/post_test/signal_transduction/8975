Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for tissue engineering and zzso medicine, but many issues remain to be zzso such as the amount of seed cells, committed differentiation and the zzso Several previous studies have focused on the study of chemical zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of gravity on the differentiation of bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso into zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were cultured under zzso or simulated zzso zzso conditions with or without zzso zzso The expression levels of the characteristic proteins were measured and analyzed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso After treatment with zzso and zzso zzso expressed more characteristic proteins of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso however, fewer such proteins were seen with zzso After treating zzso with zzso zzso and zzso there were marked increases in the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso results were obtained with zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso and zzso expressed greater levels of zzso Greater levels of zzso or zzso cells were observed under zzso without zzso as shown by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso differentiation of zzso into zzso cells zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 

Taken together, we conclude that gravity is an important factor affecting the differentiation of zzso this provides a new avenue for zzso studies of stem cell differentiation and a new approach to obtain more committed differentiated or zzso zzso
