The formation of zzso cells is part of the zzso program of several zzso During zzso development, zzso zzso cells arise in the liver, caused by failure in zzso In this report, we have shown that the initiation of zzso failure events and the subsequent appearance of zzso zzso cells are strictly controlled by the zzso transition in zzso We found that daily zzso rhythms and zzso intake did not affect liver zzso In contrast, impairment of insulin signaling drastically reduced the formation of zzso zzso cells, whereas repeated insulin injections promoted the generation of these liver zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity decreased the number of zzso failure events, possibly through the zzso target of zzso signaling complex 2 zzso which indicates that the zzso zzso lies downstream of the insulin signal to regulate the zzso zzso To our knowledge, these results are the first demonstration in a zzso context that insulin signaling through zzso controls a specific cell division program and leads to the zzso generation of zzso zzso liver zzso
