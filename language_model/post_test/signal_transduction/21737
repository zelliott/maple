zzso of zzso light chain zzso and contraction of differentiated smooth muscle cells in vascular walls are regulated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and by zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We examined regulatory pathways for zzso zzso and zzso in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and for zzso force generation of zzso zzso in collagen zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso (a regulatory zzso of zzso were zzso in cultured zzso whereas a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was zzso zzso evoked a steady rise in levels of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso force of zzso whereas zzso induced transient zzso Also, zzso zzso of zzso occurred in response to zzso but neither zzso induced zzso of zzso at zzso Unlike fresh zzso zzso removal of zzso or addition of zzso zzso zzso blocker did not inhibit zzso of zzso zzso fibers induced by zzso or even high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso antagonized zzso or zzso zzso contraction in both zzso fibers and fresh zzso These results indicate that both zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso at zzso play pivotal roles in zzso zzso of cultured zzso where either zzso zzso or zzso signaling is zzso
