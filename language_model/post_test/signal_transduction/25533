zzso is an zzso zzso protein that regulates zzso and zzso trafficking of cell surface zzso In polarized zzso cells zzso is localized to the zzso zzso and recent work has implicated zzso in regulation of cell zzso and migration, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso transition zzso We depleted zzso cells of zzso and examined the effects downstream of zzso zzso While zzso of zzso did not affect zzso zzso we show that depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promotes loss of zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso formation and cell zzso zzso of zzso levels in zzso zzso cells revealed zzso of zzso following zzso calcium depletion and zzso zzso which zzso with enhanced loss of cell zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso depleted cells stabilized zzso contacts following depletion of zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso acts to suppress zzso zzso and its loss leads to increased sensitivity toward zzso signals that disrupt zzso zzso to induce zzso transition zzso and cell zzso
