Cell size is a complex quantitative trait resulting from interactions between intricate genetic networks and environmental zzso Here, taking advantage of previous studies that uncovered hundreds of genes affecting budding zzso cell size zzso we performed a wide zzso analysis using drugs mimicking cell size zzso zzso zzso relationship emerging from this approach allowed us to characterize a new cell size zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso downstream zzso including the large zzso zzso zzso and the zzso regulators zzso and zzso We showed that this zzso signaling route acts independently of other previously described cell size controlling pathways and may integrate the zzso status of the cell through zzso zzso zzso Finally, although zzso and the zzso zzso regulate both cell size and zzso aging, we found that there is no clear zzso relationship between these two complex zzso This study sheds light on a zzso of zzso genes and illustrates how zzso applied to zzso offers a potent experimental framework to explore complex zzso zzso
