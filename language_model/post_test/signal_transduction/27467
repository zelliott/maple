A key zzso action of insulin is the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, by increasing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular mechanism underlying this process has been investigated using a variety of experimental zzso We report here the use of cultured human zzso to study insulin control of zzso synthesis in zzso In these cells insulin stimulates zzso synthesis zzso zzso associated with a similar zzso of zzso zzso zzso which occurs within zzso zzso of the addition of zzso zzso also causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso B, both processes being sufficiently rapid to account for the effects of insulin on zzso zzso by insulin of the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is observed, but is significantly slower than the zzso of zzso Selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been used to probe the contribution of these components to insulin zzso in human zzso zzso blocks zzso of both zzso synthesis and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is without effect on these events, while zzso is without effect on zzso of zzso but partially blocks zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that protein zzso B is responsible for the zzso of zzso but that an additional zzso mechanism may contribute to the zzso of zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso
