The zzso of receptors for zzso and zzso in cerebral zzso suggests possible interactions between zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso In this study, we showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in enriched cerebral zzso To test the interactions between zzso and zzso or zzso cellular zzso we zzso these plasmids in zzso cerebral zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso was determined by western zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso downstream to zzso receptors was determined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which increased zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was abolished by a specific zzso zzso indicating the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso production was zzso Thus, zzso specifically zzso zzso signaling downstream to zzso by zzso with zzso zzso The cooperation of zzso and G zzso receptors in cellular signaling may have considerable biological implications not restricted to feeding and zzso
