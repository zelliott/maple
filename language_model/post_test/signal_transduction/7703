zzso access failure is the main cause of morbidity in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is similar zzso to zzso Recent studies showed that zzso 6 zzso has a key role in the zzso of zzso by binding 2 specific zzso zzso and zzso When zzso zzso interacts with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which then activates a zzso factor, signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso directly turning on several zzso zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate zzso expression and zzso zzso within zzso zzso 

44 patients undergoing surgery for zzso creation were zzso 10 of them had zzso failure with zzso proven zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso was collected during creation and revision of the vascular zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were evaluated by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated at the time of zzso creation and zzso 

zzso protein zzso barely zzso in native zzso was zzso increased within the zzso branch of zzso zzso The signaling zzso of the zzso zzso broadly zzso with zzso the zzso zzso zzso cells were mainly zzso suggesting that this zzso is expressed primarily by zzso zzso zzso At the same time, a significant increase in zzso of zzso was observed in zzso cells of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso cells isolated at the time of zzso failure presented zzso greater zzso expression compared with dialysis zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may have a role in the zzso of zzso failure in zzso patients and may represent a potential therapeutic target in this zzso
