Recent studies have implicated zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and traumatic brain injury zzso however, a direct link between zzso zzso and zzso cell death has not been established in injured zzso We detected zzso zzso binding and assembly of zzso signaling complexes zzso zzso zzso protein with death domain, and zzso or zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso converting zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso protein with a death zzso by zzso and zzso within mouse zzso zzso after controlled cortical zzso At the time of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso product appeared at 48 zzso in terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by zzso processing detected at 48 zzso by zzso and by zzso zzso of zzso zzso at 12 zzso zzso pathways were also zzso by zzso in human brain, because zzso expression plus zzso interaction were robust in zzso cortical tissue samples surgically removed between 2 and 30 zzso after zzso To address whether zzso functions as a death zzso in brain cells, cultured embryonic day 17 cortical zzso were zzso with an zzso zzso containing the gene zzso zzso zzso After 48 zzso in culture, zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso assembly increased, and by 72 zzso cell death was zzso Cell death was decreased by approximately 50% after zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso assemble in zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as within mouse and human zzso brain after zzso zzso zzso may function as a death zzso after brain zzso
