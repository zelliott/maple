In mouse zzso zzso cells, mechanical stimulation of a cell induced an increase of zzso zzso concentration zzso which spread from the zzso cell to the surrounding cells with a zzso zzso of about 10 zzso The zzso signal was transmitted between isolated cells or separated zzso where there was no physical contact between zzso The flow of medium changed the spreading pattern of zzso zzso The zzso wave was induced even in zzso zzso These findings suggested that a certain factor was released from zzso cell to zzso medium and it induced the zzso increase from zzso store in the surrounding zzso
