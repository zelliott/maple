To investigate the molecular mechanisms zzso the Chinese medicinal compound zzso improves vascular zzso function through studying the induction of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and its upstream signaling zzso 

zzso was induced in zzso rats by a zzso diet followed by zzso zzso The zzso ring was isolated for measuring vascular zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso reporter zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso of the reporter genes was measured by zzso zzso The level of zzso was studied by western zzso and the zzso oxide content was measured using the nitrate zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso with the dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso or zzso to explore the role of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso induction by zzso 

zzso could significantly zzso the expression of zzso in the zzso tissue and improve the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso at various doses could significantly enhance the expression of zzso and zzso reporter gene as well as zzso the protein level of zzso Meanwhile, zzso caused a zzso increase in the NO content in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso both attenuated zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso induction by zzso 

zzso a compound Chinese traditional medicine, zzso the expression of zzso via the zzso signaling pathway, thus improving the zzso zzso
