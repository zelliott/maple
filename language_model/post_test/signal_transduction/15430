zzso cell signaling plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso expression and joint destruction in zzso arthritis zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso was recently identified as an zzso negative regulator of the zzso pathway, since it could block the upstream zzso zzso This study was carried out to evaluate whether low zzso expression in zzso enhances zzso zzso and overproduction of zzso in zzso and whether zzso zzso increases arthritis severity in passive zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways and zzso expression were analyzed in human zzso and zzso zzso zzso using quantitative zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso and zzso mice were evaluated in the zzso serum transfer model of inflammatory arthritis, and clinical signs of arthritis, zzso formation, and bone erosion were zzso 

zzso levels of the zzso gene and protein were unexpectedly low in human zzso zzso despite abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso attenuated tumor necrosis zzso signaling through the zzso pathway, reduced the zzso of zzso protein 1, and decreased the expression of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exacerbated zzso zzso arthritis in mice, dramatically increased signaling through the zzso pathway, elevated zzso and zzso gene expression in the mouse zzso and increased the zzso inflammation and number of zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso can contribute to zzso of zzso exacerbate clinical arthritis, and augment joint zzso This process can be zzso by enhancing zzso expression or by zzso the activity of zzso or its upstream regulator, zzso
