The zzso cells in classical zzso disease zzso zzso are of zzso origin, but they lack many markers of this cell zzso for example, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso predominance zzso disease retain the molecular profile of zzso center B zzso In this paper, we investigated the expression in zzso disease zzso cases and 3 cell zzso of 5 zzso signaling molecules found in B zzso The zzso family zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso C zzso were consistently absent from zzso cells, whereas 2 other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in a proportion of cases zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the tumor cells in all cases of zzso predominance zzso disease were positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Lyn zzso was seen in a minority of zzso These results indicate that in zzso cells, the zzso in zzso lineage marker expression includes a spectrum of molecules involved in zzso zzso a finding in keeping with recent gene expression profiling zzso Furthermore, the clear difference in expression of signaling proteins between the 2 major zzso of zzso disease may be of diagnostic zzso
