zzso zzso is an animal model for aspects of cocaine zzso zzso rats exhibit increased zzso zzso zzso surface expression in the nucleus zzso zzso which may in turn enhance drug zzso To identify signaling pathways contributing to zzso zzso we measured zzso surface expression and signaling zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso rats, zzso rats that failed to sensitize and saline controls on withdrawal days zzso 1, 7, and zzso We focused on zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso In zzso rats, zzso surface expression was elevated on zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso followed a parallel zzso suggesting a role in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso rats exhibited zzso zzso on zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso measured using an zzso recognizing zzso zzso zzso increased gradually over withdrawal in zzso rats, from below control levels on zzso to significantly greater than controls on zzso Using zzso novel zzso zzso zzso were identified, including two structural proteins zzso and zzso that we speculate may link zzso signaling to previously reported zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
