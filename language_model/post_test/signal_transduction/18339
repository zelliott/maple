Multiple zzso signaling pathways have been shown to regulate the zzso growth of zzso Both necessary and sufficient roles have been described for the zzso activated protein zzso zzso signaling pathway, specific protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso Here we investigate the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso using three separate zzso Hearts from zzso zzso transgenic mice were characterized for zzso and zzso zzso zzso hearts demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic hearts demonstrated increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso or zzso In a second approach, cultured zzso were infected with a zzso zzso to induce zzso and the effects of zzso zzso or zzso with a dominant negative zzso were zzso zzso zzso was prevented with zzso zzso zzso zzso and attenuated with a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso or zzso zzso had no zzso In a third approach, we examined the zzso of zzso factors and zzso zzso during the progression of zzso zzso in zzso banded rats with or without zzso We determined that zzso of zzso activity with zzso prevented zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso zzso signaling is interconnected with zzso zzso and zzso in the heart, while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in zzso zzso
