During zzso zzso zzso zzso cells first arise from a subset of blood vascular zzso cells in the zzso aspects of the zzso zzso The molecular cues responsible for defining the zzso of such a discrete pool of zzso remain zzso Here we identify a novel function for zzso an zzso known to play a role in tissue zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso mice, in which zzso levels are zzso exhibited an increased number of zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso together with zzso blood filled zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso clearance by zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso zzso cells is important for determining the position and size of the zzso pool zzso Our studies identify a genetic zzso that zzso the architecture of the developing zzso and define zzso as a novel zzso of zzso vascular zzso
