The functional selectivity of zzso zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been extensively studied in zzso zzso Much less is known about zzso selectivity for zzso zzso zzso In the present study we used resonance energy transfer methods to compare the ability of zzso and zzso to form a complex with the zzso zzso or zzso in response to a variety of zzso with various degrees of zzso The profiles of zzso selectivity of the zzso for the two zzso interactions were sharply zzso For zzso zzso the majority of zzso were more effective in zzso the zzso whereas for zzso zzso the relationship was zzso These data indicate that the zzso interacts more efficiently than zzso with zzso but less efficiently than zzso with zzso A group of zzso exhibited zzso efficacy in driving the zzso to zzso zzso a member of this group, had zzso of the adrenaline zzso effect on zzso via zzso but acted as a competitive zzso of adrenaline via zzso Thus the structure of such zzso appears to induce an zzso form of the zzso only when bound to the zzso zzso
