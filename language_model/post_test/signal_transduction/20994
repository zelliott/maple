We have isolated zzso in the gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein as zzso of the rough eye zzso caused by the zzso expression of zzso Using a simple zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso acts to increase the efficiency of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein appears to function in multiple zzso zzso suggesting that it is a general component of zzso signaling zzso zzso analysis of three zzso zzso defines two regions of zzso zzso that participate in zzso zzso We also present evidence that zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso protein family members, are partially redundant for zzso signaling in zzso formation and in animal zzso Our genetic data suggest that zzso zzso functions downstream of or parallel to zzso but upstream of nuclear factors in zzso zzso
