zzso zzso are abundantly expressed zzso zzso zzso highly zzso with respect to their affinities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso associate with a large number of zzso zzso the zzso significance and regulation of which is poorly zzso Here we show that zzso 2 associates with zzso 1 via the zzso zzso domain of zzso and thereby competes with the binding of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso thus interfering with the assembly of the zzso zzso We also present a novel role for the zzso mouse zzso 2 as a regulator of membrane zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso zzso whereas lack of zzso 2 in zzso results in an increase in zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso releases zzso 2 from the zzso zzso 1 complex as well as from the zzso zzso complex, suggesting that zzso 2 is zzso the zzso signaling zzso to zzso zzso as well as zzso
