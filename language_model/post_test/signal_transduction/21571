To identify the genes involved in the partial resistance of sunflower zzso zzso to the zzso fungus zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso zzso containing carefully chosen genes zzso involved in primary zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso stress zzso A zzso general linear model was used to zzso the data and then to detect zzso expressed zzso This method allowed us to identify 38 genes zzso expressed among zzso treatments and times, mainly belonging to plant defense, signaling pathways and zzso acid zzso Based on a set of genes whose differential expression was highly zzso we propose a model in which negative regulation of a zzso zzso zzso could be implicated in sunflower defense mechanisms against the zzso The resulting zzso of the zzso zzso cascade could subsequently trigger defense responses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of zzso factors belonging to zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso which is implicated in cell death zzso could limit pathogen zzso The results reported here provide a valuable first step towards the understanding and analysis of the zzso zzso zzso
