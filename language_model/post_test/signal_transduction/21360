zzso hormone zzso regulates calcium zzso via the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to identify the contributions of distinct signaling mechanisms to zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In Human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a robust increase in zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso was zzso with an early peak at 10 zzso and a later sustained zzso zzso zzso for greater than 60 zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso individually or in combination reduced the early component of zzso zzso zzso However, these zzso of second zzso dependent zzso had little effect on the later phase of zzso zzso zzso This later phase of zzso zzso at zzso zzso was blocked by depletion of cellular zzso 2 and zzso 1 by small interfering zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso selectively activated zzso zzso zzso or G zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso stimulates zzso through several distinct signal zzso zzso an early G zzso zzso meditated by zzso and zzso and a late zzso independent of G proteins zzso through zzso These findings imply the existence of distinct active zzso of the zzso responsible for the two zzso which can be zzso by unique zzso Such zzso may have distinct and valuable therapeutic zzso
