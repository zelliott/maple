In the early zzso period, energy metabolism in the zzso zzso brain relies to a large extent on zzso pathways alternate to zzso such as the zzso of zzso bodies zzso However, how zzso affect zzso zzso is not zzso Using recordings of single zzso and zzso channels in zzso zzso cells we studied the effects of zzso on the resting membrane potential zzso and reversal potential of zzso zzso currents zzso zzso We show that during zzso development zzso if zzso brain slices are adequately supplied with zzso zzso and zzso are both maintained at negative levels of about zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso causes a significant zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso shift in zzso is largely determined by the interaction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by inducing a zzso shift in zzso and modulating zzso signaling mode, zzso can efficiently control the zzso of zzso cortical zzso
