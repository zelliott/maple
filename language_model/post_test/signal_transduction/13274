In this work the mechanisms of zzso triggered in zzso zzso zzso by bacterial challenge were investigated in an in zzso model of infection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Western zzso analyses of zzso extracts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso coli induced a time dependent zzso of different classes of zzso mainly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by the use of the selective zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with zzso significantly reduced bacterial killing, whereas zzso an inhibitor of zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced both zzso zzso and bacterial killing, indicating a critical role also for this zzso zzso in the zzso immune zzso
