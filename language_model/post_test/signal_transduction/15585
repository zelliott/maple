The present study was conducted on zzso T cells, isolated from wild type zzso and zzso mice, in order to assess the mechanism of action of zzso acid zzso an zzso fatty acid, in the zzso of two zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso implicated in zzso differentiation zzso respectively, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso from zzso mice zzso higher zzso and lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso Furthermore, the deletion of zzso gene in zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso both at zzso and protein zzso zzso exerted not only an zzso effect on zzso zzso but also diminished zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both cell zzso zzso also zzso zzso and zzso zzso both at zzso and protein zzso Though the zzso from zzso mice expressed higher zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both the cell zzso The pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso also zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate that zzso via its action on zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso These results also explain the mechanism of action of this fatty acid on zzso differentiation in disease and zzso
