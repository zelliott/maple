The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can be altered rapidly in response to external zzso We reported previously that zzso zzso responds to zzso stress by zzso zzso its zzso zzso and that this step requires a zzso protein zzso high zzso zzso 1 zzso This study further investigated the components involved in this zzso reorganization at pH zzso Gene deletions on the zzso branch of the zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso depends mainly on the zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso did not influence the time course of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is a direct effect of the zzso zzso zzso of the scaffolding zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso markedly inhibited the zzso and further deletion of the zzso zzso zzso notably delayed zzso zzso Our results suggest the involvement of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso in zzso reorganization of the zzso zzso zzso at low zzso
