The present study was performed to establish a real-time monitoring of the zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso using zzso cells, and to assess the zzso of zzso activity by potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from zzso zzso and cultured for 2 days, and then zzso with zzso zzso The cells were directly zzso or cultured with zzso zzso zzso or a permeable zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso complex zzso for the real-time monitoring of zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso signaling consisted of three distinct zzso zzso burst, zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso a zzso analog induced the prolonged zzso although three distinct zzso were observed at its high zzso Of all the zzso factors, only zzso slightly induced zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso with zzso caused a significant suppression of zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso the zzso zzso The present study provides a new approach for direct signaling study on zzso factors under the influences of potential zzso
