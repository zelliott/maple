We recently reported that heat shock protein 60 zzso via zzso signaling activates B cells and zzso them to zzso and zzso zzso We now report that zzso zzso mouse B cell zzso spontaneous or induced by zzso or zzso zzso Unlike zzso enhancement of B cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso signaling was not required for the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso maintenance of the zzso zzso potential, and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, B cells incubated with zzso zzso prolonged survival following transfer into recipient zzso These results extend the varied role of zzso in the innate regulation of the zzso immune zzso
