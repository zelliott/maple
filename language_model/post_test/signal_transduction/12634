Although zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso factor expression are known to promote the development of zzso cell zzso zzso little is known about molecular mechanisms driving the development of specific growth pattern zzso Using gene array analysis, we have previously observed that zzso of zzso in human zzso promotes increased expression of the zzso differentiation markers ARC and zzso We asked whether zzso differentiation is a characteristic of zzso and whether there is any correlation with zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso we confirmed that the zzso markers zzso zzso III, zzso and zzso are expressed in human zzso but not in normal zzso Moreover, we found that expression of these zzso differentiation markers showed strong correlation to zzso zzso with more aggressive zzso and zzso zzso showing low levels or lack of expression compared to zzso superficial and zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso showed elevated levels of zzso III and ARC but not zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso III and Arc may be early targets of zzso zzso expression in zzso whereas expression of zzso and zzso are either later, downstream targets or under control of alternative zzso We propose that zzso differentiation is a feature of zzso and that expression of these markers is in part due to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we suggest that correlation between loss of expression of zzso markers in zzso and zzso zzso zzso reflects zzso of more aggressive zzso zzso
