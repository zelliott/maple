The generation of zzso polarity in zzso relies on the formation of a nuclear zzso of the zzso factor zzso B zzso factor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by a process of differential nuclear zzso It is thought that the zzso is formed by zzso at zzso positions of the membrane zzso Toll that in turn causes the local zzso of zzso from the zzso anchor protein zzso Although Toll is related in its zzso domain to the zzso zzso little is known about the signal zzso pathways that lead from Toll to the zzso of zzso In this paper we have used zzso zzso as a direct zzso of zzso protein nuclear zzso in the zzso cell line Schneider zzso We find that increased zzso calcium concentration and the expression of zzso active Toll receptors can induce the zzso of zzso By contrast, we find that zzso of zzso protein zzso A and expression of zzso Toll zzso which activate zzso zzso reporter genes in this system, have only a marginal effect on the cellular distribution of the zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso of protein zzso C and radical oxygen zzso both of which activate nuclear factor zzso B, also has little effect on zzso protein zzso We propose that different threshold levels of zzso zzso can be established by distinctly regulated signal zzso zzso
