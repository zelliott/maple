The aim of the present study was to zzso the mechanism of the vitamin zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities in the rat zzso When rats were maintained on a vitamin zzso diet, the activities of these two zzso in the liver were significantly reduced compared with those in the zzso control rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein per zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein per zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso rats, the level of zzso induction in response to the administration of zzso and zzso was significantly lower than in the zzso zzso zzso induced a significant increase in zzso activity in the primary culture of the zzso prepared from the deficient rats, as well as in the cells from the control zzso However, a further increase in zzso activity was not observed in the zzso from the deficient rats, in contrast to the cells from the controls, when zzso was added simultaneously with zzso The zzso production of zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso from the deficient rats relative to the cells from the control zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso activity in the liver was significantly lower in the deficient rats than in the zzso These results suggest that vitamin zzso zzso results in decreases in zzso and zzso activities correlated with the impairment of the zzso signal zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso system in the zzso
