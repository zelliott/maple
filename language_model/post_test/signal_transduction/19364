The zzso effect of cancer and treatment zzso contribute to sexual zzso Recently, a series of zzso zzso zzso have been approved either as zzso or for targeted treatment of zzso However, zzso zzso are not only important for cell growth and zzso but also in regulation of vascular zzso 

The present study investigated whether zzso zzso contribute to zzso in rat penile zzso and addressed whether they are involved in calcium entry and/or related to the zzso zzso 

zzso of the rat zzso penile artery were mounted in zzso zzso for simultaneous zzso of zzso calcium concentration zzso and tension, and zzso zzso activity, and zzso of zzso zzso light chain zzso was measured in zzso penile artery zzso 

In zzso evidence for zzso and changes in zzso zzso in small penile zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso A zzso calcium channel blocker, zzso (1 zzso markedly reduced zzso increases in zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso In contrast to the inactive zzso zzso a general zzso zzso zzso reduced both zzso contraction, and zzso zzso contraction was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso whereas there was no effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso 

This study suggests that zzso of zzso zzso is involved in contraction of rat penile smooth muscle probably by regulation of calcium entry through zzso calcium zzso These findings may have implications for the selections of novel add on zzso treatments, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and for novel approaches to treat zzso zzso
