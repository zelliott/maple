A fundamental problem in zzso zzso is understanding how zzso cues link to complex zzso signaling pathways to drive zzso zzso zzso During the formation of the zzso peripheral nervous system, bone zzso proteins zzso promote zzso zzso zzso also maintain the expression of early zzso genes such as zzso while blocking the acquisition of a mature, zzso zzso cell zzso We investigated the zzso signaling pathways that contribute to early zzso gene expression to address the question of how specific signaling interactions contribute to cell fate decisions in neural crest zzso Using a zzso cell line that exhibits the characteristics of immature zzso cells, we found that zzso promotes zzso expression using zzso signaling as well as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter does not contain known zzso consensus sites, suggesting that zzso may act indirectly to promote zzso zzso We provide evidence that this indirect effect may be zzso via induction of immediate early genes and the zzso factor zzso by demonstrating that these zzso regulators are induced by zzso and contribute to zzso promoter zzso These findings demonstrate new roles for zzso zzso pathways in zzso the effects of zzso during the early stages of zzso differentiation and suggest that differential contributions by signaling and zzso networks may contribute to the range of effects of zzso on zzso and zzso development during the formation of the peripheral nervous zzso
