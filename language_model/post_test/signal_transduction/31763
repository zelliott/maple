The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a major regulator of organ size and proliferation in zzso As such, zzso can act as an zzso in several tissue types if its activity is increased zzso Although no zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been identified in human cancer, zzso is located on the zzso zzso which is amplified in several human zzso In addition, zzso or zzso zzso of members of the zzso pathway, which zzso zzso function, have been identified in human zzso Here we demonstrate that, in addition to increasing tumor growth, increased zzso activity is zzso zzso in breast cancer and melanoma zzso Using a zzso approach to multiplex in zzso zzso we determined that the domain of zzso that interacts with the zzso family of zzso factors but not the WW zzso or zzso zzso is essential for zzso tumor growth and zzso We further demonstrate that, through its zzso domain, zzso enhances multiple processes known to be important for tumor progression and zzso including cellular zzso zzso migration, and zzso Finally, we found that the zzso potential of breast cancer and melanoma cells is strongly correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that increased zzso activity plays a zzso role in cancer progression and zzso
