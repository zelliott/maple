Nuclear zzso zzso is an important regulator of inflammation and zzso We showed previously that zzso zzso by zzso zzso treatment strongly reduced zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso by zzso was not associated with zzso of cerebral zzso zzso We investigated how tumor necrosis zzso zzso production is maintained after zzso zzso and whether zzso contributes to brain zzso 

zzso Day 7 rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery zzso and zzso zzso were treated immediately after zzso with zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and/or the zzso inhibitor zzso We determined brain damage, zzso and zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our data confirm that zzso treatment reduces brain damage without zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this treatment reduced the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso was zzso in the zzso brain after zzso administration and that zzso treatment also reduced the zzso effect of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso zzso 

When zzso was inhibited after zzso cerebral zzso zzso activity was increased and required for increased zzso zzso Our data indicate that the switch to zzso zzso preserves zzso zzso expression and thereby might contribute to the zzso effect of zzso possibly through a zzso dependent zzso
