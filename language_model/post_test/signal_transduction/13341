zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso family, due to its structure, zzso family and signal zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor requiring zzso for zzso into an active zzso zzso However, with regard to its capacity to induce the production of zzso zzso and to enhance zzso zzso zzso is also related to zzso Produced mainly by zzso cells, zzso is a zzso factor involved in the regulation of both innate and acquired immune responses, playing a key role in zzso zzso and infectious zzso This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of zzso structure, processing, zzso zzso and zzso functions and emphasizes the critical role of this zzso in bacterial zzso It focuses on the participation of this zzso in the defense against zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since this zzso may be particularly useful in zzso and zzso interventions in which the cellular response is most desirable, the potential therapeutic aspects of zzso is also zzso
