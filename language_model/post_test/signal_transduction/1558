The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso is dependent on biologically active zzso zzso zzso also zzso a similar zzso zzso zzso resulting in the liberation of the zzso zzso domain zzso which is critically required for zzso signal zzso zzso processing of zzso results in the production of a similar zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso which may function in nuclear signaling as zzso zzso like zzso is rapidly zzso By using a battery of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso in contrast to zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso In zzso degradation of zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso obtained from zzso and zzso zzso Taking into account the zzso profile and the zzso zzso we identified three candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso which all are involved in the degradation of zzso peptides in the zzso When insulin, a well characterized zzso of zzso was added to the in zzso degradation zzso removal of zzso was efficiently zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced degradation of zzso whereas zzso of the inactive zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso significantly reduced the zzso degrading zzso Therefore our data demonstrate that zzso which is one of the zzso implicated in the removal of zzso zzso also removes the zzso product of zzso zzso zzso
