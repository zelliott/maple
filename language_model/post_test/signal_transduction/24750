zzso factor zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that protects cells from zzso zzso by either preventing the formation of or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on human peripheral T cells by zzso zzso has previously been reported to lead to zzso zzso Two zzso both mapping to the third short consensus repeat region of zzso were able to trigger proliferation of human peripheral T zzso To determine the role of the zzso anchor in cell zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso either zzso or a zzso form of zzso zzso The zzso cells were able to zzso late zzso events as evidenced by zzso production, whereas zzso zzso cells were unable to do zzso The zzso zzso was able to zzso early zzso events leading to the zzso zzso of a zzso protein and several proteins in the zzso zzso zzso event absent in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso cells contain zzso zzso activity leading to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso cells did not have an associated zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were associated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso associated with zzso This complex of zzso with zzso family protein zzso zzso requires the zzso anchor and suggests a zzso for signaling through zzso membrane zzso
