zzso of the zzso gene are the most common genetic zzso found in human zzso and are known to play crucial roles in tumor development and zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein functioning as a zzso factor, and the biological functions of zzso are zzso through the activities of its downstream zzso Identification of these downstream genes involved in the zzso zzso should provide more detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate zzso activities, as well as various responses to cellular zzso We have been attempting to isolate zzso genes by means of various approaches, including differential display, zzso zzso analysis, and direct cloning of the zzso sequences from human zzso zzso Here I review our recent work on isolation of zzso genes and their functional zzso The zzso functions of zzso genes include zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA repair zzso zzso of zzso zzso re-entry into the cell cycle zzso zzso stress zzso and determination of cell fate zzso
