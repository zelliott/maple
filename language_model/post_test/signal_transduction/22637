zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso type I is increased in human zzso in which an zzso zzso for zzso growth zzso growth factors is zzso We have investigated the effect of zzso zzso of zzso gene expression on zzso cancer cell zzso We report that zzso zzso treatment results in a reduction in zzso expression and protein zzso A type I, and zzso of cell zzso The growth zzso was accompanied by changes in cell zzso and appearance of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were reduced, and the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso activities were zzso zzso zzso A type I and zzso zzso levels were also reduced in cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso depletion of zzso leads to blockade of both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signaling pathways resulting in arrest of zzso cancer cell zzso
