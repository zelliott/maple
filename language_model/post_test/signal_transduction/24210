The regional distribution, zzso profiles, and zzso and zzso changes in the density of transcripts zzso the steroid zzso zzso zzso were examined in the female rat brain by zzso in zzso zzso The results demonstrate striking differences in the abundance of zzso zzso in discrete brain regions throughout zzso Whereas transcript zzso gradually decreased with age in the cerebral cortex, they peaked prominently during the zzso period in the zzso zzso zzso area zzso and zzso nucleus zzso zzso and zzso substitution influenced zzso zzso levels in sexually mature animals in a zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso of zzso zzso levels in the zzso a brain region richly endowed with zzso receptors and playing a major role in neuroendocrine control of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transcript levels were significantly zzso after zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression in the zzso was zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso The obtained zzso zzso expression profiles during development clearly demonstrate brain region specificity and regulation by estrogen, thus it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a temporally and zzso coordinated manner and therefore contributes to the functional specialization of brain areas involved in the regulation of zzso
