zzso peptides derived from viral proteins by multiple zzso zzso are bound by zzso class I molecules and recognized by zzso zzso predominantly takes place in the zzso of infected cells by the action of zzso To identify other zzso involved in the zzso generation of viral zzso specifically those derived from proteins routed to the zzso pathway, we investigated presentation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to specific zzso in the presence of diverse zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso recognition of the zzso zzso expressed from either native zzso or from a zzso based on the zzso B virus zzso core protein as carrier zzso zzso of this zzso from both native zzso and the zzso B virus zzso core zzso protein appeared to proceed by a zzso zzso that involved sequential zzso by zzso and zzso however, other zzso activities could replace the function of the zzso zzso By contrast, in a second zzso zzso we detected no contribution of zzso for processing the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso These results show that, in the classical zzso zzso class I pathway, zzso zzso processing of viral proteins to yield the zzso zzso zzso requires zzso in addition to zzso
