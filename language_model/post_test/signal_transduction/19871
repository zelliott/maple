The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1; zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes including cell survival, growth and zzso metabolism and zzso Previously, we generated zzso mice and found high zzso mortality with unknown zzso Here we report that zzso analysis of zzso zzso and newborns revealed heart defects and decreased cell zzso zzso study of zzso mice indicated decreased heart zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso zzso caused substantial zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso mice to mice that were zzso for a zzso zzso partially rescued the heart zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and restored normal patterns of zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso is essential for heart development and function, in part, through suppression of zzso zzso
