The zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso of branching zzso and induction of zzso tissue growth factor zzso expression in embryonic zzso Because a number of zzso interactions have been described between zzso zzso signaling and the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, we have investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso in mouse embryonic lung zzso Mouse embryonic day zzso zzso lung zzso were treated with zzso in the presence or absence of a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We found that zzso activated the zzso zzso by stimulating zzso zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso also decreased normal branching zzso and induced zzso expression as well as zzso zzso zzso of branching and induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso responses in lung branching zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso may antagonize zzso dependent zzso signaling during mouse embryonic lung zzso
