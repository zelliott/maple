An excess of the free radical zzso oxide zzso is viewed as a deleterious factor involved in various zzso zzso Numerous studies have shown that the zzso zzso extract zzso zzso is a NO scavenger with zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying its zzso ability remain to be fully zzso Thus, we investigated the effect of different constituents of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against toxicity induced by NO generators on cells of the zzso a brain area particularly susceptible to neurodegenerative zzso Exposure of rat primary mixed zzso cell cultures to either sodium zzso zzso 100 zzso or zzso resulted in both a decrease in cell survival and an increase in free radical zzso These zzso events were blocked by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or its zzso fraction zzso 205 zzso zzso as well as by zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso calcium channels zzso In contrast, the zzso constituents of zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso B, as well as zzso of zzso A zzso acid zzso and C zzso failed to display any significant zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso and zzso were also able to rescue zzso cells zzso to zzso (up to 1 zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to block the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the protective and rescuing abilities of zzso zzso are not only attributable to the zzso properties of its zzso constituents but also via their ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso
