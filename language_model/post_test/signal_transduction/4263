The gene zzso which encodes a novel protein of zzso zzso zzso is required for the choice of alternate cell fates by several cells in the zzso zzso male zzso Three cells descended from the ray 6 precursor cell adopt fates of anterior zzso and a fourth, zzso unrelated zzso cell is transformed into a zzso The affected cells lie together in the lateral tail zzso suggesting that zzso acts as part of a short-range zzso zzso Each of the changes in cell fate brought about by zzso zzso can be interpreted as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso males and zzso have additional zzso zzso affecting movement, body shape and zzso indicating that zzso has functions outside the tail region of zzso We show that the three known zzso of zzso are zzso of a new zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso acts cell autonomously to specify the properties of the sensory zzso but zzso in the zzso versus zzso cell fate zzso zzso of cell zzso in the choice of the zzso fate was confirmed by cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso were shown previously to be genetic zzso of the effects of zzso gene zzso on ray identity zzso The results presented here support the conclusion that zzso acts as part of a mechanism required for correct cell fate choice, possibly involving the function of zzso genes in several body zzso
