Natural killer zzso cells are zzso of the innate immune system that are involved in the early defenses against foreign cells, as well as zzso cells undergoing various forms of stress, such as microbial infection or tumor zzso zzso cell zzso is controlled by a dynamic balance between complementary and zzso pathways that are initiated upon interaction with potential target zzso zzso cells express an array of zzso cell surface receptors that can trigger zzso programs, as well as zzso or zzso zzso Some of these zzso cell surface receptors initiate protein zzso zzso zzso pathways through zzso associations with zzso signaling zzso that harbor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional cell surface receptors that are not directly coupled to zzso also participate in zzso cell zzso These include zzso which is zzso associated to the zzso zzso signaling zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells also express cell surface zzso receptors that antagonize zzso pathways through protein zzso zzso zzso These zzso cell surface receptors are characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso status of several signaling components that are zzso for both zzso and zzso is thus key to the propagation of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the integration of these multiple signals is central to the understanding and manipulation of zzso cell zzso signaling zzso
