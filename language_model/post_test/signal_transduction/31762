The molecular zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso governing zzso zzso zzso development, drug resistance, and zzso zzso functions in concert with zzso to regulate stability and zzso of client zzso many of which are signal zzso Here, we characterize the first zzso zzso in the leading human zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso physically interacts with zzso and that it zzso zzso zzso zzso and drug zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso depletion of zzso inducing zzso to filament zzso and invasive zzso zzso zzso these traits by bridging two zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and depletion of either zzso or zzso activates zzso zzso revealing the elusive link between zzso and the zzso signaling zzso zzso also mediates tolerance and resistance to the two most widely deployed classes of zzso drugs, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso abrogates zzso tolerance and acquired resistance to zzso which target the cell zzso zzso of zzso also abrogates tolerance and resistance to zzso which target the cell wall, and renders zzso zzso Though zzso and zzso have a zzso impact on drug resistance, the underlying mechanisms are zzso zzso of zzso zzso the client protein zzso thereby blocking crucial responses to drug-induced zzso in contrast, depletion of zzso does not destabilize zzso but blocks zzso zzso in response to drug-induced zzso zzso influences not only zzso and drug resistance, but also zzso as genetic depletion of zzso zzso zzso leads to reduced kidney zzso burden in a zzso model of systemic zzso Thus, our characterization of the first zzso zzso in a zzso pathogen establishes zzso zzso zzso as a global regulator of zzso and drug resistance, providing a new target for treatment of life-threatening zzso zzso
