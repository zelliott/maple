zzso pattern formation mechanism exhibits sensitivity to the details of the initial conditions suggesting that, in isolation, it cannot robustly generate pattern within noisy biological zzso Nonetheless, secondary aspects of zzso zzso such as a growing domain, have been shown to zzso this zzso model zzso Furthermore, while zzso zzso reveals the presence of gene expression in zzso zzso the influence of such dynamics on zzso model has received limited zzso Here, we zzso focus on the zzso reaction diffusion system considering delays due the time taken for gene zzso while incorporating a number of different domain growth profiles to further explore the influence and interplay of domain growth and gene expression on zzso zzso We find extensive pathological model zzso exhibiting one or more of the zzso zzso zzso with no spatial structure, a failure of the Turing instability and an extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions, the growth profile and the duration of gene zzso This zzso zzso is even more severe than observed in previous studies of zzso zzso on zzso growing zzso in the presence of gene expression zzso and Monk in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results zzso that gene expression dynamics induce unrealistic zzso in zzso model for multiple choices of zzso and thus such zzso zzso predictions are likely to be zzso They also highlight that domain growth can no longer zzso the excessive sensitivity of zzso mechanism in the presence of gene expression time zzso The above, extensive, zzso suggest that, in the presence of gene zzso zzso mechanism would generally require a novel and extensive secondary mechanism to control reaction diffusion zzso
