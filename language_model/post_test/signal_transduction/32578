zzso zzso in zzso behavior are essential for maintaining zzso integrity during growth and wound repair and rely on zzso cell signaling zzso Numerous growth factors and zzso have been shown to be instrumental in guiding such changes in zzso zzso here we provide evidence which proposes a novel zzso signaling zzso zzso by the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the major zzso neurotransmitter at synaptic junctions within the central nervous system; however, we have identified expression in zzso of several regulatory molecules associated with zzso signaling in zzso In resting rat skin zzso different classes of zzso zzso zzso and a recently described zzso protein were shown to display distinct distribution patterns, supportive of a zzso cellular communication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors were zzso with the specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso layer zzso and zzso a related zzso was expressed zzso In zzso rat skin wounds, marked modifications in the distribution of zzso receptors and zzso were observed during zzso and zzso in zzso zzso expression accompanied embryonic zzso development, implicating zzso signaling in these important zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that these receptors are functional in zzso These data provide strong evidence to support a role for zzso in the control of zzso renewal, and therefore suggest potentially novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of skin disease and enhancement of wound zzso
