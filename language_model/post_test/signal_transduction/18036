Several neuroendocrine control systems are prominently controlled by zzso coupled receptors that activate the zzso signal zzso zzso The discovery of multiple genes that zzso the molecular machinery of zzso metabolism has revolutionized our knowledge of zzso zzso zzso This perhaps all too familiar second zzso can be generated by nine different membrane zzso in the context of varied levels of zzso of G proteins as well as zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso length and zzso distribution of the zzso signal are further modulated by over zzso functionally distinct zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The present review summarizes the key properties of the molecular machinery that generates the zzso signal and highlights how it is deployed in neuroendocrine zzso
