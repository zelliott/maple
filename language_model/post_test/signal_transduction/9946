A limited number of zzso zzso signal zzso pathways are repeatedly zzso during development to regulate a wide range of zzso Here we describe a new negative regulator of zzso signaling and identify a potential mechanism by which the zzso of responses resulting from zzso zzso is generated in zzso As part of a genetic interaction screen, we have identified Ken & Barbie zzso , which is an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso , as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso Ken genetically interacts with the zzso in zzso and recognizes a DNA consensus sequence overlapping that of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate the existence of zzso and zzso zzso binding sites, while zzso expressed Ken is sufficient to zzso a subset of zzso zzso target genes in zzso Finally, we show that zzso Ken specifically zzso zzso expression of zzso veins lacking zzso in the zzso zzso Ken therefore represents a novel regulator of zzso signaling whose dynamic spatial and zzso expression is capable of selectively modulating the zzso repertoire zzso by activated zzso in zzso
