The zzso zzso provides a major platform for zzso zzso which act upon zzso proteins in zzso zzso cargo proteins are recognized by zzso zzso inherent to key zzso proteins at the plasma membrane and sorting zzso A balance between zzso and zzso activities may govern the efficiency of recycling from zzso to the plasma membrane versus zzso sorting through the zzso body zzso We discuss the current knowledge of the properties of zzso and zzso proteins and their effects upon the trafficking and signaling of receptors and zzso associated with pathways fundamental to zzso
