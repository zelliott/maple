Here, we address the role of the zzso zzso complex in the response to zzso rendered dysfunctional by deletion of the zzso component zzso Using conditional zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is required for zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso This establishes that zzso is the only sensor for the zzso zzso and suggests that zzso might block zzso signaling by interfering with zzso binding to the zzso zzso possibly by zzso the zzso end in the zzso zzso We also examined the role of the zzso zzso in zzso end joining zzso of damaged zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso that occur in zzso consistent with the requirement for zzso and its target zzso in this zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso at dysfunctional zzso in zzso specifically at zzso generated by zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso ends were not prone to fuse in the absence of either zzso or zzso indicating zzso in their zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso by promoting the generation of a 3' zzso after completion of zzso DNA zzso zzso may ensure zzso formation by recruiting zzso (and other zzso to newly generated zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso by the dysfunctional zzso is proposed to induce zzso that protects the zzso ends from zzso when zzso is zzso Thus, the role of zzso at dysfunctional zzso is zzso involving both repression of zzso in zzso through end zzso and induction of zzso in zzso through zzso zzso
