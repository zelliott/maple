zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are widely prescribed zzso drugs, but their use may induce zzso intolerance and zzso zzso beta cell dysfunction contributes to these zzso effects through mechanisms that remain to be zzso In this study, we hypothesized that zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso following zzso zzso zzso stress could be one of the underlying mechanisms involved in zzso beta cell zzso We report here that zzso did not affect zzso insulin release but zzso inhibited zzso insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment also decreased both zzso and insulin zzso leading to a marked reduction in cellular insulin zzso These zzso zzso effects were found to be prevented by prior treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated with zzso of two of the three branches of the zzso Indeed, zzso induced a zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso pathways but was found to reduce the zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso These zzso of zzso stress pathways were accompanied by zzso of zzso 10 and increased zzso zzso 3, indicating that long term exposure to zzso ultimately promotes zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the zzso of insulin zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso cells results, at least in part, from a zzso impairment in zzso zzso which may lead to zzso cell zzso
