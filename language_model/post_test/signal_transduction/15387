The zzso protein Ras plays a central role in the regulation of various cellular zzso acting as a molecular switch that triggers signaling zzso Only Ras bound to zzso is able to interact strongly with zzso proteins like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas in the zzso state, the stability of the complex is strongly zzso and signaling is zzso To determine whether this process is only controlled by the stability of the complex, we used zzso protein design to improve the interaction between Ras and zzso We challenged the zzso complex in this study because zzso among all zzso shows the highest Ras affinity and the fastest association zzso The proposed zzso were characterized as to their changes in dynamics and binding zzso We demonstrate that zzso interaction can only be improved at the cost of a loss in specificity of zzso versus zzso As shown by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso leads to a shift of Ras switch I in the zzso as well as in the zzso state, thereby increasing the complex zzso In a zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso is associated with higher signaling activity, which appears to be a mere matter of zzso zzso
