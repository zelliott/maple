zzso zzso are critical to the zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso as they facilitate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso membrane and associated signaling patterns is a current focus of therapeutic zzso Many tumor membrane targets are simultaneously targeted by zzso zzso thus forming recognizable zzso zzso We sought to use this immune response to identify novel zzso targets for zzso Using a novel strategy, we interrogated zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso Our analysis unveiled zzso zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso target that is highly expressed in zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso biology by zzso zzso zzso thereby solidifying zzso structures and providing a scaffold for critical signaling zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso blocked migration toward zzso in zzso zzso and to bone zzso in an in zzso zzso model, confirming a role for zzso in leukemia zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso block zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso Our data demonstrate a novel strategy to identify cancer membrane target zzso using zzso zzso zzso In addition, we identify zzso as a zzso target in zzso with confirmed zzso zzso This clinical trial was registered at zzso study ID zzso zzso zzso
