zzso a group of zzso zzso zzso are competitive zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene cluster has been cloned previously from zzso zzso The cluster contains 25 complete zzso including zzso The zzso gene was zzso by the zzso of a zzso resistance gene and the resulting disruption zzso failed to produce zzso Moreover, the zzso production was restored by zzso with a single copy of zzso The deduced product of zzso bears striking sequence similarity with zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli and zzso to apparent zzso by affinity zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso or its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also found to catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to their corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso to their respective zzso derivatives in zzso This was zzso shown by using zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso or by comparing the reaction product with an authentic standard of zzso These results indicated that zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso
