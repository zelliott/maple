zzso zzso zzso zzso which possesses zzso zzso and single strand DNA zzso activities, plays a role in maintaining zzso zzso We found that zzso is synthetic lethal with zzso and exhibits a synergistic growth zzso with zzso and zzso which are members of the zzso zzso group important for tolerance of DNA damage during DNA zzso The zzso zzso is not sensitive to zzso agents, but the zzso zzso double zzso has increased sensitivity to zzso and a greatly increased spontaneous zzso zzso Growth defects of zzso zzso double zzso are suppressed by a zzso in zzso zzso a DNA zzso or by zzso of zzso More over, zzso zzso suppresses the temperature sensitivity of zzso in zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso also suppresses the growth zzso of a zzso zzso caused by expression of zzso coli zzso a bacterial Holliday junction zzso These findings suggest that zzso is essential for preventing zzso instability caused by replication fork arrest in cells deficient in the zzso zzso and may zzso replication fork movement zzso by zzso zzso zzso
