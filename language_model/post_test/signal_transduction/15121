Mice deficient in the zzso zzso zzso have attenuated inflammatory responses to zzso infection associated with decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso after exposure to zzso In this study, we show that the abnormal zzso production is related to impaired zzso zzso Despite their abnormal response to zzso zzso zzso zzso produced amounts of zzso similar to those in zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso of zzso events was normal in the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso a zzso response activated by zzso was reduced by zzso zzso This reduction could be zzso in zzso zzso with the use of iron zzso In contrast, zzso expression of zzso a zzso response, was normal in zzso zzso zzso and was unaffected by iron zzso Our data suggest that low zzso iron selectively zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso to zzso and results in reduced zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, by mimicking the altered iron metabolism associated with zzso zzso we found that 3 different zzso of zzso attenuated zzso and zzso zzso Thus, manipulation of iron zzso could represent a new therapeutic approach to controlling zzso
