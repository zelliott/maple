The zzso distribution of the zzso growth factor zzso and its interaction with second zzso proteins has been explored using tagging with green fluorescent protein and its zzso zzso itself has been fused with zzso and its natural life cycle and its zzso in response to zzso zzso Several second zzso proteins including zzso and zzso have also been zzso with fluorescent proteins and their zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso has been zzso The physical interaction of the zzso with second zzso has been studied by zzso and other proximity zzso These systems will not only reveal much about the zzso of the system in live cells but may also be useful for observing the effects of signal zzso inhibitor drugs such as zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, they have the potential to be developed into screens for new compounds which affect the zzso
