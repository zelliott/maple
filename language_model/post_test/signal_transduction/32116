zzso navigating in a chemical zzso are exposed to a periodic stream of zzso zzso The periodic stimulation zzso zzso zzso that control looping steering zzso It is not known how zzso sample zzso molecules during periodic stimulation and adjust their zzso We report that sea zzso zzso sampled molecules for zzso s before a zzso response was zzso Additional molecules delivered during a zzso response reset the cell by causing a pronounced zzso drop that terminated the zzso this reset was followed by a new zzso zzso After zzso zzso adapted their sensitivity following the zzso zzso Taking into account the zzso sensitivity, we estimate that zzso can register a minimal zzso of zzso zzso and be attracted from as far away as zzso zzso Many zzso sense stimulus zzso along periodic paths to translate a spatial distribution of the stimulus into a zzso pattern of the cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and adaptation might control zzso sensing in such organisms as zzso
