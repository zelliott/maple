The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of immune responses, zzso zzso and zzso Here, we show that inflammatory stimuli such as zzso induce the expression of zzso in human zzso cells zzso associated with an zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso In zzso data confirmed the elevated expression of zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso in zzso of B6 zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso both normal and zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso control of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso induction of zzso was zzso as shown in mouse embryonic zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso induction of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso compared with wild type zzso cells and zzso expression of zzso restored the expression of zzso and induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the human zzso gene identified three putative zzso elements upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified one zzso site as responsible for zzso the induction of zzso expression by zzso and zzso shift zzso demonstrated that this zzso motif is recognized by the zzso zzso Our results show for the first time that zzso zzso is a critical component regulating the expression of zzso and the induction of zzso gene expression in immune cells illustrating the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso
