We formulate a spectral zzso zzso that uses the two leading zzso of the zzso corresponding to a selected quality function to split a network into three communities in a single zzso In so doing, we extend the zzso zzso methods developed by Newman zzso zzso zzso Newman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E 74, zzso zzso to allow one to consider the best available zzso and three-way divisions at each zzso zzso We illustrate the method using simple zzso zzso examples and then apply the zzso to examine the community structures of the zzso graph of network scientists and of zzso zzso Congressional networks zzso from roll call voting zzso
