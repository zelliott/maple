zzso cells are the principal zzso of the zzso zzso and are characterized by a large and highly zzso zzso zzso For this reason, they have for a long time been an attractive model system to study the regulation of zzso growth and zzso In this article, I will first review studies on different aspects of zzso cell zzso development and then go on to present studies which have aimed at zzso altering zzso cell zzso zzso Some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms which have been shown by these studies to be important zzso of zzso cell zzso development will be discussed, in particular the role of the parallel fiber zzso of hormones, and of zzso growth zzso The zzso slice culture method will be introduced as an important experimental tool to study zzso cell zzso development under controlled zzso Using zzso slice cultures, protein zzso C zzso has been identified as a major zzso of zzso cell zzso development and the contribution of specific zzso of zzso will be zzso Finally, it will be shown that zzso cell zzso development in slice cultures does not depend on the zzso of zzso receptors and appears to be independent of the presence of the zzso zzso These studies indicate that the initial outgrowth of the zzso cell zzso tree can occur in the absence of signals derived from zzso zzso but is under control of zzso zzso
