The zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso is a crucial contributor to the regulation of zzso from the zzso gene zzso The zzso gene encodes a major milk zzso which is expressed in zzso zzso cells during zzso and can be induced by zzso hormones in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso We have investigated the specific zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso cells from zzso mice revealed molecules with identical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso in zzso cells has a higher zzso zzso than zzso found in zzso Little zzso activity was detected in nuclear extracts from zzso cells cultured in the absence of zzso zzso zzso hormone treatment of zzso cells led to a strong induction of zzso zzso The induction of zzso activity as well as zzso of the zzso promoter were suppressed when zzso growth factor was present in the tissue culture medium simultaneously with the zzso zzso In zzso animals, zzso activity is regulated by zzso milk zzso and systemic hormone zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso animals, 16 days zzso contain drastically reduced zzso activity after removal of the zzso for only 8 zzso The zzso of zzso by pup withdrawal was slower in early zzso 6 days zzso We also investigated the relative contributions of local signals, generated by milk zzso and systemic hormone signals to the regulation of zzso zzso The access to one row of zzso zzso of zzso mothers was denied to the zzso for 24 zzso High levels of zzso were found in the accessible zzso zzso and intermediate levels of zzso were found in the zzso zzso of the same zzso Very low zzso levels were detected when the zzso were removed from the zzso for 24 zzso We conclude that systemic as well as local signals cooperate in the in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
