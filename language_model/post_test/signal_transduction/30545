zzso respond to zzso radiation through an intricate network of interacting signaling zzso that are engaged in the regulation of diverse cellular functions, such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and zzso While changes in protein zzso activity, and zzso zzso may directly mediate these responses, zzso in gene expression also represent a central component of the pathways zzso Studies of altered gene expression have historically played an important role in zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular radiation zzso In recent years, functional zzso approaches, such as zzso zzso have been developed that can simultaneously monitor changes in gene expression across essentially the entire zzso However, analogous methods for global zzso of protein expression or modification have lagged zzso As global zzso profiling has become increasingly accessible, the quantity of information on gene expression responses to zzso has increased zzso While many such experiments have provided improved insight into various aspects of radiation response, the diversity of experimental models and details of radiation dose, timing, and data analysis that have been employed means that no single consistent picture has emerged zzso More sophisticated methods for data analysis, data mining, and reverse engineering to reconstruct the underlying response pathways are continually being developed, and can extract additional value from profiling zzso As methods for the global study of other zzso become more routine, it will be important to integrate the results of radiation response profiling across multiple biological levels, and to build from simpler experimental systems toward more complex zzso and in zzso zzso The future development of zzso models of radiation response should add substantially to the understanding gained from gene expression studies zzso
