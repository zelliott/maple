In response to zzso availability or medium zzso the sensor zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso control the expression of the zzso zzso coding for the high affinity zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The stimulus for zzso to undergo zzso is believed to be a change in zzso or some effect zzso reflecting the role of zzso as an important zzso zzso zzso The zzso sensor zzso zzso was zzso as a fusion protein containing six zzso zzso zzso two zzso acids before the C zzso This zzso protein was functional in zzso and in zzso zzso was zzso from zzso membrane zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso oxide followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso to zzso zzso The zzso protein was not active with respect to zzso but retained the ability to bind zzso zzso was zzso into zzso in a zzso zzso orientation as revealed by zzso accessibility and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity, and the zzso group could be transferred to zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to be the only protein that mediates zzso of zzso approximately zzso
