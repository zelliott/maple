Different zzso processes are selectively controlled by a zzso system based on transient rises or zzso of zzso calcium zzso which transmit zzso signals at zzso zzso When treated with a zzso concentration of caffeine, skeletal muscle cells provide a suitable preparation to study mechanisms which generate repetitive calcium zzso Based on optical zzso zzso of local zzso of individual zzso we have shown substantial enhancement of spontaneous repetitive calcium release in the presence of zzso caffeine zzso zzso release zzso to neighbor calcium sources and forms slow contraction zzso A power zzso density analysis has revealed parameters of the time course of these zzso However, substantial amounts of calcium released in zzso are not zzso
