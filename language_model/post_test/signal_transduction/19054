The zzso family of zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of a wide range of zzso responses in zzso The zzso zzso contains five zzso zzso among which zzso and zzso play the most important zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in the dark and accumulate in the nucleus under light conditions, inducing specific zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso is therefore considered a key regulatory step of these zzso In fact, one of the most severe zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso red zzso zzso 1), is strongly affected in nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso lacking both zzso and its only close zzso zzso is virtually blind to zzso light like zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso accounts for residual amounts of zzso in the nucleus in a zzso background and that nuclear zzso of zzso is completely inhibited in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso interact with each other in a zzso manner and that they zzso in zzso nuclear zzso We also identify a zzso site at the zzso of zzso and zzso and show that the zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso are sufficient for the interaction with zzso
