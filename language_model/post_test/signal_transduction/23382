Cystic zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso is a zzso zzso channel, which plays an important role in zzso zzso and fluid zzso and is defective in several zzso Although its zzso by zzso and zzso has been studied zzso its regulation by receptors is less well zzso To study signaling involved in zzso zzso we measured zzso zzso currents in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso In cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso caused strong zzso of zzso through two zzso the zzso zzso mechanism and a second mechanism that involves zzso zzso The role of zzso was suggested by partial zzso of zzso stimulation by the specific zzso inhibitor zzso The role of zzso zzso was suggested by zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso that lack 15 zzso or 9 zzso consensus sequences and are unresponsive to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the residual zzso response was sensitive to zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso acts on zzso directly and through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso and zzso zzso contribute to zzso regulation by zzso that are expressed at the zzso membrane of zzso and airway zzso
