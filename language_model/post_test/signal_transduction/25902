Cotton fibers zzso zzso are zzso zzso that differentiate from the zzso zzso zzso and fast-growing cells generally expand at the zzso zzso zone zzso zzso however, previous studies suggest that zzso fiber cells expand via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and active secretary zzso trafficking are two important phenomena of zzso Recently, a high zzso zzso is found in the zzso of zzso cotton fiber cells near the growing zzso Several protein coding genes participating in zzso coating and transport are highly expressed in zzso fiber zzso Taken together with the observation that zzso acts as a positive regulator for cotton fiber and several zzso zzso that are known to zzso via tip growth prompted us to propose a zzso mode for similar cell zzso
