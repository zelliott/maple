zzso zzso is common in zzso prostate cancer, though the zzso of zzso deletion and its downstream effects have not been zzso in clinical samples of hormone zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso to zzso independence is pivotal in prostate cancer and zzso largely by the zzso zzso zzso Since this process is distinct from zzso zzso we examined zzso of the zzso gene in locally advanced zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso deletion status were correlated with activated downstream zzso zzso zzso proteins and with the zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso deletions in zzso zzso samples of 59 zzso patients with known clinical outcome was assessed by zzso FISH zzso FISH was performed using six zzso clones spanning both zzso zzso zzso regions and the zzso gene zzso and a zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso copy number was also evaluated in a subset of cases using single zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the samples were zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene was deleted in zzso of cases, with zzso showing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletions zzso In a subset of the study group, zzso array analysis confirmed the FISH zzso zzso zzso deletion was significantly correlated to the expression of downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion is common in zzso with zzso loss zzso to zzso mortality and associated with zzso and zzso zzso
