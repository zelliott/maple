zzso targeting of zzso receptors is critical for zzso responses to zzso zzso cues, yet the underlying trafficking mechanisms remain zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso receptors for zzso zzso are zzso zzso to zzso via zzso in sympathetic zzso Using zzso cultures, we show that mature receptors on zzso zzso surfaces are zzso and zzso via zzso recycling zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso disrupted zzso transport and zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso delivery and zzso into zzso growth cones is enhanced by nerve growth factor zzso acting locally on zzso zzso zzso zzso recycling attenuated zzso signaling and zzso growth while enhancing recycling zzso increased zzso sensitivity to zzso Our results reveal regulated zzso as an unexpected mode of zzso trafficking that serves to rapidly mobilize zzso receptors to growth cones, thus providing a positive feedback mechanism by which limiting zzso of zzso zzso enhance zzso zzso
