The development of zzso cancer zzso is strongly correlated with the zzso zzso of multiple zzso signaling zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways which usually function zzso In addition, zzso between these pathways forms a complicated signaling network that is regulated by zzso zzso zzso most of the currently used and zzso zzso agents might not always be zzso zzso Moreover, long-term use of these agents often generates drug zzso These problems highlight the urgent need for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is a major active compound present in many medicinal herbs that have long been used for the clinical treatment of zzso Although previous studies have demonstrated an zzso effect for zzso the precise mechanisms of its zzso activity are not well zzso In the present study, using zzso mouse zzso model and the zzso human colon zzso cell line, we evaluated the efficacy of zzso against tumor growth in zzso and in zzso and investigated the underlying molecular zzso We found that zzso zzso cancer growth without apparent zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly suppresses the zzso of several zzso signaling pathways and alters the expression of critical target zzso These molecular effects lead to the induction of zzso and zzso of cellular zzso These data demonstrate that zzso possesses a broad range of zzso activities due to its ability to affect multiple zzso targets, suggesting that zzso could be a novel zzso therapeutic agent for cancer zzso
