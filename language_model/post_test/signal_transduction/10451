Recent studies have shown that zzso protein zzso is not just a predictor of cardiovascular events but also acts directly as a zzso stimulus in vascular zzso In this report, we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying vascular cellular zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and this induction was inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso a nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso promoter activity, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso sites resulted in a loss of zzso Finally, an zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed binding of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso induction by zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso signaling pathways in vascular zzso zzso
