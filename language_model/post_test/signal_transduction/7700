zzso neural stem cells zzso have been derived from human embryonic stem cells zzso as well as isolated from fetal zzso However, there have been few exclusive markers of zzso identified to date, and the differences between zzso from various sources are poorly zzso Although cells isolated from these two sources share many important zzso it is not clear how closely they are related in terms of gene zzso Here, we compare the gene expression profiles of 11 lines of zzso derived from zzso zzso four lines of zzso isolated from fetus zzso and two lines of restricted zzso in order to characterize these cell populations and identify differences between zzso derived from these two zzso We showed that zzso were clustered together with high zzso similarities but were distinguished from zzso zzso precursor cells, and zzso precursor zzso There were 17 genes expressed in both zzso and zzso whose expression was not identified in restricted neural zzso Furthermore, the major differences between zzso and zzso were mostly observed in genes related to the key neural differentiation zzso Here, we show that comparison of global gene expression profiles of zzso zzso and restricted neural zzso cells makes it possible to identify some of the common characteristics of zzso and differences between similar stem cell populations derived from zzso or isolated from fetal zzso Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this zzso
