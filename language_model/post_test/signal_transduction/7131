The lack of innovative drug targets for zzso zzso zzso limits patient survival to approximately 1 year following zzso The zzso zzso zzso provides an ideal target for the treatment of zzso as zzso signaling is frequently activated in this cancer zzso However, the central role of zzso in zzso processes limits its potential as a therapeutic zzso In this report, we show that the zzso zzso zzso is a novel regulator of zzso zzso using a combination of small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso establish zzso acid, the product of the zzso reaction, as an essential component for the membrane recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity and subsequent zzso zzso decreases zzso cell viability by specifically zzso zzso zzso We propose a mechanism zzso zzso of zzso by zzso prevents binding of zzso zzso domain zzso domain containing zzso zzso an interaction known to inhibit zzso zzso These findings provide a novel framework through which zzso zzso can be achieved without directly targeting the zzso
