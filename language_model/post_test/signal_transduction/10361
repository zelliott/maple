zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and represents a potential therapeutic target for this zzso We have reported previously that growth zzso zzso of zzso enhance the expression and activity of zzso and that this effect could represent an escape mechanism to the growth zzso and zzso cell death induced by zzso In this study, we investigate whether the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Pharmaceuticals, zzso United zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso might have a cooperative zzso effect on zzso cell zzso 

The interaction of zzso and zzso was evaluated in zzso on zzso cell lines by median drug effect analysis calculating a combination index with zzso software and in zzso by using zzso zzso in nude zzso The mechanism of zzso and zzso interactions was also studied by analysis of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso 

zzso exposure to zzso and zzso produced synergistic zzso and zzso effects compared with single drug zzso Furthermore, daily treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with an zzso regimen zzso units zzso three times zzso induced tumor growth delay and increased survival rate on established zzso zzso in nude zzso Moreover, the zzso treatment with zzso suppressed the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso both in zzso and in zzso 

The observed cooperative zzso effects could be, at least in part, explained by the zzso exerted by zzso of an zzso zzso survival pathway, which involves zzso zzso zzso zzso These results provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of zzso in combination with zzso in zzso
