zzso is an essential component of organ development, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly zzso We analyze here the formation of the zzso zzso cardiac zzso that arises from the migration and subsequent zzso of bilateral rows of zzso Our study of cell behavior using three-dimensional and zzso imaging and the distribution of cell polarity markers reveals a new mechanism of zzso in which zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso membrane properties and cell shape zzso constitute the main driving zzso Furthermore, we identify a genetic zzso in which zzso zzso held out wings, and zzso control cardiac zzso formation by establishing zzso zzso zzso and regulating cell shape zzso From these data we propose a model for zzso zzso cardiac zzso formation, which zzso both at a cellular and molecular level, from current models of zzso zzso We suggest that this new example of tube formation may be helpful in studying zzso heart tube formation and primary zzso
