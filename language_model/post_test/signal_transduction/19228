zzso airway inflammation is a disease in which T helper 2 zzso cells have a critical zzso The molecular mechanisms controlling zzso differentiation and function are of paramount importance in biology and zzso Recently, a network of zzso adapters and zzso has been shown to be essential in this process zzso to its function in regulating cell polarity and the zzso of critical zzso zzso Here, we show in zzso data showing that zzso zzso mice show impaired lung inflammation and have defective zzso differentiation ex zzso with zzso in zzso polarity and the selective zzso of zzso and nuclear factor of activated T zzso zzso These results establish zzso as a novel zzso adapter in zzso differentiation and zzso
