zzso acid zzso is an zzso zzso acid zzso capable of transporting zzso from the mildly zzso zzso medium into the cell zzso The resulting zzso zzso suppresses many cellular zzso The current study was aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in cultured cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were left zzso or treated with zzso Cell death was assessed by measuring zzso activity, zzso membrane zzso formation and release of zzso zzso DNA fragments, and cellular zzso Cell viability and zzso activity were monitored by zzso zzso Nuclear zzso was used to zzso the effects of zzso on cell zzso The activity of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways was studied by zzso with specific zzso zzso activity in zzso cells was determined by zzso kits measuring zzso resulting from the zzso of an artificial zzso All statistical analyses were performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Here we report that treatment of the zzso human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso activity of the zzso cells is rapidly impaired, and the cells arrest in cell cycle in response to zzso zzso we show that zzso promotes the zzso and zzso zzso pathways by efficiently zzso the activity of zzso and zzso zzso 

Our studies zzso how zzso zzso several cellular zzso thereby zzso the proliferation and survival of zzso zzso zzso These zzso effects make zzso a potential candidate for the treatment of zzso invasive zzso zzso
