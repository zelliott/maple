zzso zzso domain family member 1) is zzso expressed in cardiac and skeletal zzso It acts as a key zzso of muscle development, and zzso multiple target genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation zzso However, its target genes in skeletal muscles, regulatory mechanisms and networks are zzso 

In this paper, we have identified 136 target genes regulated directly by zzso in skeletal muscle using integrated analyses of zzso Most of the targets take part in the cell process, physiology process, biological regulation metabolism and development zzso The targets also play an important role in zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso and insulin signaling zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso through binding to the zzso element in zzso promoter, demonstrated with independent zzso zzso and zzso reporter system zzso In addition, results of zzso and zzso experiments suggest that zzso is positively regulated by zzso 

Our present data suggests that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and different signaling pathways may zzso with each other zzso by zzso We have preliminarily concluded that zzso may regulate zzso expression through zzso and zzso signaling pathways in skeletal zzso These findings provide important clues for further analysis of the role of zzso gene in the formation and transformation of skeletal muscle fiber zzso
