zzso zzso stimulates DNA synthesis and zzso zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the recently discovered family of zzso the zzso produced in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The goal of our study is to establish the effect of zzso on zzso production by zzso cells, as well to determine the receptors responsible for these zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso was measured as an increase of viable cell number and zzso zzso zzso gene expression and protein synthesis were determined by Northern zzso and zzso zzso We also determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to establish the role of zzso zzso in zzso effect, as well as to determine the type of receptors involved in these zzso 

Our results show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression in bovine zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso effect was partially abolished by treatment with zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso 1, zzso formation in these zzso These effects were partially inhibited by zzso In competitive binding zzso two binding sites were recognized on zzso with zzso zzso zzso and binding site zzso at equilibrium similar to those previously described in smooth muscle cells and likely represent zzso binding to its own zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso 

These studies expand the potential scope of the zzso significance of zzso released during zzso injury, to include zzso of zzso cell zzso
