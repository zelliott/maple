Management of pain by zzso analgesics is zzso by central adverse effects that limit clinical zzso zzso there is considerable interest to understand peripheral zzso effects of zzso The actions of zzso on peripheral sensory zzso have been difficult to study because of a general lack of effect of zzso zzso on zzso function in culture despite documented presence of zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, or zzso release in primary cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso However, after brief exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and inhibited both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso The effect of BK was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso and was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso of protein zzso C zzso or by administration of zzso acid zzso The enhanced responsiveness of zzso zzso signaling by BK zzso was blocked by both zzso and zzso zzso however, the effect of AA was blocked only by a zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso signaling in primary sensory zzso zzso is enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso receptors via a zzso AA zzso that is downstream of zzso
