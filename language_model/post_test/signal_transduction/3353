The mechanisms underlying adult stem cell zzso are likely to be diverse and have not yet been investigated zzso Here we conducted an unbiased genetic screen using zzso zzso zzso stem cells to probe essential functions regulating zzso of zzso stem zzso Surprisingly, we find that niche zzso emerges as the most commonly affected essential stem cell property, and that proliferation is critical for stem cell zzso We also find that zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso stem cell function, whereas zzso dysfunction and zzso oxygen species production lead to stem cell zzso Moreover, we find that most genes required specifically in the stem cell of the zzso stem cell lineage are widely expressed but are not required for the maintenance of zzso zzso stem zzso These findings highlight the fundamental characteristics of zzso stem cells as an important stem cell paradigm that contrasts with some other stem cell models, where repression of differentiation or relative zzso is zzso
