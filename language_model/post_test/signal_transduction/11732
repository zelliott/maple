zzso binding and insulin zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso were determined in cultured zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso and zzso red zzso in order to further zzso the putative calcium binding site on the zzso These zzso increased insulin zzso high affinity binding and the sensitivity of these responses to zzso The insulin concentration required to zzso stimulate zzso acid zzso decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The effect of zzso and zzso was more pronounced on insulin zzso zzso zzso These agents also increased zzso zzso reducing the percentage of occupied receptors required for zzso insulin stimulation of zzso acid zzso from zzso in control cells to zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso occupancy required to produce zzso insulin responses on zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso We zzso that since zzso and zzso have similar effects, that occupation of zzso binding sites on the zzso produces a zzso change in the insulin zzso which increases insulin zzso zzso insulin sensitivity and acts on an early zzso event responsible for zzso binding to insulin zzso
