zzso are zzso zzso bacteria capable of surviving within zzso zzso zzso island 2 zzso is required for growth within zzso and for zzso in zzso In this study, we show the involvement of zzso in a signal zzso zzso that zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso zzso were induced in zzso by infection with zzso zzso compared to a strain carrying a zzso in the zzso zzso which is zzso within zzso The two strains had the same effect on the expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso expression was dose zzso blocked by treatment of infected zzso with the protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso while zzso expression was increased by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was higher in zzso infected with zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso which is an important zzso of zzso zzso correlated with the levels of zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso cause an zzso increase in zzso activity that leads to zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by an zzso zzso did not affect the growth of zzso zzso within zzso whereas growth was dose zzso inhibited by zzso suggesting that the zzso signaling zzso plays a significant role in zzso zzso zzso
