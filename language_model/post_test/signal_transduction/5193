zzso of zzso are the leading cause of death of patients with type 2 zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms by which insulin resistance and zzso contribute to zzso in key target zzso zzso vessel wall, zzso zzso can assist in the design of therapeutic zzso We have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso and that targeted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice zzso improves zzso zzso metabolism and decreases zzso zzso setting the stage for a potential zzso effect of this zzso Surprisingly, we report here that when zzso mice are zzso with low density zzso zzso zzso mice zzso they develop larger zzso root zzso zzso than zzso controls despite lower plasma cholesterol and zzso zzso The zzso is unaffected by zzso bone zzso from zzso mice into zzso mice, indicating that it is independent of zzso cells and suggesting that the primary zzso in zzso mice occurs in the vessel zzso zzso in isolated zzso cells from zzso mice indicate that zzso favors zzso nuclear zzso and exerts target zzso effects, resulting in higher zzso and zzso expression and increased zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso can promote vascular zzso changes conducive to zzso plaque zzso
