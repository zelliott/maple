zzso acts on zzso zzso to stimulate the synthesis and release of zzso and zzso However, the signaling pathways downstream of the zzso zzso that mediate these effects are not fully zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso to zzso in 5 zzso but zzso of zzso zzso zzso has slower zzso reaching only zzso after 30 zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and partially blocked by zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus in a zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression in zzso cells via zzso zzso with zzso or calcium channel zzso indicated that calcium influx is important for the induction of both genes by zzso In conclusion, these results show that zzso activates all three zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso protein expression through calcium and zzso zzso These results also demonstrate that the nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso requires zzso zzso
