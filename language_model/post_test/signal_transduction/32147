The zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in a staggering array of cellular processes including zzso zzso zzso regulation, DNA damage repair, and assembly of zzso complexes, such as zzso zzso II and small zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism for all of these zzso zzso associated activities is zzso Here we document that, during the zzso of zzso zzso (including zzso the assembly factor zzso holds the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso (as components of the zzso zzso are required to pry zzso from zzso zzso the zzso domain captured by zzso harbors most zzso underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating the interface between the two proteins as a target of this bone zzso failure zzso zzso in on the essential first steps of zzso zzso zzso our findings provide the first insight into the mechanism of action of zzso and zzso in the assembly of zzso zzso
