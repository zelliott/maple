zzso and ecological characteristics of sun and shade leaves have been compared in detail, but their zzso zzso in particular their light sensory mechanisms, are still zzso This study compares the development of sun and shade leaves of zzso album zzso paying special attention to the light sensory zzso We hypothesized that mature leaves sense the light environment, and that this information determines anatomy of new zzso To examine this hypothesis, we shaded plants zzso In the zzso zzso treatment zzso the shoot zzso with developing leaves was covered by a cap made of a zzso screen and received zzso active zzso flux density zzso of 60 zzso zzso zzso while the remaining mature leaves were exposed to 360 zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso treatment zzso the zzso was exposed while the mature leaves were covered by a shade zzso After these treatments for 6 zzso we analyzed leaf anatomy and zzso zzso The anatomy of LA leaves with a zzso zzso tissue was similar to that of sun leaves, while their zzso were zzso with thick zzso The anatomy of zzso leaves and shade leaves was similar and both had zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso leaves were zzso having thin zzso These results clearly demonstrate that new leaves differentiate depending on the light environment of mature leaves, while zzso differentiate depending on the local light zzso
