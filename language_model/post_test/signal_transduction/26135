We investigated the role of zzso oxygen species zzso in promoting cell survival during zzso stress induced by the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso in cerebral zzso zzso cells zzso from newborn zzso zzso is the major zzso of zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso stress and zzso in zzso We present novel data that zzso zzso zzso zzso also initiate a cell survival mechanism by increasing production of a gaseous zzso zzso carbon monoxide zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly enhanced zzso CO production in a zzso and zzso zzso manner in zzso with zzso but not with small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso compound, inhibited zzso zzso production and enhanced cell survival in zzso zzso The zzso zzso survival mechanism requires functional interactions between the protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways activated by zzso In zzso zzso zzso and in cells with zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activities, zzso was no longer capable of blocking zzso zzso and zzso caused by zzso Overall, zzso zzso zzso zzso initiate both death and survival pathways in zzso zzso The zzso cell survival zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso via a mechanism that includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso The ability of CO to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in an zzso manner appears to be the key element in zzso survival of zzso cells during zzso brain inflammatory zzso
