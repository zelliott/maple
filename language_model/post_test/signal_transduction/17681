For more than a decade it has been known that certain growth factors inhibit zzso in genetically determined and experimental models of inner and outer retinal zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying these protective effects and the signaling that supports the survival of zzso and retinal zzso cells in these models have recently come under more in depth zzso This paper reviews our current understanding of the balance of zzso and zzso signals that determine cell fate in the zzso and how the zzso of key signal zzso pathways by specific classes of zzso protects retinal zzso
