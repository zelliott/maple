We have identified and zzso 54 genes that exhibit zzso expression in the zzso Our hypothesis is that such zzso molecules are likely to zzso proteins that are zzso associated with particular zzso processes intrinsic to zzso zzso and therefore might contribute to the regional specificity of zzso observed in zzso disorders such as zzso disease zzso zzso of these genes was measured simultaneously in the zzso of HD zzso transgenic mice using zzso zzso zzso We found a decrease in expression of zzso of zzso genes in HD transgenic zzso Changes in expression of genes associated with zzso signaling and calcium zzso were zzso The most striking zzso was observed for a newly identified zzso of the sodium channel, beta 4, with dramatic decreases in expression beginning at 8 weeks of zzso A subset of zzso genes was tested by real-time zzso in zzso samples from human HD zzso Similar zzso in expression were observed in human HD and the zzso model for the zzso genes zzso zzso of 15 of the zzso genes was measured in zzso rats to determine their dependence on zzso zzso No changes in expression were observed for any of these zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso protein causes selective deficits in the expression of zzso responsible for zzso physiology and these may contribute to the regional specificity of zzso observed in zzso
