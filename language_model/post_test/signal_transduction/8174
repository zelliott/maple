Members of the zzso zzso provide a model for defining host responses to invasive zzso zzso Active zzso of zzso zzso across the gut zzso barrier is zzso by interaction of bacterial zzso zzso and its zzso host zzso zzso whereas zzso across zzso patches through zzso is zzso To define microbial zzso and molecular zzso of the host response to zzso via these two routes, we zzso zzso transgenic mice expressing the human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso relative zzso zzso or with zzso zzso a prominent gut zzso Mouse zzso combined with zzso zzso software, were used to identify zzso signaling pathways that comprise the response to zzso zzso zzso versus the other zzso zzso and zzso experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, demonstrated that the zzso zzso signature of the response to zzso zzso zzso is largely zzso in the zzso zzso zzso responses include zzso of gene networks involved in various aspects of zzso zzso acid, and energy metabolism and zzso of zzso zzso The host response is markedly attenuated in a zzso zzso zzso despite its ability to be zzso to the zzso zzso Together, these studies establish that zzso rather than bacterial invasion of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is a dominant zzso of the intensity of the host response to zzso zzso infection via the oral zzso
