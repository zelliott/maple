The zzso fusion protein is created by the zzso between zzso 11 and 22 that appears in most Ewing's zzso This zzso protein has been demonstrated to be an zzso zzso zzso Genes up regulated by zzso but not by full-length zzso were identified by zzso difference analysis zzso We have characterized a novel zzso zzso activated transcript 2 zzso that was cloned from a zzso zzso library using a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso expression is seen within zzso h of zzso zzso Its expression zzso with transformation of zzso cells by zzso proteins related to zzso but not by unrelated zzso zzso is expressed in normal zzso zzso and contains a unique but zzso functional zzso zzso An zzso sequence in the human zzso has been identified and mapped to zzso zzso Human zzso transcripts were identified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso in Ewing's zzso cell zzso cell zzso zzso unique structure and correlation with transformation make it a candidate for playing a role in the transformation of zzso cells and the zzso of Ewing's zzso
