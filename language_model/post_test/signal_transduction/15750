Despite effective chemotherapy to treat zzso infections, zzso rates are extremely zzso Resistance to zzso can zzso however it typically takes several years following numerous rounds of treatment and zzso and often develops in only a small cohort of zzso Using a well-established and highly zzso mouse model, we investigated whether zzso mechanisms influence the development of zzso Following zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso infected mice we observed a significant and mixed zzso response, characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the elevated zzso response in zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso this did not zzso any protection from a secondary challenge zzso Because a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso was observed, we zzso that zzso was zzso the development of zzso zzso of zzso combined with zzso treatment afforded a greater than 50% reduction in zzso establishment during zzso compared to zzso treatment alone, indicating that zzso zzso the development of acquired zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and circulating zzso characterized the zzso This study demonstrates that blocking zzso zzso during zzso treatment can facilitate the development of protective immunity and provide a highly effective strategy to protect against zzso with zzso zzso
