The zzso function of cellular prion protein zzso is not yet zzso Recent findings suggest that zzso may have zzso properties, and its absence increases zzso to zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the role of zzso in zzso brain injury in zzso 

zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice were subjected to zzso transient or permanent focal cerebral zzso followed by zzso volume analysis 24 hours after zzso To identify effects of zzso deletion on mechanisms regulating zzso cell death, expression analysis of several zzso and zzso proteins was performed at 6 and 24 hours after transient zzso and in zzso controls using Western zzso or zzso 

zzso mice displayed significantly increased zzso volumes after both transient or permanent zzso when compared with zzso animals zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso compared with zzso animals both early after zzso and in sham zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was significantly enhanced in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, expression of total zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between both zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso deletion zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso by resulting in reduced zzso zzso zzso followed by enhanced zzso zzso zzso and aggravated zzso injury after transient and permanent cerebral zzso
