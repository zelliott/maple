The rapid zzso of gene expression by growth factors frequently involves the zzso zzso of proteins which regulate the zzso of discrete sets of zzso In particular, it has become apparent that protein zzso and zzso factors including protein zzso A, zzso activated protein zzso protein zzso C, zzso B and zzso can rapidly migrate from the zzso to the nucleus in response to a wide variety of zzso zzso Furthermore, it is assumed that these proteins represent important components of the signal zzso pathways which operate between the plasma membrane and the zzso Here two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso has been used to detect proteins which undergo rapid growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor and insulin influenced the association of 15 individual protein spots with the zzso Estimates of the abundance of these proteins revealed that they represented approximately zzso to zzso of total nuclear zzso To permit identification by zzso five of the protein spots have been recovered from multiple zzso PAGE gels and concentrated by one-dimensional zzso gel zzso The data obtained demonstrate that zzso PAGE can be used to: zzso zzso putative regulators of growth factor activated gene transcription, and zzso purify sufficient amounts of these proteins to facilitate identification by zzso zzso
