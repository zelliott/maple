The scaffolding adapter zzso mediates cell signaling and responses evoked by various zzso stimuli including several growth zzso zzso the zzso for stem cell factor zzso plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including mast zzso zzso via zzso and zzso activates zzso family zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which zzso on the zzso of a zzso zzso required for mast cell zzso However, how Kit zzso signals to zzso is not well zzso By analyzing zzso mast cells, we find that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Upon Kit zzso in zzso mast cells, zzso becomes zzso and associates with Kit and zzso zzso an zzso binding site in zzso and zzso activity were required for zzso zzso zzso and association with zzso By zzso zzso or a zzso zzso that cannot bind zzso in zzso mast cells or acutely by deleting zzso in mast cells, we found that zzso requires zzso for zzso zzso Ras zzso and mast cell zzso Lastly, by analyzing mast cells from mice with compound zzso and Kit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso acting in a parallel zzso to zzso from Kit zzso regulates mast cell proliferation and development in specific zzso Our data show that zzso via zzso is critical for zzso signals from Kit zzso to activate the zzso zzso controlling mast cell zzso which likely contributes to mast cell development in specific zzso
