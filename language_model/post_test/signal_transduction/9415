We reported previously that the orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and is zzso in a mouse model of inflammatory zzso The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether zzso is also zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were zzso in normal and zzso cartilage samples and in zzso zzso in zzso with and without short-term treatment with a variety of zzso factors and signaling zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso expression was lower in zzso than in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso or inhibitor treatment indicated that the zzso was dependent on zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso inverse zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso suggesting zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso expression was also decreased by treatment with zzso plus zzso versus zzso alone, and the zzso of zzso zzso and protein observed with zzso alone suggests that the zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso 

We report the first evidence that zzso expression is regulated by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso is an zzso target gene in human, as in zzso zzso and identified zzso as a potential new target zzso which suggests that zzso may both respond to the healing signal and contribute to zzso degradation in zzso zzso
