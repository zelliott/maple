zzso signaling controls a variety of zzso programs but the mechanisms by which the same signal leads to distinct zzso remain zzso To address this question, we identified zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso embryonic zzso We show that lines zzso is essential for zzso patterning in zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel protein that acts zzso downstream or in parallel to zzso zzso and upstream of zzso target zzso Lin can accumulate in zzso of cells signaled by zzso suggesting that signaling promotes entry of Lin into the nucleus, where it zzso with zzso and zzso Thus, a zzso zzso is used to mediate zzso signaling activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso controls half of the zzso pattern zzso and zzso zzso function to do zzso Lin can accumulate in the zzso of cells signaled by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso function by prohibiting Lin from entering the zzso
