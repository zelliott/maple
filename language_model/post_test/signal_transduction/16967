zzso acid zzso is a zzso compound with multiple biological zzso This compound has recently been reported to possess an zzso zzso however, the mechanisms are less zzso 

As zzso plays a critical role in zzso the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso and mechanisms of action in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso were induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of zzso for 6 zzso The cells were determined for zzso zzso fat zzso as well as the protein expressions of molecular targets that regulate or are involved in fatty acid synthesis and zzso The results demonstrated that zzso acid at zzso ranging from zzso zzso to 10 zzso zzso attenuated zzso accompanied by reduced protein expression of zzso element binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding protein zzso zzso and zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso 1 zzso but decreased protein expression of fatty acid zzso zzso and fatty zzso protein 4 zzso zzso acid increased the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso mating type information regulation 2, zzso 1 zzso Further studies demonstrated that the zzso effect of zzso was reversed by the zzso zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso Liver zzso B1 zzso the upstream zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso When zzso was silenced with zzso or the inhibitor zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso acid inhibited zzso zzso differentiation and zzso through the zzso zzso There is potential to develop zzso into a therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of zzso
