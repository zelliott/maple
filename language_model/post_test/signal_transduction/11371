The dialogue between zzso cells of the zzso and zzso cells of the zzso is critical to zzso maintenance and zzso zzso The signal zzso mechanisms by which bovine zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso of zzso zzso C with a zzso zzso zzso 12, 13 zzso zzso activates zzso gene expression and zzso zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but this zzso effect appears to be independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acting through a Type I zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso or repression of zzso zzso Experimental evidence is provided that zzso regulation of zzso regulates gene expression of zzso in a manner that decreases zzso of zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso is discussed relative to the ability of the zzso fatty acid, zzso zzso to decrease zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to increase both zzso development and zzso zzso
