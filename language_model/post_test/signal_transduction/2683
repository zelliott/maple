zzso zzso zzso cells zzso initiate various cell triggering responses following zzso cell zzso A putative zzso protein on zzso may alternatively initiate zzso processes following zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that binding to this zzso by zzso zzso produced increased levels of expression of zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of each zzso were approximately the same molecular weight zzso Unlike their zzso zzso and natural killer zzso cell counterparts, zzso zzso did not zzso on zzso zzso This was determined by a lack of Western zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso specific zzso zzso or zzso Additional evidence for this lack of zzso zzso was shown by experiments treating zzso zzso activated zzso with sodium zzso This protein zzso zzso inhibitor did not affect levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso were also examined to determine if levels of protein zzso C zzso expression were affected during triggering zzso zzso increased zzso levels occurred zzso zzso following zzso The zzso zzso zzso consisted of a 60,000 zzso zzso and a 30,000 zzso zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Not all zzso zzso however, were affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso of expression of zzso and zzso did not change following zzso zzso This is the first study of zzso cells in cold-blooded zzso regarding the expression of these vital zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
