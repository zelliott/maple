zzso zzso plays a critical role in modulating the activities of natural killer zzso cells and T zzso In animal models, zzso has potent zzso effects that are likely zzso by its ability to enhance the zzso activity of zzso cells and zzso T zzso and to induce the production of zzso zzso by zzso and T zzso In addition to zzso zzso cells are responsive to zzso and may mediate some of the zzso effects of zzso In this study, we examine the interaction between zzso and the signaling events induced by zzso in zzso zzso We find that zzso not only zzso the expression of zzso and zzso it also plays an important role in zzso and maintaining the expression of zzso a critical zzso protein involved in zzso signaling in zzso zzso In contrast to the effects of zzso alone, expression of zzso receptors and zzso are unaffected or decreased by zzso or the combination of zzso and zzso Through expression of high levels of zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso cells show enhanced functional responses to zzso as measured by zzso production and the killing of target zzso zzso cells from cancer patients who received zzso zzso treatment also exhibited increased expression of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may enhance the response to zzso in zzso These findings provide a molecular framework to understand the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and suggest strategies for improving the effectiveness of these zzso in the zzso of zzso
