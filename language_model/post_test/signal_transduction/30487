zzso are born in zzso zzso zones and zzso migrate in multiple zzso above and below the developing cortex, and then, at the appropriate zzso stage, migrate zzso into the zzso The factors that control the formation of and the timing of exit from the zzso remain zzso moreover, the rationale for this complicated zzso plan is zzso We show that a zzso zzso is an zzso for zzso during the stage of stream formation and zzso zzso Furthermore, the timing of exit from the migratory zzso accompanies loss of responsiveness to zzso as an zzso Mice with zzso in zzso have zzso migratory zzso and deletion of zzso after the zzso have formed zzso premature entry into the cortical zzso In addition, zzso deletion of zzso specifically in zzso alters the regional distribution of zzso within the zzso and leads to zzso zzso positioning defects in the zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso distribution on the development of cortical circuitry, we generated mice with focal defects in zzso distribution and studied the density of zzso zzso zzso in areas with too many and too few zzso Interestingly, zzso in zzso frequency and zzso in areas with excess zzso tend toward zzso of zzso tone, but in areas with reduced zzso density this system zzso Thus, the processes controlling zzso zzso migration, regional distribution, and zzso positioning can have significant consequences for the development of cortical zzso and may have important implications for a range of zzso zzso
