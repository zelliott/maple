Human zzso zzso 2 zzso and its mouse zzso zzso belong to the G zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso recognize a variety of zzso and zzso zzso peptides associated with zzso zzso Since zzso cells actively participate in zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso cells express zzso and its regulation by zzso zzso We found that resting primary mouse zzso zzso cells and a cell line zzso expressed low levels of zzso at both zzso and protein levels, which was markedly enhanced by two key zzso stimulants, zzso zzso and zzso zzso While the zzso effect of zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso attenuated zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating an essential role for zzso in regulating zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso in vascular zzso cells under inflammatory conditions may mediate cell responses in diseases in which zzso zzso are zzso
