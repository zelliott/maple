zzso zzso T cells play a critical role in initiating zzso diabetes zzso The relative contribution of each of the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the induction of zzso diabetes remains zzso To evaluate the role of each zzso zzso in beta cell zzso and induction of diabetes, we have used a transgenic mouse model in which beta cells expressing the influenza virus zzso zzso are destroyed by zzso zzso T cells from zzso zzso zzso Upon adoptive transfer of zzso T cells from zzso zzso zzso mice, there was a zzso increase in the number of T cells required to induce zzso In contrast, elimination of the zzso zzso of zzso had little zzso When both pathways of zzso were zzso mice did not become zzso Using a model of spontaneous diabetes, which occurs in double transgenic zzso that express both zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice deficient in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso become diabetic soon after zzso This indicates that, in the zzso large numbers of zzso zzso T cells can lead to destruction of zzso beta cells by either zzso
