zzso zzso a zzso of aging and age-related diseases, exhibits wide variation between zzso Common genetic variation may explain some of the individual differences in zzso zzso To date, however, only a few genetic zzso have been identified in the previous zzso association zzso As emerging data suggest zzso regulation of zzso zzso we investigated 72 single zzso zzso zzso in 46 genes that involve DNA and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso proteins and DNA damage zzso zzso and zzso of zzso length were performed in blood samples from zzso zzso white participants of the Sister zzso a prospective cohort of women aged zzso zzso The association of each zzso with zzso relative zzso length was estimated using zzso linear zzso Six zzso were associated with relative zzso length in blood cells with zzso zzso for multiple zzso The minor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with shorter zzso while minor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with longer zzso Five of these zzso are located in genes coding for proteins involved in DNA and zzso zzso Our results are consistent with recent findings that zzso structure is zzso regulated and may influence the zzso integrity of zzso region and zzso length zzso zzso studies with greater coverage of the genes implicated in DNA zzso and zzso modifications are warranted to replicate these zzso
