The zzso zzso of zzso coli is zzso an outer membrane protein that is dependent upon the zzso protein zzso to enable active transport of specific zzso zzso infection by certain zzso and cell killing by the protein antibiotics zzso M and zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies were performed to establish at the zzso level the interaction between zzso and zzso In an zzso coli strain in which both proteins were expressed from the zzso a high molecular mass complex was detected when the zzso zzso zzso was added immediately prior to addition of zzso The complex included both zzso it was absent from strains of zzso coli that were devoid of either zzso or zzso and it was detected with zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that, in zzso the binding of zzso to zzso enhances complex formation between the zzso and zzso An in zzso system was established with which to examine the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso followed by addition of zzso led to the specific recovery of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso M to zzso in this system greatly increased the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that binds near the N zzso of zzso reduced the retention of zzso by zzso zzso These studies demonstrate the significance of zzso binding at the external surface of the cell to mediate signal zzso across the outer zzso
