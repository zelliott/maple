Classical signal zzso is initiated by zzso zzso We have described an alternative form of signal zzso that is initiated by the withdrawal of zzso from specific receptors referred to as dependence zzso This process is zzso featuring in zzso cell death, zzso (especially zzso zzso and possibly zzso events such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of dependence receptors suggest that these receptors form complexes that include specific zzso Complex formation appears to be a function of zzso interaction, and dependence receptors appear to exist in at least two zzso zzso Complex formation in the absence of zzso leads to zzso zzso by a mechanism that in at least some cases is dependent on zzso zzso of the zzso itself, releasing zzso zzso Thus these receptors may serve in zzso amplification, and in so doing create cellular states of dependence on their respective zzso
