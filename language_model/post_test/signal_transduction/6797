The sequencing of multiple zzso of the same plant species has revealed zzso gene and zzso zzso Genes associated with disease resistance are overrepresented among those showing structural variations, suggesting an zzso role for gene and zzso zzso variation zzso To shed light on the possible functional relevance of zzso coding region loss and the mechanisms driving this process, we characterized genes that have lost entire zzso or their whole coding regions in 17 fully zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that although a significant enrichment in genes associated with certain functional categories is observed, zzso events are largely restricted to genes with signatures of reduced zzso zzso genes tend to be newer additions to the zzso tissue specific, and lowly zzso In addition, zzso genes are located in regions of lower gene density and higher zzso element zzso zzso coding region zzso events were associated with only a marginal reduction in gene expression level in the affected zzso and occurred in genes with higher levels of alternative zzso in the zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that although zzso scenarios cannot be ruled out, zzso events can be explained without zzso zzso
