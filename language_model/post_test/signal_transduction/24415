The administration of zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso patients increases serum zzso levels and improves the blood zzso zzso Although it has been reported that zzso synthesis in rat primary zzso is diminished under lower zzso ratio conditions compared to normal zzso ratio conditions, the mode of action at the molecular level for these effects is still zzso It has been reported recently that the triggering signal for protein synthesis is transmitted through zzso zzso target of zzso We have had an interest in the zzso signal zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the mode of action of zzso zzso synthesis using rat primary zzso The zzso mixture zzso promoted the production of zzso with zzso being the major zzso half of which was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso We also showed that only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso downstream zzso zzso These zzso were completely inhibited by zzso Our results suggest that zzso especially zzso promote the production of zzso in rat primary zzso through an zzso signal zzso zzso
