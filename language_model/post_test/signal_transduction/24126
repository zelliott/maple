We recently identified a novel mechanism for zzso of the zzso state and function of the zzso zzso zzso via the scaffolding protein zzso We found that zzso binds both the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and decreases zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso slices zzso zzso Thornton, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso Here, we identified the signaling cascade by which zzso is released from the zzso zzso complex and identified the consequences of the zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso in zzso slices induced the release of zzso from zzso and zzso This resulted in the induction of zzso zzso and the enhancement of zzso zzso activity via zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso that induced zzso of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso induced the movement of zzso to the nuclear compartment in zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso in turn was found to regulate the expression of zzso zzso factor induced by zzso Taken together our results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso results in the release of zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso This in turn leads to zzso zzso zzso enhanced activity zzso by zzso and to the induction of zzso zzso factor expression by zzso
