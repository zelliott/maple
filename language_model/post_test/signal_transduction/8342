To investigate the signal pathways involved in zzso zzso expression in chronic zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso in zzso zzso were detected by zzso stain and zzso chain reaction zzso Their expressions and zzso zzso zzso release were determined by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso and/or small interfering zzso zzso zzso 

Positive protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso and inflammatory zzso Their zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso The expressions varied in time and zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso zzso had no blocking effect on zzso zzso of zzso or zzso could block zzso but zzso zzso had no blocking effect on the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso did not inhibit each zzso 

zzso of zzso expression suggested its role as a zzso in zzso zzso and zzso pathways were involved in signaling zzso through zzso zzso
