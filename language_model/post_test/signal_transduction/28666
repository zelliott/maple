zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 16 positions located in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lining the main zzso pocket of the zzso zzso identified three acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the main interaction points for zzso zzso modeling suggests that one zzso ring of zzso interacts with zzso in zzso whereas the other ring is sandwiched between the zzso acid groups of zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso Metal zzso binding in the zzso rings of zzso increased its dependence on zzso and provided a tighter molecular map of the binding site, where borderline zzso hits became clear hits for the zzso zzso The proposed binding site for zzso was confirmed by a gradual zzso in the rather distinct zzso zzso for which the compound normally had no zzso Introduction of only a zzso at position zzso and the removal of a zzso zzso zzso at position zzso resulted in a zzso increase in affinity of zzso to within zzso of its affinity in zzso We conclude that zzso binds through interactions with essentially only three zzso zzso zzso two of which are located at one end and the third at the opposite end of the main zzso pocket of the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso with, for example, improved oral zzso can be designed to mimic this interaction and thereby efficiently and selectively block the zzso zzso
