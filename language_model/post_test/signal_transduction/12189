The discovery of molecular sensors that enable zzso to recognize microbial pathogens and their products has been a key advance in our understanding of innate zzso A zzso sensing apparatus has developed to detect danger signals from infectious agents and damaged zzso resulting in an immediate but short-lived defense zzso This apparatus includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors and other zzso zzso acid sensors, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other signaling molecules are required to elicit effective zzso Although this sensing is beneficial to the host, excessive zzso and/or engagement by self molecules might induce zzso and other inflammatory zzso
