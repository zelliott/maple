We examined the effect of high-fat zzso feeding on blood pressure zzso regulation, including zzso zzso zzso as well as the changes in zzso patterns and responses to restraint zzso Furthermore, we investigated whether zzso feeding affects zzso and zzso Y zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso Male zzso zzso rats were fed with standard rat zzso or zzso zzso diet for 6 zzso zzso and heart rate zzso were measured by zzso and zzso changes as well as responses to 20 zzso restraint stress were zzso Mean zzso zzso was significantly elevated in zzso rats both during daytime and nighttime compared with controls, whereas zzso was elevated only during the zzso zzso and zzso increased similarly in response to stress in both experimental zzso however, zzso recovery of zzso and zzso were significantly delayed in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso II type 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso activity increased significantly in the zzso with zzso zzso whereas levels of zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso remained zzso In addition, zzso diet also elevated the zzso protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso This study shows that feeding zzso zzso rats with a zzso diet results in elevated zzso and zzso and delayed cardiovascular zzso recovery, and that these changes are paralleled by increases in the expression and activity of zzso zzso in the zzso without a zzso increase in the zzso zzso levels, possibly leading to zzso zzso and zzso
