zzso zzso maturation of zzso zzso requires the synthesis of new zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is thought to be necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso however, it has recently been proposed that newly zzso proteins binding to zzso could be involved in a signaling zzso that triggers the zzso of zzso zzso We focused our attention on zzso B proteins because they are zzso in response to zzso they bind to zzso and their zzso into resting zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated zzso B zzso in response to zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso We report here that the zzso inhibitor zzso when zzso into immature zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso breakdown induced by zzso by zzso factor transfer, or by injection of zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso fails to induce the zzso of zzso or zzso and zzso does not zzso In contrast, the level of zzso B1 increases normally in a manner dependent on zzso of zzso protein zzso but independent of zzso zzso of zzso
