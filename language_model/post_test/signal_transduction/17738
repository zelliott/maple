zzso growth factor zzso expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated in zzso amplification of zzso contributing to zzso responses during zzso wound healing, collateral formation and tumor zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso expression by zzso is primarily dependent on zzso zzso and we mapped the zzso element to a zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors bind to this element zzso however the zzso promoter is zzso by zzso in the absence of induced binding zzso In experimental approaches to clarify molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso gene transcription, neither zzso changes in nuclear expression nor in relative DNA binding activity of zzso family members to the indicated element were zzso Thus, zzso was hypothesized to induce zzso gene zzso via increased zzso activity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso was found to increase the amount of zzso zzso revealing a likely mechanism of zzso zzso zzso as zzso may enhance the zzso activity of zzso The contribution of different signaling molecules to zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by the use of chemical zzso of expression of zzso signaling zzso and by the use of zzso zzso zzso we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a significant role in zzso zzso promoter zzso Together, our results zzso a critical zzso of zzso amplification of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso may activate zzso promoter activity that requires the contribution of distinct signaling zzso
