zzso zzso zzso receptors are zzso G zzso receptors that mediate slow synaptic zzso in the central nervous zzso Here we show that the functional zzso of zzso receptors to inwardly zzso zzso channels rapidly zzso This effect is alleviated after direct zzso of a single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tail of zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso is evident in rat brain zzso and in cultured zzso zzso of zzso is modulated positively by pathways that elevate zzso zzso such as those involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso which is consistent with zzso functioning in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically enhances the membrane stability of zzso zzso We conclude that signaling pathways that activate zzso may have profound effects on zzso zzso synaptic zzso These results also challenge the accepted view that zzso is a universal negative zzso of G zzso zzso
