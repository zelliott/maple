zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso found in zzso zzso In the present study, effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso were examined using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was observed when differentiated zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso 4 protein expressions were also zzso when muscle cells were treated with of zzso up to 60 minutes, resulting in stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso as compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso protein expressions were increased when zzso zzso were exposed to zzso for up to 3 hours; and these effects including zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso with zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso In animal study, zzso at 25 zzso lowered the plasma zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso fatty acid levels by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with control zzso In the meantime, plasma insulin levels were significantly increased by zzso and zzso times in 10 and 25 zzso mice, respectively, compared with control mice, in parallel with the zzso observation showing a preserved architecture of the pancreatic zzso zzso and gene expression patterns for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulatory element binding zzso and zzso zzso 4 in the liver and skeletal muscles were similar to those in cell zzso In zzso zzso might be a promising therapeutic agent improving altered zzso and zzso zzso revealed in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso
