zzso therapy is the therapeutic mainstay for bipolar disorder and has been associated in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line is a well known model of zzso cell zzso where zzso has been shown to increase zzso zzso at zzso of 2 zzso This zzso effect was not associated with zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The de zzso synthesis of cholesterol is an important signal zzso zzso in zzso cells, where newly zzso zzso zzso is zzso enabling membrane zzso of the zzso and subsequent zzso to zzso transition, resulting from zzso zzso Here we confirm zzso zzso at zzso relevant zzso (1 zzso and demonstrate a zzso zzso of zzso cells in zzso of the cell zzso These effects could be abolished by zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso A zzso the zzso zzso in the formation of zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso required for zzso zzso zzso similar to lithium, showed no effect on zzso production either under zzso or zzso stimulating hormone zzso conditions indicating that de zzso cholesterol synthesis is not involved with zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso could be overcome by zzso de zzso cholesterol zzso This was achieved by the addition of the cell zzso first zzso zzso after zzso which allowed the cycle to continue, leading eventually to protein zzso despite the presence of zzso These novel findings demonstrate zzso involvement in de zzso cholesterol synthesis and zzso zzso an important signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso
