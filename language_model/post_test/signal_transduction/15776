The cell cycle is driven by the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso complexes, which is zzso regulated by zzso inhibitor zzso Recently, we identified zzso as an interaction partner and a zzso of zzso A1 in complex with zzso On a functional level, we identified a novel zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and cell zzso The zzso effects depended on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals suppressed zzso zzso whereas it was induced by cell cycle zzso We established a zzso mouse model that showed increased zzso activity in zzso with altered zzso architecture in zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso showed an increase in the fraction of zzso zzso Furthermore, blasts from acute zzso leukemia and acute zzso leukemia patients expressed significantly reduced zzso levels highlighting its relevance for growth control in zzso Taken together, this study identifies a novel zzso inhibitor with reduced expression in acute zzso and zzso zzso The molecular events that control the cell cycle occur in a sequential process to ensure a tight regulation, which is important for the survival of a cell and includes the detection and repair of genetic damage and the prevention of uncontrolled cell zzso
