We found that several zzso oxide donors had similar potency in killing mature and immature forms of zzso zzso Because of the possibility of interaction of zzso oxide with zzso zzso we tested the effect of the zzso zzso donor zzso zzso in OL cultures in the setting of zzso zzso which has been shown to cause zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the presence of 200 zzso zzso completely protected zzso against the toxicity of zzso zzso This protection appeared to be due to zzso oxide, because it could be blocked by zzso and zzso by inclusion of zzso zzso We tested the effect of three additional zzso donors and found that protection was not seen with zzso zzso a donor with a zzso measured in minutes, but was seen with zzso zzso and zzso zzso donors with zzso measured in zzso This need for donors with longer zzso for the protective effect suggested that zzso was required when zzso zzso zzso were falling, a process evolving over hours in medium depleted of zzso These studies suggest a novel protective role for zzso oxide in zzso stress injury and raise the possibility that zzso zzso oxide production might be a mechanism of defense against zzso stress injury in zzso
