A zzso for the regulation of vascular tone appears to involve zzso between zzso and zzso zzso proteins or their fragments and the subsequent zzso of zzso movement across the smooth muscle cell zzso Here, we report that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels occurs through a novel interaction of zzso zzso with peptides containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is found in the zzso region of an alternately spliced zzso zzso zzso were conducted on zzso isolated from rat skeletal zzso zzso exhibited sustained zzso zzso to zzso peptides but not to zzso zzso control zzso The zzso was associated with increased smooth muscle cell zzso as measured by using zzso zzso The response could be inhibited with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso did not alter the zzso zzso Further experiments demonstrated that the zzso was abolished by the zzso zzso channel inhibitor zzso and the zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso In studies of isolated smooth muscle cells using zzso zzso methods, the zzso current was enhanced by the zzso but not zzso zzso and was blocked by zzso or zzso to zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso leads to enhanced influx of zzso through zzso channels by zzso a zzso zzso pathway, leading to zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso of vascular tone may be particularly important in vascular responses to mechanical signals, such as pressure and flow, and to tissue injury after damage to the zzso zzso
