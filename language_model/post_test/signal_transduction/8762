We sought to determine whether the levels of expression of 17 candidate genes were associated with zzso control after zzso treatments of zzso breast zzso in young, zzso zzso 

Gene expression was measured by using zzso in the breast tumors of a series of 53 young zzso than 40 zzso zzso zzso All treatments consisted of primary zzso surgery followed by zzso zzso zzso regional zzso zzso with or without systemic treatments zzso zzso hormone zzso The median follow-up was 10 zzso 

The 10-year zzso control rate was zzso zzso zzso 57% to zzso In zzso analysis, no zzso zzso factors were found to be significantly associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso of three genes was found to be significantly associated with an increased zzso recurrence rate: low zzso zzso low zzso and high zzso Two others were associated with only a trend zzso zzso zzso low zzso and zzso In zzso analysis, only the absence of zzso was significantly associated with an increased zzso recurrence rate zzso zzso zzso relative risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Recent data give credit to the fact that breast cancer in young women is a distinct zzso entity driven by special zzso zzso Our results highlight the role of zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the risk of zzso recurrence of breast cancer in young zzso Confirmation in larger prospective studies is zzso
