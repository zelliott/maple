The zzso target of zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso protein zzso that regulates a number of diverse zzso processes important for cell growth and zzso including zzso zzso and protein zzso In this regard, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso has been demonstrated in numerous human zzso including a number of inherited cancer syndromes in which individuals have an increased risk of developing benign and zzso zzso Three of these inherited cancer syndromes zzso disease, zzso type 1, and zzso sclerosis zzso are characterized by significant central nervous system dysfunction and brain tumor zzso Each of these disorders is caused by a genetic zzso that zzso the expression of proteins which zzso regulate zzso zzso indicating that the zzso signaling zzso is critical for appropriate brain development and zzso In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the zzso signaling zzso and its role in promoting zzso zzso and cell zzso We suggest that studies of this zzso may prove useful in identifying molecular targets for zzso therapies of brain tumors associated with these inherited cancer syndromes as well as sporadic central nervous system zzso
