zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso acts by zzso the zzso zzso zzso To understand how different zzso in zzso contribute to efficient zzso zzso we performed a genetic screen aimed at uncovering zzso of an zzso zzso zzso in the developing zzso We identified a series of zzso mapping to the zzso zzso that affect its activity in multiple zzso zzso These point zzso map to both the zzso and zzso zzso regions, implicating both zzso in zzso zzso We show by surface zzso resonance that these zzso zzso are deficient in their ability to bind zzso in zzso Our data indicate that a mere approximately zzso decrease in zzso is sufficient to compromise zzso activity in zzso This effect could be zzso in a zzso zzso where a higher zzso concentration of zzso zzso was needed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a approximately zzso decrease in the binding constant nearly zzso zzso activity in zzso and in cellular zzso In agreement with previously reported zzso studies, our results define an affinity threshold for optimal zzso zzso of zzso signaling during zzso
