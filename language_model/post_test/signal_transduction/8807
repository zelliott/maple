zzso mustard zzso zzso is an zzso agent, and produces zzso on skin and causes systemic toxicity and DNA strand zzso The mechanism and role of inflammatory zzso zzso and DNA damage signaling zzso specific genes were studied in sulfur mustard zzso exposed mouse zzso Female mice were exposed zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiles were determined at 1 and 3 days zzso to zzso and DNA damage signaling zzso specific, double strand break repair proteins gene expression profile at 1, 3, and 7 days were examined by DNA zzso and zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and receptors were zzso from day 1 to day zzso zzso genes zzso zzso receptors were zzso from day 1 to day zzso Double strand DNA break repair proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from day 1 to day zzso This result indicates sulfur mustard causes inflammatory response, activates the cascade of events in the signal zzso pathway, and promotes irreversible double strand DNA breaks in zzso DNA, which is leading to cell zzso
