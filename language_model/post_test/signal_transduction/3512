Exposure to environmental zzso including various pesticides and trace metals, can disrupt critical zzso behaviors of fish such as zzso to zzso streams, mate selection, and an ability to detect predators and zzso These zzso injuries have been linked to reduced survival and population zzso Despite the importance of maintaining proper zzso signaling processes in the presence of chemical zzso little is known regarding chemical zzso in the salmon zzso system, and in particular, the zzso defenses that maintain zzso zzso An zzso yet critical component of cellular zzso defense is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso within the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that can directly reduce zzso zzso and other zzso complex zzso In this study, we cloned two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso salmon zzso zzso and compared their zzso in zzso and liver zzso by cadmium, an environmental zzso and zzso zzso that cause zzso damage as a mechanism of zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons of the two zzso zzso shared zzso identity, and also relatively high sequence identities when compared with other fish zzso zzso zzso comparisons with human zzso indicated conservation of three important active sites at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting similar zzso activity between fish and zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling confirmed the expression of zzso and zzso in all ten zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso system was accompanied by comparably high initial rates of zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso Exposure to low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso environmental zzso zzso for zzso h significantly decreased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso expression was not modulated by zzso at these zzso In zzso zzso salmon express two zzso of zzso a key zzso in the maintenance of signal zzso processes that protect against cellular zzso zzso The zzso zzso of salmon zzso zzso expression in particular, may be associated with the loss of zzso signal zzso that accompanies zzso loss of zzso in zzso
