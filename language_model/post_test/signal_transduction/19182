zzso responses to zzso injury involve changes in gene zzso however, little is known about how such changes can be induced from a distant site of zzso In this study, we describe a nerve crush zzso in zzso zzso to study injury signaling and zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to dual zzso zzso zzso functions as an upstream zzso of a zzso injury signaling cascade that involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is physically transported in zzso and zzso transport is required for the injury signaling zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso protein zzso with a decrease in zzso zzso In zzso zzso injury signaling is zzso active, and zzso initiate a faster zzso zzso Our data suggest that the regulation of zzso protein turnover by zzso can function as a damage surveillance mechanism for responding to zzso zzso
