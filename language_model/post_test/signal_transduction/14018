zzso disease zzso occurs zzso and is caused by zzso of zzso from zzso in subjects with a genetic zzso The small zzso damage depends on an zzso zzso immune response to certain zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso in association with an zzso immune response to other zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso affect zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling and CD zzso zzso The reason why the zzso immune and zzso responses to certain zzso peptides are present in CD and not in control zzso is so far zzso The aim of this work is to investigate if, in CD, a zzso zzso of zzso proliferation and signaling exists that may represent a zzso condition to the damaging effects of zzso zzso and zzso were used to study signaling in CD zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso zzso analysis, zzso and quantitative zzso were also zzso We found in CD zzso enhancement of both proliferation and zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso In CD zzso and zzso we found increase of the zzso downstream signaling zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso zzso block of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation in CD zzso In conclusion the same pathway, which zzso and zzso zzso zzso can interfere with, is zzso altered in CD zzso This observation potentially explains the specificity of the damaging effects of certain zzso peptides on CD zzso
