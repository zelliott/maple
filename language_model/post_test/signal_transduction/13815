In zzso plants, zzso infection of the zzso triggers proliferation of cortical cells to form a zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that two classic zzso zzso and zzso have important functions in zzso The identification of these functions in zzso zzso was facilitated by use of the spontaneous zzso formation 2 zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso using zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso signaling causes formation of spontaneous zzso structures in the absence of zzso and that zzso responses are induced in zzso cortical cells during such spontaneous zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling positively regulates the zzso zzso In the present study, we further investigated the induction of the zzso response using a zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso that causes spontaneous zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso spontaneous zzso development is accompanied by a localized zzso zzso Thus, a localized zzso response at the site of an zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso
