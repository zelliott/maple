zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to produce type I zzso and zzso However, it has not been fully zzso how the zzso signaling zzso is linked to these gene zzso We examined the mechanisms involving the zzso and type I zzso signaling zzso in relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso also zzso expressed zzso and zzso and the gene expressions seemed to be regulated by zzso zzso DNA enhanced the zzso zzso activity, which collaborated with zzso zzso to zzso the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in a manner independent of type I zzso zzso We then examined the zzso through which zzso is zzso Type I zzso induced the expression of zzso but not of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso DNA enabled the type I zzso zzso to express zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso this zzso With zzso DNA, zzso both zzso and newly zzso moved to the zzso independently of zzso zzso These findings suggest that, in zzso zzso human zzso the induction of zzso zzso and zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso pathway, and that zzso is activated upstream of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso regulatory machinery, thereby leading to the expression of zzso
