zzso is one of the greatest limitations to crop expansion outside the zzso agricultural zzso It will become increasingly important in regions of the globe where, in the past, the problem was zzso due to the recognized changes in global zzso Today the concern is with improving cultural practices and crop zzso for zzso zzso therefore, understanding the mechanisms behind drought resistance and the efficient use of water by the plants is fundamental for the achievement of those zzso In this paper, the major constraints to carbon zzso and the zzso regulations that play a role in plant responses to water deficits, acting in isolation or in conjunction with other zzso is zzso The effects on carbon zzso include increased resistance to diffusion by zzso and the zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress is critical for crops that experience drought zzso The role of detoxifying systems in preventing irreversible damage to zzso machinery and of zzso molecules as local or systemic signals is zzso Plant capacity to avoid or repair membrane damage during zzso and zzso processes is pivotal for the maintenance of membrane integrity, especially for those that zzso functional zzso Among such proteins are water zzso whose role in the regulation of plant water status and transport of other zzso is the subject of intense zzso zzso chemical zzso as an early response to drought, started to be zzso more than a decade zzso The effects of those signals on carbon zzso and zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso structures are revised and discussed in the context of novel management zzso These applications are designed to combine increased crop zzso efficiency with sustained yield and improved quality of the zzso Through an understanding of the mechanisms leading to successful adaptation to zzso and zzso it has already been possible to identify key genes able to alter metabolism and increase plant tolerance to zzso An overview of the most important data on this topic, including engineering for zzso adjustment or protection, water zzso and C4 traits is presented in this zzso zzso is given to the most successful or promising cases of genetic engineering in crops, using functional or regulatory zzso as well as to promising technologies, such as the transfer of zzso zzso
