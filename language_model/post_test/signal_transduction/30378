zzso zzso is a hormone with over 300 biological zzso Although the signaling zzso downstream of the long form of its zzso zzso has been well zzso little is known about zzso actions upon zzso of the short form zzso Here, we show that mice expressing only zzso exhibit an zzso zzso of accelerated zzso recruitment followed by massive zzso death leading to premature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of young adults are depleted of functional zzso and formed mostly by zzso We also show that zzso of zzso zzso the expression of the zzso factor zzso box zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso two proteins known to be essential for normal zzso zzso Our finding that zzso regulates the expression of Galt and enhances its zzso activity indicates that it is the repression of zzso by zzso acting through zzso that prevents Galt expression in the zzso and causes zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso prevents zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso is no longer seen in zzso transgenic mice that zzso zzso suggesting that zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso In zzso we show that zzso signals through zzso and causes, in the absence of zzso a severe zzso pathology by zzso the expression of zzso and that of its target gene zzso We also provide evidence of a link between the premature zzso failure seen in mice expressing zzso and in mice with zzso gene deletion as well as in human with Galt zzso
