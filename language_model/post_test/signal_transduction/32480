The mechanisms involved in zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were converted into zzso collectively and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells displayed similar zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso receptors showed the same efficacy and potency for zzso zzso of zzso zzso as did the zzso zzso In all cases the zzso increase in zzso zzso was zzso In contrast to normal zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso with all three zzso changed to zzso zzso failed to undergo normal zzso in response to zzso After a 24-hr incubation in the presence of 1 zzso zzso subsequent zzso binding was reduced by zzso for the zzso clone but by only zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed a profound reduction in zzso zzso zzso studies showed that a small but significant zzso of zzso zzso also could be produced by converting a single zzso zzso zzso to zzso The fact that these effects were not due to zzso zzso changes was suggested by the lack of effects on zzso signal zzso and zzso of converting zzso to zzso or converting two zzso zzso zzso to zzso in an adjacent zzso A similar reduction in zzso number also was observed in binding studies using the zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso are important in zzso zzso zzso
