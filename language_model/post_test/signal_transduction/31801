zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso directly interact with each other and thereby activate crucial signaling pathways that benefit cancer zzso zzso of zzso and zzso function has been shown to significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation zzso As a novel approach in human melanoma, we evaluated the effect of a zzso compound that zzso the protein interaction of zzso and zzso Previously, using virtual screening and functional testing, we identified a lead compound zzso that targets the known zzso protein interaction zzso We studied the ability of this compound to disrupt zzso protein zzso inhibit downstream zzso decrease human melanoma cell zzso alter cell cycle zzso induce zzso and decrease tumor growth in zzso zzso blocked the interaction of zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso in melanoma cells and tumor zzso through zzso the zzso of zzso leading to reduced zzso of zzso upon IGF-1 zzso As a result, zzso significantly inhibited cell proliferation and viability zzso zzso zzso More importantly, 15 zzso of zzso given for 21 d via zzso injection disrupted the interaction of zzso and zzso and effectively decreased zzso of tumor zzso resulting in significant melanoma tumor zzso in zzso Our data suggest that the zzso protein interaction is an important target, and disruption of this interaction with a novel small zzso zzso has potential zzso therapeutic effects in human zzso
