zzso signaling by zzso acid zzso is thought to be an innovation essential for the origin of the zzso body zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains a zzso body plan throughout life, and yet its zzso appears to lack genes for zzso zzso degradation, and zzso This suggests the hypothesis that the zzso was lost during zzso evolution, and predicts that zzso development has become independent of zzso This prediction raises the problem that the zzso organization of a zzso body plan can be developed without the classical zzso role of zzso To address this problem, we performed pharmacological treatments and analyses of zzso molecular markers to investigate whether zzso acts in zzso zzso patterning in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso does not cause zzso zzso in zzso as it does in zzso and zzso and showed that a zzso can develop the zzso body plan in the absence of the classical zzso role of zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso evidence suggests that the lack of zzso zzso zzso is a shared derived feature of zzso We discuss possible relationships of altered roles of zzso in zzso development to zzso events, such as zzso of the zzso in the context of a new understanding of zzso zzso
