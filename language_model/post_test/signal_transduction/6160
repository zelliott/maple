zzso healing proceeds by the concerted action of a variety of signals that have been well zzso However, the mechanisms zzso them and zzso their effects are poorly zzso zzso we reveal how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso follows a balanced pattern of expression controlled by a zzso between inflammatory zzso and zzso Whereas conditions that mimic the initial inflammatory events stimulate zzso zzso zzso suppresses this zzso zzso transcription, as seen in the late zzso zzso This zzso action involves an zzso effect on zzso activity and DNA binding that results in an zzso of the zzso induction of the zzso zzso As expected from these zzso wound zzso from zzso mice showed sustained zzso expression as compared to those of their zzso zzso Together, these findings suggest a mechanism for setting the necessary balance between inflammatory signals, which trigger zzso zzso and zzso that zzso the timely decrease of this expression as wound healing proceeds to zzso
