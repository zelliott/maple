zzso peptides exert diverse zzso functions through their zzso zzso One zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso exerted a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the signaling mechanism by which the zzso zzso regulates zzso activity, zzso expression zzso in zzso cells were zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells clearly suppressed zzso zzso zzso activity, indicating that the zzso is primarily regulated by zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso of the selective zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso whereas the zzso growth factor zzso inhibitor zzso zzso failed to do zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso was suppressed by an zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso induced zzso stimulation and zzso zzso and promoted the formation of zzso zzso The participation of small zzso as well as a zzso zzso exchange factor was also implicated because zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso of zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso of zzso by zzso receptors is routed via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
