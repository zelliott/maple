zzso (target of zzso 1) and its related proteins zzso and zzso constitute a protein family and share an zzso VHS zzso domain and a following zzso zzso and zzso domain, both of which are also zzso in the zzso family zzso However, the zzso half is not significantly zzso between the zzso and zzso families or even between zzso and zzso We have previously shown that the zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso to which it recruits zzso We here extend the previous data and show that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also interact with zzso and the zzso regions of all the zzso family proteins interact with zzso Furthermore, when zzso with zzso all the zzso family proteins zzso zzso onto zzso These results indicate that, in conjunction with zzso zzso family proteins play an important role in recruiting zzso onto zzso and suggest that they zzso zzso zzso
