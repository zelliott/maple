The National Institute of Diabetes and zzso and zzso Diseases zzso sponsored a workshop, zzso zzso to Nuclear zzso and zzso in April 2009 to explore how chemical and molecular biology and physiology can be exploited to further our understanding of nuclear zzso structure, function, and role in zzso Signaling zzso involving nuclear receptors are more complex and interrelated than once zzso Nuclear receptors continue to be attractive targets for drug zzso The overall goal of this workshop was to identify gaps in our understanding of the complexity of zzso activities and begin to address them by zzso increasing the collaboration of investigators from different disciplines, zzso developing a better understanding of chemical zzso of nuclear zzso action, and zzso identifying opportunities and roadblocks in the path of translating basic research to discovery of new zzso
