The zzso zzso channel zzso is a key player in the maintenance of whole body zzso balance, and consequently of blood zzso It is tightly regulated by numerous signaling pathways including zzso via the zzso zzso zzso This mechanism is itself under the control of several zzso which zzso zzso thereby interfering with zzso interaction, or by zzso which binds to and zzso zzso Another, different regulatory mechanism concerns the zzso zzso of zzso during which the channel is zzso on its zzso side by zzso zzso such as zzso and further activated by zzso zzso such as zzso This process is regulated as well but the underlying mechanisms are not zzso Previously, evidence was provided that the zzso status of zzso may affect the zzso of the zzso When zzso of zzso was reduced, either by zzso zzso or mutating either the zzso zzso zzso the binding sites for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the level of channel zzso was zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso channels are not zzso at the cell surface, are zzso zzso and zzso does not affect their zzso zzso We further show by limited zzso that the zzso zzso status of zzso affects the zzso zzso of zzso by demonstrating that zzso channels are more efficiently zzso when treated with zzso added zzso or zzso These results present a new paradigm in which an zzso zzso modification zzso zzso of a zzso protein can affect its zzso zzso
