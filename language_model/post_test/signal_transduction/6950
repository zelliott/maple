zzso zzso within artificial zzso undergo a separation into zzso and zzso zzso However, the existence of this segregation into microscopic zzso zzso has been difficult to prove in living cells, and the precise organization of the plasma membrane into such zzso has not been zzso in plant zzso We developed a zzso zzso zzso approach to generate zzso images of the plasma membrane surface of Bright Yellow 2 tobacco zzso zzso suspension cells labeled with an environment sensitive fluorescent zzso This allowed the in zzso characterization of the global level of order of this zzso by which we could demonstrate that an increase in its proportion of ordered zzso zzso occurred in the early steps of the signaling triggered by zzso and zzso two zzso of plant defense zzso The use of zzso recovery after zzso revealed an increase in plasma membrane fluidity induced by zzso but not by zzso Moreover, we characterized the spatial distribution of zzso zzso on the membrane of living plant cells and monitored their variations induced by zzso zzso We analyze these results in the context of plant defense zzso discuss their meaning within the framework of the zzso zzso hypothesis, and propose a new mechanism of signaling platform formation in response to zzso zzso
