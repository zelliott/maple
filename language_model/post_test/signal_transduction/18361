zzso zzso zzso a primary output signal of zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in diverse cellular zzso Evidence indicates that zzso exerts downstream zzso in part, by recruiting zzso proteins to plasma zzso zzso identification of signaling zzso with zzso motifs represents a viable approach to understand the mechanism by which specificity of the zzso zzso signaling network is zzso To address this issue, we have developed zzso derivatives of zzso as affinity zzso for the zzso and characterization of zzso zzso Considering the relaxed requirement for the zzso zzso in zzso recognition, these zzso zzso zzso display two structural zzso First, they contain short zzso side chains zzso and zzso allowing them to be soluble in zzso zzso This desirable feature avoids the formation of zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso Second, the appended zzso is located at the zzso of the zzso zzso side chain, thereby maintaining the integrity of the zzso head group essential for selective zzso The utility of these affinity zzso is validated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed as zzso fusion zzso to zzso from bacterial zzso These include the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of these zzso proteins was approximately zzso of that of zzso beads
