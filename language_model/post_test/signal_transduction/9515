zzso is a zzso zzso zzso complex that regulates many aspects of zzso growth including the zzso of zzso The zzso protein zzso resident in zzso is responsive to environmental cues and is zzso inhibited by the natural product zzso Recent characterization of the zzso zzso in zzso has yielded insights into how zzso regulates zzso Here, we show that zzso an zzso family zzso and direct zzso of zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso gene expression via direct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso partially zzso the growth and cell size defects of an zzso strain and reveals zzso regulation of both zzso and zzso gene zzso and other aspects of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso enables recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso complex to repress zzso gene zzso Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that zzso is a master regulator of zzso zzso through the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso
