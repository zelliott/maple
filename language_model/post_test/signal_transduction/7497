zzso proteins are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in both normal development and zzso We describe a program of zzso zzso that regulates the conversion of zzso proteins into zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso by the direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso a master negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso of signaling leads to a global zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso target sites become zzso while a second cluster of sites zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso can regulate zzso zzso activity in a graded fashion, suggesting a zzso mechanism for how a zzso of zzso signaling in a zzso field can be converted into a zzso of zzso zzso
