zzso zzso is a critical zzso that involved in heart zzso It has been proved that zzso stimulation results in cardiac zzso both in zzso and in zzso but the mechanisms underlying remain largely zzso In this study, we reported that zzso zzso might be an important zzso of zzso responses to zzso zzso In the cultured rat zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the expression and activity of zzso which was accompanied by increase in cell surface area and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was abolished by zzso selective zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso zzso zzso but the zzso effects could be diminished by zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso A zzso and zzso of nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso induced by zzso and zzso could also bound to the zzso sequence in the promoter region of rat zzso zzso indicating that zzso signaling participated in the zzso regulation of zzso following zzso zzso These findings provided further insight into the roles of zzso in cardiac zzso and suggested a potential therapeutic strategy against cardiac zzso by zzso zzso
