Based on zzso techniques against zzso and the zzso flux of zzso zzso it has previously been shown that zzso communication occurs among zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells, this due to the presence of zzso gap zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the density of zzso contacts in the left coronary and internal zzso arteries as well as in the left zzso vein by means of electron zzso the distance between both cells participating in an zzso contact with a zzso image analysis system and the presence of zzso and zzso gap junctions between zzso and smooth muscle cells by using the zzso technique and zzso zzso in zzso zzso were also zzso The results are that all blood vessels studied present zzso zzso while density studies show that they are more abundant in the zzso zzso The zzso contact distance is constant and in no case the zzso processes reach the plasma membrane of the partner cell toward which they are zzso zzso gap junctions were found between smooth muscle cells and between zzso zzso zzso gap junctions were zzso zzso the possibility that signaling molecules between zzso and smooth muscle cells may be transferred through plasma zzso as was once thought and not necessarily by zzso zzso
