The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein zzso cascade involved in regulating organ size in zzso and cell contact zzso in zzso by governing cell proliferation and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is linked to cancer zzso Its first core zzso zzso was identified in zzso more than 15 years ago, but it gained much attention when other core components of the zzso were identified 8 years zzso Major discoveries of the zzso were made during past several zzso The core zzso components zzso Salvador, zzso and zzso in the fly and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso in the fly, zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso with zzso motif zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the zzso by interaction with zzso zzso Here we review recent zzso of this zzso by focusing on how these proteins communicate with each other and how loss of regulation results in zzso
