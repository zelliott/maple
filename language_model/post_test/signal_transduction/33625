zzso acid zzso is known to be required at various levels of eye patterning via zzso Acid zzso zzso however the molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by these nuclear receptors are still zzso The genetic studies performed here enable us to present a new model to study zzso action during eye zzso By zzso the three zzso specifically in the zzso zzso we discriminate the individual contribution of each zzso during eye development and describe a new function for zzso during the formation of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is the only zzso that mediates zzso zzso in the zzso during zzso zzso Surprisingly, and despite a sophisticated pattern of zzso in the developing zzso we observed that zzso zzso is not autonomously required in this tissue for eye zzso We show that the action of zzso during eye zzso is occurring specifically in neural zzso zzso zzso and is zzso by all three zzso Furthermore, we point out that zzso which encodes a zzso zzso factor, is a key zzso gene in neural crest cells during eye zzso Interestingly, we observed that zzso is required in the neural crest cells for normal position of the zzso zzso
