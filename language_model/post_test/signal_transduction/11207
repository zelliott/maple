The checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso are central to the induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and zzso as elements in the zzso zzso We report here that in several human tumor cell lines, zzso and zzso control the induction of the zzso related zzso factor zzso in response to DNA zzso Multiple experimental systems were used to show that interference with or zzso of zzso or zzso signaling strongly impacts zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso after DNA zzso We demonstrate as well that zzso directs zzso expression in the presence and absence of DNA zzso zzso and zzso in turn, are vital to zzso stabilization and activity after zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in a zzso zzso zzso cell death produced by zzso zzso Since zzso is often zzso through zzso as a cellular port for zzso intervention, this zzso controlling zzso autonomous zzso signaling is of potential therapeutic zzso
