Members of the zzso family of zzso signal zzso are essential for transforming growth zzso zzso to exert its zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso become zzso and form zzso complexes with zzso zzso these activated zzso complexes zzso to the nucleus, where they may direct zzso zzso Here we report that zzso mediates zzso of zzso at two zzso zzso in the C zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires that zzso be zzso zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso and/or zzso to zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso of zzso zzso These zzso zzso were found to zzso interact with an activated zzso zzso complex, in contrast to zzso zzso which interacts only zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso complex formation of this zzso with zzso and blocked the nuclear zzso not only of zzso but also of zzso Thus, zzso complex formation of zzso with zzso is required for nuclear zzso of zzso Moreover, peptides from the C zzso of zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso were found to bind zzso in zzso whereas the corresponding zzso peptides were less zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso may provide a recognition site for interaction with zzso and zzso of these sites is a key event in zzso zzso
