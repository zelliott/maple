zzso cells zzso stem zzso derived from the ICM zzso cell zzso of zzso are zzso and are capable of giving rise to most cell zzso The zzso cell identity is mainly maintained by the zzso zzso zzso factor 4) and zzso zzso zzso Recently, a tremendous amount of work has focused on deciphering how zzso cell identity is regulated zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play crucial roles in zzso cell maintenance and zzso Moreover, zzso of those zzso regulators results in loss of zzso cell identity or zzso zzso zzso it is important to fully understand the zzso regulation landscape of zzso zzso The knowledge gained will help us to harness the unique characteristics of zzso cells for stem zzso therapy and zzso zzso In the present review, we will discuss recent proceedings that provide novel insights into zzso regulation of zzso cell zzso
