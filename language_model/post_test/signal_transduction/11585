zzso are pivotal zzso cells of the innate immune system, which is vital for recognizing and eliminating invasive microbial zzso When microbial products bind to zzso zzso zzso become activated and release a broad array of zzso that orchestrate the host innate and zzso immune zzso zzso identified as a zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso is also a zzso zzso and an important zzso of inflammation and zzso Here we report that zzso is an essential regulator of zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with zzso cells, zzso zzso are zzso to zzso and zzso bacteria, as shown by a profound reduction in the activity of zzso and the production of zzso zzso This reduction is due to a zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex, and is associated with decreased activity of zzso factor zzso which is required for optimal expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso These findings identify an important role for zzso in innate immunity and provide a molecular basis for the resistance of zzso mice to zzso zzso
