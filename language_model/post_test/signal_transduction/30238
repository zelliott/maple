zzso the process of new blood vessel formation, is important in wound healing, zzso zzso and zzso During this process, it is a critical step of the loosening of cellular interactions between zzso cells, which are dependent on the architecture of zzso junction constructed by zzso interactions of cell surface zzso Several studies suggested that the dynamic changes of zzso are necessary during zzso However, the mechanism of zzso regulation on zzso cells requires further zzso Here, we showed that basic zzso growth factor zzso a pivotal zzso factor, can zzso typical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression on the surface of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso via zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso surface zzso zzso was significantly reversed only when the zzso were treated with zzso inhibitor zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso with a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso interferes zzso zzso zzso and the result suggests that zzso zzso surface zzso expression on zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, after growth factors withdrawal, zzso blockade or zzso zzso for 16 zzso zzso were zzso on cell surface of zzso But the zzso or total protein of zzso had no significant change, suggesting that the effect of zzso on zzso expression may work through a zzso zzso Our data first suggest that zzso zzso in zzso surface zzso zzso Loss of surface zzso may affect the zzso interaction between zzso cells and facilitate zzso
