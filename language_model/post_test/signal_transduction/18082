Recently, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was shown to zzso to the nucleus and regulate gene zzso To determine whether zzso I proteins function as zzso zzso we produced the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso fused with the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso exhibits zzso zzso in zzso However, full-length zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso region of zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso acid replacement in the zzso zzso motif of the zzso region of zzso zzso substantially reduced zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso region in zzso I proteins may interact with other proteins by way of the zzso zzso motif and has a zzso zzso zzso
