Type I zzso zzso are important for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene I zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso proteins mediate zzso production in response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso B form zzso DNA, such as zzso zzso can also induce zzso but the underlying mechanism is zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso DNA is converted into zzso zzso to induce zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of zzso zzso zzso III zzso as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso prevents zzso induction by zzso of DNA or infection with DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso abrogates zzso induction by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and promotes the bacterial zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is a zzso DNA sensor involved in innate immune zzso
