For vascular zzso disease, an zzso vein graft is the most suitable zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, is a major obstacle to zzso after vein zzso The degree to which the function of zzso oxide zzso in the vein graft is preserved has been reported to be associated with the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso zzso is released from zzso in the vascular system and plays zzso roles in controlling the vascular zzso The zzso receptors contributing to the zzso mechanical responses vary by vessel type zzso and zzso and among species zzso zzso rats, and so zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso receptors in smooth muscle cells or zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso receptors in arteries from various zzso However, the effects of zzso have not been clarified in grafted zzso We zzso demonstrate the responses to zzso in zzso veins and then zzso vein zzso Next, we describe the effects of chronic in zzso administration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso antagonists, both of which reduce the zzso contraction and zzso zzso in vein zzso Further studies targeting zzso are required to evaluate its possible benefits for zzso vein zzso with respect to vasospasm, function, and zzso
