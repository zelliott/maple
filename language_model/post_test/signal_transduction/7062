Type I zzso zzso play an important role in direct zzso defense as well as linking the innate and zzso immune zzso On zzso cells zzso zzso facilitate their zzso and contribute to zzso and zzso T cell zzso However, the precise molecular mechanism by which zzso regulate maturation and zzso of zzso in zzso has not been studied in zzso Here we show that, after in zzso stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dominate zzso changes in zzso In contrast to direct zzso zzso zzso are required for zzso of all pathways associated with DC zzso In addition, zzso zzso particularly the switch from zzso zzso to zzso are also regulated by zzso and required for DC zzso These data provide evidence for a zzso zzso zzso with DC maturation and offer a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso DC zzso
