There is considerable evidence to suggest that aberrations of zzso connectivity contribute to the zzso of schizophrenia and that zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission is especially zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors in rats, which are widely used as a model for zzso We investigated zzso zzso expression profiling of the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso rats using the zzso difference gel zzso method, and 49 zzso expression proteins were successfully identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso We carried out a literature search for further confirmation of zzso locations and to explore the relevance to the diseases of zzso expressed zzso zzso Pathways Analysis zzso was used to further examine the underlying relationship between the changed zzso The network encompassing zzso zzso zzso signaling and interaction, nervous system development and zzso was found to be significantly altered in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso are the most significant zzso zzso pathways to be affected by zzso zzso Using western zzso we confirmed the differential expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso proteins and total proteins in the cerebral zzso of the zzso Our study identified the change and/or response of the central nervous transmission system under the stress of zzso zzso underlining the importance of the synaptic function in zzso
