Juvenile zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso are common, zzso and poorly understood subset of brain zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to fusion genes formed between zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso zzso of zzso was recently identified in a proportion of zzso and may be involved in their zzso Our aim was to investigate additional zzso zzso in zzso and whether zzso of zzso zzso is associated with zzso type or zzso 

Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso on genes of interest, we investigated 84 zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is specific to sporadic zzso (35 of 53 - zzso and does not occur in other zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso We also establish that it is site specific as it occurs in the majority of zzso zzso (24 of 30 - zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 of 16 - zzso and is rare in zzso zzso (1 of 7 - zzso The zzso pathway, assessed through zzso zzso was active in all zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso of function studies performed on zzso zzso show that zzso of zzso zzso does not increase cell proliferation or baseline zzso zzso even if it zzso cells to zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso of zzso might arise from a unique zzso zzso cell where zzso duplication, a hallmark of this zzso in association to zzso zzso zzso potentially plays a zzso role in their zzso zzso gain of function abnormalities in components of zzso zzso are potentially present in all zzso making this zzso amenable to therapeutic targeting of this zzso
