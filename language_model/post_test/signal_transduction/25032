zzso control in zzso zzso is often described in terms of a handful of zzso proteins with preferential expression in these zzso An equally valid approach is the identification of zzso elements in zzso which are specifically transcribed in zzso zzso Regulatory regions of several zzso genes have been analyzed in transgenic animals, transient zzso and in zzso In some cases, these studies have identified regions responsible for zzso expression within the promoters or immediate upstream zzso Other zzso genes possess zzso which simply secure zzso levels of transcription, but do not contain zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes also differ strongly in other zzso They either contain a zzso or are zzso and zzso They exhibit multiple zzso initiation sites or a single strong zzso zzso sites for general zzso factors, such as zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso and for downstream zzso of major signaling pathways are found in them in zzso In agreement, members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso families are zzso components of the zzso machinery in zzso zzso Together with several members of the nuclear zzso family, they are an intrinsic part of the zzso control in zzso zzso
