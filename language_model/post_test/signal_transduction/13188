We have recently demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso These PCs have been identified to activate several growth factors, zzso molecules and zzso zzso compounds by zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the regulation of zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso with zzso growth factor zzso (20 zzso zzso II zzso II, 1 zzso or zzso fetal calf serum zzso for 48 hours increased DNA zzso as assessed by zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and zzso zzso (both zzso zzso whereas zzso II had no effect on zzso protein levels compared with zzso The PCs zzso and zzso which display a comparable zzso zzso and zzso activity, were found in zzso but their levels did not increase following zzso zzso II, or zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a rapid increase in zzso levels after 30 minutes of zzso of zzso zzso zzso induction was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso and by zzso an inhibitor of zzso (both zzso In contrast, the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso revealed low zzso protein and zzso levels in intact rat zzso in zzso After balloon injury, zzso protein and zzso levels were strongly increased in zzso zzso zzso The present data demonstrate that zzso is zzso during proliferation of zzso in zzso and in zzso We show that zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso Thus, growth factors regulate the zzso zzso zzso which may play an important role during zzso zzso
