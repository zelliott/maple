Liver zzso which is caused by the zzso of zzso zzso materials, is a serious clinical problem that can progress to zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso production, but bone zzso protein zzso a member of the zzso zzso can zzso the zzso activity of zzso 

In this study, we examined whether zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso in zzso and in zzso 

In primary cultured rat zzso cells and the zzso human zzso cell line, induction of zzso by zzso infection decreased the expression of collagen zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso in the presence or absence of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered the zzso expression of zzso of differentiation 2 zzso in zzso Although zzso expression of zzso was hardly zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso expression in zzso A liver zzso model was induced by the repetitive zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso body zzso twice per week for up to 7 zzso In rats administered zzso via the tail zzso zzso content and the areas stained by Sirius red dye in the liver were significantly reduced compared to zzso zzso also reduced zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact to zzso zzso zzso
