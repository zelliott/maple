The rice zzso zzso zzso zzso contains at least six genes exclusively with an SPX zzso domain at the zzso designated as zzso Here we report the diverse expression patterns of the zzso genes in different zzso and their responses to zzso Among them, five zzso zzso 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsive to zzso in shoots and/or in zzso The zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso and zzso is exclusively located in nucleus, zzso in the zzso and zzso is a membrane zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso 3 and 5 at the zzso level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in shoots under zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the responses of zzso and zzso to zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of zzso 3 and zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso long distance regulation on zzso Our results also indicate that zzso is involved in plant tolerance to zzso zzso
