One of the most important ways in which animal species vary is in their zzso zzso of the largest animal ever thought to have lived, the blue whale zzso zzso can reach a weight of 190 zzso and a length of over 30 zzso At the other extreme, among the smallest zzso animals are males of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which even as adults are just 140 zzso in zzso In terms of volume, these species differ by more than 14 orders of zzso Since size has such profound effects on an zzso zzso anatomy and zzso an important task for evolutionary biology and ecology is to account for why organisms grow to their characteristic zzso zzso a full description of an zzso development must include an explanation of how its growth and body size are zzso Here I review research on how these processes are controlled in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of small and long zzso have revealed that in the worm, zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso family, promotes growth in a zzso zzso zzso signaling affects body size by stimulating the growth of zzso zzso cells rather than controlling cell zzso zzso from zzso zzso and from the zzso also zzso body size, in part, independently of zzso zzso zzso size and zzso is heavily influenced by the zzso which acts as the zzso Finally, I zzso research on several genes that appear to regulate body size by cell autonomously regulating cell growth throughout the zzso
