zzso zzso is a neurotransmitter implicated in multiple functions, including movement, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for clearing zzso zzso thereby terminating zzso zzso Previously, it has been shown that insulin signaling through protein zzso zzso regulates zzso function by zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serve distinct zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate using zzso zzso zzso that zzso activity of zzso rather than zzso regulates zzso cell surface zzso Since zzso zzso is zzso by insulin, these data further zzso insulin signaling as an important zzso of zzso function and zzso zzso
