The influence of nerve stimulation pattern on zzso release zzso by zzso the zzso of NO zzso by zzso oxide zzso zzso was studied in the rat zzso zzso We also investigated the putative interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the NO donor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso release from rat motor nerve zzso zzso stimulus frequency from 5 zzso to 50 zzso enhanced zzso release zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the effect of zzso (10 zzso remained zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso prevented the effect of zzso but not that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso transport zzso zzso (10 zzso attenuated release zzso by zzso and zzso With 5 zzso blockade of zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso receptors with zzso zzso reduced the zzso action of zzso and zzso the opposite was verified with 50 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso also attenuated the effects of zzso and zzso with 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso transport system sensitive to zzso (10 zzso without significantly zzso changing the zzso release subsequent to nerve zzso Data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release by increasing zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso receptors zzso depending on the stimulus zzso While zzso acts predominantly at zzso zzso receptors during 5 zzso zzso of zzso release by zzso at 50 zzso depends on the interplay between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
