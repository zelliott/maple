zzso zzso is an emerging concept that can potentially be harnessed for the management of zzso zzso The present study zzso the potential zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 

zzso of embryonic stem cells into zzso cells in an in zzso zzso body is paralleled by an amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with the levels of the zzso zzso 1 zzso Small hairpin zzso zzso of zzso or modification of zzso zzso zzso in embryonic stem cells with zzso or sodium zzso inhibited differentiation of embryonic stem cells into zzso zzso This was translated to an in zzso zzso zzso model, in which the genetic zzso of zzso resulted in impaired zzso characterized by a zzso decrease in zzso vessel zzso and a large zzso zzso which could be rescued by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To explore the cross talk between the zzso and the zzso during zzso we identified by zzso and then validated zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso zzso zzso analysis at 3 zzso stages critical for zzso revealed a cascade of pathways that may mediate zzso regulation of zzso These pathways were intimately connected to cell zzso cell survival, and cell fate zzso Specifically, we demonstrated that zzso box zzso proteins and zzso growth factor were key downstream signals in this zzso 

The present study for the first time implicates interplay between the zzso and the zzso during zzso revealing the possibility of harnessing specific cellular zzso for therapeutic zzso
