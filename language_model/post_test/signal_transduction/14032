zzso is one of the most persistent environmental zzso in biological systems and its effect through zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso has been well zzso However, the information on zzso toxicity in other molecular pathways is rather zzso To fully understand molecular toxicity of zzso in an in zzso animal model, adult zzso were exposed to zzso at 10 zzso for 96 h and the zzso were sampled for zzso based zzso zzso A total of zzso differently expressed genes were identified based on zzso and zzso zzso per million) zzso Among the top 20 zzso zzso 10 novel responsive genes were identified and verified by zzso analysis on independent zzso zzso analysis indicated several zzso pathways associated with cell cycle, zzso zzso signal zzso and immune zzso Comparative analyses of zzso zzso changes between fish and zzso models revealed that zzso zzso is consistently zzso while calcium signaling zzso and several zzso pathways are generally zzso Finally, our study also suggested that zzso model showed greater similarity to in zzso zzso models than in zzso zzso Our study indicated that the zzso is a valuable in zzso model in zzso analyses for understanding molecular toxicity of environmental zzso relevant to human zzso The expression profiles associated with zzso could be useful for monitoring environmental zzso and zzso zzso
