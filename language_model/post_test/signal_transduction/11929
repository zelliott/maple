During many years, very limited data had been available on specific gene zzso in zzso in particular due to the fact that balanced zzso zzso (which have allowed to discover many zzso zzso are very rare in zzso while zzso deletions are generally very large, making it difficult to identify genes of zzso Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing zzso techniques has helped identify zzso gene zzso in zzso of zzso that cluster mainly in four functional groups, zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with zzso of zzso and zzso 53 zzso Most of those zzso except zzso and zzso zzso are associated with an overall poorer zzso while some gene zzso zzso zzso zzso may be associated to better response to zzso zzso The frequent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso appear to largely contribute to the importance of zzso deregulation (in particular gene zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and may account at least partially for the efficacy of zzso agents in the treatment of zzso
