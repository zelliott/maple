We detected a protein in rabbit skeletal muscle extracts that was zzso rapidly by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1), and identified it as the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in zzso which lies in an insert not present in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso became zzso when zzso zzso were zzso with insulin or zzso growth factor, and zzso was prevented by low zzso of zzso at which it is a relatively specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of the classical zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso target of zzso had no zzso zzso also induced the zzso of zzso at zzso in cardiac muscle in zzso but not in cardiac muscle that does not express zzso zzso zzso 1), the upstream zzso of zzso These results identify the zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso zzso for zzso
