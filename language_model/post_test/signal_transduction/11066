zzso cells adapt to zzso shock by accumulating zzso and altering expression of hundreds of zzso This zzso response of zzso zzso to zzso shock encompasses genes whose products are implicated in protection from zzso zzso We addressed the question of whether zzso shock caused zzso zzso zzso shock did not result in the generation of zzso levels of zzso oxygen species zzso To zzso any generation of zzso zzso shock treatments were performed in zzso zzso Global gene expression response profiles were compared by employing a novel two-dimensional cluster zzso The zzso profiles following zzso shock under zzso and zzso conditions were zzso very zzso In particular, it appeared that expression of the zzso stress genes was zzso upon zzso shock even if there was no apparent need for their zzso Interestingly, cells adapted to zzso shock much more rapidly under zzso and the signaling as well as the zzso response was clearly attenuated under these zzso This more rapid adaptation is due to an enhanced zzso production capacity in zzso cells, which is caused by the need for zzso production in zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso production led to an attenuated response even under zzso zzso These observations demonstrate the crucial role of zzso zzso and zzso recovery in determining the period of zzso zzso signaling and the profile of cellular adaptation to zzso zzso
