Human zzso 8 zzso encodes several putative zzso which are zzso to cellular host genes known to function in cell cycle regulation, control of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso as well as primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising target for novel therapies directed against zzso zzso By zzso display screening of human synthetic zzso libraries, we have selected a specific zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso The zzso recognized by zzso was localized on the top of the D zzso of the zzso zzso which is a part of zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso growth of the primary zzso zzso cell line zzso and blocks zzso zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso Since it was previously found that zzso can also induce signals from within the cell, presumably within the zzso zzso we fused the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso retention sequence zzso zzso As a result, zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso ceased to zzso the zzso Moreover, we observed that zzso that was bound to zzso and retained in the zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that the activity of the zzso retained zzso protein is neutralized by zzso Our results might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to neutralize zzso zzso growth factors or zzso
