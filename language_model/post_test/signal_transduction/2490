The effects of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on different zzso molecules in the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade in pancreatic zzso cells were analyzed and compared with the effects of zzso the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso rapidly increased the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso reaching a maximum within zzso zzso when zzso and zzso increases, respectively, were zzso The zzso increase of zzso activity was zzso with only a slight zzso after 30 zzso whereas zzso zzso remained at a high level of zzso to 60 zzso The protein zzso C inhibitor zzso abolished the zzso by zzso zzso and inhibited the effect of zzso by zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated both forms of zzso zzso zzso with zzso having a much larger effect, zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso whereas zzso activated both zzso by only zzso zzso revealed three different forms of zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso Of the total zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso was zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso All three forms of zzso were zzso to a greater extent by zzso than by zzso which was especially evident for zzso and zzso The effect of zzso in zzso zzso was at least partially zzso by stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso Ras by 183 and zzso at zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no measurable zzso Our study suggests that zzso and zzso activate the zzso cascade by distinct mechanisms in pancreatic zzso zzso
