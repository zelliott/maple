The zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lyn are expressed in zzso zzso is expressed in T cells at elevated levels and is associated with the T cell zzso zzso complex, whereas Lyn is expressed in B cells and is associated with zzso zzso Thus, these zzso are suggested to participate in zzso signal zzso in zzso Previous report showed that zzso was also expressed in brain, but its cellular distribution was not zzso zzso of Lyn in neural zzso was not previously zzso Here we report that both zzso and zzso are expressed in discrete regions of the zzso To throw light on their functions in the brain, we investigated their expressions during brain zzso in zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso of zzso and newborn zzso In adult animals, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso as well as zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso was relatively low in brains of zzso and newborn mice, but in adults the transcript was specifically expressed in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso the zzso and Lyn zzso may regulate distinct functions of specific cells during brain zzso The specific expressions of zzso and Lyn in both zzso and neural zzso could suggest common zzso mechanisms in the immune system and central nervous zzso
