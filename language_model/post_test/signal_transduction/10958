zzso zzso are important for patterning many aspects of the zzso including the zzso arches and zzso region of the embryonic zzso The zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso and thus zzso from the zzso are a potential patterning influence on the developing zzso We have carried out experiments that have used zzso a zzso zzso to address the function of zzso signaling from the zzso pit in a whole zzso zzso When zzso beads were implanted into the zzso pit of stage 20 chicken zzso the result was a specific loss of derivatives from the lateral zzso zzso Providing zzso zzso acid zzso development of the beak demonstrating that most zzso defects were produced by the specific blocking of zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso effects was a specific increase in programmed cell death on the lateral zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso side zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Gene expression studies were focused on the Bone zzso zzso zzso pathway, which has a well-established role in programmed cell zzso zzso blocking zzso synthesis decreased rather than increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also examined cell survival zzso the most relevant of which was zzso which is expressed around the zzso pit and in the zzso zzso We found that zzso was not initially expressed along the lateral side of the zzso pit at the start of our experiments, whereas it was expressed on the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso along the lateral edge and this may have contributed to the specific increase in programmed cell death in the lateral zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso zzso was able to prevent cell death, rescue most of the zzso defects and was able to prevent a decrease in zzso acid zzso zzso expression caused by zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso act upstream of zzso and the balance of these two factors is critical for regulating programmed cell death and zzso in the zzso In addition, our data suggest a novel role for zzso zzso from the zzso pit in controlling the precise zzso of zzso in the center of the zzso mass observed during normal zzso zzso
