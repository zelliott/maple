The zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso a zzso zzso factor belonging to the family of nuclear zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation although the exact zzso of this activity has not been zzso In this study, we explored the role of zzso signaling on the control of gene expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in human lung zzso zzso 

Using several human lung zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso we zzso for cell growth zzso and zzso zzso We also zzso for zzso zzso and protein expression by reverse zzso real-time reverse zzso and Western zzso zzso Nuclear protein binding activities to three response elements located in the zzso promoter zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso zzso binding protein zzso were measured by gel mobility shift zzso We used transient zzso zzso with zzso promoter reporter gene zzso to determine the zzso regulation by zzso zzso Finally, by using zzso zzso zzso we tested the link between zzso zzso and zzso signaling in cell growth zzso zzso and by Western zzso zzso 

We showed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit the growth and induce the zzso of several human lung zzso cell lines, whereas the zzso zzso zzso has little zzso Treatment of lung zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso elevated zzso zzso and protein levels and reduced zzso D1 zzso zzso These results were supported by transient zzso zzso which indicated that zzso zzso increased zzso gene promoter activity in human lung zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso protein expression and significantly blocked lung zzso cell growth zzso induced by zzso zzso Finally, zzso mobility shift experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso increased the nuclear binding activities of zzso and zzso zzso two zzso factors with regulatory elements in the promoter region of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inhibit human lung zzso cell growth and induce zzso by stimulating the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and by reducing zzso D1 gene zzso The induction of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso may be zzso through increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations unveil a mechanism for zzso gene regulation in lung zzso that represents a potential target for zzso
