In pregnancy, vascular zzso oxide zzso production is increased in the systemic and more so in the zzso zzso thereby supporting zzso zzso of the zzso This high level of functionality is matched in the zzso zzso and in corresponding disease states such as zzso reduced vascular responses are seen in both zzso artery and zzso zzso In any zzso cell, NO actually produced by zzso NO zzso zzso is determined by the maximum capacity of the cell zzso expression zzso zzso zzso state, and the zzso zzso concentration in response to circulating hormones or physical zzso zzso we discuss how zzso zzso of NO output is determined as much by pregnancy adaptation of zzso signaling responses as it is by zzso expression and zzso By examining the changes in zzso signaling responses from human hand vein zzso cells, zzso artery zzso cells, and human zzso vein zzso cells in (where zzso zzso normal pregnant, and pathological pregnant zzso state, it is clear that pregnancy adaptation of NO output occurs at the level of sustained phase zzso zzso zzso response, and the adapted response is lacking in zzso zzso Moreover, gap junction function is an essential zzso regulator of the zzso response and impairment of NO output results from any inhibitor of gap junction function, or zzso entry using zzso zzso zzso these zzso signaling mechanisms underlying normal pregnancy adaptation of NO output not only provides novel targets for future treatment of diseases of pregnancy but may also apply to other common forms of zzso
