The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise the main elements of the functional feet of the zzso element in skeletal zzso These two main elements have zzso states that are regulated by the membrane potential and the zzso electrical zzso The pharmacological action of zzso on skeletal muscle depends upon the zzso functional state of the zzso At a resting potential of zzso m zzso zzso at very low zzso zzso M, causes the zzso to have a low zzso state which allows calcium to leak from the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso and to be recycled with zzso zzso leading to a marked increase in oxygen consumption and zzso zzso At zzso greater than zzso M, zzso can cause a slowly developing zzso of resting muscle, inhibit the muscle zzso when the zzso complex is formed during zzso and, if formed before zzso accelerate the development of zzso zzso studies have revealed that the zzso has four binding sites in which the zzso state depends upon the number of sites occupied by zzso Our present understanding of the zzso calcium channel is the result of an interdisciplinary approach in which each discipline zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributes to our knowledge of the pharmacological action of zzso
