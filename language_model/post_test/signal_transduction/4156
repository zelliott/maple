zzso zzso elicits almost identical zzso dose responses in isolated mouse zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso We have further zzso characterized zzso cell VP receptors by comparing the zzso of a series of VP zzso including the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in stimulating insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative orders of potency of VP zzso were parallel in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the most potent zzso tested, behaved as a zzso but zzso zzso The potency of zzso relative to VP was zzso in stimulating insulin zzso and 1:40 with respect to zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso the relative order of affinity of zzso in competition for binding with zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso VP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V2 zzso zzso zzso in parallel with their biological zzso The relative orders of potency and affinity parallel those reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso liver zzso indicate that the zzso VP zzso belongs to the zzso zzso We conclude that VP activates zzso C and interacts with functional VP receptors of the zzso type, which do not belong to the zzso zzso and which are similar to zzso zzso
