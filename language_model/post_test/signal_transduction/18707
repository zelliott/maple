Changes in gene expression are known to occur between closely related species, but it is not yet clear how many of these are due to random fixation of zzso zzso or due to zzso zzso In a zzso survey between subspecies of the zzso zzso complex, we identified the zzso zzso zzso as a candidate for change in gene zzso zzso zzso experiments with multiple individuals from each subspecies confirmed a specific and significant zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that this is due to a new transcript that is not found in other zzso nor in zzso zzso zzso A zzso test via zzso specific expression analysis of the zzso gene in F1 hybrids between zzso and zzso shows that the expression change is mainly caused by a zzso located in zzso zzso diversity was found to be significantly reduced in a window of at least 20 zzso around the zzso locus in zzso indicative of a selective zzso Because the zzso gene is involved in modulating a zzso zzso cascade in a stress response pathway, it seems a plausible target for zzso differences between subspecies, although the functional role of the new zzso transcripts will need to be further zzso
