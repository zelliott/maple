zzso and zzso have been identified as receptors for zzso zzso mediates the pharmacological zzso effects of zzso in zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release of free fatty acids into the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso expression of genes zzso reverse cholesterol zzso although via an unidentified zzso We describe zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso in human zzso cell lines and primary cells in zzso In zzso cells zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso the most potent zzso zzso of zzso Both zzso and the structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso nuclear expression of zzso protein and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso toxin sensitive and required activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso although not in zzso control zzso This was sensitive to zzso toxin and to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso via a zzso toxin and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso can mediate zzso responses to zzso via zzso of the zzso synthesis zzso and induction and zzso of zzso This suggests a novel zzso zzso the clinical effects of pharmacological doses of zzso
