zzso of signal zzso pathways zzso may promote zzso by zzso cell proliferation and survival advantages in acute zzso leukemia zzso Several agents targeting zzso are under zzso however, zzso and zzso between zzso could activate multiple downstream zzso and this could zzso the effect of zzso zzso The frequency of concurrent zzso of multiple zzso in zzso and the zzso relevance of zzso zzso in zzso are zzso zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by Western zzso in samples from 188 patients with newly zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso analysis high levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were adverse factors for survival as was the combination variable zzso Survival progressively decreased as the number of activated pathways zzso Patients were more likely to have none or all 3 pathways activated than was predicted based on the frequency of individual zzso zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso of multiple zzso is common in zzso and has a progressively worse adverse effect on zzso It is thus likely that only combinations of agents that target the multiply activated zzso will be beneficial for patients with zzso
