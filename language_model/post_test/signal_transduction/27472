In zzso zzso the zzso zzso acts with a downstream zzso regulator, zzso to mediate zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigate the functions of two regions of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso repeat domain, which includes six zzso repeats plus zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain, which spans approximately 60 zzso acids just inside the zzso zzso First, we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso domain and zzso is only observed in zzso by a zzso zzso and, therefore, may be either direct or zzso By contrast, the interaction between the zzso domain and zzso is likely to be zzso since it is observed by zzso of the proteins in zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso Second, we demonstrate that the zzso domain, when expressed in zzso without a functional zzso repeat domain, does not mimic the zzso zzso in directing cell fates or interfere with signaling by zzso zzso Finally, we show in zzso that the zzso repeats are strong zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso that eliminate zzso activity also abolish zzso zzso by the zzso zzso repeats in zzso We speculate that one possible function for the zzso repeat domain is to act as a zzso zzso with zzso
