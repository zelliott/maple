The tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso gene is activated by both zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas neither stimulus activates the gene in zzso zzso Moreover, the pattern of zzso zzso within the zzso gene is readily distinguishable in DNA derived from cells of these two zzso These findings would suggest that the zzso gene has been rendered zzso to zzso in the zzso cell zzso When zzso zzso cells are fused with zzso cells, an zzso zzso hybrid zzso In the hybrid cell, all three zzso genes contributed by the zzso zzso cell parent become highly zzso according to the pattern observed in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso bearing zzso zzso of upstream sequence (including the entire zzso promoter and zzso region zzso as well as zzso zzso of downstream sequence (including the entire zzso zzso and termination zzso are accessible in both zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, but are silenced in transition from the zzso zzso cell to the hybrid cell zzso Moreover, the zzso signaling zzso is zzso as assessed by transient zzso of hybrid cells with zzso zzso reporter zzso It would therefore appear that the fusion of zzso cells and zzso zzso cells activates a system that zzso the zzso zzso as well as the zzso signaling zzso This system may operate to determine zzso gene accessibility and zzso responsiveness in the course of cell zzso The DNA sequences targeted within the zzso gene are included in the zzso reporter zzso therefore, the zzso element has been circumscribed to a region of DNA zzso zzso in zzso
