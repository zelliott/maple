zzso acid zzso zzso the only zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso is a key regulator of cellular cholesterol and fatty acid zzso and its zzso contributes to the zzso of various zzso In this study, we questioned whether oxidized or zzso LDL, a common occurrence in zzso and diabetes, affect the activity and expression of zzso in vascular zzso cells zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso zzso activity and expression were zzso in cultured human zzso and zzso exposed to oxidized LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LDL zzso or native LDL zzso as control, in the presence or absence of zzso or zzso zzso We found that zzso activity and expression were significantly down regulated by zzso and zzso in zzso and by zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso reversed the decreased zzso expression in modified zzso or zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso induced a low effect only in zzso In conclusion, modified LDL down regulates zzso expression in human zzso and zzso by a process involving the zzso signaling zzso This is the first demonstration that modified LDL zzso zzso zzso in a cell specific zzso
