A zzso primary zzso technique, using zzso tissue sections was developed to study bystander effects under in zzso like conditions where dividing and differentiated cells are zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue fragments were performed with the Gray Cancer Institute charged particle zzso at a single location (2 zzso zzso with 10 zzso particles (5 zzso LET 70 zzso After zzso the zzso tissue section was incubated for 7 days allowing zzso outgrowth to be zzso zzso was estimated using zzso to zzso III, a specific marker of terminal zzso zzso Even although only a single region of the tissue section was targeted, thousands of additional cells were found to undergo zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso This resulted in an overall increase in the fraction of differentiated cells from zzso to zzso These changes are much greater than that observed for the induction of damage in this zzso One interpretation of these results is that in the tissue environment, differentiation is a much more significant response to targeted zzso and potentially a protective zzso
