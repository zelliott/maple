The zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso the death signal in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso on binding of zzso released zzso c into the zzso zzso complex to ignite the downstream cascade of zzso Here, we present the zzso crystal structure of full-length zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso The structure shows how the zzso death switch is kept in its zzso zzso By comparing the off state with a recent zzso zzso derived model of zzso in its zzso zzso we depict the molecular events that transform zzso from zzso zzso to a building block of the zzso zzso Moreover, we have solved the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso in the absence of zzso c to zzso resolution and we show that proper function of zzso relies on zzso in the vicinity of the bound zzso
