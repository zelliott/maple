Exposure of zzso zzso to elevated zzso zzso (30 versus 3 zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso to the zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kennedy, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso a dominant negative form of the zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain, and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso blocked these zzso Similarly, zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso blocked the zzso from the nuclear membrane to the zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on any of the above zzso and zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso of the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no change in the activity of extracted zzso could be detected after incubation of cells at either 3 or 30 zzso zzso These data suggest that stimulation of zzso is necessary and sufficient for the effects of zzso on zzso gene transcription, acting via a downstream signaling zzso that does not involve zzso
