zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and zzso zzso zzso by several zzso zzso zzso including zzso growth factor and zzso growth zzso Here we identify the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as an additional positive regulator in the zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso during zzso zzso zzso has an expression pattern that displays substantial overlap with zzso zzso 1 zzso during zzso zzso Using zzso zzso technology, we show that zzso of zzso zzso expression dramatically restricts anterior and zzso structure development and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso loss of zzso expression dramatically blocks the induction of the early zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and partially blocks zzso induction by zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso is also inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso however, introduction of zzso zzso zzso is able to rescue zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity due to loss of zzso is also rescued by an active zzso zzso that zzso may act upstream of or parallel to zzso Finally, zzso physically associates only with an activated zzso and this interaction requires the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has been shown to participate in other zzso systems, the data presented here also reveal zzso as a new and important component of the zzso signaling zzso
