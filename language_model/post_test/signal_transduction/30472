The zzso zzso factor, nuclear factor Y zzso consists of three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso compartment of wing discs by a zzso and zzso mainly resulted in a zzso disclosed zzso Reduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basket zzso gene dose enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso Monitoring of zzso activity in the wing disc by zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso trap line revealed reduction in the level of the zzso reporter, zzso signals, in zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso zzso effectively suppressed the zzso induced by zzso of zzso The zzso gene promoter contains a zzso motif and this motif plays a positive role in the promoter zzso We performed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso The zzso gene promoter region containing the zzso boxes was effectively amplified in the zzso by zzso However, this region was not amplified in the zzso from zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the level of zzso zzso zzso is reduced in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is necessary for proper zzso expression and activity of zzso zzso during zzso zzso
