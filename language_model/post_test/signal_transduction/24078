zzso hormone zzso release from anterior zzso zzso is greatly increased during peripheral inflammation induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to participate in zzso zzso release, but whether or not zzso are directly targeted by this zzso is zzso zzso we investigated the expression and zzso of zzso signaling components in the zzso of rats 2 and 4 h after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment provoked the nuclear zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and zzso expression in the anterior zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso By using in zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso and zzso zzso were significantly induced by the zzso treatment in the anterior lobe of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that most zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that 2 h after zzso treatment, zzso and zzso zzso were induced in zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso could regulate the zzso axis by directly targeting zzso during peripheral zzso
