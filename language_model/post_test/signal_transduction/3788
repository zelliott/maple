zzso for the zzso hormones, zzso zzso and zzso are a unique zzso of the zzso G zzso proteins with a large zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso expression of soluble binding proteins has been zzso We fused the zzso of zzso or zzso receptors to the zzso domain of zzso and found that hybrid proteins anchored on the cell surface retained zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso site in the hybrids allowed generation of soluble zzso fragments that zzso with zzso binding to their receptors and blocked zzso production zzso by zzso zzso analyses confirmed the formation of high molecular weight complexes between zzso zzso and their specific zzso A similar approach also generated a soluble zzso zzso zzso capable of blocking zzso signal zzso When administered to rats, the soluble zzso zzso zzso retarded zzso growth and induced zzso cell zzso These findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating zzso regions of zzso hormone receptors to selectively neutralize actions of zzso and zzso thus allowing future design of novel zzso and management of different zzso and zzso zzso The present study represents the first successful derivation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso hormone receptors as functional zzso Similar approaches could allow generation of zzso of related receptors to neutralize actions of zzso or zzso zzso and to facilitate zzso zzso
