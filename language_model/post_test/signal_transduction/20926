zzso injections of adult mice with zzso zzso zzso prolong the survival of zzso F1 mice, and suppress type I zzso diabetes zzso zzso in non-obese diabetic zzso zzso To determine whether repeated zzso injections suppress T cell function in adult mice, we studied the responses of influenza zzso T cells derived from T cell zzso zzso transgenic zzso Treatment of adult mice with zzso zzso for 3 zzso suppressed a broad range of T cell responses, including proliferation and zzso zzso Furthermore, T cell responses of zzso transgenic mice also expressing the human zzso zzso were markedly reduced compared to zzso single transgenic zzso indicating that sustained zzso zzso signaling is sufficient to suppress T cell function in zzso Using a model of chronic zzso exposure in zzso we demonstrate that zzso chronic zzso effects are dose and time dependent, zzso zzso suppresses the responses of both zzso and zzso T helper subsets, zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso produced in T cell cultures could be reversed with zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso prolonged zzso exposure zzso T cell zzso zzso The finding that zzso treatment in zzso enhances T cell zzso responses and zzso production provides evidence for a novel regulatory effect of zzso on T cells in healthy laboratory zzso These effects are more pronounced in chronic inflammatory zzso In addition, our data provide a mechanism through which prolonged zzso exposure suppresses disease in animal models of zzso
