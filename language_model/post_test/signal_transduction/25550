Chicken type II collagen zzso is a protein extracted from the cartilage of chicken breast and exhibits intriguing possibilities for the treatment of zzso diseases by inducing oral zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on inflammatory and immune responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso arthritis zzso zzso The onset of secondary arthritis in rats appeared around day 14 after injection of zzso zzso zzso secondary inflammatory response and zzso proliferation were observed in zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso 20, zzso days zzso could significantly reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory cells zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso days zzso restored the previously decreased level of zzso of zzso of zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso increased total protein expressions of zzso zzso and decreased that of zzso 2 of zzso in zzso rats but had an slight effect on zzso zzso further increased zzso protein expressions of zzso zzso and decreased that of zzso 2, zzso and increased membrane protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso and decreased that of zzso 2 of zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the mechanisms of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso of zzso play crucial roles in zzso of this zzso
