zzso necrosis factor zzso is a zzso with well known zzso properties and is being zzso as zzso agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced solid zzso However, zzso role in cancer biology is zzso In fact, in spite of the wealth of evidence supporting its zzso activity, the cascade of molecular events underlying zzso tumor zzso observed in zzso is still incompletely zzso Furthermore, some zzso findings suggest that zzso may even promote cancer development and zzso With this work we intend to zzso the molecular biology of zzso (with particular regard to its zzso zzso and review the experimental and clinical evidence currently available describing the complex and sometime apparently conflicting relationship between this zzso cancer biology and zzso zzso We also propose a model to explain the dual effect of zzso based on the exposure time and zzso levels reached within the tumor zzso Finally, we overview recent research findings that might lead to new ways for exploiting the zzso potential of zzso in the clinical zzso
