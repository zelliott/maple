Biological responses of zzso growth factor zzso are zzso by the Met zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is a potent zzso for a variety of cells, the signals required for zzso progression by the zzso zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we have used the zzso zzso system to define the role of various Met zzso partners and downstream signaling pathways in zzso zzso We show that zzso progression and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso Met zzso zzso are dependent on its zzso activity and the presence of the twin zzso zzso & zzso zzso in its zzso but that the recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso proteins is zzso implicating other signaling zzso However, using Met zzso zzso engineered to recruit specific signaling zzso we demonstrate that recruitment of zzso or zzso zzso proteins is sufficient to induce zzso progression and zzso of zzso and zzso while the binding of zzso or zzso zzso alone fails to elicit these zzso Using various means to block zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity, we show that unlike the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and independent signaling contribute to Met zzso zzso zzso but zzso or zzso activity and zzso synthesis are not zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso signaling are required for zzso progression initiated by the Met zzso a protein frequently zzso in human zzso
