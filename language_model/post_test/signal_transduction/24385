Small zzso proteins regulate diverse processes in zzso cells such as signal zzso cell zzso zzso organization, and zzso membrane zzso These proteins function as molecular switches that cycle between zzso and zzso states, and this cycle is linked to the binding and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso contains 93 genes that zzso small zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of these genes shows that plants contain zzso zzso zzso and Ran zzso but no Ras zzso We have assembled complete lists of these small zzso families, as well as accessory proteins that control their activity, and review what is known of the functions of individual members of these families in zzso We also discuss the possible roles of these zzso in relation to their similarity to zzso with known functions and zzso in zzso and/or animal zzso
