The role of each of the four zzso bonds in zzso was investigated by systematically and zzso replacing each with its corresponding zzso Six zzso zzso based on six zzso surrogates and two zzso zzso were zzso and thoroughly tested using a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a competition binding zzso to evaluate their biological zzso We observed that an zzso can efficiently replace the first zzso bond of zzso and zzso without significantly affecting biological zzso By contrast, the second zzso bond was found to be highly sensitive to the same zzso suggesting that it is involved in biologically essential zzso or zzso zzso Finally, we observed that the affinity and activity of zzso containing an zzso at either the third or fourth position were partially reduced, indicating that these zzso bonds are less important for these zzso or zzso zzso Overall, our study demonstrates that the systematic and sequential replacement of zzso bonds by zzso represents an efficient way to explore zzso zzso
