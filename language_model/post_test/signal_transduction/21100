It has been recently shown that zzso enhanced the zzso expression of the zzso gene in resident mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso but little is known about the pathways zzso In this report, we show that both zzso and zzso zzso release were enhanced and prolonged in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso release required higher zzso of zzso while enhanced zzso release was diminished when inhibitor zzso exceeded defined zzso SP was also shown to activate zzso zzso release by blood zzso and zzso PM zzso but had no effect on their responsiveness to zzso zzso of zzso by exposure of resident PM zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in enhanced zzso release and zzso was shown to zzso with zzso These data indicate that zzso does not induce zzso gene expression by amplifying the zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso It exerts its effects independently of zzso which may activate zzso gene expression in its own right by an alternative zzso While zzso and zzso are involved in separate zzso the synergistic zzso response seen when zzso and zzso interact suggests convergence of the two zzso It is also apparent that multiple zzso excluding zzso may be involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
