zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produce compounds that act as zzso zzso survival and/or growth zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso IX, human zzso and bovine insulin were tested for their ability to substitute for the zzso factors and stimulate cell survival and zzso The cells were zzso into zzso zzso in a nutritionally complete, chemically defined medium at known cell zzso from 5 to zzso zzso In zzso medium cells at 5 to 500 zzso zzso initial cell density zzso died within 8 zzso whereas cells at 1000 and zzso zzso zzso initial cell density zzso proliferated with lag zzso lasting for up to 4 zzso In the presence of insulin compounds, zzso zzso IX, or zzso zzso zzso cells also proliferated at all low initial cell zzso zzso zzso was effective over two separate concentration zzso at the zzso levels as well at low zzso to zzso zzso At initial population zzso of up to 50 zzso the cells at both zzso of sodium zzso survived about zzso longer than the zzso At 500 initial zzso cells at the high zzso of sodium zzso survived about zzso longer than those of the control cultures; they proliferated in the low zzso of sodium zzso zzso of zzso too low to have any effects on their own, had synergistic effects with sodium zzso zzso inhibited proliferation at high initial cell zzso This zzso action was reduced by high zzso of zzso zzso IX, sodium zzso or zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso blue inhibited cell proliferation at high initial cell zzso This zzso was zzso by addition of zzso zzso The findings that zzso material may be released from zzso and that insulin and sodium zzso increase zzso zzso in these cells are discussed in relation to the presented zzso Together these observations suggest that zzso is responsible for supporting cell survival in zzso and switching the cells into their zzso mode, and that zzso signal molecules and insulin stimulate an zzso zzso zzso into producing zzso
