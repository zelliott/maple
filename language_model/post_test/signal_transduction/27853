zzso zzso a zzso A derived zzso with an array of effects in different zzso has a role as a zzso hormone of insulin action in zzso and zzso regulating zzso zzso and protein zzso We have previously characterized zzso receptors and signaling in rat zzso in which zzso functions as a zzso zzso In the present work we have studied zzso receptors as well as the signal zzso pathways generated upon zzso binding in zzso zzso First, we have characterized zzso receptors using zzso zzso as a zzso Analysis of binding data indicated the existence of one class of binding sites, with a zzso of 5 zzso of protein and a zzso of 1 zzso In addition, we have studied the G protein system that couples the zzso zzso by zzso binding zzso We have found that two G protein systems are involved, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein alpha zzso zzso were used to block the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso are activated by zzso in rat zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso activity was not affected by zzso Finally, we have studied the specific zzso C zzso that is activated in response to zzso We have found that zzso zzso is coupled to zzso via zzso zzso in zzso zzso
