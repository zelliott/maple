zzso is an ubiquitous membrane zzso that allows the zzso of three sodium zzso from the cell and two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Its activity is decreased in many zzso of zzso diabetic zzso This impairment could be at least partly responsible for the development of diabetic zzso zzso activity is decreased in the red blood cell zzso of type 1 diabetic individuals, irrespective of the degree of diabetic zzso It is less impaired or even normal in those of type 2 diabetic zzso The authors have shown that in the red blood cells of type 2 diabetic patients, zzso activity was strongly related to blood zzso levels in zzso patients (in whom zzso concentration reflects that of zzso as well as in zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso relationship has been zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in red blood cells and nerve tissue is zzso by the zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso 1 of this gene is associated with lower zzso activity in patients with zzso zzso either with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but not in normal zzso There are several lines of evidence for a low zzso level being responsible for low zzso activity in the red blood zzso zzso zzso infusion to type 1 diabetic patients restores normal zzso zzso zzso zzso which restores zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso activity zzso to the rise in zzso This zzso effect is not zzso In fact, incubation of diabetic red blood cells with zzso at zzso concentration leads to an increase of zzso zzso In isolated zzso zzso of rats or in the zzso thick ascending limb of the zzso zzso stimulates in a zzso manner zzso zzso This impairment in zzso activity, mainly secondary to the lack of zzso plays probably a role in the development of diabetic zzso Arguments have been developed showing that the zzso decrease in zzso activity compromises zzso blood flow by two zzso by affecting zzso regulation and by decreasing red blood cell zzso which leads to an increase in blood zzso zzso infusion restores red blood cell zzso and zzso blood flow zzso with zzso zzso The zzso in zzso is strongly related to diabetic zzso Patients with zzso have lower zzso activity than those zzso The zzso impairment in zzso activity is identical in red blood cells and neural zzso Red blood cell zzso activity is related to nerve zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso nerve of diabetic zzso zzso infusion to diabetic rats increases zzso zzso activity in zzso Because the zzso in zzso activity is also probably involved in the development of diabetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso infusion could be beneficial for the prevention of diabetic zzso
