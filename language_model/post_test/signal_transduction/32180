zzso receptors zzso are emerging as important breast cancer zzso zzso events common to breast cancer cells impact zzso zzso activity, in part by direct zzso zzso but not zzso zzso are zzso on zzso by zzso activated protein zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso is, a repressive zzso zzso of zzso small zzso modifier zzso by zzso protein zzso suggests a mechanism for zzso zzso is, zzso zzso of target zzso As a broad range of zzso protein expression is observed zzso a zzso gene signature would provide a valuable marker of zzso contribution to early breast cancer zzso 

Global gene expression patterns were measured in zzso and zzso breast cancer cells expressing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and subjected to zzso zzso Gene sets were validated by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso Changes in cell proliferation and survival were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso Finally, human breast tumor cohort zzso were zzso to identify zzso gene zzso zzso analysis was employed to define survival rates in patients whose tumors express a zzso gene zzso 

zzso zzso target genes primarily include genes required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are zzso recruited to zzso regions of zzso genes zzso is, zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and mixed lineage leukemia 2 zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks these events, suggesting that zzso modification of zzso prevents interactions with zzso of early zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene signatures are significantly associated with human zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso breast tumors and zzso of early zzso and shortened zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and inhibited proliferation in zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso zzso profoundly alters target gene selection in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso favors a zzso zzso environment via recruitment of zzso and zzso Patients whose zzso tumors are driven by zzso zzso is, zzso zzso may benefit from zzso zzso therapies that contain an zzso
