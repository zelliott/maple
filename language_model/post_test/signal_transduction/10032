zzso growth zzso proteins zzso are zzso carrier proteins that release zzso growth factors zzso from the zzso zzso storage and thus enhance zzso zzso Here we have mapped the interaction domain between human zzso and zzso For this, we generated zzso zzso display libraries of zzso and zzso truncated zzso fragments that were then panned against immobilized zzso From this zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso was identified as the minimum binding domain for zzso As a zzso zzso this zzso zzso binds to zzso and enhances zzso signaling in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, as well as zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso interaction domain in zzso is distinct from the zzso domain zzso acids zzso and zzso modeling supports the notion of a distinct domain in the C zzso that is zzso across different zzso This domain also contains zzso positioning of zzso zzso with the zzso positions in the human protein predicted to participate in zzso bridge zzso zzso display of a zzso zzso of zzso reduced binding to zzso indicating the functional significance of this zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso interaction domain is contained in the C zzso of zzso
