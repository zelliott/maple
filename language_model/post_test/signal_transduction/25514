After injury to the central nervous system intrinsic factors such as zzso associated zzso factors inhibit cellular and zzso zzso resulting in permanent zzso Three of these factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to a common zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed mainly on zzso and is usually associated in a zzso zzso The second member of the complex, zzso is often connected to zzso function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of zzso proliferation and zzso The third member of the zzso complex is either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or an as yet unidentified zzso zzso of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of zzso zzso zzso proliferation and differentiation and zzso of cell zzso In the current review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological compounds used in targeting zzso and zzso This will be achieved using three examples: blocking of zzso binding to zzso in treatment of spinal zzso injury, zzso zzso of zzso to promote zzso differentiation in multiple zzso and the use of soluble zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the periphery in Alzheimer's zzso
