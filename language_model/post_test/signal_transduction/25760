Members of the zzso and zzso protein families play a relevant role in zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso are crucial for the zzso of their zzso Lack of expression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cell lines is a zzso of the zzso response induced by their bone zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cell lines express zzso zzso We hypothesized that cancer zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso bone zzso of solid zzso by zzso bone zzso zzso zzso of zzso prostate cancer cells induced zzso zzso characterized not only by enhanced zzso bone zzso but also by decreased zzso bone zzso zzso in this model, zzso of the bone zzso process contributes to zzso Bone formation was preserved in the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso cells, suggesting that cancer zzso zzso interferes with zzso bone zzso Furthermore, zzso tumor growth of zzso zzso cells was zzso most probably as a result of the zzso zzso zzso This investigation provides new evidence for a model of zzso bone zzso where zzso zzso of zzso by cancer cells mediates zzso of bone formation, thereby preventing repair of zzso zzso generated by an excess of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso suppression may be a novel strategy for the treatment of zzso bone zzso
