Human newborns are more susceptible than adults to bacterial zzso With zzso bacteria, this may be due to a diminished response of newborn zzso to zzso zzso Since protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in adult cells, we hypothesized that protein zzso zzso may have a critical role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that newborn zzso may have altered protein zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso family protein zzso zzso in the zzso response of newborn zzso compared to adult zzso In a respiratory zzso the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso release by adult zzso was greatly decreased by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to the level of zzso newborn zzso in which zzso failed to zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both adult and newborn zzso but increased the zzso of zzso zzso only in adult zzso In newborn zzso zzso was highly zzso independent of zzso We evaluated zzso zzso of zzso and found that the zzso form of zzso was mainly in the zzso zzso fraction in adult zzso while in newborn cells it was located mainly in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso were mainly detected in the zzso in both adult and newborn zzso These data indicate a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso fraction in newborn zzso may contribute to the zzso of newborn cells in responding to zzso zzso
