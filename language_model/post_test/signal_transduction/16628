Experimental control over the position and connectivity pattern of zzso on a surface is of central interest for applications in zzso such as zzso zzso and tissue zzso By restricting zzso networks to a simple grid pattern, a drastic reduction of network complexity can be achieved relative to networks on homogeneous zzso zzso patterned zzso networks are also a valuable tool in research on zzso signal zzso zzso printing has emerged as a simple and efficient method for surface patterning to direct cellular zzso Although the formation of synaptic contacts in networks of rat cortical cells on such surfaces has been demonstrated, evidence of more complex circuits has been zzso Triple zzso zzso were performed to analyze connectivity in zzso networks complying with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the pattern and interconnected to a range of different types of zzso linear connections, feedback zzso as well as branching and zzso zzso We conclude that in spite of the severe geometric zzso a complex repertoire of different connectivity patterns can form along the provided zzso At the same time, network complexity is kept low enough to allow the study of these patterns at the resolution of single zzso zzso
