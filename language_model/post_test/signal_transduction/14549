The effect of zzso free fatty acids on zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been a controversial zzso This study examined direct effects of zzso acid zzso on zzso release from rat pancreatic zzso and on zzso zzso concentration zzso in single zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 zzso increased zzso release from isolated zzso in the presence of low zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 6-10 zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso irrespective of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso increased zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso increases were strongly inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso and by zzso zzso the blocker of both zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso increases was reduced substantially by zzso conditions and mildly by an zzso zzso channel blocker, zzso and an zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso release was also inhibited mildly by zzso and strongly by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso stimulates zzso release by increasing zzso in rat pancreatic zzso and that the zzso increase is triggered by zzso release from zzso zzso and amplified by zzso influx possibly via zzso channels and via zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso to stimulate zzso release from zzso may operate under zzso conditions when plasma free fatty acids levels are zzso possibly playing a role in maintaining zzso zzso
