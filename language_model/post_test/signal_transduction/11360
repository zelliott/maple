In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate the type zzso zzso zzso by promoting the association of this zzso with the inhibitor zzso Here, we describe zzso a zzso zzso protein involved in the regulation of zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso resistance, suppresses a zzso zzso and prevents zzso of zzso from zzso Furthermore, a zzso deletion prevents zzso events such as zzso of the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso factor zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso by binding and zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso is zzso upon zzso treatment via zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is part of a feedback loop that rapidly zzso zzso zzso activity under zzso zzso
