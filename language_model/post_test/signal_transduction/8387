The zzso disc, a zzso contact site between neighboring cardiac zzso plays an important role in maintaining the zzso of the heart by zzso electric and mechanical zzso Changes in the architecture of the zzso disc have been observed in zzso zzso Among zzso junctions in the zzso disc, zzso junctions are involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules that exist in zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in cardiac zzso and integrity of the zzso disc are zzso Among the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at the zzso disc in the zzso zzso mice showed normal cardiac structure and function under zzso zzso Four weeks after zzso of the ascending zzso cardiac function was significantly impaired in zzso mice compared with zzso mice, although both zzso and zzso mice developed similar degrees of cardiac zzso zzso zzso mice displayed cardiac zzso more evidently than banded zzso zzso The disruption of the zzso discs and zzso zzso were observed in banded zzso zzso Furthermore, the number of zzso cardiac zzso was increased in banded zzso zzso In the hearts of banded zzso mice, zzso remained at lower zzso levels until 2 weeks after zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso were highly zzso compared with those of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is required to maintain structure and function of the zzso disc and protects the heart from zzso cardiac zzso
