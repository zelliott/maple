zzso of zzso and other zzso molecules at discrete cellular locations is often an essential component of signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a small, zzso zzso that presumably lacks zzso zzso Yet in zzso the zzso distribution of several zzso signal zzso proteins involved in the control of polar zzso and cell cycle progression changes from a fairly dispersed distribution to a tight zzso at one or both poles in a spatial and zzso pattern that is reproduced during each cell zzso This cell zzso choreography suggests that similarly to what happens in zzso protein zzso provides a means of modulating signal zzso in zzso Recent studies have provided important insights into the biological role and the mechanisms for the differential zzso of these bacterial zzso proteins during the zzso cell zzso
