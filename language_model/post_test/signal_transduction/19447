The heart is one of the first functional embryonic zzso occurring during zzso The fundamental zzso processes and genes involved in zzso are zzso between the zzso and zzso In the past zzso years, one of signaling pathways that has been best characterized in heart development in both zzso and zzso is the zzso signaling zzso Since our discovery of the zzso signaling required for the early heart development in zzso the past zzso years have witnessed tremendous progress in the understanding of specific zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso This review will zzso the current state of knowledge of zzso signaling zzso in zzso heart development, which will benefit our understanding of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso
