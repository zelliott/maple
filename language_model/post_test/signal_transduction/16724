zzso play a central role in maintaining zzso in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells through a member of the zzso type zzso family termed leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso through the class I zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso complex with zzso and the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play a crucial role in zzso in mouse zzso cells probably by induction of zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso leads to zzso However, important connections between zzso and other zzso pathways have been zzso In addition, zzso zzso leads to both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to maintain zzso of both human zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso It seems quite possible that the main zzso maintaining zzso in zzso cells is the zzso pathway, while the zzso zzso is present in mouse cells as an adaptation for sustaining zzso during embryonic zzso a condition of delayed zzso in zzso In keeping with this scenario, the zzso zzso has been shown to elevate the level of zzso Thus, the two pathways seem to zzso on zzso as a common target to promote zzso Whereas zzso does not seem to stimulate zzso in human embryonic stem cells it cannot be excluded that other zzso are zzso The zzso actions of the increasing number of zzso and receptors zzso via zzso zzso and zzso exhibit considerable zzso compensation and plasticity in stem cells in accordance with the view that stem cells are governed by quantitative variations in strength and duration of zzso events known from other cell types rather than zzso different stem zzso zzso
