zzso were performed to define the basis for negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso II in zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso II resulted in rapid and sustained zzso of zzso on zzso in contrast, zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso being most pronounced at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not prevented by zzso protein zzso but was blocked by zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso II also attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso and this effect could be blocked with zzso These results are consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso and accounting for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We propose that zzso serves as a scaffolding protein in recruiting either a protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso
