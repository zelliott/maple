Increased production and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are critical events in skeletal muscle zzso and are known to occur in response to mechanical zzso We hypothesized that reorganization of the zzso zzso would increase zzso cell production and zzso of zzso and that this increase would require a zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso The pharmacological zzso zzso agent zzso D increased expression of zzso and membrane type zzso zzso zzso zzso and this was reduced significantly in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was sufficient to induce expression of both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso a downstream target of zzso with small interference zzso inhibited zzso expression in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso significantly decreased the amount of active zzso following zzso D stimulation with a concurrent decrease in zzso zzso zzso reorganization of zzso occurs during zzso zzso zzso zzso protein production and zzso as well as zzso protein production, depended on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced by zzso of zzso or by treatment with zzso zzso In zzso our results provide novel insight into the signaling zzso initiated in the early stages of zzso through the reorganization of the zzso zzso and demonstrate a critical role for zzso in regulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso regulates protein levels of both zzso and zzso
