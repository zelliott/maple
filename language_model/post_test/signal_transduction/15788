During their evolution, plants have acquired diverse capabilities to sense their environment and modify their growth and development as zzso The versatile zzso of solar radiation for photosynthesis as well as a signal to coordinate zzso responses to the environment is an excellent example of such a zzso zzso light quality zzso are converted to zzso zzso mainly through hormonal zzso zzso zzso extensive interactions between light and the zzso pathways of every known plant hormone have been uncovered in recent zzso One such interaction that has received recent attention and forms the focus of this review occurs between light and the zzso zzso of the zzso hormone with roles in regulating plant zzso and zzso Here the recent research that revealed new zzso insights into how plants might integrate light and zzso signals to modify their growth and development, especially when defending themselves from either zzso zzso or encroaching zzso is zzso
