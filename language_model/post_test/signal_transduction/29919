The zzso zzso factor zzso family of molecules acts as adapter proteins for signaling pathways initiated by several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso animals are viable and have normal development of the immune system despite interacting with several zzso family zzso A clear role for zzso has yet to zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso suggesting that this zzso could be involved in regulating T cell differentiation into zzso or zzso zzso In tissue culture, zzso stimulation of zzso T cells resulted in a pronounced zzso zzso with elevated levels of zzso and zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso with protein in zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso development in zzso zzso Additionally, lung inflammation induced by T cells, which is critically controlled by zzso was more pronounced in zzso mice, characterized by higher levels of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can limit the induction of zzso responses, and that zzso can play a role in modulating responses driven by zzso zzso
