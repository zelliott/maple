To colonize the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso establishes zzso communities referred to as zzso Although the signaling zzso zzso zzso the transition from zzso to zzso growth, the environmental zzso required to zzso zzso formation remain zzso Using relevant zzso zzso of the 19 zzso acids previously identified in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso robustly promoted zzso formation zzso Among the seven zzso zzso zzso only zzso also completely zzso the ability of zzso zzso to swarm over zzso surfaces, suggesting that zzso may be an environmental cue favoring a zzso zzso zzso two documented zzso zzso required for zzso formation zzso and zzso reduced zzso formation and restored swarming zzso on zzso zzso Growth on zzso increased the zzso levels of zzso and this increase was dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso or both also showed a reduction in zzso formation when grown with the other zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso acids can zzso zzso formation and swarming zzso at least in part, by controlling the zzso levels of zzso
