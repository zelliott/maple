zzso zzso play an important role in recruitment of T zzso to inflammatory zzso T zzso zzso zzso but the zzso requirements for zzso production by T cells are zzso We studied the regulation of zzso zzso production by zzso zzso signals by zzso T zzso zzso from zzso mice cultured with zzso zzso expressed zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso plus zzso zzso zzso production by zzso T cells from zzso zzso transgenic mice was zzso by zzso zzso and increased compared with zzso zzso When T cell zzso was provided by zzso zzso was not zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice suggested that zzso production is controlled by pathways different from those regulating T cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso may amplify an immune response by stimulating T cell survival, zzso and production of zzso that recruit T cells to inflammatory zzso
