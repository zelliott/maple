The formation of blood in the zzso is dependent on bone zzso protein zzso but how zzso signaling zzso with other regulators of zzso development is zzso Using embryonic stem zzso cells, we show that zzso first zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently directs zzso cells toward blood fate by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso signaling is blocked during this latter phase, enforced expression of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso development, thereby placing zzso signaling upstream of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso signaling plays two distinct and sequential roles during blood formation, initially as an zzso of zzso and later to specify blood via zzso of zzso signaling and the zzso zzso
