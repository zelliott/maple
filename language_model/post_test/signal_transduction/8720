zzso in zzso the gene for the zzso zzso protein zzso cause a severe muscular zzso termed zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso zzso patients have accompanying zzso neural zzso and white matter abnormalities for which the underlying mechanisms remain zzso Here, we report that in zzso mice, zzso development was delayed such that zzso zzso accumulated inappropriately in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to promote the transition of zzso zzso to newly formed zzso zzso differentiation was zzso family zzso and resulted in the zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso In zzso zzso however, increased zzso repression was accompanied by elevated levels of the zzso family zzso negative regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso deficiencies delay zzso maturation by causing zzso of signaling pathways critical for zzso development, and suggest that a normal role for zzso zzso is to promote the development of zzso zzso into zzso zzso via zzso of zzso regulatory zzso
