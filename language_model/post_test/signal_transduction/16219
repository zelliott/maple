Two competing theories have been put forward to explain the role of zzso T cells in zzso zzso memory T zzso one proposes zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso the other proposes the zzso of zzso cells zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso We investigated the requirement for zzso by the relevant three cell types in zzso and found that zzso T cells, rather than zzso T cells or zzso cells zzso produced the zzso necessary for zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso T cells were able to provide help only if their ability to transmit signals via zzso was zzso Our findings reconcile contradictory elements implicit in each model noted above by showing that zzso T cells activate zzso through a zzso mechanism to enable zzso production of zzso in zzso memory T zzso
