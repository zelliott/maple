The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso of gap junctions zzso prior to zzso would modify the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso in a canine model of zzso 

Twenty control dogs, zzso with zzso and zzso were zzso and subjected either to a 25 or a 60 zzso zzso of the left anterior descending zzso coronary zzso This prolonged zzso was preceded 20 zzso earlier by a single 5 zzso zzso zzso in zzso dogs zzso zzso zzso or by a 20 zzso zzso infusion of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a relatively selective zzso of gap zzso zzso was also infused in PC dogs zzso zzso zzso The severity of zzso zzso zzso changes, zzso of electrical zzso and of zzso zzso such as zzso premature beats zzso zzso zzso zzso episodes and zzso zzso zzso as well as changes in electrical zzso was assessed throughout the zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined at the end of the zzso zzso 

Compared to the controls PC and, interestingly, zzso markedly reduced, zzso the total number of zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso during the prolonged zzso This protection was, however, attenuated when zzso was infused in PC dogs zzso zzso Changes in electrical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly less in the PC and zzso groups than in the controls but these were again increased in the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso prior to zzso either by PC or zzso preserves the electrical zzso of cells and results in an zzso effect during a subsequent zzso zzso indicating that a partial closure of gap junctions may play a trigger role in the zzso In contrast, when zzso is administered in PC dogs the protection both against zzso zzso and zzso is markedly zzso suggesting that the zzso protection, at least in part, is zzso through zzso
