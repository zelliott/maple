zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso factors, is necessary for zzso maintenance and zzso zzso We identified a new zzso termed zzso zzso zzso that is bound by zzso and zzso in human embryonic stem cells zzso and derived zzso We demonstrate that two basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso motif at regions overlapping zzso and zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso associate with zzso and zzso suggesting they form a complex at critical target zzso This association is biologically important, as zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, E proteins are novel zzso signaling zzso that associate with zzso and zzso and are necessary for zzso zzso
