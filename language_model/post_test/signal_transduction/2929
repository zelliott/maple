Increased production of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a feature of inflammatory lung diseases, including zzso and fibrosis, but the divergent pathological characteristics that result indicate involvement of other processes in disease zzso zzso mice zzso zzso in type II zzso zzso cells under the control of the zzso protein zzso promoter develop pulmonary inflammation and zzso but are resistant to induction of zzso by administration of zzso or transforming growth zzso To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this zzso we used a zzso approach to characterize the pulmonary zzso of zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed pronounced pulmonary zzso zzso enlargement, increased zzso and zzso levels, and altered expression of zzso zzso The functional assessment of genes with increased expression revealed enrichment of zzso responses and zzso whereas genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of basement membrane zzso and zzso differentiation were predominantly zzso zzso with multiple lung disease models identified a set of genes unique to the zzso model and revealed that lack of zzso zzso production distinguished zzso mice from zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory and zzso pathways and disruption of maintenance and repair processes are central features of zzso in this zzso zzso zzso of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso production may zzso resistance to induction of zzso
