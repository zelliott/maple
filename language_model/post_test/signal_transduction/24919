Although cell movements are vital for establishing the normal architecture of zzso it is unclear how these movements are regulated during development in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso function zzso zzso extension movements of cells during zzso but the mechanism of this effect is zzso as cell fates are not zzso In zzso zzso controls both cell fate and cell zzso but whether zzso is involved in controlling cell polarity in zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we show, using zzso zzso zzso that the failure of cells lacking zzso function to undergo zzso extension results from defects in cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso that inhibit zzso extension zzso to zzso in zzso zzso that selectively zzso zzso cell zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso at the membrane of normal zzso zzso cells is consistent with zzso controlling cell zzso Our results show that polarized cell zzso is essential for zzso extension and is controlled by zzso zzso Thus, a zzso equivalent of the zzso zzso cell polarity zzso cascade may be required for normal zzso
