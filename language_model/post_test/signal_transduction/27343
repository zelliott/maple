zzso gamma zzso zzso rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso which then forms zzso zzso to the nucleus and zzso in zzso zzso However, little is known of the interactions between zzso and the general zzso machinery during zzso zzso We show here that zzso can directly interact with the zzso protein zzso family of zzso zzso Specifically, two interaction regions were zzso the zzso region of zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso region of zzso interacts with the domain of zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest a role for these interactions in zzso zzso Because zzso is required for the zzso zzso protein to regulate zzso of many genes during viral replication and cellular zzso it is possible that the zzso effect of zzso is based at least in part on direct competition by nuclear zzso with zzso for zzso zzso
