zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive zzso of the motor zzso in the cortex, zzso and spinal zzso The zzso and mechanisms of selective motor zzso loss in ALS remain zzso zzso signaling is involved in neurodegenerative processes but little is known about the kinetic changes in zzso signaling during ALS zzso In this study we used zzso zzso analysis to examine the expression of zzso signaling components in the spinal cords of ALS transgenic zzso mice at different zzso We found that ALS onset led to the zzso of zzso signaling components and target genes involved in growth regulation and zzso We also determined the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the spinal zzso of ALS transgenic mice at different stages by Western zzso and zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso and zzso in the spinal cords of ALS transgenic mice were zzso compared to those in zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso and zzso in mature zzso zzso was increased at the end stage of zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso signaling is altered by spinal zzso zzso dysfunction in adult ALS transgenic mice, which provides new insight into ALS zzso
