zzso protein degradation zzso is a protein quality control system of zzso which eliminates zzso proteins by zzso degradation and ensures export of only properly folded proteins from zzso zzso an zzso membrane protein zzso by zzso stress, is implicated in regulation of zzso In the present study, we show that zzso interacts with members of the zzso family, which function as a shuttle factor to deliver zzso zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso stabilized the zzso zzso zzso whereas it did not alter or increased degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was stabilized by zzso zzso zzso which were capable of binding to zzso but were impaired in zzso membrane targeting by deletion of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso binding to zzso proteins plays an important role in the zzso zzso and that zzso are specifically involved in degradation of only a subset of zzso targets, including zzso zzso zzso
