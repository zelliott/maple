Control of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso is essential in the development and maintenance of a healthy zzso Acquisition of a zzso zzso zzso by zzso following vascular insult is central to zzso formation and the development of vascular zzso zzso zzso are relatively recently discovered negative regulators of gene expression and act at the zzso zzso zzso have the potential to control zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the recent findings on how zzso influence zzso biology and acute vascular zzso 

zzso play an important role in the gene regulation by growth factors and downstream zzso factors involved in zzso zzso control and zzso Recent studies have revealed zzso that are involved in zzso regulation and further identified several target genes which are implicated in zzso zzso highlighting new disease zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso has also been demonstrated, revealing a novel mechanism through which vascular cells communicate in health and zzso 

zzso appear to play a major role in the capability of zzso to zzso switch from a zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso zzso expression levels can prevent and even reverse the acquisition of zzso synthetic zzso in zzso and reduce zzso formation, thereby implicating zzso as exciting future therapeutic targets for vascular zzso zzso
