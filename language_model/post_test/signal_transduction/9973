zzso are known to display significant zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso migration and zzso and thus zzso We analyzed the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso migration, and downstream signaling zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 h zzso inhibited zzso proliferation and migration up to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively (both P zzso zzso These effects were prevented by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso nor did it impair the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and consecutive binding of the zzso signaling molecules zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus zzso inhibited zzso cellular responses at the zzso zzso Although stimulation of zzso with zzso led to a transient increase of zzso activity, zzso with zzso for 24 h zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso lethal toxin or zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso migration, indicating that zzso activity is essential for zzso cellular zzso zzso did not further reduce zzso migration in zzso cells, suggesting that it diminishes zzso migration by altering zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso cellular functions of zzso downstream of the zzso via zzso of zzso These observations offer a molecular explanation for the zzso effects of zzso
