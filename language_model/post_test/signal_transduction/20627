Recent work provides evidence of a failure of acute inflammation in Crohn's disease zzso and suggests that the primary zzso operates at the level of the zzso and zzso zzso Here we extend the characterization of the innate immune zzso in CD by investigating the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and assess potential links between zzso association study zzso zzso zzso disease zzso and therapeutic regimens on tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were cultured from control subjects and patients with CD, zzso with zzso zzso and the release of zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso from blood and zzso for 34 single zzso zzso zzso identified as being associated with CD by zzso 

All stimuli resulted in a reduction zzso in zzso release from zzso derived from CD patients zzso zzso zzso compared to those from healthy control zzso zzso All zzso demonstrated impaired zzso release, with the greatest zzso in patients with zzso zzso There was no zzso relationship between the level of zzso released and the presence of zzso zzso zzso in CD zzso zzso zzso levels were not influenced by age, zzso or use of zzso zzso zzso 

This study supports the hypothesis of defective zzso zzso zzso and an innate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is evident downstream of multiple zzso affects all disease zzso and is unrelated to 34 zzso associated with CD by zzso
