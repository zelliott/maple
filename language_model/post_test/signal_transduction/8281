The dogma that the adult central nervous system zzso is zzso to zzso zzso is beginning to fall in the face of increased understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of zzso zzso It is now appreciated that zzso growth is regulated by a combination of zzso factors related to the milieu of the developing or adult zzso and the presence of injury, and zzso factors related to the zzso zzso of the developing or zzso zzso Several critical points of convergence within the developing or zzso zzso for zzso zzso cell signaling effects on the growth cone zzso have been identified, and their zzso has produced marked increases in zzso outgrowth within the zzso milieu of the adult injured zzso One such critical convergence point is the small zzso zzso which zzso signaling events produced by both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulates the activity of downstream zzso that zzso zzso dynamics within the growth cone zzso zzso outgrowth or zzso zzso of zzso has been associated with increased outgrowth on zzso zzso in zzso and increased zzso zzso in zzso We are developing zzso zzso that zzso zzso activity, allowing more long-term expression than is possible with current zzso These zzso may be useful in zzso strategies for spinal zzso injury, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and zzso zzso
