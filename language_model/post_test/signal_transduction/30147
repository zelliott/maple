The nocturnal zzso of zzso in the rat zzso depends on strongly enhanced expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso during darkness by zzso zzso to the zzso from the zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso following stimulation of zzso zzso involves zzso stimulation of protein zzso A zzso The nocturnal rise in zzso depends on the lighting zzso As compared with zzso zzso zzso the delay between dark onset and the nocturnal rise in zzso is shortened under long zzso and prolonged under short zzso Here, we report that the zzso of nocturnal zzso induction depends on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produces a strong zzso response in zzso obtained from rats housed under long zzso and a weak zzso response under short zzso Changes in zzso zzso are fully developed not earlier than after seven zzso This observation suggests that long-term changes in the zzso are necessary to achieve full adjustment of zzso zzso of the zzso A direct relationship was found between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso As compared to zzso zzso zzso activity was increased under zzso zzso and attenuated under zzso zzso On the basis of the present findings, we suggest that the zzso determines the effectiveness of nocturnal zzso induction by long-term zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso signal to the zzso zzso
