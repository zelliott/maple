zzso zzso remains an zzso therapeutic zzso zzso growth factor zzso is directly linked to vessel formation and zzso This study was undertaken to zzso the mechanisms by which zzso exerts its effects on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was induced in zzso mice by removal of the zzso zzso When mature vessels appeared after 7 days, mice were treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor AG zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using an zzso implanted zzso zzso At day 14 after scraping, zzso of treated and zzso zzso mice were dissected and zzso with zzso zzso for zzso cells and with zzso zzso muscle zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso and zzso zzso levels of treated and zzso zzso were determined by real-time zzso 

Mice treated with the zzso inhibitor AG zzso showed an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and a reduction of zzso of zzso in the newly formed vessels compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was reduced in the zzso of AG zzso mice compared with the respective zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso had similar effects, inducing a decrease in zzso zzso and a reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso signal zzso results in loss of zzso and a reduction in vessel density in the zzso cornea that zzso with reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso zzso or zzso had similar zzso Because zzso is a known stimulus for zzso zzso it can be zzso that the observed decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels on administration of the zzso inhibitor is caused by the decreased zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
