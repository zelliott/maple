zzso immune responses are zzso by the zzso of various signaling zzso Here, we describe our current knowledge on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso immune zzso First, we briefly introduce the main zzso involved in the zzso and cellular responses, such as zzso peptides and zzso Second, we describe the zzso zzso pathway, as established from extensive studies in zzso systems, and we introduce the zzso components of the zzso pathway, as discovered from studies on embryonic zzso Third, we describe the various roles of zzso signaling in both zzso and cellular zzso We present the zzso zzso factors, such as the zzso proteins and the zzso zzso produced by the fat body in response to septic zzso We also discuss the possible involvement of the zzso zzso in cellular responses, including zzso proliferation and zzso Finally, we present how zzso such as zzso might contribute to the integration of the immune responses at the zzso level by orchestrating the response of various immune cells and zzso such as fat body, zzso and zzso zzso
