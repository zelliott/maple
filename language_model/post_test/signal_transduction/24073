In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, the zzso genes are zzso whereas in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell types their zzso is zzso It is shown in this report that zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, is required for the repression of zzso zzso It has previously been reported that disruption of the zzso gene zzso in zzso cells, to an zzso cell zzso resembling the polarized mating projection of cells responding to zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of both mating types was examined and found to be zzso active in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and express significant levels of other zzso zzso The results indicate that the inappropriate zzso production in a zzso context, due to the zzso of the zzso zzso produces an zzso zzso loop that leads to the zzso zzso displayed by zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso complex contributes to maintain the repressive zzso structure described for the zzso operator present in the promoters of zzso zzso
