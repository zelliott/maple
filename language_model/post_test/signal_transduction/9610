The zzso zzso provides an zzso environment for zzso zzso Within the mouse zzso zzso signals are indispensable for imposing the zzso fate on zzso zzso zzso but the downstream zzso that impart zzso zzso and commitment are not well zzso Here we show that a zzso factor, zzso factor 1 zzso also known as zzso factor 7, zzso specific, zzso is a critical regulator in zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in the earliest zzso zzso and its expression is zzso by zzso zzso Most importantly, when zzso is forcibly expressed in bone zzso zzso zzso it drives the development of zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of these zzso cells revealed expression of many zzso zzso including zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso and components of the zzso zzso Our data suggest a model where zzso signals induce zzso and zzso in turn imprints the zzso fate by zzso expression of zzso essential zzso
