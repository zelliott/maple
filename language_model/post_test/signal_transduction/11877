A zzso repeat expansion in the zzso 9 open reading frame 72 gene zzso was recently identified as the most common genetic cause of zzso zzso lateral zzso Here we describe the clinical, zzso and genetic features of a Finnish zzso expansion carrier, who developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso a rare zzso syndrome of zzso zzso cells associated with zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the patient showed typical zzso response zzso protein with Mr 43 zzso zzso pathology mainly in the zzso and the zzso zzso and numerous zzso inclusions in the zzso zzso zzso His sister carried the same gene zzso and showed a similar type of zzso pathology in her zzso Our findings confirm that the clinical and zzso picture of zzso zzso carriers is more zzso than originally thought and warrants further studies on the possible involvement of zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso in the specific zzso zzso cell pathology associated with zzso zzso
