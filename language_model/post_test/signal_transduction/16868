At least one of three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso can interact with 10 G zzso receptors zzso nine Family B zzso and a Family C zzso All three zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and the zzso zzso which are all Family B zzso Three zzso enable zzso to function as three zzso receptors for zzso which is a feeding suppression zzso These zzso also transport the zzso to the cell surface, where they function as a CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso and AM are potent zzso peptides that exert powerful protective effects against zzso zzso We recently reported that the third zzso loop zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso but not zzso signaling in the three zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that in the presence of zzso the eighth zzso zzso 8) in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso tail of the zzso which is thought to be present in all family B zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso enhances the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In this review, we describe these studies and consider their implications for other Family B zzso that can interact with zzso
