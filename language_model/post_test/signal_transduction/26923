zzso guidance is a key process during nervous system development and zzso One of the best established zzso to study the mechanisms underlying this process is the zzso decision of whether or not to cross the zzso in the zzso zzso An essential regulator of that decision is the well zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso guidance cues act through zzso receptors to repel zzso from the zzso Despite good progress in our knowledge about these zzso the zzso mechanisms associated with zzso function remain poorly zzso In this work, we found that the scaffolding protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso is expressed along zzso zzso pioneer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cross the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso show a significant reduction of zzso localized in growth cone zzso and zzso forms a complex with zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso lack of zzso due to zzso surface presentation of zzso in all zzso is suppressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic interactions between zzso zzso zzso and genes zzso other components of the zzso pathway, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso further confirm that zzso functionally interacts with the zzso zzso Our data argue that zzso is a novel regulator of the zzso signaling pathway, crucial for regulating the zzso zzso of zzso and for zzso its signaling to the zzso zzso during zzso guidance at the zzso
