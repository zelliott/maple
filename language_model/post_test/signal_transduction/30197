The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 is an important factor in AIDS zzso In addition to zzso zzso and major zzso complex class I molecules from the cell surface, as well as increasing zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cascade to facilitate virus zzso Signaling pathways that are induced by zzso have been zzso however, it is unclear how and in which zzso compartment zzso triggers zzso zzso recruits a zzso complex to activate the cellular zzso zzso that mediates downstream zzso zzso Since a zzso of zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso zzso from where zzso zzso signaling is zzso we tested whether zzso zzso are instrumental for zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, zzso zzso activity exclusively zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso coincided with zzso raft recruitment of the zzso which was otherwise excluded from zzso zzso Experimental zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the association of zzso activity with zzso To analyze the importance of the raft zzso for zzso function more zzso we generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly enriched in zzso zzso and associated with significantly higher levels of zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso zzso and zzso also occurred in zzso zzso and required raft zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso zzso signal zzso via the recruitment of a signaling machinery including zzso into zzso zzso thereby mimicking a zzso cellular mechanism to initiate the zzso zzso
