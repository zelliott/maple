zzso acid zzso is a plant hormone involved in many zzso and zzso zzso but as yet, no zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso of rice zzso and zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso have been used to demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso of cell surface zzso Using surface zzso resonance technology specific binding of zzso to zzso was zzso Such interaction was antagonized significantly by zzso but not by the biologically inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso These in zzso interactions were correlated with the biological activities of zzso zzso and zzso acid on zzso of the zzso zzso promoter using two different transient reporter gene zzso zzso and quantitative flow zzso of zzso green fluorescent zzso zzso with zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso gene zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso interacts with a functional PM complex involved in zzso zzso
