The human zzso gene zzso zzso channel, and its zzso are present in heart, zzso zzso some cancer cells, and the zzso rat zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 111, zzso Despite its importance, there are few studies of zzso zzso In this first report of regulation by zzso zzso we show that zzso cells express transcripts for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso was identified using an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso detected by zzso was reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso A, or zzso (but not zzso The whole cell zzso current was reduced by zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by a scrambled zzso zzso the current was increased by the zzso zzso zzso but not by an inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso active zzso altered the zzso dependence and zzso zzso to produce more current at negative zzso zzso identified an association between the channel protein and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso zzso appear to exist in a signaling complex that is well positioned to zzso this zzso channel and affect its contribution to cellular zzso
