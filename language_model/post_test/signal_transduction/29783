zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is required for normal zzso in zzso zzso zzso deprived of zzso signaling develop with a range of zzso defects including zzso zzso shortened zzso zzso and reduced anterior zzso These defects arise because the zzso zzso fails to move zzso In this study, we determine that zzso of zzso signaling causes prospective head zzso cells to appear in the zzso cavity at the onset of zzso stage zzso These zzso cells undergo zzso via the zzso 3 zzso at an embryonic checkpoint called the early zzso transition zzso They are zzso and have increased levels of zzso 3 activity compared to control zzso zzso death of these zzso cells can be prevented by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or by injection of either a general zzso inhibitor or a zzso zzso zzso Prevention of cell death, however, is not sufficient to rescue zzso defects in these zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso signaling is necessary for survival of prospective head zzso cells, and also plays an essential role in the control of their cell movement during zzso
