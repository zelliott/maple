Ethanol zzso similar behavioral responses in zzso and the fruit fly, zzso zzso By zzso zzso for zzso behavior to the genetic tools available in flies, a number of genes have been identified that influence zzso responses to zzso To enhance the utility of the zzso model for investigating genes involved in zzso behavior, we explored the value of an zzso that measures the sedative effects of ethanol on negative zzso an evoked locomotor zzso 

We established zzso zzso Rapid zzso zzso zzso as an zzso for zzso the sedative effects of ethanol on negative zzso zzso zzso zzso We validated the zzso by assessing acute sensitivity to ethanol and rapid ethanol tolerance in several different control strains and in flies with zzso known to disrupt these zzso We also used zzso in a candidate screen to identify zzso with altered zzso zzso 

zzso zzso measured in zzso zzso was zzso impaired by ethanol zzso zzso developed tolerance to the intoxicating effects of ethanol when tested during a second zzso Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance varied across 4 control zzso but internal ethanol zzso were indistinguishable in the 4 strains during a first and second challenge with zzso Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol zzso respectively, were altered in flies with zzso in amnesiac and zzso genes known to influence these zzso Additionally, zzso in the beta zzso gene zzso and the alpha zzso gene zzso increased the initial sensitivity to ethanol and enhanced the development of rapid ethanol tolerance without altering internal ethanol zzso 

The zzso zzso is suitable for investigating genetic mechanisms that influence ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol zzso Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance depend on the function of alpha and beta zzso in zzso
