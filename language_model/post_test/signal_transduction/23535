To study the zzso activity of zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso in the zzso of rats with zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso 

zzso rats were zzso into normal control group zzso and zzso zzso model group zzso for feeding with normal and zzso zzso respectively, for 20, 30 and 40 zzso The cardiac function of the rats was evaluated by carotid artery zzso and the damage of cardiac zzso was observed under electron zzso The cardiac zzso were extracted for assessing zzso zzso and zzso C zzso activities, and the protein expressions of zzso and total zzso were zzso 

Compared with the corresponding control groups, the rats in the model group showed significantly decreased cardiac function with obvious structural and functional damage of the cardiac zzso zzso which aggravated as the zzso feeding time extended zzso The rats in the model group also showed significantly decreased zzso zzso activity zzso in the zzso as the zzso feeding time prolonged zzso zzso linear correlation analysis showed that the activity of cardiac zzso zzso had positive correlations with the left zzso zzso pressure, zzso increased rate of the left zzso pressure, and the activities of zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso in rat heart to contribute to cardiac zzso injury and the progression of heart zzso
