The nuclear factors of activated T cells zzso constitute a family of zzso factors that zzso calcium signals in the zzso zzso muscular and nervous zzso Like their distant relatives of the zzso family, including zzso zzso are zzso in resting cells and activated by means of induced nuclear zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso show highly dynamic nuclear shuttling properties that have important implications for graded signaling by these zzso This review focuses on recent advances in deciphering mechanisms by which calcium signaling regulates the zzso zzso therefore zzso functions of the zzso These discoveries highlight the interplay between nuclear import and export signals on zzso and the roles of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in controlling the activity of these zzso They also reveal that zzso as well as other zzso factors controlled at the level of nuclear import, face the very real prospect of futile cycling across the nuclear envelope as a consequence of conflicting nuclear import and export zzso We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which zzso suppresses futile zzso as well as the major challenges to our understanding of zzso signaling in diverse biological zzso
