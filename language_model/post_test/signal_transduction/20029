zzso zzso zzso is a common early event in zzso zzso and is affected by calcium and vitamin D in basic science zzso To assess the effects of calcium and vitamin D on zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso expression in the normal appearing zzso zzso of sporadic zzso zzso patients, we conducted a randomized, zzso zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso cases were treated with 2 zzso zzso calcium and/or 800 zzso vitamin zzso versus zzso over 6 months (N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso in colon zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by standardized automated zzso and zzso by image zzso In the vitamin zzso group relative to zzso the proportion of zzso in the upper zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso score increased zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso group, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased 51% zzso zzso zzso and the zzso score increased zzso zzso zzso zzso These results support zzso that calcium and vitamin D modify zzso zzso and zzso expression in humans in directions hypothesized to reduce risk for zzso zzso zzso calcium and vitamin D as potential zzso agents against zzso zzso and zzso the potential of zzso zzso and zzso expression as zzso zzso risk zzso for zzso zzso
