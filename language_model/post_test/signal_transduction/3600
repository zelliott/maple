zzso cells play an important role in tumor zzso and largely contribute to the therapeutic success of zzso zzso like zzso Here, we studied the role of the zzso family member zzso zzso zzso during the interaction of zzso cells with chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed on patient zzso cells in all 56 investigated zzso Signaling via zzso following interaction with zzso which was detected on zzso cells of zzso patients but not healthy individuals, led to the release of zzso zzso including zzso by zzso zzso zzso patient zzso contained elevated levels of zzso and induced zzso zzso on zzso cells, which in turn impaired direct and zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was not only enhanced by blocking the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed by zzso cells, but also by preventing zzso zzso on zzso cells via zzso of zzso in patient serum with zzso Our data indicate that zzso mediates zzso zzso in zzso and thus might contribute to the reportedly compromised efficacy of zzso to induce zzso zzso in the disease, and that zzso zzso may serve to enhance the efficacy of zzso treatment in zzso
