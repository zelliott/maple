zzso regulates the zzso capacity, size, and structural integrity of the adrenal zzso through a series of actions involving changes in gene zzso however, only a limited number of zzso genes have been identified, and these only partly account for the global effects of zzso on the adrenal zzso In this study, a National Institute on Aging zzso mouse zzso zzso was used to identify zzso changes in gene expression after treatment of zzso mouse zzso cells with zzso zzso affected the levels of zzso zzso zzso of which zzso were zzso The zzso transcripts were enriched for functions associated with steroid zzso and zzso the zzso regulated transcripts were enriched for functions associated with cell zzso nuclear transport and zzso processing, including alternative zzso A total of 133 different zzso zzso only zzso of the zzso zzso were represented in the categories zzso most of these had not been described as zzso zzso The contributions of protein zzso A and protein zzso C to these zzso effects of zzso were evaluated in zzso experiments after treatment of zzso cells and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with pharmacological zzso of each zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling accounted for zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling accounted for an additional zzso These results indicate that zzso affects the expression profile of zzso adrenal cells principally through zzso and protein zzso A- dependent zzso The large number of transcripts affected by zzso anticipates a broader range of actions than previously zzso
