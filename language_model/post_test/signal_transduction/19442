zzso immune recognition of zzso is shared by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso recruitment zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activates inflammatory genes through zzso pathway, whereas zzso and zzso assemble zzso complexes called zzso culminating in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although both zzso and zzso pathways cooperate to clear infections, little is known about the relative zzso zzso mechanisms operating through each of zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso was able to activate zzso an zzso previously associated with zzso zzso Using zzso or zzso zzso we found that both receptors are involved in zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is completely zzso in the absence of zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso do not seem to be important for zzso zzso zzso Together, our data defined an additional zzso zzso mechanism operated through zzso and zzso zzso and illustrated a novel signaling zzso zzso that activates zzso
