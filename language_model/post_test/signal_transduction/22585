In this study we have investigated the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso exits the nucleus upon zzso zzso zzso and recognizes the zzso zzso as a cellular zzso We report that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but does not alter the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso can regulate selectively zzso protein zzso signaling pathways emanating from the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the protein zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 2, function downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that zzso and the zzso zzso which is capable of forming stable complexes with zzso zzso inhibit almost completely the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso act upstream of zzso zzso most likely by zzso the recruitment of the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Recent studies have indicated that the zzso zzso can be activated in the absence of zzso following zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells is zzso by the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso of zzso following the attachment of zzso cells to zzso Thus, zzso may serve as a negative regulator of growth factor or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
