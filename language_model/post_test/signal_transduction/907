zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a member of the focal zzso zzso family, is thought to act as a key component in zzso and zzso zzso we studied the effect of zzso zzso expression on the migration and proliferation in zzso cells zzso Two types of zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso inactive zzso and zzso expressing a zzso zzso site zzso in addition to zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso infected with zzso increased to a level similar to that of zzso infected with zzso The size of effect was dependent on the amount of applied zzso within the range of zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso infection did not show any significant effect on cell zzso Western zzso showed that both zzso of zzso zzso and association of zzso with zzso were enhanced in zzso infected with zzso as well as with zzso but not in zzso infected with zzso zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in the migration of zzso infected either with zzso or with zzso In proliferation zzso zzso infection suppressed zzso proliferation zzso however, neither zzso nor zzso showed such an zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso revealed that zzso signaling zzso regulates cell migration and proliferation zzso
