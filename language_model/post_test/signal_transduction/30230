zzso cells are able to discriminate between native and non-native zzso selectively transporting the former to their final zzso zzso proteins are scrutinized at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent findings reveal novel features of the underlying molecular mechanisms, with several zzso networks cooperating in assisting the maturation of complex proteins and being selectively induced to match changing synthetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso some of which enriched in specializes zzso operate for most or selected zzso zzso Moreover, sequential checkpoints are distributed along the early zzso pathway, allowing efficiency and zzso in protein zzso
