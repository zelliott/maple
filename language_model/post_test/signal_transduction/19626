zzso age-related depletion of the zzso testosterone is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease zzso in zzso Previously, we reported that experimental zzso depletion significantly zzso development of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mouse model of zzso an effect prevented by zzso zzso Because testosterone is zzso in brain into both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso testosterone can mediate its effects through zzso and or zzso zzso To define the role of zzso and zzso pathways in regulation of zzso zzso we compared the effects of testosterone zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso in male zzso mice depleted of zzso sex steroid hormones by zzso zzso Male zzso mice were sham zzso or zzso immediately treated with vehicle, zzso zzso or zzso and 4 months later evaluated for two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In comparison to sham zzso mice, we observed a significant increase in zzso zzso in zzso mice in zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso mice with T prevented the increased zzso zzso in all three brain zzso zzso treatment yielded similar results, significantly reducing zzso zzso across brain zzso Interestingly, zzso prevented zzso zzso in zzso but exerted only partial effects in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in sham zzso male zzso mice were modest and only slightly increased by zzso Treatment of zzso mice with T or zzso but not zzso reduced zzso zzso to levels lower than observed in sham zzso These data suggest that testosterone regulates zzso pathology through zzso and zzso pathways and reduces zzso pathology largely through zzso zzso These findings further define hormone pathways involved in regulation of zzso pathology, information that is important for understanding disease zzso and developing zzso hormone zzso
