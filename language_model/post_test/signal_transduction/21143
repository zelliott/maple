The zzso zzso boundary functions as an organizer in the growth and patterning of the zzso wing disc and gives rise to the wing margin in the adult zzso Here we show that zzso notch zzso is a downstream component of the zzso signaling zzso and is important for the zzso of this zzso zzso encodes a novel nuclear protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in wing margin genes interact zzso with zzso and loss of zzso function results in loss of expression of zzso zzso cut, and zzso at the zzso zzso In regulating these zzso zzso functions in close cooperation with zzso of zzso and zzso Finally, zzso has no role in lateral zzso suggesting that it may contribute to the specificity between lateral and zzso zzso signaling zzso
