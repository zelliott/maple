zzso zzso in zzso zzso is an early stage zzso breast cancer that originates in the zzso lining of the milk zzso but it can evolve into zzso zzso and ultimately, into the most common type of breast cancer, invasive zzso zzso zzso the progression and how to effectively intervene in it presents a major scientific zzso The zzso zzso zzso surrounding a duct contains several types of cells and several types of growth factors that are known to individually affect tumor growth, but at present the complex zzso and mechanical interactions of these zzso cells and growth factors with tumor cells is poorly zzso Here we develop a mathematical model that incorporates the zzso between zzso and tumor cells, which can predict how zzso of the local zzso and mechanical state influence tumor zzso We focus on the zzso and zzso signaling pathways and show how zzso or zzso of components in these pathways affects cell growth and zzso We then study a hybrid model for the interaction of cells with the tumor zzso zzso in which zzso cells zzso are modeled individually while the zzso is treated as a zzso and show how these interactions affect the early development of zzso Finally, we incorporate breakdown of the zzso into the model and predict the early stages of tumor invasion into the zzso Our results shed light on the interactions between growth factors, mechanical properties of the zzso and feedback signaling zzso between zzso and tumor cells, and suggest how zzso changes in transformed cells affect tumor zzso
