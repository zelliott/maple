zzso in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene family recently have been shown to zzso several zzso disorders of bone development, with specific zzso zzso causing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, for none of these zzso has the zzso in zzso function been demonstrated directly and, therefore, for none has the zzso mechanism of the disease been zzso Using our established techniques for zzso zzso real-time calcium image analysis, we defined the nature of the basic zzso growth factor zzso calcium signal in human zzso zzso and, in blinded studies, have analyzed the zzso signals from 18 independent zzso cell lines, including multiple lines from patients with known zzso zzso of zzso and syndromes of zzso or zzso Control cells responded with transient increases in zzso zzso with many cells showing zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso cell lines failed to zzso whereas zzso zzso lines responded nearly zzso We observed zzso signals in TD zzso the unresponsive lines all turned out to carry zzso zzso whereas all responsive lines had zzso zzso Since zzso 2 and 3 receptors are known to be expressed in zzso our results suggest that specific zzso zzso zzso can function in a zzso zzso fashion to zzso zzso zzso
