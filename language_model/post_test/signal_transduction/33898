It is well known that many of the actions of zzso zzso in the central nervous system are zzso via zzso zzso factors that interact with steroid response elements on target zzso However, there is compelling evidence for membrane steroid receptors for zzso in zzso and other brain zzso But it is not well understood how zzso signals via membrane zzso and how these signals impact not only membrane zzso but also gene zzso in zzso Indeed, it has been known for sometime that zzso can rapidly alter zzso activity within seconds, indicating that some cellular effects can occur via membrane zzso zzso In addition, zzso can affect second zzso systems including calcium zzso and a plethora of zzso to alter cell zzso zzso this review will consider our current knowledge of rapid zzso and zzso signaling by zzso in the zzso the nature of receptors involved and how they contribute to zzso zzso
