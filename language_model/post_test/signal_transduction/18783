zzso and zzso of different zzso pathways have been described in several systems however, the differential contributions of the different zzso have not been well zzso Here we report the zzso to the nucleus of zzso and zzso in response to two zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and disruption of calcium zzso As seen by treatment with zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso is not zzso by executor zzso but by zzso By reduction of zzso or zzso expression we unraveled that zzso primarily controls zzso caused by changes in calcium zzso while zzso has a main role in programmed cell death induced by protein zzso Nevertheless, the two zzso factors appear to reinforce each other during the zzso process, confirming that while the first response primarily involves one zzso zzso and zzso can influence each other in the zzso zzso
