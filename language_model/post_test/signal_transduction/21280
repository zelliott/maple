zzso of the zzso signaling cascade is essential for growth zzso cell proliferation and zzso In this report, we describe the zzso zzso and characterization of a novel zzso designated zzso that is zzso zzso and binds to zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso We find that zzso is zzso and that this modification is essential for membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso protein that targets signaling molecules to the plasma membrane in response to zzso stimulation to link zzso zzso with the zzso and other signaling pathways essential for cell growth and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso is closely related and probably zzso to zzso the zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso
