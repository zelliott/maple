The zzso zzso for zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and thereby serves as a paradigm for zzso cell zzso gene zzso The expression of zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso We established an experimental model to analyze the individual functions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the natural zzso promoter in zzso cells lacking both zzso zzso was required for both the zzso activity and for the zzso zzso promoter zzso while zzso alone could not initiate zzso In contrast, in the context of a zzso promoter, zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso promoter elements revealed that zzso of the promoter required the DNA zzso and the zzso functions of both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso bound the promoter elements zzso and no physical interaction between the proteins was zzso The requirement of zzso for zzso promoter activity was supported by demonstration of in zzso interaction between zzso and components of the zzso zzso machinery zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso greatly diminished both the zzso promoter activity as well as the interaction with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not interact with zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results define functional zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso promoter zzso where zzso serves as an amplifier and bridging factor with the zzso zzso zzso
