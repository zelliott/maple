We used an zzso zzso for cells cultured under high dynamic strain to measure human zzso zzso cell adherence to immobilized type I zzso zzso and zzso These conditions were designed to model the increased forces present at unstable fractures or loose joint zzso At a constant, low zzso density zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain for 24 zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso supported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which paralleled the relative number of zzso sites in each zzso Thus, when the number of available binding sites was zzso strain resistance was zzso to the number of zzso zzso In contrast, at high zzso zzso zzso or zzso 2,500 zzso zzso supported greater adherence zzso zzso zzso when compared with type I collagen zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and directed zzso expression of zzso zzso which suggested that there exist discrete signals on zzso zzso occupancy that promoted cell adherence and survival under zzso zzso binding was necessary for resistance to strain, as evidenced by the low levels of strain resistance observed when cells were adherent in a zzso zzso These findings support the zzso of at least two distinct mechanisms zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso by zzso cells to remain adherent and viable on exposure to mechanical zzso
