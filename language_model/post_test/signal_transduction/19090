zzso growth zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in the progression of zzso zzso zzso evidence has suggested that zzso derived from zzso zzso participate in a number of pathological processes in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso play a major role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso express receptors for zzso and zzso expression can be induced in zzso However, to date, there are no published data on the possible role of zzso in zzso expression in human zzso cells zzso We designed studies to determine zzso whether zzso stimulates zzso expression in primary zzso zzso whether zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso whether zzso zzso synthesis is affected by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies were performed in primary cultures of zzso and in an immortalized line of zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso induction is accompanied by increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blunted zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso expression in zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results can help to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso and open up specific strategies for the treatment of zzso zzso
