The zzso zzso performs pivotal roles in diverse zzso processes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is kept inactive in the zzso through association with zzso zzso and zzso to the nucleus to activate its target genes after the zzso are zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that loss of function of zzso zzso domain interacting protein zzso leads to zzso of zzso signaling in skin, resulting in the development of an idiopathic zzso syndrome zzso with zzso zzso in zzso mice, and zzso expansion of zzso B cells and zzso T zzso zzso profiling in skin revealed zzso zzso of classical zzso zzso predominantly by zzso members of zzso zzso zzso zzso for both the zzso zzso accessory protein zzso and zzso zzso resulted in mice having decreased skin disease zzso zzso of zzso degradation by the zzso inhibitor zzso alleviated the zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that absence of zzso causes zzso with zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso may be an effective treatment for skin problems of zzso
