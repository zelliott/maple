We investigated cellular signaling and zzso zzso in the human gastric zzso cell line zzso which was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso toxin increased the levels of zzso zzso zzso free calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 31 zzso and 22 zzso proteins in the host zzso Moreover, zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso with increasing zzso of zzso We conclude that besides the zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso release are important factors involved in the zzso of chronic active zzso and zzso zzso zzso
