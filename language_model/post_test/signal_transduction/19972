Over the past decade, the zzso signaling cascade has been linked to organ size regulation in zzso Indeed, zzso of the zzso zzso can have potent effects on cellular proliferation and/or zzso and a deregulation of the zzso often leads to tumor zzso zzso emerging evidence indicates that the zzso zzso can zzso its effects on tissue size by the regulation of stem and zzso cell zzso This role has recently been associated with the central position of the zzso in sensing zzso or mechanical cues, and translating them into specific cellular zzso These results provide an attractive model for how the zzso cascade might sense and zzso cellular zzso cues into zzso of zzso stem or zzso zzso A further understanding of this process could allow the development of new therapies for various degenerative diseases and zzso Here, we review current and emerging data linking zzso signaling to zzso cell zzso
