zzso flow zzso or zzso flow, measures the zzso state of zzso proteins at the single cell zzso Many zzso events can be analyzed simultaneously in each cell, along with cell surface zzso enabling complex zzso signaling networks to be resolved in zzso cell zzso The method has been applied to many diverse areas of biology, including the characterization of signaling pathways in normal immune responses to zzso stimulation and microbial challenge, zzso of signaling networks that occur in cancer and zzso diseases, and zzso zzso drug zzso In this chapter, we provide detailed experimental protocols for performing zzso flow in cell lines, zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, and whole zzso These protocols are zzso to both human and zzso zzso We also provide methods for the validation of surface marker zzso for use in zzso zzso Finally, we discuss data analysis methods, in particular, how to zzso changes in zzso and how to zzso the large data sets that can result from experiments in primary zzso
