The zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso proteins are established regulators of zzso development and cell zzso By combining traditional genetic and zzso zzso with a statistical analysis of global gene expression profiles, we discerned a genetic interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso (named for its role in the suppression of the zzso zzso and zzso (the protein zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso We found that during development and zzso both zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso In other organisms, the protein zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso functions in a complex with the regulatory zzso zzso and zzso to control recovery from DNA zzso Here, we show that zzso active zzso is also required for development, zzso and the expression of numerous zzso The product of zzso zzso functions as the zzso zzso zzso and positively regulates a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the expression of genes specifically involved in cell stress responses and cell zzso We also demonstrate that zzso does not control the absolute level of zzso activity and suggest that zzso regulates zzso by controlling its zzso to the zzso These data define a novel genetic zzso in which zzso functions upstream of zzso to control zzso development and zzso
