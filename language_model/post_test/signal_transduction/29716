Renal cell zzso zzso rarely acquires zzso in zzso tumor zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling in this tumor type might be zzso by some other zzso In fact, all four zzso cell lines we tested maintained zzso zzso but were not capable of zzso zzso reporters and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso showed normal response to zzso stress, including zzso nuclear zzso and zzso of specific DNA zzso zzso and expression analysis of zzso zzso and zzso showed lack of involvement of these zzso regulators in the observed zzso of zzso function in zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso could be achieved by extremely high levels of zzso attained by zzso zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of a dominant inhibitor in repression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso prevailed in the hybrids of zzso cells with the cells possessing fully functional zzso zzso cells of normal kidney zzso also caused partial zzso repression in cell fusion experiments, suggesting that zzso zzso repression may be based on an unknown dominant mechanism also acting in normal kidney zzso
