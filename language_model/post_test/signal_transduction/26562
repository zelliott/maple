zzso a zzso zzso promotes cell growth, zzso and zzso Human zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso by reducing zzso to zzso zzso The zzso are activated by similar zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Maines, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 287, zzso zzso we examined interactions between the two proteins in the context of regulation of their activities and defining targets of zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis of zzso intact zzso identified zzso zzso positions 21, 33, zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso domain motif zzso and zzso zzso the zzso motif zzso and in zzso sequence zzso as targets of zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was a high affinity zzso for zzso in zzso and in zzso the relative affinity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two overlapping peptides spanning this zzso zzso and zzso were effective zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso factors zzso and zzso Only zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, caused membrane zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and accelerated the rate of zzso zzso This study, together with previous findings, reveals an unexpected regulatory interplay between zzso and zzso in modulating cell zzso in response to various zzso zzso In addition, this study has identified novel zzso for and zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso technology may have utility to zzso zzso functions in the zzso
