Regional differentiation along the zzso zzso axis of the zzso zzso primarily depends on a graded zzso signaling activity generated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified zzso zzso and zzso target genes zzso 2 and 3 zzso 2, 3) that have a zzso zzso domain related to the zzso zzso zzso and act zzso to induce zzso zzso Doc genes are expressed in the zzso region in the early zzso After zzso newly expressed Doc appears in a zzso pattern in the zzso This expression zzso zzso with the second phase of zzso expression in the zzso Doc expression in the early zzso is abolished in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso segmented expression depends only on zzso zzso of Doc genes with zzso dramatically affected the development of zzso and wing disc zzso both of which depend on high levels of zzso zzso although leg disc zzso which depends on low levels of zzso remained zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso induced zzso zzso suppressed zzso events and induced zzso zzso which are analogous to the effects of native zzso and its upstream regulator, zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso act in the zzso signaling zzso required for embryonic patterning in both zzso
