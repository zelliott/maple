Animals measure zzso zzso and adapt to seasonal changes in the environment by altering their physiology and behavior zzso Although this zzso response has long been of interest, the underlying mechanism has only recently begun to be uncovered at the molecular zzso Japanese quail provide an excellent model to study the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso zzso zzso The recent sequencing of the chicken zzso allowed a zzso analysis of zzso time measurement in zzso and this approach uncovered the key event in the zzso signaling cascade that regulates seasonal zzso Long zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was found to trigger local zzso hormone zzso in the zzso zzso which increases the activity of the zzso neuroendocrine system resulting in zzso zzso Since zzso was only known to stimulate the zzso zzso a traditional zzso approach would not have been expected to predict this zzso Thus, a functional zzso approach, which is a zzso approach, provides new insights in the field of zzso
