Host 1 was designed and zzso as a fluorescent sensor for zzso zzso zzso The design features a zzso zzso core to zzso binding zzso The three zzso zzso a zzso zzso complex and two ammonium groups, were included to complement the three zzso zzso on the zzso Beyond acting as a binding site, the zzso complex was used to signal binding of the guest through modification of the charge transfer zzso A zzso complex with zzso was determined in 50 % zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by monitoring the reduction of the zzso signal upon guest zzso In the zzso of related zzso zzso lacking a second zzso zzso into host 1, zzso host to guest binding was zzso Similarly, control compound 2, which lacks the ammonium groups, binds zzso and 4-6 in a zzso zzso Also, zzso 7 binds to host 1 in a zzso zzso with a zzso over three times less than zzso
