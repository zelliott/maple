zzso are functionally regulated by zzso zzso in that zzso signaling pathways act on the zzso zzso tail to regulate the activity of the zzso on the zzso Both a change in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the receptors occurs, but the mechanisms that regulate inside out signaling are not completely zzso Previously, we identified zzso in a zzso screen to identify proteins involved in zzso control of zzso using the zzso leukemia cell line zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso was involved in affinity regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso Here, we examined how zzso regulates zzso zzso affinity in the leukemia cell line zzso We show that zzso is mainly expressed at the cell membrane and is present near zzso zzso The role for zzso zzso in zzso affinity regulation was examined using the zzso modulating agent zzso which decreased zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso in zzso cells also decreased zzso zzso affinity and cell zzso to zzso These data suggest that increased zzso zzso through zzso regulates zzso zzso affinity and cell zzso
