The mechanism of zzso differentiation of zzso zzso was investigated by in zzso zzso degradation of cell surface zzso the direct measurement of products formed from the zzso of zzso C, and the use of an array of signal zzso zzso The data indicate that a zzso protein is required for zzso to signal the cells to differentiate and that the cells are committed to the differentiation zzso within two hours after exposure to zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso lipids from control and zzso populations in the presence of 10 zzso zzso were consistent with a rapid zzso of zzso zzso Within five zzso following addition of zzso this resulted in an increase in zzso and a zzso decrease in the relative amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
