The aim of the present study was to analyze whether zzso II via the zzso system can induce gastric zzso protection, since zzso of zzso zzso receptors by zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso Experimental zzso was induced by zzso ethanol given orally in male zzso rats, zzso wild type and zzso knockout zzso The compounds were administered zzso It was found, that zzso zzso II inhibited the zzso gastric zzso zzso the effect of zzso II zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso inverse zzso AM 251 zzso and the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II exerted zzso in wild type, but not in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso II zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso and bilateral cervical zzso In conclusion, stimulation of central zzso zzso receptors via zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso
