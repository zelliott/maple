In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso administration after zzso reduces lung injury through a mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso provides protection after injury via zzso of multiple signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso can be used to assess zzso signaling zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso underwent soft tissue trauma zzso zzso and zzso shock zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso for 90 minutes) followed by fluid zzso Animals were zzso with a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso a soluble zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 2, 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 30 minutes before zzso zzso zzso or vehicle zzso Animals were killed at 2 hours after zzso 

Lung injury induced by zzso is evidenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with an increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment after zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which paralleled a decrease in lung zzso zzso of zzso and zzso abolished the zzso increase in zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso exacerbated lung inflammation and zzso 

These results collectively suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso protects against zzso lung zzso
