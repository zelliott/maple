zzso zzso zzso is an attractive target for novel zzso zzso zzso We used magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso of zzso signaling zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso MR zzso of cell extracts were zzso In every case, zzso treatment was associated with a significant decrease in zzso levels by up to zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a significant increase in zzso levels by up to zzso was also observed zzso zzso zzso whereas the content of zzso when zzso did not change zzso zzso zzso levels did not change significantly in zzso and zzso cells but decreased by approximately zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The changes in zzso and zzso levels seen in cell extracts were also zzso in the zzso MR zzso of intact zzso cells following exposure to zzso When treated with another zzso zzso zzso zzso cells also showed a significant decrease in zzso content by approximately zzso relative to the control zzso zzso zzso whereas the levels of the remaining zzso did not change zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso in human breast cancer cells by zzso and zzso is associated with a decrease in zzso zzso
