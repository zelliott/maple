An essential phase of skeletal zzso is the fusion of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso Many cell zzso zzso including zzso have been shown to be important for zzso fusion in zzso but the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate cell fusion remain mostly zzso Here, we focused on the role of focal zzso zzso zzso an important zzso protein zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso as a potential zzso by which zzso may regulate zzso zzso To test this hypothesis in zzso we generated mice in which the zzso gene was disrupted specifically in muscle stem cells zzso zzso and we found that this resulted in impaired zzso formation during muscle zzso after zzso To examine the role of zzso in the fusion of zzso cells, we examined the expression of zzso and the effects of zzso deletion on the differentiation of zzso in zzso zzso of mouse primary zzso was accompanied by a rapid and transient increase of zzso zzso To investigate the requirement of zzso in zzso fusion, we used two zzso approaches (a zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in markedly impaired fusion but did not inhibit other zzso measures of zzso zzso suggesting a specific role of zzso in the zzso changes of cell fusion as part of the differentiation zzso To examine the mechanisms by which zzso may be regulating fusion, we used zzso analysis to identify the genes that failed to be normally regulated in cells that were fusion defective due to zzso zzso Several genes that have been implicated in zzso fusion were zzso regulated during differentiation when zzso was zzso zzso the normal increases in the transcript of zzso 3 as well as an zzso zzso the zzso zzso were suppressed by zzso zzso We confirmed this also at the protein level and show that direct zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso inhibited zzso formation with a prominent effect on secondary zzso These data suggest that zzso regulation of profusion zzso including zzso 3 and the zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso muscle zzso
