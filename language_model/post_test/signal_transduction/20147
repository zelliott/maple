To present an assortment of molecular targets evident from a variety of signal zzso pathways and downstream zzso which may have clinical relevance for the treatment of zzso 

Data were zzso from zzso using zzso queries on the zzso zzso zzso pathology, zzso zzso tumor regression, zzso therapy, clinical trial, therapeutic agent, drug, molecular zzso and zzso zzso Only the most zzso articles were selected for critical analyses based on the qualitative assessment of the citation index, novelty of the findings and relevance to prospective novel ways of targeted therapies for zzso 

zzso are highly aggressive zzso tumors of the zzso akin to primitive zzso tumors elsewhere in the zzso Current treatments for zzso which include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, remain challenging especially, for younger zzso however, advances in understanding regulatory pathways in zzso are crucial to develop more effective therapeutic zzso Evidence showing several molecular and pharmacological targets within key zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , their downstream zzso like zzso zzso and zzso and as well as other targets such as zzso and zzso zzso is zzso All molecular and pharmacological targets have pivotal roles in the zzso of zzso Most importantly, these pathways can be effectively zzso targeted to zzso the growth of zzso zzso studies were routinely undertaken with a variety of human and zzso cell lines and as well as zzso models of zzso Thus far, two drugs which target the zzso and zzso zzso have completed Phase I clinical trials, but with evidence of low zzso zzso reinforcing the importance of continuing investigations in search of new therapeutic agents and zzso 

Novel therapies, based on better understanding key biological pathways in zzso hold promise for improved treatments in due course among patients with zzso
