zzso help is crucial for memory zzso T cell development, yet the mechanisms of zzso help and why zzso helpless memory zzso T cells elicit poor recall responses are currently not well zzso In this study we investigated these questions using an in zzso acute virus infection zzso We show zzso that zzso help during zzso is required for memory zzso T cell zzso and that stimulation of zzso during zzso zzso the helpless defects in the absence of zzso T zzso The defective recall response by helpless memory cells did not correlate with the amount of cell death and was independent of zzso However, helpless memory cells excessively zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso blockade enhanced the recall response of helpless memory zzso Furthermore, providing zzso signaling in zzso during the recall response reduced zzso expression and rescued the recall response of helpless memory zzso Our study identifies molecular pathways involved in zzso help for memory zzso T cell generation that are independent of zzso and it provides therapeutic implications that helpless memory cell function can be restored at multiple stages through various zzso zzso
