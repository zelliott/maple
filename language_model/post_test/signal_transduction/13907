The precise wiring of the nervous system relies on processes by which zzso navigate in a complex environment and are guided by a concerted action of attractive and repulsive factors to reach their zzso zzso these guidance processes depends critically on our ability to control in space and time the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso techniques in cell biology now enables a precise control of the zzso physical and chemical environment of cultured zzso However, zzso is only beginning to be applied in the field of zzso guidance due to specific requirements of zzso zzso Here we review zzso specifically designed to study zzso guidance and compare them with the conventional zzso used to probe zzso sensing in cell zzso We also discuss how innovative zzso approaches will enable the investigation of important zzso questions on the zzso sensing properties of nerve cells, such as the sensitivity and zzso in the detection of directional signals or the zzso response to multiple zzso
