zzso spines are the sites of most zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso Recent studies have shown that spines function independently of each other, and they are currently the smallest known processing units in the zzso zzso exist in an array of zzso and spine structure helps dictate synaptic zzso zzso spines are rich in zzso and zzso zzso are critical regulators of spine zzso and zzso In this review, we discuss the importance of zzso in regulating zzso spine zzso and discuss the upstream signal zzso pathways that either foster or inhibit zzso zzso The understanding of zzso regulatory pathways is best zzso as a zzso network in which molecules function in discrete levels defined by their molecular distance to zzso To this end, we focus on several classes of zzso including zzso zzso exchange factors, small zzso small zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso We discuss how individual proteins in these molecular classes impact spine zzso and reveal the zzso interactions in these networks that are responsible for shaping zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the importance of these zzso regulatory pathways in zzso zzso
