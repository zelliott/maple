zzso zzso represent potential drug targets for zzso zzso zzso of different chemical classes have been identified that target human zzso a zzso responsible for the establishment of the bipolar zzso One potent zzso inhibitor is zzso zzso which arrests cells in zzso and exhibits tumor growth zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso action on the molecular level is zzso Here, cells treated with zzso were blocked in zzso through zzso of the zzso assembly checkpoint as shown by the zzso state of zzso and the zzso of zzso specific zzso on zzso zzso and aurora A zzso Using live cell imaging, we observed prolonged zzso arrest and subsequent cell death after incubation of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso occurred before zzso of zzso leading to the zzso of the activated executioner zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso through the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso analysis following zzso treatment revealed 33 zzso regulated proteins of various cellular zzso 31 of which can be linked to zzso cell zzso Interestingly, four identified zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso associated in zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso and zzso controlled tumor protein can be linked to zzso and zzso zzso
