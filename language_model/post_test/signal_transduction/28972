zzso zzso signaling is essential in embryonic development and in adult zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso not only plays an important zzso role in zzso zzso degradation, but is itself zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we have previously demonstrated to act as an inhibitor of zzso zzso interacts with zzso and prevents its interaction with and degradation by the zzso zzso thereby increasing its zzso and zzso zzso levels induced during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso or during transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso cells result in the stabilization of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells as well as in transformed cell lines results in increased zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may play an important role in the maintenance of the differentiated state and restrain zzso proliferation through its association with and zzso of zzso
