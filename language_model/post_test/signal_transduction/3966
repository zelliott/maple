Treatment of zzso with transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth arrest, which is followed by extensive cell death by zzso Previously, we found that zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso activity in zzso B cell zzso inducing zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice died during gestation due to zzso of liver zzso Here we have explored the effects of zzso on zzso using two zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso which zzso express classical zzso zzso treatment caused increased zzso binding that was followed by a dramatic decrease in zzso levels that preceded zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso induced by zzso The zzso in zzso activity correlated with elevated zzso expression due to zzso and increased zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso factor expression acts directly to promote liver cell zzso Furthermore, these findings characterize a novel signaling zzso for zzso in zzso cells involving zzso of zzso factors activity through zzso modification of zzso zzso
