zzso orphan nuclear zzso 4 zzso plays essential roles for normal zzso in male zzso However, its roles in female fertility and zzso function remain largely zzso Here we found female mice lacking zzso zzso displayed zzso and irregular zzso zzso zzso female mice zzso were smaller with fewer or no zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso female mice produced fewer zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, more intensive zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso in zzso female mice can be due to an zzso zzso with impaired zzso rather than a zzso in zzso zzso zzso mechanism dissection of defective zzso found zzso might induce zzso zzso zzso gene expression via direct binding to its zzso zzso The consequence of reduced zzso expression in zzso female mice might then result in reduced zzso sex hormones via reduced expression of zzso involved in zzso Together, our results showed zzso might play essential roles in normal zzso by influencing zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression and/or zzso via its upstream signals or unidentified zzso might allow us to develop small zzso to control zzso
