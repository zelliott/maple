The Human Genome zzso Project provided us a large amount of sequence zzso However our understanding of these data did not grow zzso because old zzso still set the limits of our zzso The zzso zzso side of molecular biology is reviewed and seven problems are formulated, each indicating the zzso of the zzso zzso The following is concluded and zzso zzso Genes are located and expressed on both DNA zzso zzso zzso are the source of important biological regulation and zzso zzso zzso are the frame of the zzso structure and participate in the zzso zzso zzso The molecular accessibility of the zzso zzso structure is poor; zzso The genetic code is zzso with the zzso acids and there is a zzso matching between the codes zzso zzso zzso The flow of information between zzso acids and proteins is zzso and reverse translation might zzso zzso Complex genetic information is always carried and stored by zzso acids and proteins zzso
