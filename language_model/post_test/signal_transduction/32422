The cell surface zzso for zzso zzso domain zzso gamma zzso zzso is present as a zzso complex on human zzso cells and is essential for zzso cellular zzso Although zzso engagement zzso zzso zzso of several zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lack intrinsic protein zzso zzso consensus zzso We report here that, in human zzso cells, engagement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso triggering through zzso zzso enhances in zzso zzso activity of zzso proteins and zzso activity of zzso zzso Similar results were obtained after stimulation with zzso In zzso labeling experiments showed that zzso zzso primarily zzso in zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso of human zzso cells, we demonstrated that a zzso protein of 62 to 65 zzso was zzso with zzso zzso experiments also suggested that a small amount of zzso may interact with this zzso These results indicate that zzso triggering involves zzso and that this zzso is therefore involved in the signaling pathways regulating zzso cell zzso zzso However, additional zzso not yet identified are also likely to play a role in the early signaling events through zzso
