The regulation of cell proliferation in the external zzso layer zzso of the developing zzso is important for its normal zzso An important signal that regulates zzso cell proliferation is Sonic zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso cells zzso and has a zzso effect on the zzso cell precursors of the zzso zzso of zzso signaling has been associated with abnormal development, and been implicated in zzso which are tumors that arise from the zzso Given the importance of the zzso zzso in zzso development and disease, there has been no systematic study of its expression pattern during human zzso zzso In this study, we describe the expression pattern of zzso its zzso zzso zzso and its zzso that belong to the zzso family of zzso factors, during normal human zzso development from 10 weeks of zzso age, and in zzso that represents a case of abnormal cell proliferation in the zzso This expression pattern is compared to equivalent stages in the normal development of zzso in zzso as well as in zzso Important differences between human and mouse that reflect differences in the normal zzso program between the 2 species are zzso First, in humans there appears to be a stage of zzso signaling within the zzso when the PC are not yet the source of zzso Second, unlike in the zzso mouse zzso expression of zzso in the PC in the zzso human zzso is zzso Finally, zzso in the human but not in patched zzso mouse express zzso These results highlight zzso differences in the regulation of the zzso signaling zzso
