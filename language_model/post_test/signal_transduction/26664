zzso zzso is a hallmark of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso There is an emerging interest in the role of zzso signaling in the initiation and progression of zzso Growth differentiation factor 15 zzso is a divergent member of zzso zzso However, whether cigarette smoke zzso airway zzso zzso production and its functions in the airways have not been zzso zzso we first analyzed zzso protein expression in airway zzso of human COPD smokers versus normal zzso We then examined the regulation and function of zzso in human airway zzso cells in response to cigarette smoke zzso We found increased zzso protein expression in airway zzso zzso in zzso zzso of human COPD smokers compared with normal zzso Furthermore, cigarette smoke exposure consistently zzso zzso expression in human airway zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to play a critical role in cigarette zzso airway zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was largely responsible for zzso airway zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that human airway zzso cells can produce zzso during cigarette smoke exposure, which subsequently activates zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso zzso This highlights a novel role of zzso in regulating airway zzso immunity zzso zzso in cigarette zzso zzso
