zzso zzso zzso channels zzso to the central zzso intermediate zzso through three zzso zzso The genes for these zzso pathways are clustered in three independent regions on the host zzso A number of zzso units and zzso coexist within each of these zzso favoring zzso of zzso zzso and transport zzso zzso of the three pathways is zzso by three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by a positive zzso regulator, zzso In this study, we generated zzso in each of the regulators and carried out zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso These studies revealed that zzso controls the genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso that yield zzso the genes for the zzso zzso that yield zzso and zzso and zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso is the zzso regulator that controls specific zzso for the entry of zzso into the zzso space, as well as the zzso zzso for zzso transport through the inner zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso transport and zzso responsible for the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso however, controls the zzso for zzso of zzso to zzso its transport and zzso and a set of genes unrelated to zzso zzso
