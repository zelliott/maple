The development of peripheral zzso zzso T cells is dependent on the success of positive selection of immature T cells in the zzso Only zzso that express a T cell zzso zzso capable of recognizing zzso with low affinity are selected for survival and differentiation into mature zzso T zzso Although the zzso of zzso T cells has to maintain zzso it also zzso zzso zzso T cell proliferation on recognition of appropriate foreign zzso associated with zzso class II on zzso cells zzso zzso zzso T cells that successfully engage foreign zzso undergo further differentiation that leads to the maturation of a select few into the memory T cell zzso Although the requirements that lead to memory T cell development are currently not known, functional changes have been described that are thought to be associated with the greater efficiency with which memory T cells respond to zzso This article will discuss differences associated with signaling through the zzso of zzso and memory zzso T cells and describe unique control mechanisms imposed on memory zzso T cells that are likely to have zzso zzso to counterbalance the altered zzso zzso
