zzso zzso transformation has been studied in Syrian zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had a limited life span, whereas the zzso cells escaped zzso showed altered zzso and acquired zzso and zzso in a zzso manner during successive transfers after zzso Multiple genetic changes may be associated with the expression of various transformed zzso In fact, sequential zzso of various zzso were required for the zzso progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by the zzso zzso zzso no zzso changes having been identified so zzso The only difference in zzso expression detected was the zzso expression of the zzso gene which was observed zzso These findings indicate the zzso nature of zzso zzso zzso Although the molecular changes involved in these process are still to be zzso recent studies have indicated that the instability induced by zzso inherited through the progeny of zzso cells is associated with those zzso This genetic instability provides a new way with which to zzso the zzso process of radiation zzso The predicted mechanism and future studies are zzso
