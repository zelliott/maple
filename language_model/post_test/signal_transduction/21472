zzso signaling is an zzso zzso mechanism that plays a critical role in the determination of multiple cellular differentiation pathways and zzso during zzso The limb bud zzso culture is an established model that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso showed that zzso and its related genes were expressed in such cultures on day 1 and reached a peak between day 3 and day 5, when cell zzso and zzso formation were zzso zzso experiments revealed that the expression of zzso was initially localized within the zzso and shifted to their peripheral region as the cell differentiation zzso We disrupted zzso signaling by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to analyze the function of zzso signaling in the culture zzso The blocking of zzso signaling by zzso apparently promoted the initiation of zzso zzso and fusion of the zzso and such an effect was reversed by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced zzso markers and bone zzso protein zzso zzso including type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso These observations imply that the zzso signal may have an important role in zzso differentiation by zzso regulating the initiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
