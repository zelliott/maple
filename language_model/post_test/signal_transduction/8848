zzso type 1 zzso zzso is a large zzso deletion that embraces at least 11 continuous genes at human zzso zzso To date, most of these zzso functions still remain zzso In this study, we report an unknown zzso zzso like zzso zzso that is frequently deleted in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The cloned gene has zzso base pair long that encodes a zzso zzso zzso The gene was subsequently named zzso based on its predicted molecular zzso A typical zzso type III zzso domain was identified in zzso between zzso and zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso repeat plus a putative zzso zzso motif were found at the zzso zzso zzso zzso were abundant in many tumor cell lines and normal human zzso and zzso in some freshly isolated lung cancer and leukemia zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso in human zzso kidney zzso cells could significantly cause zzso arrest and prevented S phase zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso gene expression by specific zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso could significantly zzso rather than zzso zzso D1 and zzso D3 zzso We further showed that the induction of zzso D1 expression was directly due to the zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso but was independent of zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso may represent a novel type of zzso protein functioning as a negative regulator at the zzso zzso
