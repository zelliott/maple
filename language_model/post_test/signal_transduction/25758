Loss of zzso zzso tumor zzso function is associated with human zzso zzso and genetic mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso zzso are not fully zzso Through a forward genetic screen and zzso zzso we identified and characterized a zzso zzso specific zzso 39 zzso zzso the zzso and human zzso of which encodes a component of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso and zzso cell lineage expansion without apparent changes in major zzso hormonal and regulatory zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso partially reversed embryonic zzso expansion in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso status of critical cell cycle regulators showed zzso zzso zzso resulting in a premature stop zzso These studies unravel a novel mechanism for zzso regulation by a zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso regulates embryonic zzso zzso by targeting zzso and zzso zzso respectively, contributing to increased zzso sensitivity to these altered cell cycle zzso These results provide a mechanism for zzso zzso and zzso pathways that may result in zzso zzso
