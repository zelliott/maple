Recent findings have suggested that certain zzso responses to zzso may be zzso in a manner that is not dependent on the intrinsic zzso zzso activity of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or, zzso that these responses may occur through the interaction of the human zzso zzso zzso with an as yet unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Davis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These conclusions represent a significant departure from our current understanding of signal zzso by zzso zzso zzso Therefore we examined the effect of expression of zzso zzso human zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells on the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso In parental cells zzso that express low levels of zzso zzso zzso there was no zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso human zzso there was unexpected zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso human zzso in these cells revealed significant zzso zzso of the zzso A low level of zzso zzso zzso present in these cells were also zzso on zzso zzso and displayed zzso zzso Similar results were obtained using an unrelated cell line zzso zzso in which zzso zzso of zzso zzso was previously attributed to signal propagation through a zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso human zzso are able to amplify the response to zzso of low levels of zzso zzso zzso thus leading to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso human zzso
