zzso zzso is one of a family of related hormones including growth hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are hypothesized to have arisen from a common ancestral gene about 500 million years zzso Over 300 different functions of zzso have been reported, highlighting the importance of this zzso zzso zzso is also zzso by a number of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and the zzso Most of zzso actions are zzso by the unmodified 23 zzso zzso however, zzso may be modified zzso thereby altering its biological zzso zzso exerts these effects by binding to its zzso a member of the class I zzso zzso zzso This activates a number of signaling pathways resulting in the zzso of genes necessary for the tissue specific changes induced by zzso Mouse knockout models of the major forms of the zzso zzso have confirmed the importance of zzso role in zzso Further knockout models have provided insight into the importance of zzso signaling zzso and the advent of transcript profiling has allowed the zzso of a number of zzso target zzso
