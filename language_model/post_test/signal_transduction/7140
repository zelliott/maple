zzso targets of broad relevance are likely located in zzso pathways common to disorders of various zzso zzso for targets of this type revealed zzso genes to be consistently zzso in multiple zzso We developed zzso interference zzso to silence zzso and found this zzso approach to block multiple zzso and zzso pathways in activated primary cardiac zzso zzso The zzso was developed in zzso zzso and then investigated in zzso human zzso grown from human zzso zzso zzso zzso of short hairpin zzso zzso sequences for high zzso efficacy and specificity yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or human zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso showed higher efficacy of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in strongly reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso contact protein zzso suggesting multiple signal pathways to be linked to zzso zzso cell zzso towards zzso zzso was significantly zzso We demonstrate here that this zzso strategy is technically zzso to zzso human zzso too, but that these display individually zzso different responses to zzso zzso Either zzso zzso factors or stable zzso modification may explain different responses between individual zzso The new zzso approach addresses a key regulator protein induced in zzso Investigation of this and other molecular therapies in individual human zzso may help to dissect differential zzso processes between otherwise similar disease entities and zzso
