Human zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso and zzso most of which require zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present report, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso activated by tumor necrosis factor zzso Treatment of the zzso human zzso cell line with zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso degradation, and zzso reporter gene zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso induced by zzso The effect of zzso on zzso was zzso through zzso of zzso of zzso Because zzso also blocked zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso must act at a step that causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso was also suppressed by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversed the effect, and zzso zzso zzso the effect, suggesting that zzso suppresses the zzso factors through zzso protein zzso A zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso which may be the molecular basis by which zzso suppresses viral zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso
