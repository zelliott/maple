The zzso zzso zzso is subjected to zzso editing, in the second zzso loop, generating 14 different zzso in human zzso This zzso event markedly alters the signaling properties of the zzso by reducing its ability to couple to zzso Although the zzso form of the zzso is essentially fully zzso active, edited forms show lesser degrees of zzso zzso We have used two extensively edited zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to investigate how variations in zzso zzso activity affect the trafficking and the interaction of these zzso with components of the zzso machinery in zzso zzso zzso We found that cell surface expression of the zzso decreased in parallel with increased zzso activity of the zzso The zzso distribution of the various zzso was dependent of their ability to interact with zzso which correlated with the zzso activity level of each zzso We observed that the zzso interaction of zzso with zzso active zzso zzso was reversed by inverse zzso treatments promoting zzso zzso to the cell zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to stabilize the interaction of zzso with zzso active zzso zzso even in the presence of inverse zzso Taken together, our observations indicate that the zzso active zzso zzso are spontaneously zzso in an zzso zzso This zzso process is zzso by a zzso mechanism and is directly correlated with the zzso activity status of the zzso edited zzso zzso Thus the ultimate zzso output of zzso active receptors may be determined not only by their zzso activity but also by their interactions with zzso and zzso
