The interaction of different members of the zzso growth factor zzso family may be relevant to the increased proliferation and the failure of differentiation that characterizes the zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso that is composed of the zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with low affinity (3 zzso and zzso both zzso and differentiation signals to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate whether the common zzso of the zzso zzso zzso c) can interact with zzso either the entire zzso or a zzso truncated zzso that completely lacks the zzso domain zzso zzso was introduced into zzso cells that express zzso and the binding of zzso as well as proliferation and differentiation responses were zzso 

zzso analysis showed that both zzso + beta c and zzso + beta zzso bound zzso with high affinity zzso 40 zzso to 65 zzso zzso zzso showed that the maximum growth of cells expressing zzso + beta c was identical to that of cells with zzso zzso However, proliferation of the cells that expressed zzso + beta zzso was reduced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed that the concentration of zzso required for zzso growth was zzso zzso for zzso + beta c and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso + beta zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso did not correlate with growth in cells expressing beta zzso zzso of beta c with zzso in zzso cells grown in zzso markedly enhanced zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that beta c can zzso a unique signal in association with zzso to influence both zzso and differentiation signal zzso
