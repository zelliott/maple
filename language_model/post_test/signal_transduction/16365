The zzso Food and Drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developed to control serum zzso in patients with zzso They have been found to reduce zzso and zzso in both diabetic zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso protective effects of zzso result, at least in part, from their direct action on zzso similar to zzso Treatment with zzso zzso or zzso significantly protected zzso against zzso zzso injury zzso to mimic zzso zzso zzso as determined by both cell survival and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we compared the ability of these drugs to zzso key signaling pathways in zzso that may be critical to their protective zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso did not, and zzso zzso to some zzso Similar to zzso both zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso and this response to zzso and possibly to zzso was zzso Furthermore, both drugs zzso or enhanced the effects of zzso on zzso genes in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, both zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso In zzso zzso are able to zzso the zzso zzso and exert direct protective effects on zzso similar to zzso This suggests that zzso may have potential clinical utility as either primary or zzso therapy for zzso syndrome or other diseases treated with zzso These findings may also lend zzso insight into the well established but poorly understood zzso protective effects of zzso in diabetic zzso
