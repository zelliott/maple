zzso of zzso zzso after vascular injury includes zzso of signaling pathways and zzso zzso zzso that are involved in cell proliferation and zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to inhibit zzso zzso in diabetic animals and zzso But the underlying mechanism has not been zzso In this study, we examined how zzso inhibited zzso zzso 

The proliferation and survival of cultured rat zzso were reduced by zzso which was zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso without change of zzso The zzso effect of zzso was reversed by zzso zzso The migration of zzso was also suppressed by zzso that inhibited the expression and activity zzso through zzso zzso Thus migration of zzso zzso from zzso knockout mice was not affected by zzso The underlying mechanism of zzso suppression by zzso was that it inhibited zzso DNA binding activity, which was also dependent on zzso In rat carotid artery, balloon injury significantly zzso zzso with induction of zzso which was effectively prevented by zzso Thus, zzso significantly decreased the ratio of zzso to media by reducing proliferation and inducing zzso of zzso at zzso which was reversed by zzso of zzso with zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso activates zzso which zzso not only proliferation of zzso but also migration of zzso through blocking zzso zzso zzso
