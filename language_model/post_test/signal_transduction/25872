zzso zzso of the zzso accounts for approximately zzso of all cancer deaths in zzso The large majority of zzso tumors are zzso invasive at diagnosis, but even after local surgical therapy there is a high rate of local tumor recurrence and zzso Current treatments extend time to recurrence but do not significantly alter disease zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the zzso potential of combining the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with a small zzso inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso zzso to interfere with zzso regulators of zzso in human zzso tumor zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso A exhibits high binding affinity to the zzso zzso zzso When zzso A was used at nontoxic zzso in combination with zzso there was a significant increase in the sensitivity of zzso and zzso zzso tumor lines to zzso zzso In addition, zzso of TRAIL sensitivity in the zzso zzso tumor cell line zzso with zzso A was zzso by zzso small interfering zzso suppression of zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso resistance to TRAIL in these zzso These results suggest the potential of combining zzso A with TRAIL as an alternative therapy for zzso zzso
