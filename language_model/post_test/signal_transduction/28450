A high expression level of zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been suggested to lead to a shorter survival time and resistance to zzso therapy in patients with breast zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso effect of zzso therapy, an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to human breast cancer zzso A total of five human breast cancer cell lines were zzso The effects of single or combined treatments with zzso and/or zzso on cell growth, cell cycle progression and zzso were zzso Changes in the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso factor, zzso and a zzso factor, zzso were also zzso All cell lines tested were sensitive to zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso Breast cancer cell lines with a high expression level of zzso or zzso were more sensitive to zzso than the zzso zzso induced a significant zzso blockade in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso effect of zzso in all three zzso cell lines in a medium supplemented with zzso The combined treatment promoted cell cycle zzso in zzso cells, which is associated with an zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest an additive interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
