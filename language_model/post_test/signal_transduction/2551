zzso is a zzso zzso that can inhibit the proliferation of the zzso zzso cells, zzso As the mechanism of zzso by zzso remains zzso we studied its effect on the growth of zzso zzso We performed a cell cycle analysis and examined the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso cells with or without zzso After the serum zzso for 3 days, zzso cell proliferation was zzso by the addition of zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that cell cycle zzso induced by zzso included a decreased transition rate from zzso to S phase, suggesting that some zzso event is required for progress through the zzso phase and that this event is sensitive to zzso Internal signal zzso mechanisms are central in the molecular control of cell zzso One such regulator is the protein zzso zzso system and the zzso gene is likely to be a direct target of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso zzso activity and zzso expression of the zzso cells are zzso We zzso that zzso affects the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso expression in cells zzso with serum containing growth zzso
