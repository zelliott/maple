The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso pathways are frequently zzso in human cancer as a result of genetic zzso in their components or upstream zzso of zzso zzso These zzso zzso are regulated by complex feedback and zzso zzso 

In this review the key components of the zzso and zzso pathways and their molecular zzso are zzso The complex interactions between these zzso zzso are also zzso 

The observation that the zzso and the zzso pathways are often zzso in human cancer makes the components of these zzso zzso interesting targets for therapeutic zzso Recently, the presence of zzso zzso that activate one zzso following the blockade of the other zzso cascade has been zzso zzso the blockade of both pathways with combinations of zzso zzso might result in a more efficient zzso effect as compared with a single zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso pathways are activated by zzso that coexist or can be mutually zzso In this regard, a large-scale characterization of the cancer zzso might offer personalized cancer zzso information, which may improve the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso
