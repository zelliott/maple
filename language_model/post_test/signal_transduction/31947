The zzso zzso zzso is a member of family A zzso G zzso zzso Mouse genetic studies suggested that zzso and the related zzso are zzso regulators of energy zzso Lack of zzso leads to higher feed efficiency and fat zzso However, until now only a few zzso zzso have been identified in humans and the role of zzso in the zzso of obesity was zzso In the present study, we performed detailed functional studies on nine naturally occurring zzso zzso recently zzso We found that all nine zzso had decreased cell surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso had decreased total expression whereas the other six zzso had normal total zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited significant defects in zzso binding and zzso The dramatic defects of zzso might be partially caused by decreased cell surface zzso In addition, we found zzso zzso and zzso had decreased zzso binding but displayed similar signaling properties as zzso zzso All the other zzso had normal binding and signaling zzso zzso studies showed that all zzso except zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso at zzso demonstrated the necessity of zzso for cell surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso we provided detailed data of these novel human zzso zzso leading to a better understanding of zzso relationship of zzso and the role of zzso zzso in zzso
