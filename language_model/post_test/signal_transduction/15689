The zzso zzso generate the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensory zzso Previously, it has been shown that bone zzso proteins zzso are involved in the formation of these zzso However, it has been unclear as to whether zzso zzso has an ongoing function in directing the later development of the zzso zzso and how this zzso is zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso maintain zzso zzso and that their activity is modulated by a member of the zzso family of zzso antagonists, zzso Related to Dan and zzso zzso We find that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso while zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso The timing and regional expression of these three genes suggest that zzso is involved in inducing zzso zzso and zzso in maintaining it and that zzso activity is modulated by zzso To investigate this hypothesis, we have performed both zzso and zzso zzso experiments with zzso and find that it can zzso the zzso signals that induce zzso zzso a gain of zzso function results in a loss of zzso and hence zzso zzso is zzso conversely, a loss of zzso function zzso zzso zzso and an expansion of zzso zzso This zzso is therefore necessary for the number and positioning of the zzso zzso
