Recent studies have identified zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso cell proliferation following zzso damage in airways of zzso In this study, we investigated the potential role of zzso one of the zzso inflammatory zzso persistent in zzso zzso in regulating zzso expression using a cell line zzso 

Real time zzso analysis was performed to determine concentration and time dependent effects of zzso upon zzso zzso Nuclear run on experiments were carried out to explore potential zzso zzso Western zzso experiments using a zzso zzso specific to zzso domain of zzso were performed to analyze zzso zzso levels in plasma membrane zzso To analyze potential signal zzso zzso zzso treated zzso cultures were zzso separately with a zzso zzso a zzso selective inhibitor or a zzso 2 zzso inhibitor at various zzso before zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was tested by western zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels increased in a concentration and time specific fashion reaching peak expression at zzso zzso and 8 zzso Nuclear run on experiments revealed zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso levels were observed in plasma membrane zzso zzso inhibitor revealed marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso selective inhibitor zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso In accordance with the above zzso zzso zzso was detected within 5 minutes of zzso zzso No effect in zzso levels was observed on using a zzso zzso 

These observations signify a potential role for zzso in zzso zzso in airway zzso
