zzso is a critical zzso in the regulation of immune responses and genesis of zzso zzso of the zzso activates multiple signaling zzso including the zzso factor zzso zzso mice demonstrate the importance of this factor in zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso cell zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso was generated that is zzso active independent of zzso zzso To determine the ability of a zzso active zzso to mimic zzso responses, we have generated transgenic mice expressing zzso under control of the zzso locus control region, restricting expression to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso transgenic mice is similar, but not zzso to zzso transgenic mice, suggesting a critical role for zzso signaling pathways in the generation of some zzso responses in zzso The expression of a zzso active zzso in zzso increases surface expression of zzso genes and increases serum levels of zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso expression increases zzso differentiation in zzso and in zzso zzso expression also dramatically alters zzso of peripheral zzso populations resulting in decreased zzso cells and increased zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso zzso T and B cell populations correlate with an activated zzso and increased cell death in transgenic T cell, but not B cell, zzso Together these results suggest that expression of a zzso active zzso has distinct effects on B and T zzso
