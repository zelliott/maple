zzso zzso but not predicted ones, trigger strong zzso changes in the firing rates of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso tone have failed to reveal an influence of reward zzso However, the subjects of the zzso experiments were asked to predict reward onset over longer intervals zzso on zzso than the subjects of the zzso studies zzso zzso Thus, the contrasting effects of reward predictability could reflect the difference in the duration of the zzso separating the predictor from the reward rather than a difference in the influence of reward predictability on zzso and zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested in rats receiving trains of rewarding electrical brain stimulation with either a predictable or unpredictable zzso The mean zzso zzso was zzso a value close to the zzso zzso zzso that has been used in zzso studies demonstrating the dependence of zzso zzso responses on reward zzso Despite the shortened zzso zzso the time courses of the observed zzso zzso in zzso levels were very similar, regardless of whether train onset was zzso This finding is consistent with the idea that zzso zzso signaling is insensitive to the predictability of zzso
