To identify potential molecular genetic zzso of cardiovascular zzso tolerance in zzso and transgenic hearts zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso 

zzso zzso were used to explore expression of zzso genes in zzso hearts and zzso mouse hearts zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso dysfunction, limited zzso and reduced necrosis by approximately zzso in hearts subjected to 30 zzso global zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso was zzso by acute zzso zzso and only a small number zzso of genes were modified by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso significantly altered expression of 75 genes in zzso hearts zzso zzso 61 zzso including genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso cell signaling zzso zzso zzso and regulators of zzso and zzso zzso zzso reversed the majority of gene zzso whereas gene induction was generally zzso Additionally, genes involved in cell zzso signaling and gene expression were selectively modified by zzso in transgenic hearts zzso zzso 10 zzso possibly contributing to the protected zzso zzso zzso verified changes in nine selected zzso revealing zzso with array zzso zzso of the zzso gene was also modestly reduced zzso consistent with impaired functional sensitivity to zzso stimulation 

Data are presented regarding the early zzso gene profile of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed which may contribute to poor outcome from zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso gene zzso potentially contributing to zzso
