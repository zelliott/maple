zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso regulator of cellular and systemic oxygen zzso Previous studies have shown that the regulation of zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in some zzso However, whether this zzso plays a role in modulating zzso in cultured cortical zzso during zzso zzso remains zzso We therefore investigated the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in cultured zzso using an oxygen and zzso deprivation zzso zzso In this study, cortical zzso cultured in zzso were subjected to zzso for zzso followed by zzso The expressions of zzso zzso total zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso Western zzso and zzso We found that zzso and zzso were increased at zzso and peaked at zzso after zzso Meanwhile, zzso increased and peaked at zzso after zzso preceding zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso expression and further attenuated both zzso and translation of zzso and zzso zzso our findings suggested that zzso signaling zzso might be involved in zzso regulation after zzso in cultured cortical zzso
