In the present study, we report that compound C, an inhibitor of a key zzso energy sensor zzso protein zzso zzso can induce zzso in cancer zzso The induction of zzso in zzso human zzso cell line was demonstrated by zzso orange zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso decrease and conversion of zzso to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso was confirmed by transmission electron zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells was associated with paradoxical decrease in zzso of zzso zzso a major negative regulator of zzso and its downstream target zzso The zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was also impaired in compound zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not reduce the activity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to block compound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the zzso of compound C towards zzso cells, as confirmed by increase in zzso zzso release, DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso Similar effects of compound C were also observed in zzso rat zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso mouse melanoma cell zzso Since compound C has previously been reported to suppress zzso zzso in different cell types, our findings suggest that the effects of compound C on zzso might be zzso cell zzso and/or zzso By demonstrating the ability of compound C to induce zzso response in cancer cells via zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathway, our results warrant caution when using compound C to inhibit zzso cellular responses, but also support further exploration of compound C and related molecules as potential zzso zzso
