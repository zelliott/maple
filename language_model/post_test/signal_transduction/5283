zzso control of zzso number is crucial for bipolar zzso assembly and accurate transmission of genetic material to daughter zzso Failure to properly control zzso number results in zzso zzso which are frequently found in cancer zzso This presents a zzso during zzso cells with more than two zzso are prone to zzso zzso and cell death, however, cancer cells possessing extra zzso usually divide zzso One mechanism frequently zzso by cancer cells to escape death caused by zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso into bipolar zzso An understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells can suppress zzso zzso is beginning to zzso Here, we review what's currently known about zzso zzso mechanisms and discuss potential strategies to target these mechanisms for the selective killing of cancer zzso
