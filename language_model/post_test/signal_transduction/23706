In zzso zzso cancer, resistance to platinum chemotherapy is zzso Although the orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso is implicated in zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells, its role in zzso cancer has not been zzso In an zzso cancer tissue zzso zzso protein expression was elevated in stage I tumors, but zzso in a significant subset of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression was significantly lower in zzso tumors in patients with zzso disease, and low zzso zzso was associated with poorer overall and zzso zzso We have identified a direct role for zzso in zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso analyses showed clear overlap between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, which was associated with zzso c zzso zzso cancer cells with stable zzso or transient zzso zzso zzso displayed substantial reduction in zzso effects on zzso markers and cell growth in zzso and in zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso induction was regulated by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Finally, zzso resistance was partially overcome by zzso zzso zzso and by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that disruption of zzso activity, via zzso or nuclear zzso likely contributes to platinum resistance in zzso zzso Moreover, we have described a treatment strategy aimed at overcoming platinum resistance by targeting zzso
