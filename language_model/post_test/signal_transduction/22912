zzso are the zzso zzso of zzso acid and include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They are zzso and released upon cell stimulation and act on cells in the vicinity of their synthesis to exert their zzso zzso zzso the actions of zzso were recently identified and zzso They are G zzso receptors with seven zzso zzso There are eight types and zzso of zzso receptors that are zzso by different genes but as a whole constitute a zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso Each of the receptors was expressed in cultured cells, and its zzso properties and signal zzso pathways were zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso of zzso binding and signal zzso are being zzso Information also is accumulating as to the distribution of these receptors in the zzso It is also becoming clear for some types of receptors how expression of their genes is zzso Furthermore, the gene for each of the eight types of zzso zzso has been zzso and mice deficient in each type of zzso are being examined to identify and assess the roles played by each zzso under various zzso and zzso zzso In this article, we zzso these findings and attempt to give an overview of the current status of research on the zzso zzso
