In a society experiencing an accelerating increase in the middle- and old-age population, there is an urgent need to address zzso zzso by a paradigm shift, zzso a new medical strategy to combat middle-age decline at the stage before zzso old-age problems develop into full-blown zzso We suggest that a decline in cellular health status occurs at zzso and that this decline may involve a universal or zzso zzso shift of signaling zzso This decline, although zzso and zzso may zzso increased risk of late-life zzso The putative control for this zzso cellular decline may be governed by a recently discovered group of molecular species, the zzso small zzso of approximately 22 zzso zzso In general zzso while themselves not coding for any protein product, zzso regulate the expression of target genes by either degrading their message or zzso translation by binding to their zzso region zzso Thus, possible zzso of these negative regulators for gene expression in zzso may be the putative force inducing molecular frailty in individual cell zzso and in time leading to zzso zzso A challenge for future research is then to identify these dysfunctional zzso in order to develop advance diagnosis and therapy to combat zzso decline, a preventive medicine approach to block, delay or reduce the risk of old-age zzso
