The zzso mechanisms underlying enhanced zzso contraction zzso in coronary resistance arteries zzso from zzso zzso pigs have not been zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso in protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso enhanced zzso Furthermore, we sought to determine whether zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso enhanced zzso in zzso zzso Male zzso miniature zzso were treadmill trained zzso zzso 7) at approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso for 16 zzso (6 zzso 60 zzso or remained sedentary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso pressure zzso 75, and 90 zzso or 60 zzso zzso were determined in single, zzso zzso ( approximately 100 zzso zzso with and without the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso imaging of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso was also performed in zzso of similar internal diameter after zzso loading of the zzso indicator dye zzso 4 (1 zzso 37 degrees C, 30 zzso We observed significantly greater zzso in zzso isolated from zzso than from zzso animals at 90 zzso as well as greater reductions in zzso after zzso at all pressures zzso At zzso pressures of 75 and 90 zzso zzso produced greater decreases in zzso in zzso from zzso than from zzso animals zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso was also greater in zzso animals zzso zzso zzso Western zzso revealed significant increases in zzso zzso ( approximately zzso but not zzso zzso levels in zzso isolated from zzso animals zzso zzso zzso We also observed significant group differences in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso current zzso was effectively blocked by zzso zzso and zzso in isolated smooth muscle cells from zzso providing evidence for a zzso link between zzso and zzso in our experimental zzso These results suggest that enhanced zzso in zzso from zzso animals involves zzso zzso of zzso zzso including regulation of zzso
