zzso agents have received considerable interest as potential zzso zzso These compounds interfere with zzso dynamics and zzso organization and thereby induce cell growth arrest at zzso phase, and eventually lead to zzso cell zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso zzso was effective at zzso viability of cancer cells, and suppressing tumor growth in zzso Our studies showed that zzso significantly arrested cell cycle at zzso phase and led cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso was identified as a binding protein of zzso using affinity zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was characterized by surface zzso resonance zzso zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated both at cellular level and in cell free system that zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso thereby demolished zzso organization in cancer zzso The underlying mechanism lies in its binding to zzso on a unique site distinct from other conventional binding zzso All these suggest that zzso is a novel zzso zzso and this might shed new light on the understanding of zzso activities and mechanisms of novel zzso zzso and help develop new zzso agents in cancer zzso
