Black tea improves zzso function in patients with coronary artery zzso We sought to determine the responsible components of black tea and zzso the underlying cell signaling zzso We exposed zzso zzso zzso cells to components of black tea and found that the zzso fraction acutely enhanced zzso oxide zzso This effect involved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso consistent with increased zzso zzso These effects were zzso as removal of zzso calcium prevented zzso zzso at zzso whereas zzso of zzso calcium zzso with zzso blunted zzso zzso Black tea zzso zzso zzso appeared dependent upon the zzso zzso pathway, as it was significantly inhibited by zzso and a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso as well as zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso attenuated both zzso zzso and zzso changes in response to black tea zzso zzso of zzso zzso also blunted zzso zzso in response to black tea zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is upstream of zzso in this zzso Finally, a zzso active zzso of zzso an upstream zzso for zzso zzso enhanced both the zzso and zzso activity of zzso leading to increased zzso zzso Taken together, these data identify the zzso zzso as an upstream component of zzso zzso zzso
