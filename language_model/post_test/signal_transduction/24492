During the development of the zzso wing, the activity of the zzso zzso zzso is required to establish and maintain the organizing activity at the zzso boundary zzso zzso At early zzso the activity of the zzso is restricted to a small stripe zzso the zzso boundary, and the establishment of this activity domain requires the zzso zzso fringe zzso The activity domain will be established zzso at each side of the boundary of zzso and zzso zzso Here, I present evidence that the zzso zzso gene lethal zzso zzso discs zzso is required to restrict the activity of zzso to the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso function, the activity of zzso expands from its initial domain at the zzso zzso This expansion requires the presence of at least one of the zzso zzso which can activate zzso more efficiently in the zzso The results further suggest that zzso appears to act as a general zzso of zzso activity, because it also affects zzso eye, and bristle zzso
