In the model plant zzso members of a family of zzso system His zzso zzso receptors have direct zzso interactions with a single downstream zzso zzso zzso These components of the zzso zzso network found in zzso are zzso in the zzso fruit tomato, but both the zzso receptors and zzso proteins zzso in tomato are zzso by zzso zzso Here, using a zzso zzso interaction zzso it is shown that the tomato receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso can interact with multiple zzso In zzso protein zzso studies with fluorescent zzso proteins revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was targeted to the zzso zzso zzso when zzso expressed in onion zzso cells, whereas the four zzso proteins were found in the zzso and zzso When zzso with zzso three zzso zzso 3, and zzso but not zzso also adopted the same zzso zzso pattern in an zzso zzso manner but not in the absence of zzso The zzso interactions were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso could form a protein complex with zzso 3, and zzso This suggested that zzso receptors recruit these zzso proteins to the zzso membrane through direct zzso zzso The zzso interactions and zzso observed in the study reinforce the idea that zzso receptors transmit the signal to the downstream zzso and show that a single zzso can interact with multiple zzso zzso It remains unclear whether the different zzso are functionally redundant or have unique roles in zzso zzso
