The zzso tamoxifen competes with zzso for zzso occupancy, although reports indicate that not all effects of tamoxifen are zzso via this specific zzso In the present study we sought to determine whether tamoxifen can initiate zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is a prominent mode by which hormones, growth factors, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso metabolism was analyzed in cells zzso with zzso zzso After short-term (10 zzso exposure to tamoxifen (10 zzso cellular zzso acid zzso increased by approximately zzso zzso zzso for PA formation were obtained over a tamoxifen range of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso PA generation zzso above zzso Interestingly, addition of zzso a zzso protein zzso C zzso to zzso cells, caused further increase in PA zzso zzso above zzso zzso a second zzso zzso produced upon zzso zzso shares a prominent role in signal zzso events that govern cellular zzso It is therefore suggested that some actions of tamoxifen are zzso by promoting production of second zzso lipids that elicit zzso signal zzso zzso This view is in line with ideas on zzso zzso associated actions of tamoxifen by way of alternate binding zzso
