We previously reported that a zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso drives growth of lung cancer cell lines of zzso and large cell zzso zzso we explored zzso dependency in cell lines derived from the zzso zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression was assessed in nine zzso cell zzso zzso on zzso zzso for cell growth was tested with zzso an zzso fusion zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso dependence was defined by sensitivity to multiple zzso selective for zzso or zzso 

zzso was expressed in eight of the nine zzso cell lines zzso Also, zzso and zzso were frequently zzso whereas only two lines expressed zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso cell lines expressing zzso identifying zzso as an zzso growth zzso zzso zzso selectively reduced in zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso signaling in three zzso cell lines, whereas three distinct lines exhibited responsiveness to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these drugs yielded additive growth zzso Finally, three cell lines were highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with no contribution from zzso zzso 

zzso signaling was dominant or zzso with zzso in six zzso lines, whereas three lines exhibited little or no role for zzso and were highly zzso zzso Thus, the zzso cell lines can be divided into zzso defined by sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent novel zzso to deploy alone or in combination with zzso zzso in zzso
