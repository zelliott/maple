Ras interacts with a number of zzso molecules to achieve its prolific zzso Based on zzso sequence profile and motif searches of databases a novel family of zzso zzso was recently identified zzso and Benjamin, Trends zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among them the rat unconventional zzso and zzso protein zzso 5 was predicted to contain a zzso domain at its zzso Here we report that direct binding experiments between the proposed zzso domain of zzso 5 and Ras failed to demonstrate any zzso zzso zzso suggests that this domain in zzso 5 adopts a similar folding zzso as the zzso domain of zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso domain of zzso zzso the zzso 5 domain lacks the positive surface charges necessary for binding the zzso charged Ras contact zzso This result exemplifies the functional diversity of similar structures and suggests that the identified zzso motif does not reliably predict zzso zzso
