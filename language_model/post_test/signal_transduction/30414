zzso of a cell through the division cycle is tightly controlled at different steps to ensure the integrity of zzso replication and zzso to daughter zzso From published experimental evidence, we propose a molecular mechanism for control of the cell division cycle in zzso zzso The zzso which is based on the synthesis and degradation of three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso is converted into a quantitative model, in order to study the zzso dynamics of these and other cell cycle zzso The model accounts for important details of the zzso zzso and zzso of cell cycle control in stalked zzso zzso zzso It reproduces protein time courses in zzso cells, mimics correctly the zzso of many zzso zzso and predicts the zzso of currently zzso zzso Since many of the proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle of zzso zzso are zzso among many zzso of zzso the proposed mechanism may be zzso to other species of importance in agriculture and zzso
