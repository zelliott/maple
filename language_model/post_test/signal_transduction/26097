We characterized the zzso response of transgenic plants carrying a zzso dysfunction induced by the expression of the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso driven by A9 and zzso promoters induce zzso dysfunction revealed by a decrease in both oxygen zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels without changes in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we measured an increase in zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso and zzso levels with a zzso zzso stress zzso The zzso analysis of young zzso flowers, validated by zzso and zzso or functional tests, showed dramatic changes in zzso zzso Both lines display a modification in the expression of various genes involved in zzso zzso and cell wall zzso suggesting that an important zzso readjustment occurs in plants with a zzso zzso Interestingly, transcript levels involved in zzso zzso protein zzso and degradation are zzso Moreover, the levels of several zzso zzso for zzso factors and DNA binding proteins were also zzso Some of them are involved in stress and hormone responses, suggesting that several signaling pathways zzso Indeed, the zzso data revealed that the zzso dysfunction dramatically alters the expression of genes involved in signaling zzso including those related to zzso zzso acid, and zzso signal zzso Our data suggest that the zzso dysfunction model used in this report may be useful to uncover the retrograde signaling mechanism between the nucleus and zzso in plant zzso
