It is well established that zzso zzso in brown fat requires zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to increase expression of the zzso protein 1 zzso zzso However, little is known about the downstream components of the signaling cascade or the relevant zzso factor targets zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in brown zzso is an indispensable step in the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso By zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso members of two distinct nuclear factor families, zzso zzso controls the expression of the zzso gene through their respective interactions with a zzso response element and a zzso response element that both reside within a critical zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso additionally serves as the zzso sensor that increases expression of the zzso gene itself in brown zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings illustrate that by orchestrating the activity of multiple zzso factors, zzso zzso is a central zzso of the zzso signaling mechanism of brown fat that promotes zzso
