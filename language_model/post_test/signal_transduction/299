The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso are zzso via the zzso zzso zzso domain proteins zzso zzso and zzso We investigated whether zzso of zzso via zzso zzso might promote zzso zzso 

Mice with right zzso artery zzso were treated, by in zzso zzso with plasmids zzso for an irrelevant short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso or specific zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso induced a specific and transient zzso of their respective zzso and protein levels at day 2 after zzso and, as expected, zzso zzso As a consequence, 2 key zzso zzso actors, vascular zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso were zzso at the zzso and protein zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso were enhanced in zzso leg of mice treated with zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso pathways was associated with changes in zzso zzso At day 14, zzso of zzso and zzso increased vessel density by zzso and zzso zzso density by zzso and zzso and foot zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso displayed a lower zzso zzso Of interest, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso effects, suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso pathways zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that a direct zzso of zzso and more particularly zzso promoted therapeutic zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is required to promote this zzso
