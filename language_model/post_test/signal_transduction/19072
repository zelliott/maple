Gap zzso communication is important for embryonic zzso However, the factors regulating the spatial properties of small zzso signal flows through gap junctions remain poorly zzso Recent data on gap zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso patterning suggest a specific model: the net zzso transfer of small molecules through long-range gap zzso paths driven by an zzso zzso However, this concept has only been discussed zzso and it is not known whether such a mechanism can actually establish a zzso within zzso zzso We review the existing functional data and develop a mathematical model of the flow of zzso through the early zzso zzso under an zzso force generated by zzso zzso Through computer simulation of this process using realistic zzso we explored zzso the dynamics of zzso movement through gap zzso confirming the zzso of the proposed zzso zzso which generates a considerable zzso in the available time zzso The model made several testable predictions and revealed properties of zzso cellular zzso of zzso and the dependence of the zzso on several zzso zzso This work zzso supports the zzso of zzso control of zzso movement through gap junctions during early zzso zzso This conceptual framework for modeling gap zzso signaling -- an zzso patterning mechanism of wide relevance in biological regulation -- suggests numerous experimental approaches in other patterning zzso
