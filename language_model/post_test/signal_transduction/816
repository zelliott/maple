Cell replacement therapies have been proposed as possible alternatives to the current treatments for controlling blood zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, however, often lose their zzso insulin zzso zzso when maintained for prolonged periods in zzso For beta cell lines to be considered as a suitable source of zzso zzso it is essential that their zzso is zzso This study aimed to investigate cellular events involved in this loss of zzso to enable future zzso and enhancement of this zzso 

zzso was investigated in low and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso and assessing levels of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of relevant zzso gene zzso including insulin, zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso was investigated by zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso cells produced an approximately zzso to fivefold increase in zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso at high passage, this response was zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso with increased passage, while levels of insulin and pancreatic zzso zzso were apparently zzso 

The maintenance of insulin zzso levels in zzso zzso cells with zzso of zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso insulin zzso gene transcript levels suggests that these cells have not lost their ability to maintain insulin production, but that the loss of zzso responsiveness may be due to a general effect on regulated zzso Further studies investigating the regulated zzso zzso in these cells may further explain the zzso changes occurring with zzso of beta zzso
