zzso factor zzso is the main zzso of zzso in zzso Recently, however, a role for zzso as a cell zzso involved in signal zzso has been zzso The aim of the present study was to assess whether activated factor zzso zzso binding to zzso could induce smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation and to clarify the possible zzso zzso responsible for this zzso 

Cell proliferation was induced by zzso in a zzso manner, as assessed by zzso incorporation and direct cell zzso whereas no response was observed with active zzso zzso zzso which is identical to zzso but is devoid of zzso zzso Similarly, no proliferation was observed when binding of zzso to zzso was prevented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso on binding of zzso to zzso was demonstrated by transient zzso zzso in Western blots and by suppression of proliferation with the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was not observed with zzso or when cells were zzso with zzso 

These data indicate a specific effect by which binding of zzso to zzso on the surface of zzso zzso proliferation via a zzso mechanism and possibly indicate a new link between zzso zzso and zzso
