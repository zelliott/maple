zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso in a variety of tumor cells but its role in zzso remains zzso Here we show, by zzso experiments and zzso zzso analysis, that zzso physically interacts with the tumor zzso zzso through its zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso cells that express zzso zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso carrying five common point zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso interaction appears to zzso zzso zzso function as indicated by zzso zzso experiments, which show zzso expression of the key zzso target gene and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso cells, particularly after zzso damage from zzso Furthermore, stable zzso zzso cell lines zzso from zzso and zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso arrest and slower growth as compared to stable empty zzso control cell zzso Gene zzso studies identified additional zzso target genes involved in zzso or cell zzso which were zzso regulated by zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that increased levels of zzso may contribute to tumor cell development and progression through suppression of zzso function and zzso reductions in the zzso regulatory proteins such as zzso zzso may therefore be a valid target for zzso zzso zzso to sensitize tumor cells to zzso zzso and growth zzso
