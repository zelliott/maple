In the past decade, enormous progress has been made in understanding the role of stem cells in zzso tissue renewal and in zzso processes such as zzso These findings have shed light on the identity and biological properties of such cells and the intrinsic and zzso signals that balance stem cell zzso with zzso With its astonishing zzso capacity, the zzso zzso has provided a unique model to study stem cell biology, lineage zzso and zzso Here we review the role of zzso signaling in zzso cell renewal and differentiation in the zzso as well as during its zzso zzso
