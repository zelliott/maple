The avian Low zzso zzso zzso genetic muscle weakness is zzso characterized by a reduction in the ability of the birds to right themselves from a zzso zzso Compared to normal skeletal muscle, zzso muscle has normal zzso zzso switching and zzso recognition, elevated zzso and zzso levels at embryonic Day 20, and a large increase in collagen zzso at 6 zzso zzso To begin to determine the biological mechanism involved in the elevated zzso protein concentration at embryonic Day 20, the zzso levels of transcripts zzso both zzso and collagen Type I at embryonic Days 14, 19, and 20, and at 1 d and 6 zzso zzso were zzso On embryonic Day 20, collagen Type I transcripts were not different from the control but there was a significant zzso in zzso transcript zzso At 1 d and 6 zzso zzso transcript levels of zzso and collagen Type I were not different between zzso and zzso The change in zzso transcript zzso levels is limited to late embryonic development and suggests an zzso in a signal zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso
