At the zzso barrier, zzso an zzso drug zzso zzso selectively limits drug access to the brain zzso zzso zzso of a number of central nervous system zzso zzso We previously used zzso imaging to demonstrate in isolated rat brain zzso that zzso zzso acting through an zzso zzso NO zzso and protein zzso C, rapidly and zzso reduces zzso transport zzso In this study, we define a link between the zzso innate immune response and functional regulation of zzso We show that exposing brain zzso to the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso activated a zzso zzso released zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and essentially abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of the zzso innate immune response, reduced zzso activity through zzso release, zzso release, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects had a rapid onset zzso were zzso and did not involve changes in tight zzso zzso These findings define a signaling zzso through which zzso activity is acutely zzso They show that this key component of the zzso zzso barrier is an early target of zzso signaling during the innate immune response and suggest ways to manipulate the barrier for improved zzso zzso
