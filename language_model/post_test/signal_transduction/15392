Although zzso oxide zzso has received extensive attention as an zzso agent the mechanisms underlying its regulation of zzso zzso have not been fully zzso Since zzso has been identified as an important zzso of cardiac zzso and is inhibited by NO in vascular zzso we sought to determine whether the zzso effects of NO in zzso were zzso via zzso of the zzso cascade in the context of cardiac zzso Neonatal rat zzso zzso were cultured in the presence of zzso (10 zzso with or without zzso with the NO donor zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso or the ROCK inhibitor zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso was prevented by zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso response to zzso was associated with significantly increased gene and protein expression of both zzso and zzso although zzso was zzso zzso treatment for 15 zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso which was prevented by both zzso and zzso zzso These effects were associated with a complete zzso of zzso zzso of the downstream target of zzso zzso that was zzso by direct zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso and Western zzso revealed that 24 h zzso treatment reduced the zzso to zzso ratio zzso zzso which was prevented by zzso zzso zzso and Y zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso effects of NO are due, in part, to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings may be important in understanding the mechanisms of zzso and zzso effects of NO as well as in the development of novel zzso therapeutic interventions for treating cardiac zzso
