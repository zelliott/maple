zzso radiation can induce cell damage by generating zzso oxygen species zzso The present study was carried out to investigate the zzso effects of a zzso compound, zzso zzso and the underlying zzso zzso was found to reduce the zzso zzso generated by zzso Moreover, zzso protected cellular components against zzso membrane zzso zzso and cellular DNA damage, which are the main targets of zzso cell zzso zzso recovered cell viability damaged by radiation via zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso treatment reduced zzso zzso zzso active zzso 9 and zzso 3, which were induced by zzso zzso cells with zzso recovered the expression of zzso reduced by zzso zzso exerted zzso effects via zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso induced by zzso The results suggest that zzso protects cells against zzso stress induced by radiation via reduction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
