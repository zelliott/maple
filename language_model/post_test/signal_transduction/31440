The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel activated by zzso zzso Although originally identified in the peripheral nervous system, the zzso zzso is also zzso expressed in the central nervous zzso Sites of expression include several brain stem zzso and higher cortical areas such as the amygdala, zzso and zzso On the zzso level, both zzso and zzso zzso receptors can be zzso zzso zzso receptors are involved in zzso or modulating neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso receptors are zzso expressed on zzso In view of this specific expression pattern and of the well-established role of zzso as a neurotransmitter shaping development, we speculate that zzso receptors play a role in the formation and function of cortical zzso
