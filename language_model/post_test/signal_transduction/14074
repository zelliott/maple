zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso from zzso by zzso zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that carotid zzso zzso zzso mice zzso showed less zzso formation than zzso zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso in the process of zzso However, little is known about the roles of zzso receptors zzso in zzso To define the roles of zzso in zzso we investigated zzso zzso in zzso carotid arteries of zzso mice zzso or zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso mice had significantly less zzso whereas zzso mice had more, as compared with zzso zzso Bone zzso transplantation from zzso or zzso to zzso mice confirmed the above zzso Furthermore, the increased expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso molecules and liver X zzso zzso inflammatory signaling factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso was consistent with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso mice accelerate zzso zzso through their regulation of zzso zzso zzso molecules and zzso inflammatory signaling zzso In contrast, peripheral zzso cells act to suppress zzso in zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso regulate inflammation in the zzso zzso
