The zzso regulator, nuclear zzso B zzso family are involved in zzso cell death and zzso Previously, we reported that zzso zzso mice exhibit many features resembling human normal tension glaucoma zzso The zzso mechanism of human zzso is not clearly zzso and a radical zzso treatment has yet to be zzso Our aim is to zzso the signal cascade which mediates the spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso mice as a model of zzso 

To demonstrate the expression and zzso of zzso factors, which mediate the death of retinal zzso cells zzso in zzso mice, western zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso with zzso from zzso and wild type mice, and cultured zzso cells were zzso Furthermore, we tested the zzso effects of chemical zzso zzso zzso and zzso against zzso zzso zzso damage according to in zzso experiments with zzso zzso To zzso the zzso death zzso the effects of chemical zzso on spontaneous zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso 

zzso experiments and zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso zzso X protein zzso and a zzso factor, activated zzso 3 were expressed in the zzso of zzso mice as well as zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso active zzso forms of zzso zzso which have been reported to lead to zzso were detected in the zzso of zzso mice as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso markedly protected zzso cells from zzso zzso and then both spontaneous zzso death and degenerative changes to the zzso nerve in zzso mice were significantly reduced by the chronic administration of zzso The experiments with cultured zzso cells supported the results of zzso examinations with zzso mice, suggesting that zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso and mediates spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Research findings show that the chronic administration of zzso significantly reduces spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrated a potential zzso signal zzso which spontaneously zzso zzso zzso death and degenerative zzso nerve changes in zzso zzso
