The zzso program that commits a zzso stem cell to the B zzso lineage employs zzso regulators to enable the assembly of an zzso zzso complex with a useful specificity and with zzso zzso Once a zzso zzso B cell is generated, it must correctly integrate signals from the zzso zzso with those from zzso receptors and zzso delivering T cell zzso The B cell responds through the regulated expression of genes that implement specific cell expansion and zzso zzso of high levels of zzso zzso and generation of long-term zzso The zzso regulators highlighted in this chapter are those for which genetic evidence of function in zzso B cells in zzso has been zzso often in the form of zzso mice generated by conventional or conditional gene zzso A critical zzso step is the maturation of bone zzso zzso zzso B cells into the mature, zzso cells of the zzso and a number of the zzso factors discussed here impact on this process, yielding B cells with poor zzso responses in zzso For mature B cells, it is clear that not only the nature, but the duration and zzso of an zzso signal are major zzso of the zzso factor activities zzso and so the ultimate zzso The current challenge is the identification of the target genes that are activated to implement the correct response, so that we may more precisely and safely manipulate B cell behavior to predictably and positively influence zzso immune zzso
