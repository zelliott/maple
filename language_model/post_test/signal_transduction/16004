zzso acid zzso an intermediate in zzso zzso has been used for a variety of purposes, such as dietary zzso Although it is well documented that zzso zzso fatty liver in a zzso manner, the precise molecular mechanisms remain zzso The present study investigated the role of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fatty zzso Treatment with zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso via zzso degradation of upstream zzso zzso and induced zzso of zzso in both human zzso cell lines and primary rat zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was suppressed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or by zzso of zzso active zzso zzso in the human zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso data zzso these zzso Feeding zzso zzso with diet decreased the zzso of zzso and increased the maturation of zzso and the expression of zzso genes in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was also completely inhibited by zzso Mouse zzso and mice were resistant to zzso zzso because of little if any response in zzso and downstream zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly by the zzso zzso in rat zzso and human zzso cell zzso
