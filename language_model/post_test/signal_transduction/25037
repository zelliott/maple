During wound healing zzso undergo a process called zzso that enables the cells to spread and migrate on wound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key component of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the induction of zzso and its signaling activity during zzso zzso 

zzso were harvested from normal human zzso Previous work has shown that culture of zzso causes zzso in a manner similar to zzso Freshly isolated, zzso cells were compared with zzso activated zzso zzso cells were further examined either as growing colonies or after zzso on type I zzso zzso content was assessed by Western zzso zzso distribution was shown using indirect zzso zzso signaling activity was assessed using an zzso zzso 

zzso was not zzso by Western zzso in freshly isolated zzso In contrast zzso was detected in activated zzso zzso was zzso between Days 2 and 4 after cell isolation from zzso zzso of zzso growing zzso colonies in zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso When these cells were zzso on zzso zzso became concentrated in focal zzso zzso from zzso cells showed increased zzso zzso of zzso 

In summary zzso is induced in zzso in a time course comparable to that of zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso to focal zzso when cells are zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that induction of zzso and subsequent zzso signaling may be responsible for changes in zzso behavior of activated zzso during zzso
