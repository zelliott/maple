The zzso zzso zzso is truncated in most colon zzso which leads to the stabilization of zzso and to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, it is not clear why colon cancer cells retain the truncated zzso zzso Here, we show that a decrease of zzso levels achieved by zzso interference zzso cell proliferation and DNA zzso not only in zzso cells that express a zzso zzso but also in zzso colon cancer cells that express exclusively a truncated zzso zzso This zzso with a reduction of the levels of zzso A, zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso and the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that colon cancer cells retain a truncated zzso zzso because it is essential for cell zzso
