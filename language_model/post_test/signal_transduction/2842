The zzso events that lead to zzso acid release from bovine zzso cells in culture treated with hydrogen zzso were zzso The hydrogen zzso release of zzso acid was zzso and zzso with zzso release achieved at 15 minutes after the addition of 100 zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso release of zzso acid was blocked with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Treatment of the cells with hydrogen zzso did not result in liberation of zzso acid, indicating that hydrogen zzso exercised its effect on an zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso transition metal zzso and zzso radical zzso did not affect the hydrogen zzso zzso acid release, indicating that the response to hydrogen zzso is not oxygen zzso The response to hydrogen zzso does not appear to be zzso due to the following two zzso zzso No increase in zzso calcium was seen upon exposure of the zzso cells to hydrogen zzso at zzso sufficient to release zzso acid, and zzso no change in the release response was detected in cells loaded with the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid release was seen when the cells were zzso with zzso of protein zzso C, but not with zzso of zzso zzso The results of these studies indicate that hydrogen zzso zzso acid release is zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso and that this process is not zzso via the actions of either zzso zzso or calcium but, rather, that a stimulation of zzso zzso activity is necessary for this zzso
