This review examines the many ways in which water influences the relations between zzso bacterial pathogens and zzso As a limited resource in aerial plant zzso water is subject to manipulation by both plants and zzso A model is emerging that suggests that plants actively promote localized zzso at the infection site and thus restrict pathogen growth as one component of zzso Similarly, many zzso pathogens manipulate water relations as one component of zzso zzso pathogens do this using zzso and other molecules to alter hormonal responses and enhance zzso zzso whereas vascular pathogens use many mechanisms to cause zzso Because of water limitations on zzso surfaces, bacterial zzso including zzso benefit from the protective effects of cellular zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso and production of zzso zzso Moreover, these bacteria employ tactics for scavenging and distributing water to overcome zzso barriers to zzso zzso movement, and signal exchange on plant zzso
