To investigate the role of zzso cell zzso in zzso models of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso 

We compared zzso zzso mice carrying a zzso gene deletion zzso with zzso zzso controls for cellular composition in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso mice were zzso with zzso cells from zzso zzso mice in an zzso zzso in zzso We then infused zzso and zzso B6 zzso cells into zzso zzso zzso and zzso recipients with zzso at the minor and major zzso zzso respectively, in order to induce zzso zzso Cellular composition was analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso mice showed normal zzso cell zzso but zzso zzso cells had reduced ability to induce zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso of 5 to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells produced obvious zzso failure in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were only slightly less severe than those caused by infusion of 5 zzso zzso zzso B6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed less zzso expansion, normal zzso zzso and higher proportions of T cells expressing zzso tissue necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso in comparison to infused zzso B6 zzso zzso zzso expression was equally high in residual zzso cells in recipient of both zzso and B6 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso alters zzso expansion but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death appears to play a minor role in mouse models of zzso zzso zzso
