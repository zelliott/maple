zzso information detected by the peripheral nervous system is represented as a zzso map in the zzso It has long been thought that the topography of the map is determined by graded zzso cues that are expressed by the zzso Here, we analyzed the zzso zzso sorting for zzso map formation in zzso In zzso sensory zzso an zzso guidance zzso zzso and its repulsive zzso zzso are expressed in a complementary zzso We found that expression levels of zzso determined both zzso sorting and projection sites of zzso zzso sensory zzso knockout of zzso zzso zzso sorting and altered the zzso map zzso Thus, zzso zzso sorting plays an important role in establishing the zzso order based on the relative levels of guidance molecules expressed by zzso
