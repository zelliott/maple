Recent research has demonstrated that zzso zzso signaling is an important mechanism of zzso in solid zzso zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso the zzso zzso into zzso zzso is a primary zzso of breast cancer promotion, survival and zzso However, to date the mechanism of zzso drug resistance is poorly zzso Using the dual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we explored the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso breast cancer zzso We demonstrate that zzso alters zzso zzso signaling and decreases cancer zzso survival and zzso Furthermore, pharmacological zzso of zzso induced intrinsic zzso in these cells through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso activity through altered zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may be a promising therapeutic target in zzso zzso
