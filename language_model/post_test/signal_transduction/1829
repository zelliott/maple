zzso cells differ from conventional B-2 cells both zzso and zzso Two seemingly mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of zzso zzso The lineage hypothesis holds that certain B cell precursors are destined early on to become zzso zzso The differentiation hypothesis holds that every B cell has the same potential to acquire zzso zzso zzso of previous studies of transgenic and knockout mice, plus recent results identifying differences between zzso and zzso zzso cells, point to unexpected complexity in the zzso leading to zzso zzso A new paradigm is suggested, in which surface zzso signaling is required for zzso cell production, but in which the signaling threshold and context that lead to zzso cell development and/or expansion differ for particular B cell zzso Surface zzso signaling may also produce zzso editing, zzso zzso and tolerance zzso how these different outcomes are determined remains zzso
