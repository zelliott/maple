The zzso acid zzso is a potent zzso capable of inducing insulin zzso It also plays an important role in the regulation of zzso activity, therefore, providing impetus to investigate if a zzso mechanism in the zzso zzso is involved in insulin zzso We found that zzso insulin zzso was inhibited by both the zzso inhibitor zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso the surface expression of zzso zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso effect on insulin zzso was attenuated in diabetic zzso rats that zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming the role of zzso in insulin zzso Thus, our data demonstrate that zzso regulates insulin zzso by modulating zzso zzso receptors through the zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso led us to a second important finding in this study; retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that zzso of zzso and zzso was associated with an increased zzso of zzso diabetes in zzso transplantation patients over those receiving zzso zzso We believe that zzso of zzso by zzso along with zzso of zzso zzso receptors by zzso represents a zzso to pancreatic zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso This new insight may have important implications for the clinical management of zzso transplant zzso
