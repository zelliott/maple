The zzso properties of zzso and the structure of the zzso on human zzso are well zzso However, relatively little is known about the zzso mechanisms involved in zzso signal zzso in these zzso We investigated the role of protein zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso resulted in the zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was rather zzso as a concentration of zzso as low as zzso zzso caused a complete zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso markedly suppressed the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression and protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso induced a rapid and zzso increase in zzso zzso of several cellular proteins of molecular masses ranging from 35 to 180 zzso Interestingly, zzso caused a significant zzso of the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein relative to zzso cells as well as an increase in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso that the specific activity of zzso zzso was also induced by zzso in zzso Thus, these data show that the zzso of zzso is required for the triggering of zzso zzso and zzso functions by zzso and strongly suggest that zzso is a key participant in zzso signaling in human zzso
