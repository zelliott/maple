zzso zzso zzso is, without doubt, the neurotransmitter for which the number of receptors is the zzso Fifteen genes zzso functional zzso receptors have been cloned in zzso zzso zzso receptors are zzso zzso whereas all the others are zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso diversity is further increased by zzso zzso such as alternative zzso (up to 10 zzso zzso for the zzso zzso or by zzso editing in the case of zzso zzso The cellular and behavioral implications of zzso zzso editing are of great zzso zzso Signaling of zzso receptors involves a great variety of zzso but only some of these have been demonstrated in zzso The classical view of neurotransmitter receptors localized within the synaptic zzso cannot be applied to zzso zzso which are mostly (but not zzso localized at zzso locations either zzso or zzso zzso receptors are engaged in zzso or zzso complexes composed of many zzso zzso The functions of these proteins are starting to be zzso These proteins have been implicated in zzso trafficking to or from the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
