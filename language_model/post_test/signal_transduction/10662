This study was performed to prove our hypothesis that the zzso of zzso aromatic zzso zzso caused the zzso or zzso of zzso via DNA damage to suppress the liver X zzso zzso signal zzso as a probably more direct zzso We found that zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells carrying zzso zzso but not in zzso cells possessing zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The expression of zzso for zzso binding cassette A1 was suppressed by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso X zzso zzso a partner of zzso to form a zzso was suppressed by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
