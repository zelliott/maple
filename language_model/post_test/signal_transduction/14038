The zzso process of zzso or zzso zinc zzso is thought to be a highly coordinated process involving zinc zzso trafficking, transfer and zzso We have previously shown that zzso and zzso zinc zzso are activated in the early zzso zzso zzso via zzso by the zinc zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport zzso However, how other proteins conducting zinc metabolism affect the zzso of these zzso remains zzso Here, we investigated this issue by disruption and zzso of genes known to be involved in zzso zinc zzso using a zinc zzso tissue zzso alkaline zzso zzso as a zzso We found that zzso activity was significantly reduced in cells deficient in zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso in spite of increased zzso zinc zzso The reduced zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso cells was not restored when zzso zinc levels were zzso to levels comparable with those of zzso cells, but was zzso restored by extreme zinc supplementation via zzso by the zinc transport zzso Moreover, the reduced zzso activity was adequately restored by zzso of zzso counterparts of zzso zzso and zzso but not by zinc zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso normally zzso These findings suggest that cooperative zinc handling of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso is required for full zzso of zzso in the zzso and present clear evidence that the zzso process of zinc zzso is elaborately zzso
