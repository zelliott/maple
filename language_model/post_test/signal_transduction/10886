During the past years zzso oxide zzso signaling became an integral component in understanding zzso and zzso processes of cell zzso death or cellular zzso Among other activities NO affects multiple targets that allow regulation of gene zzso Although there is no evidence for direct zzso DNA elements within zzso regions of zzso genes numerous indirect signaling pathways exist to explain zzso gene zzso A characteristic feature of some zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is their low protein abundance in zzso cells due to efficient zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso the protein amount of zzso or zzso is increased steeply upon hypoxic stress or mechanisms that require zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Current available data illustrate that NO is endowed with the ability to mimic a hypoxic response by stabilizing zzso and/or to accumulate zzso and thus to affect viability zzso Here we review recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms how NO affects stability regulation of zzso and zzso Moreover, we zzso existing concepts how zzso and zzso interact to direct zzso death or zzso Considering zzso and zzso as targets of zzso nitrogen zzso zzso may provide insights into basic chemical zzso zzso signal zzso pathways with broad implications for zzso
