With a combined zzso and zzso video imaging system, changes in zzso and zzso zzso were investigated of zzso zzso during zzso to zzso or collagen zzso The zzso signals were, on the level of single zzso compared to the zzso and zzso responses, using zzso zzso zzso against zzso and labeled zzso V for detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in contact with zzso developed zzso and spread over the zzso in most of the cells without zzso zzso zzso zzso induced repetitive zzso in zzso followed by the expression of zzso but not of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso interaction with collagen resulted in spreading and transformation of the cells into zzso zzso structures zzso about 5 zzso The latter zzso changes were accompanied by high and prolonged increases in zzso by the exposure of both zzso and zzso and by the ability of the zzso to convert zzso into zzso zzso addition accelerated the onset of the zzso signals and the appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure was slightly reduced by treatment of the zzso with zzso and strongly inhibited by suppression of the zzso responses with zzso E1 or the zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso responses in many of the zzso and in almost complete reduction of zzso formation and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not suppress zzso formation and zzso exposure of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a collagen but not zzso zzso acts as a potent zzso of the zzso response through zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent generation of sustained zzso zzso zzso
