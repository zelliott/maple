After zzso disruption by tissue injury, zzso migrate from the wound edge into a provisional zzso This process is zzso by growth factors that signal through zzso growth factor zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso and by for example zzso growth factor zzso and zzso that function through different zzso We have previously shown that zzso migration induced by zzso or zzso is dependent on the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso migration induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso depends on zzso zzso involves zzso zzso expression and is zzso blocked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso also zzso wound zzso in zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso activity prevented cell zzso that is an early event in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso experiments with zzso and zzso zzso respectively, revealed that zzso is required for zzso migration, whereas excessive activity of zzso is zzso Thus, induction of zzso migration is conveyed through zzso promoted by zzso zzso and requires zzso zzso
