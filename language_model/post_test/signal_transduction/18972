The zzso signaling zzso acts upon the zzso zzso zzso to control tissue growth in zzso zzso zzso drives growth by stimulating cell proliferation and zzso zzso but how it achieves this is not zzso zzso is known to activate zzso E zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso However, zzso of these targets is not sufficient to cause tissue zzso Here we show that zzso also activates expression of the zzso zzso a known regulator of both proliferation and zzso zzso zzso mimics zzso zzso while loss of zzso function slows the rate of cell zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso and zzso zzso is sufficient to rescue survival and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso levels are regulated during both zzso programmed proliferation arrest and zzso In zzso the results show that the zzso zzso regulates expression of zzso to control tissue growth in zzso
