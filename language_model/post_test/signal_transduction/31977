Parkinson disease is characterized by the loss of zzso zzso mainly in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and cell loss has been also reported in many other brain regions including the zzso where it might impair adult zzso contributing to zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of these zzso are still zzso In this report we show that zzso adult rat zzso neural zzso present zzso zzso zzso with reduction of zzso expression and downstream signaling zzso We characterized a zzso zzso promoter that contains zzso zzso response zzso In zzso binding of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso directly binds to the DNA at zzso promoter vicinity and also interacts with zzso zzso zzso or increasing zzso signaling repression, which interferes with maturation and survival of neural zzso zzso This study provides a molecular basis for zzso disruption of adult zzso in Parkinson zzso
