We show that major zzso complex zzso class II molecules on B cells transit signals which regulate zzso in a negative zzso zzso of zzso class II molecules with zzso results in detachment of B cells previously bound to zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This process depends on zzso energy, active signaling and protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso influenced by this signaling event is zzso zzso The zzso signaling program is activated in B cell lines with a mature zzso zzso normal B cells from zzso and zzso In contrast, cell lines with a zzso cell zzso and normal B cells from peripheral blood are zzso to zzso class zzso regulation of zzso These results extend to zzso cells from patients with zzso diseases representing different stages of B cell zzso These results suggest that zzso class zzso signals regulate B cell zzso in a zzso programmed zzso this might have implications for clinical behavior of B cell zzso
