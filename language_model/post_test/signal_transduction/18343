To identify the signaling zzso that mediates the zzso stimulation of the expression of the gene for vascular zzso growth factor zzso during zzso induced zzso we examined mouse brown zzso in primary zzso The zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso induced zzso expression zzso in a zzso and zzso manner zzso approximately 90 zzso Also, the zzso agent zzso as well as serum and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso but the effect of zzso was additive to each of these factors, zzso that a separate signaling mechanism for the zzso induction was zzso The zzso effect was abolished by zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso and was thus zzso via zzso The zzso zzso expression was fully zzso zzso an effect which was inhibited by zzso and thus was dependent on protein zzso A zzso zzso of other zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso protein zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced the stimulation by NE, which demonstrates that a zzso zzso zzso is positively connected to zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was without zzso zzso did not prolong zzso zzso zzso and its effect was thus zzso and was independent of protein zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso through zzso zzso A zzso recruits a zzso that branches off from the zzso zzso cascade to enhance zzso of the zzso zzso
