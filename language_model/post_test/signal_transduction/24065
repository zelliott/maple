Two mechanisms are proposed to account for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso of vascular muscle, zzso zzso of either zzso a target zzso of zzso or zzso an zzso zzso In cultured vascular zzso smooth muscle cells zzso stimulation with zzso II activated zzso and this was blocked by zzso with zzso zzso zzso by zzso II, zzso or zzso significantly increased the zzso levels of both zzso (at zzso and zzso (at zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was completely blocked by zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso but not by zzso (a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso was inhibited only by zzso zzso dramatically corrected the hypertension in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, and this hypertension also was sensitive to zzso zzso The level of the active form of zzso was significantly higher in zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso light chain zzso were not significantly different in zzso from zzso and control zzso zzso of zzso without changes in levels of other signaling molecules were observed in three other rat models of hypertension, zzso zzso spontaneously zzso rats, zzso zzso rats, and zzso zzso These results suggest that independent of the cause of hypertension, a common point in downstream signaling and a critical component of hypertension is zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso
