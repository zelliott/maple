The transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso molecules plays crucial roles in the regulation of cell zzso zzso regulates gene zzso through zzso proteins and signals via zzso zzso The zzso zzso is strictly zzso and zzso lead to zzso Several zzso components are known to be targeted for zzso degradation via zzso by zzso zzso zzso are well known negative regulators of zzso which function as zzso zzso recruited by zzso such as zzso zzso signaling can also be enhanced by zzso zzso such as zzso that target zzso for zzso It is becoming clear that zzso zzso often target multiple zzso thereby acting as zzso of signaling zzso zzso via zzso involves a complex network of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso acting by removing zzso from its zzso Interestingly, also zzso zzso modifications are known to play important roles in zzso zzso zzso modifications thus play a key role in zzso signal zzso and in this review we provide an overview of known players, focusing on recent zzso
