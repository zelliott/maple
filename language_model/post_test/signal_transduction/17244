zzso family members play a relevant role in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso but a specific implication of the Bone zzso zzso zzso zzso is still zzso Although originally isolated from fetal liver, little is known about zzso a zzso family member, and its role in liver physiology and zzso Our results show that zzso promotes growth in zzso cells, but not in immortalized human zzso In the liver cancer cell line zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 zzso expression zzso zzso zzso by using chemical zzso zzso trap and gene zzso approaches we demonstrate that zzso cells zzso produce zzso that supports their proliferation and zzso independent zzso Additionally, our data reveal that in zzso cells zzso triggers cell cycle zzso and zzso completely zzso the increase in the percentage of zzso cells induced by long-term incubation in low zzso zzso our data unveil a dual role for zzso both promoting a zzso response and exerting a remarkable zzso function in zzso cells, which result in a robust zzso effect on liver cancer cell zzso Finally, we show that zzso expression is increased in zzso of human zzso zzso compared with normal human liver as revealed by zzso analysis, suggesting that zzso signaling may be relevant during zzso in zzso Our findings provide new clues for a better understanding of zzso contribution, and in particular zzso in zzso zzso that may result in the development of effective and targeted therapeutic zzso
