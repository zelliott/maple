zzso generated in response to zzso stimuli at the plasma membrane are transmitted through zzso zzso zzso to the zzso We report the identification of a zzso directly linking the small zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso to signal zzso and zzso This zzso operates via zzso and zzso two zzso zzso which reside on a zzso of zzso In response to zzso stimuli such as zzso and zzso stress, zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus where it interacts with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex zzso an established regulator of zzso structure and gene zzso Both zzso and zzso are essential for cell proliferation and their function requires zzso zzso Our findings identify an zzso compartment bearing zzso and zzso proteins as an intermediate in signaling between the plasma membrane and the zzso
