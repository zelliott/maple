The zzso zzso zzso is an elaborate cellular zzso essential for cell function and zzso zzso that interfere with zzso function lead to the zzso and zzso of unfolded proteins which are detected by zzso zzso receptors that initiate the unfolded protein response zzso to restore normal zzso zzso If the zzso stress is zzso or the zzso response fails, zzso cell death zzso Many studies have focused on how this failure zzso zzso particularly because zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular zzso In this review we aim to shed light on the proteins that are not core components of the zzso signaling zzso but which can influence the course of the zzso stress response by regulating the switch from the zzso phase to zzso
