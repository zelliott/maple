zzso was recently demonstrated to participate in the formation of a zzso complex to set up initial polarity in zzso cells, a function presumably depending on the zzso targeting of zzso We show that correct zzso sorting of zzso depends on a zzso signal composed of an zzso zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of this zzso motif could be zzso with a fusion construct of zzso with zzso zzso 50 zzso In accordance with this zzso zzso binds to newly zzso zzso at the zzso apparatus and zzso zzso and sorting of zzso into a zzso zzso A defective connection between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso results in a delayed exit from the zzso zzso failure of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso defective zzso of zzso was rapidly retrieved via a zzso zzso According to these findings, we propose a model by which a highly negative charged zzso protein could be packed into an zzso sorting platform with the aid of its zzso partner zzso
