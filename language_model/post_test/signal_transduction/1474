zzso zzso is localized to the zzso division plane before the formation of zzso ring zzso zzso binds to zzso in a zzso manner and both proteins zzso to the division zzso zzso of the binding of zzso and zzso prevents both the zzso of zzso and zzso to the division plane and the formation of the zzso ring, suggesting that the interaction of zzso and zzso is important in the formation of the zzso zzso We investigated the mechanisms of the formation of zzso ring, and the relationship among zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso in a zzso manner, but does not bind to zzso zzso we propose that a zzso signal and its target protein zzso are zzso involved in the recruitment of zzso to the division plane and the formation of the zzso zzso
