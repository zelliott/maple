One notable zzso change during the differentiation of immature zzso into either mature zzso or zzso zzso lineages is the acquisition of a resistance to zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso is critical in determining the sensitivity for the zzso zzso in developing zzso We report here that zzso signaling zzso the zzso zzso of zzso through zzso and/or zzso elements on its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso competitively zzso the binding of zzso to zzso protein bound to the zzso elements and zzso the zzso promoter zzso Moreover, enforced expression of zzso restored zzso zzso zzso survival from the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso by regulating the zzso expression through zzso and that zzso and zzso may play a significant role during zzso zzso zzso
