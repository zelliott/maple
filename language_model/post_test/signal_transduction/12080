zzso with two or more zzso have arisen independently from an ancestral zzso condition in a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso fishes, zzso zzso and zzso One potential explanation for the repeated origins of zzso teeth is the existence of multiple zzso pathways leading to them, as suggested by their different uses in these zzso Another is that the addition of zzso required only minor changes in genetic pathways regulating tooth zzso Here we provide support for the latter hypothesis by demonstrating that manipulation of the levels of zzso growth factor zzso or Bone zzso protein zzso signaling produces zzso teeth in the zzso zzso zzso a species lacking zzso teeth in its zzso The zzso of these results for zzso is suggested by the conversion of zzso zzso teeth into zzso teeth by similar zzso of the Mexican zzso zzso zzso That these zzso also produced zzso teeth in both species supports previous suggestions of similarities in the molecular control of tooth and cusp zzso We conclude that despite their apparent complexity, the evolutionary origin of zzso teeth is positively zzso likely requiring only slight modifications of a pre-existing mechanism for patterning the number and spacing of individual zzso
