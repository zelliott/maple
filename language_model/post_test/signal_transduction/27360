The contribution of the zzso zzso factor zzso proposed to be a zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid, to zzso zzso under zzso conditions has yet to be established, because its effect can be detected only after zzso of NO zzso and zzso The possibility that NO exerts a feedback zzso on zzso formation was studied in isolated zzso zzso zzso 

Under combined blockade of NO zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in rabbit carotid and zzso coronary arteries was significantly attenuated by the NO donors zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso was not altered by either NO zzso In zzso carotid artery zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso increase in zzso F1 alpha release, which was taken as an index of zzso acid zzso In parallel experiments using cultured human zzso cells, zzso attenuated the zzso response to zzso The release of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso coronary artery was detected by recording the membrane potential of zzso cultured rat zzso smooth muscle zzso The NO donor zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso by zzso zzso but markedly inhibited its release from zzso donor zzso 

These findings indicate that under zzso conditions, the production of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso it follows that when NO synthesis is impaired, zzso of this intrinsic zzso may, at least in part, maintain zzso zzso zzso
