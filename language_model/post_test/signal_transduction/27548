The activity state of G proteins is involved in the zzso zzso responses that can be produced by zzso the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The present study investigated the zzso responses at the zzso h zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso by the zzso zzso zzso a fusion protein was constructed between the zzso zzso and a zzso toxin resistant rat zzso zzso protein to define its pharmacological properties at a zzso zzso protein density ratio of zzso zzso toxin treatment zzso zzso affected neither the expression of the zzso zzso fusion protein as measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso binding response zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded partial zzso activity as compared to zzso whereas WAY zzso acted as a competitive zzso zzso zzso The magnitude of the zzso response zzso zzso was highly dependent on the nature of the zzso acid zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values zzso of zzso displayed the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For comparison, zzso responses of zzso and zzso were enhanced versus zzso upon zzso of the zzso zzso with the respective zzso zzso probably due to an altered zzso zzso protein density zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of the rat zzso protein is involved in determining the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso that zzso can produce at these zzso Moreover, the fusion protein approach allows quantitative comparisons of the intrinsic activities of zzso between one single zzso zzso with different zzso protein zzso
