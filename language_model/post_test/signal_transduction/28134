zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso growth factor, a zzso zzso controlling cell growth, zzso and zzso In our previous study, zzso whose name originated from its ability to interact with zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso by serving as an zzso protein of zzso to recruit zzso In this study, we identify a protein sharing a high zzso acid sequence identity with zzso especially in its zzso domain, the region responsible for zzso zzso This protein lacks the zzso zzso and zzso zzso stretch present in zzso and has less zzso with zzso in its zzso We subsequently named this protein zzso after demonstrating its interaction with zzso We show that, like zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso domain of zzso via its zzso domain and these two proteins can compete with each other to bind to zzso Interestingly, unlike zzso zzso of zzso cannot induce zzso zzso and serum response zzso zzso reporter gene zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso and zzso significantly zzso zzso reporter gene expression induced by zzso of zzso Additional binding zzso demonstrate that zzso fails to interact with zzso which explains its inability to activate the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso of zzso with the zzso stretch is required for recruiting zzso and a truncated zzso lacking this region fails to recruit zzso indicating that the functional difference between zzso and zzso lies in their sequence difference in their zzso
