The limbs have an essential function in all zzso In animals, the key genes that are involved in the growth and patterning of the limb zzso and of the development of the complex zzso have been identified and their interactions zzso Aided by these zzso human zzso has also been able to zzso or at least zzso certain genes responsible for anomalies of the zzso These zzso are isolated or associated with anomalies of other zzso fields, according to the expression domain of the gene zzso zzso knowledge of the zzso and genes involved has lead to a zzso of zzso manifestations in zzso zzso Clear zzso correlations are difficult to establish zzso to the zzso network of genetic signals underlying limb zzso
