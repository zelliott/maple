Type 2 diabetes zzso is a leading risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease and zzso Exercise training zzso has a beneficial effect on these disorders, but the basis for this effect is not fully zzso This study was designed to investigate whether the zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in the zzso in zzso zzso controls zzso zzso and type 2 diabetic mice zzso zzso were either exercise zzso by forced treadmill exercise or remained sedentary for 10 zzso zzso zzso functional assessment of zzso rings showed that zzso restored zzso zzso zzso of diabetic zzso Although the protein expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso did not increase, zzso reduced both zzso and zzso production by zzso zzso protein zzso In addition, zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether these beneficial effects of zzso are zzso dependent, we used zzso knockout zzso zzso Indeed, impaired zzso zzso occurred in zzso mice, suggesting that zzso plays a central role in prevention of zzso zzso zzso mice also showed increased protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso but protein expression of zzso and zzso were comparable between zzso and zzso These findings in the zzso imply that zzso suppresses inflammation and zzso stress in the zzso but not zzso and zzso Thus zzso improves zzso function in the zzso in zzso via both zzso and independent zzso This improvement is due to the effects of zzso in zzso inflammation and zzso stress zzso as well as in improving zzso zzso zzso performance in zzso
