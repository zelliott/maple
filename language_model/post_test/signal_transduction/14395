Advances in cell biology over the last several decades have allowed for a much greater understanding of the regulation of cellular zzso Many of these revelations have provided substantial details regarding the key players in cellular pathways and the role zzso zzso may play in controlling their zzso Although much progress has been made in these areas, zzso of zzso gene delivery zzso has not met with similar zzso Many of the issues that have plagued the field, such as limited zzso activity, difficulty with specific cell zzso inflammatory responses, and degradation of the zzso among others, continue to limit the efficacy of these delivery zzso In this study, we investigate several cellular pathways in an effort to develop more efficient zzso zzso To increase nuclear zzso of the zzso we explored the use of nuclear zzso sequences zzso incorporated into our zzso The results indicated that the zzso did significantly increase gene expression under several circumstances in the presence of zzso zzso as indicated by both in zzso and in zzso zzso Furthermore, to decrease inflammatory response to the zzso additional studies were performed to demonstrate that the incorporation of free zzso zzso into zzso zzso does not affect zzso activity but is able to significantly decrease the inflammatory zzso Overall, these examples provide hope that free zzso can be used to effectively mediate cellular processes to overcome some of the obstacles limiting the success of gene zzso
