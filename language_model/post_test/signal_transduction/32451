zzso complex factors zzso one of which is zzso have been implicated in mediation of zzso zzso They have been shown to be zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso upon joint zzso of zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso the latter serving as an indirect in zzso zzso of zzso This zzso is accompanied by a zzso change and results in an elevated zzso potential of zzso zzso of mapped in zzso zzso sites, which are potential targets for zzso reduced zzso zzso Thus, zzso are very probably controlling zzso activity by direct zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to stimulate zzso from both the zzso serum response element and also from an zzso binding zzso While binding of zzso to the zzso promoter is dependent on the serum response factor, zzso can autonomously interact with zzso binding zzso This indicates that zzso may participate in the zzso regulation of two different sets of zzso
