Despite the importance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso development, its zzso mechanism still remains zzso In this study, we show that deletion of both zzso and zzso leads to an almost complete block of zzso zzso zzso and to severe defects in generation of immature and mature B zzso The zzso motifs in zzso and zzso are crucial for regulating zzso development in that zzso of these motifs zzso their ability to induce zzso zzso zzso as well as to promote zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso in zzso B cells was partly relieved by introducing a zzso active form of zzso or zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso and zzso have complementary roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso at least in part, contributing to zzso zzso
