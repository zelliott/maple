zzso formation on collagen at zzso rates of zzso is zzso by coordinated signaling between zzso zzso and G zzso zzso We have investigated the role of these receptors and the zzso zzso in maintaining zzso stability under zzso 

zzso zzso are rapidly formed when blood is flowed over collagen at 1000 zzso and remain stable over 20 zzso A novel zzso mechanism of zzso against the direction of flow occurs at the zzso front and recruits zzso into the main zzso zzso zzso are not observed in the presence of zzso D, which blocks de zzso zzso zzso When exposed to the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spread in the direction of flow and rounded zzso appear within the zzso body and are lost in the direction of zzso A similar set of observations is observed in the presence of zzso A, which zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the combined presence of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Maintenance of stable zzso at high zzso is a dynamic process zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These signals maintain zzso in a compact structure and prevent continuous streaming of zzso
