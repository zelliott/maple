zzso molecular patterns are recognized by zzso receptors of the innate immune zzso This recognition enables a rapid response to potential pathogens but does not clearly provide a way for the innate immune system to discriminate between virulent and zzso zzso We find that pulmonary infection of mice with type 3 zzso zzso zzso triggers a rapid inflammatory response, while infection with zzso zzso zzso does zzso Discrimination between zzso and zzso bacteria requires zzso activity in bone zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso by bacteria expressing type 3 zzso systems allows for rapid recognition of bacteria expressing zzso functions associated with zzso
