zzso therapy of zzso diseases with zzso killer zzso cells showed promise in a number of zzso the zzso of zzso cells from cancer patients towards their zzso cancer cells still needs to be zzso Here, we generated zzso cells ex zzso from blood zzso of zzso cancer patients and engineered those cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells thereby gained a new specificity as defined by the zzso and showed increase in zzso towards zzso colon zzso cells, but less in presence of zzso cells, indicated by increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior by zzso zzso than zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso cells from colon zzso patients showed improved zzso against their zzso primary zzso cells from zzso resulting in more efficient zzso cell zzso We assume that adoptive therapy with zzso zzso cells shows improved selectivity in targeting zzso zzso zzso
