Fetal zzso syndrome zzso is caused by in zzso exposure to the drug sodium zzso zzso is used worldwide for the treatment of zzso as a mood zzso and for its zzso zzso In addition to birth zzso zzso is associated with an increased risk of zzso spectrum disorder zzso which is zzso by abnormal zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso pathways and alters gene expression through its zzso of zzso zzso Which, if any, of these mechanisms is relevant to the genesis of its zzso side effects is zzso zzso changes associated with zzso have been reported and, among these, altered zzso zzso differentiation is a consistent zzso zzso zzso zzso is also associated with zzso Here we have used a zzso approach to investigate the underlying molecular zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso causes the selective failure of zzso central zzso zzso It does so by zzso the zzso gene zzso an zzso of zzso zzso which is a known zzso of zzso identity in the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to rescue zzso expression in zzso zzso Chemical and genetic blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zzso repression by zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso restores zzso expression and zzso expression in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for zzso defects in zzso and highlight an zzso mechanism for zzso interaction in zzso
