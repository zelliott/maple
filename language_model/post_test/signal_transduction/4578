The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a profound impact on plant development, mainly through its principal zzso factors, a mix of zzso acting zzso that induce shoot zzso zzso profiling of marker genes for several zzso zzso routes and zzso analysis demonstrated that the bacterial zzso stimulate the zzso zzso of plants via specific targeting of the zzso acid zzso pathway, resulting in enhanced zzso signaling in infected zzso The double zzso zzso zzso 1-1 zzso zzso related 2-1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is zzso displayed a decreased responsiveness towards zzso zzso infection, although bacterial colonization and zzso gene expression were not zzso These observations implied that zzso zzso was employed to reinforce symptom zzso Furthermore, the increased zzso production and, zzso the accumulating bacterial zzso in infected plants modified the polar zzso transport so that new zzso zzso were zzso established and distributed, a process that is imperative for symptom onset and zzso Based on these findings, we extend our model of the mode of action of bacterial and plant signals during the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso
