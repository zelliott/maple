zzso regulate responsiveness of many cells to hormones that bind to G zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso on zzso hormone zzso zzso of two G zzso signal zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso over 4 days zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso zzso of control after 4 days for zzso and zzso activity, zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso response in the same cells was more modest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of control after 4 days for zzso and zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso to G alpha zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by G alpha s zzso zzso of these G protein zzso in control and zzso cells showed a zzso increase in G alpha zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas G alpha s was increased only zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso were increased zzso (from 54 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso are more potent regulators of zzso activity than zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, and this is zzso at least in part, by differential increases in G alpha zzso zzso
