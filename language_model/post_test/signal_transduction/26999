zzso inflammatory zzso zzso alpha and beta are members of the zzso branch of the zzso factor 4 zzso of zzso recently designated the zzso zzso It has been suggested that the major cellular targets for the zzso activities of the zzso zzso are the zzso zzso However, the original designation of zzso zzso proteins as inflammatory zzso was based on suggestions that they activated zzso functions such as zzso the respiratory burst, and zzso In this study, we have evaluated the ability of human zzso zzso alpha and beta to affect zzso human zzso zzso Although both zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso significant calcium zzso in human zzso only zzso alpha exerted a zzso effect on zzso zzso alpha zzso a small, zzso increase in zzso zzso which was accompanied by a simultaneous change in zzso light zzso the latter indicating induction of shape zzso While the effect of zzso alpha on calcium zzso in zzso was small when compared with that zzso by zzso or zzso zzso it had similar characteristics to that by other zzso zzso zzso in that it was dependent on zzso zzso G proteins and on both zzso of calcium from zzso sources as well as influx from the zzso zzso In addition, stimulation of zzso with zzso alpha led to zzso to subsequent additions of zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso alpha on zzso calcium zzso and shape change was not coupled to other standard measures of zzso zzso zzso For instance, neither zzso alpha nor zzso beta had any zzso zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Moreover, although zzso alpha binding could easily be measured on zzso or zzso cell lines, the number of sites were too few to characterize on zzso by the same zzso Taken together, these results show that neither zzso alpha nor zzso beta stimulate significant zzso zzso and support the concept that the zzso effects of members of the zzso branch of the zzso factor 4 zzso are not primarily directed toward zzso
