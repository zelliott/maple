A zzso protein zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso enriched zzso with a molecular weight of 46 zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso with zzso zzso To examine the hypothesis that zzso is involved in the zzso functions modulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system, we introduced the complementary DNA of zzso into the zzso cell line zzso which exhibits zzso differentiation characterized by zzso outgrowth in response to zzso and nerve growth factor zzso and we established zzso cell lines that zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso The zzso expressing zzso showed increased zzso outgrowth during differentiation induced by a zzso analogue zzso zzso The positive regulatory role of zzso in the zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells indicates that zzso may play a role in zzso processes modulated by the zzso cascade as a zzso
