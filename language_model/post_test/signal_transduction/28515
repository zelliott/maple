zzso zzso cells are continuously exposed to mechanical zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso growth zzso zzso It is important to zzso the mechanisms by which cells perceive and integrate these different stimuli to regulate the downstream signaling zzso We zzso have previously reported the zzso interplay between two membrane zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso stress and zzso Both zzso stress and zzso induced a transient increase of zzso zzso These effects were inhibited by zzso a specific zzso zzso and by a negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso form a complex upon zzso or zzso applications (50), these results suggest that zzso stress and zzso activate zzso via the zzso zzso and its recruitment of the adapter protein zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso activities by a negative zzso of zzso indicates that zzso acts upstream to zzso in response to zzso stress and zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso abolished the zzso and zzso zzso activity, indicating that zzso acts at a level downstream to zzso and zzso zzso our results indicate that the signaling events induced by zzso stress and zzso zzso at the membrane zzso zzso and that these stimuli share the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
