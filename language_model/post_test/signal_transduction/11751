The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso in collecting zzso zzso from the zzso zzso or outer zzso zzso of the rat zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso either a zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso active on all forms of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso active on the zzso type zzso A zzso synthesis inhibitor was added to all zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso the response induced in the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso Under the same experimental conditions, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso was not affected by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not modify the response to 1 zzso zzso in zzso but inhibited this response in zzso samples zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso was dose dependent with a maximum at zzso zzso observed for all zzso of zzso tested (from 50 zzso to 1 zzso and did not affect the concentration of zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso In a second experimental series performed in the presence of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased the response to 1 zzso zzso in the zzso The addition of an zzso zzso relieved the effect of zzso but did not modify the zzso observed with zzso Thus zzso decreased the synthesis of zzso in zzso sensitive cells in rat zzso and might affect the zzso of zzso zzso level rather than its synthesis in rat zzso
