Maintenance of the zzso state or differentiation of the zzso state into any germ layer depends on the factors that orchestrate expression of thousands of genes through zzso zzso and zzso zzso Long zzso zzso zzso are implicated in the complex molecular zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso project has opened up new avenues for studying these zzso transcripts with the availability of new zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies identified hundreds of long zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso state, and many of these zzso are found to control the zzso and zzso in embryonic and induced zzso stem cells or, in the reverse way, promote differentiation of zzso zzso They are generally zzso activated or zzso by zzso zzso factors and function as molecular zzso of gene expression that determine the zzso state of the zzso They can act as molecular scaffolds or guides for the zzso complexes to direct them to bind into specific zzso zzso to impart a repressive or zzso effect on gene zzso or they can zzso or zzso regulate gene expression by diverse molecular zzso This review focuses on recent findings on the regulatory role of zzso in two main aspects of zzso zzso self renewal and differentiation into any zzso and zzso the underlying molecular mechanisms that are being uncovered zzso
