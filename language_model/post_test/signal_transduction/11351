zzso zzso is a widespread zzso signal since many animal cells release zzso in the zzso zzso often this release is zzso but the molecular mechanism is still zzso The involvement of zzso release, zzso channels, or ABC zzso has been suggested in different cell zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso release in human zzso zzso cells, in which mechanical stimulation induced zzso calcium waves sustained by both zzso zzso through gap junctions and zzso zzso In this study we employed a zzso zzso zzso to measure the amount of zzso released under different zzso zzso Given the role of zzso zzso in favoring passive zzso transport zzso zzso et zzso (2001) zzso zzso 15, zzso the involvement of zzso zzso as putative zzso zzso was initially zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso the amount of zzso released under zzso and zzso conditions was similar to zzso cells, ruling out a major involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells mechanical zzso induced by medium displacement and zzso stress consistently enhanced zzso zzso zzso D treatment did not alter zzso and zzso zzso release, while elevated zzso levels consistently reduced zzso in both zzso zzso released by zzso stress and medium displacement evoked zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that different mechanical stimuli activate zzso cell zzso
