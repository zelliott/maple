The emerging understanding of the molecular basis of zzso mechanisms allows one to answer some long-standing questions regarding the complex recognition machinery zzso The ability of the zzso system to detect chemicals at zzso zzso is explained by a plethora of amplification devices, including the zzso of receptors to second zzso generation through zzso zzso zzso and selectivity may be understood in terms of a diverse repertoire of zzso receptors of the zzso zzso zzso which are probably disposed on zzso sensory zzso according to a zzso exclusion zzso Signal termination may be related to sets of zzso zzso that process zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso Many of the underlying molecular components show specific expression in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso sequence of zzso possibly related to sensory zzso function and connectivity zzso A general model for molecular recognition in biological zzso zzso allows a prediction of the number of zzso receptors necessary to achieve efficient detection and sheds light on the zzso between the immune and zzso zzso The molecular cloning and mapping of a human zzso zzso zzso cluster on zzso 17 provides insight into zzso zzso diversity, zzso and zzso Combined with future zzso zzso with particular reference to specific zzso as well as with computer-based molecular zzso these studies may provide insight into the zzso specificity of zzso zzso
