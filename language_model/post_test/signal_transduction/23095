All biomedical materials are recognized as foreign entities by the host immune system despite the substantial range of different materials that have been developed by material scientists and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with low protein binding surfaces, and those that readily zzso a protein layer all seem to incite similar host responses in zzso that may differ in zzso but ultimately result in zzso by zzso zzso The recognition of medical materials by the host is explained by the very intricate pattern recognition system made up of zzso zzso zzso scavenger zzso and other surface proteins that enable zzso to perceive almost any foreign zzso In this review, we describe the various pattern recognition receptors and processes that occur on biomedical material surfaces that permit detection of a range of materials within the zzso
