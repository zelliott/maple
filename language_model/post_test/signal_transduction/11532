zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a range of cardiovascular functions including direct effects on zzso Despite the demonstration of high numbers of AM binding sites in rat heart, the zzso responsible for cardiac AM action has not been zzso We show here that the hearts of adult and zzso rats, and zzso zzso cultures zzso zzso transcripts for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso predominated over zzso in adult zzso zzso and zzso heart zzso zzso and in zzso cultures zzso zzso though the relative abundance of these transcripts appears to be zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso element zzso reporter gene as an indirect measure of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso the AM zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso together led to an additive effect on AM zzso that was approximately zzso greater than control zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, the zzso induction of zzso activity was abolished by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that AM action in the rat zzso requires zzso and zzso to constitute functional AM zzso
