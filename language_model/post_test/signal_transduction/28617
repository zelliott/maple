The Ras zzso enriched in zzso zzso is the product of a zzso zzso gene during brain zzso zzso and the zzso zzso define a novel distinct zzso of proteins within the Ras family, characterized by an extended variable domain in the zzso terminal zzso We have carried this study because there is a complete lack of knowledge on zzso zzso We show that in zzso cells, zzso is targeted to the plasma membrane by zzso We demonstrate that about zzso of the native zzso protein is bound to zzso and this proportion is zzso by typical Ras family zzso exchange zzso However, zzso is not transforming in zzso zzso We have also examined the role of zzso in cell zzso zzso does not stimulate the zzso zzso By contrast, it binds to and activates zzso On the other hand, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso hormone, and by an activated zzso zzso zzso by a mechanism that suggests zzso of the zzso to its zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results provide the initial insights into the role in signal zzso of this novel Ras family zzso
