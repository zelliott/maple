To compete in complex microbial communities, bacteria must sense environmental changes and adjust cellular functions for optimal zzso zzso signal zzso pathways are implicated in the regulation of multiple behaviors in response to changes in the environment, including zzso patterns, zzso production, and zzso zzso In zzso zzso cell surface properties, including zzso production, are thought to play a direct role in promoting zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso suggesting an associated zzso of cell surface zzso Using atomic force zzso distinct changes in the surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso Whereas the zzso strain produces a smooth zzso zzso zzso after 24 zzso the zzso zzso zzso strains produce distinctive zzso zzso zzso Further analyses using zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparison of zzso profiles suggest that the zzso zzso differs between the zzso and the zzso zzso despite an apparent similarity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that disruption of the zzso zzso is correlated with distinctive changes in the zzso zzso which likely result from changes in surface zzso structure and/or zzso
