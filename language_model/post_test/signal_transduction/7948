zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors are the two most important zzso families in innate zzso Although it has been observed that zzso signaling can induce or zzso the expression of the zzso for zzso zzso receptors on zzso or muscle cells, there is not yet a report indicating whether zzso signaling can break down zzso through zzso zzso The present work reports that zzso signaling by zzso acid stimulation zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to express zzso acid early zzso (a zzso for zzso and to induce zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso derived from zzso zzso The blockade of interaction between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso against zzso in a zzso zzso manner and therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso destruction and acute zzso injury of small zzso These results demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso tissue injury through the zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso signaling may break down zzso through induction of abnormal expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso
