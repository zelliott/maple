The zzso zzso group is characterized by short zzso short hands and feet, stiff joint, and zzso zzso Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern zzso zzso is characterized by the presence of dislocation of zzso and has zzso dominant or zzso mode of zzso zzso is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often leading to an early zzso zzso has an zzso dominant mode of zzso distinct facial and skeleton features (a zzso voice and internal notch of the zzso zzso Finally, zzso is zzso characterized by zzso deafness, zzso zzso thickened zzso and large zzso with short and large zzso We first identified zzso in zzso zzso in the dominant form of zzso and then zzso in A zzso And zzso domain with zzso type 1 repeats 10 zzso in the zzso form of zzso The function of zzso is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between zzso and zzso We then identified zzso in zzso in the zzso form of zzso and a hotspot of zzso in zzso in the dominant form of zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso domain 5 zzso of zzso The function of zzso is zzso Using a zzso double hybrid screen, we identified zzso transforming growth zzso zzso binding protein 1 as a partner of zzso We found an increased level of active zzso in the zzso medium from patients with zzso or zzso zzso and an enhanced zzso zzso level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced zzso signaling in zzso and zzso Finally, a direct interaction between zzso and zzso was demonstrated suggesting a zzso of zzso zzso as the underlying mechanism of the short stature zzso Using zzso sequencing in zzso zzso we identified de zzso zzso zzso zzso all involving zzso zzso at position 500, in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso we found decreased zzso level of zzso and increased level of zzso supporting a stabilization of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso signal zzso through the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso We therefore studied the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso complexes and found that the complexes zzso to the zzso We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream zzso target genes supporting impaired zzso driven zzso control in zzso Our findings support a direct link between the short stature zzso and the zzso zzso However, the finding of enhanced zzso signaling in zzso zzso supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating zzso zzso
