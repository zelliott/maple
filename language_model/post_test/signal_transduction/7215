zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso regulating zzso cell zzso differentiation and proliferation in liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso gene are associated with human diseases such as zzso diabetes of the zzso Recently, zzso has also been described as a zzso gene for zzso colitis in zzso association zzso In addition, specific zzso genetic zzso have been identified in pediatric zzso of Crohn's zzso zzso obtained from knockout mice supported that zzso can protect the zzso zzso against zzso However, the exact molecular links behind zzso and inflammatory zzso diseases remains zzso In this review, we will zzso the current knowledge about the role of zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso nature of zzso zzso and zzso classes of zzso will be zzso zzso role as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso during liver inflammation will be integrated based on documented examples of the zzso zzso that can be made from these earlier liver studies will serve as a basis to extrapolate correlations and zzso zzso to zzso zzso Finally, potential functional roles for zzso zzso in protecting the zzso zzso from chronic and pathological inflammation will be zzso
