It was recently suggested that the zzso nuclear zzso zzso plays an important role in controlling the inflammation and zzso zzso associated with zzso In zzso and zzso cells, zzso acts as a zzso of the inflammatory response, suppressing zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the ability of different forms of zzso to zzso the inflammatory response in zzso zzso zzso were cultured according to standard zzso zzso differentiated zzso were zzso with 1 zzso zzso zzso for 16 zzso with or without zzso with 10 zzso of zzso zzso or full-length zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly suppressed zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso and reduced the concentration of zzso in culture zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the increase in zzso zzso in zzso exposed to zzso In culture media, the increase in zzso detected after zzso stimulation was significantly attenuated after zzso with zzso In zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso activity by 50 and zzso respectively compared to the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Moreover, both forms of zzso significantly attenuated zzso as well as zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso significantly increased zzso zzso levels, taking its expression back to the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso exert zzso activity suppressing zzso and zzso production from inflamed zzso This zzso action may be zzso through zzso of zzso activity as well as through increased zzso zzso
