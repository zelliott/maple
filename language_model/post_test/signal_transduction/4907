Wear zzso zzso loosening zzso prosthetic zzso is one of the most common causes of total joint zzso It is well established that extensive bone destruction zzso by zzso is responsible for wear zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso bone zzso should prevent wear particle induced zzso and may serve as a potential therapeutic avenue for prosthetic zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso a new zzso inhibitor zzso wear zzso zzso in a mouse zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso is partially attributed to a disruption in zzso zzso and zzso both a prerequisite for zzso bone zzso Interestingly, the zzso inhibitor also impaired zzso differentiation via the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso In conclusion, we showed that zzso affected multiple zzso processes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso of zzso bone zzso in zzso and wear zzso zzso in zzso The results of the study provide proof that the new generation zzso zzso such as zzso are potential zzso agents for treatment of zzso zzso
