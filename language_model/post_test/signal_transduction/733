zzso of zzso zzso was found in normal human and mouse skin zzso Upon zzso we observed a rapid zzso of zzso zzso and protein in wounds of zzso however, when repair continued, zzso zzso was strongly zzso and zzso protein expression peaked at late stages of zzso zzso revealed wound zzso as the cellular source of zzso In line with the in zzso situation, we found a zzso expression of zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso A marked stimulation of zzso expression in the cells was achieved with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso and two alternate zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso was completely inhibited by the specific zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso and zzso zzso 2/3 inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso might contribute to the observed zzso of zzso also in skin repair, as we found a spatial and zzso correlation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression at the wound zzso Thus, in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso also zzso expression is regulated in the process of zzso wound zzso
