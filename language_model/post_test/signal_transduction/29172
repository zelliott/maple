In zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso proteins characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with the product of the vestigial zzso zzso where the zzso functions as a master gene controlling wing formation zzso zzso The zzso zzso activates the zzso of several specific wing zzso including zzso and zzso themselves zzso zzso The zzso drives zzso progression by inducing expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso which regulates genes involved in DNA replication and zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso that is the downstream zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which controls cell proliferation and zzso in zzso We identified zzso as a partner for zzso We show that interaction between zzso and zzso increases zzso zzso activity both ex zzso in zzso zzso cells and in zzso in zzso wing discs and promotes zzso nuclear zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and that proliferation induced by zzso or by a zzso form of FAT in wing disc is significantly reduced in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is not required in all zzso zzso This indicates that zzso interaction acts in a zzso fashion and that other zzso partners must zzso
