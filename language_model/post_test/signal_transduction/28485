The zzso orientation checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso has been proposed to delay zzso transition when the zzso poles are zzso with respect to the long axis of the zzso This checkpoint is activated in the absence of either an zzso division ring or astral zzso Although the zzso could be overridden in the absence of the zzso factor zzso its zzso nature remained zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso delay depends on a subset of the zzso assembly checkpoint zzso components zzso and zzso Based on this finding and a detailed imaging of the zzso orientation process, we hypothesized that the zzso pole might contain proteins capable of sensing the achievement of zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso pole body resident zzso as a candidate zzso A targeted zzso in its central domain specifically triggered the zzso in spite of the presence of oriented zzso causing a zzso delay that could be relieved in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso might provide a link between the mechanical process of zzso alignment and the signal zzso that zzso zzso
