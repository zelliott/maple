T cell zzso is triggered by the specific recognition of zzso peptides presented by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso of zzso peptides which have a high affinity for zzso zzso Some of them induce complete T cell responses, zzso they act as zzso whereas others behave as partial zzso or even as zzso Here, we analyzed both early zzso zzso zzso and late zzso zzso signal zzso events induced by a zzso zzso or a corresponding altered zzso zzso using T cell zzso expressing or not the zzso alpha and beta zzso With a video imaging system, we showed that the zzso zzso response to an altered zzso zzso zzso the appearance of a characteristic sustained zzso zzso concentration zzso which can be detected shortly after T cell interaction with zzso zzso We also provide evidence that the same altered zzso zzso can be seen either as an zzso or a partial zzso depending on the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expressed at the T cell zzso
