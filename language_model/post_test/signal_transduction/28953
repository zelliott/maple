Early during infection, zzso targets zzso cells zzso and alters their zzso zzso we show that zzso DC maintain the ability to present both zzso and zzso zzso but that they actively induce tolerance or zzso in zzso T zzso zzso accomplishes this by selectively maintaining high-level expression of the negative zzso zzso programmed death zzso zzso while zzso zzso positive zzso molecules and zzso on the DC zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells activated by these infected DC have a stunted zzso characterized by poor zzso zzso zzso and recall zzso zzso zzso but not zzso during direct zzso of zzso T cells by infected DC significantly restores zzso T cell zzso Using systems where direct and zzso of T cells can be distinguished revealed that zzso signaling contributes only when zzso T cells are primed directly by infected DC, and not upon zzso of viral zzso by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso programs infected DC during acute infection to inhibit early host zzso zzso responses by tipping the balance between negative and positive zzso
