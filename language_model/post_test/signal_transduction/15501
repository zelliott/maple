The zzso zzso checkpoint monitors proper bipolar attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso Previously, depletion of the novel zzso complex zzso was found to induce a zzso zzso By using zzso we identified zzso predicted to associate with zzso Recently, three laboratories independently zzso zzso as an additional zzso complex zzso and therefore we adopted the name zzso We found that cells depleted of zzso by zzso achieve zzso alignment but fail to silence the zzso checkpoint or enter zzso After hours of zzso arrest, zzso separate but retain robust zzso zzso zzso cells accumulate high levels of the checkpoint protein zzso at zzso zzso protein zzso at zzso in zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso which accumulates at the zzso earlier, in zzso is not dependent on zzso zzso cells show a stronger premature zzso separation zzso than those depleted of zzso We zzso that zzso functions to coordinate checkpoint signaling from the zzso binding sites within a zzso by zzso linking the individual binding zzso We suggest that this network plays a major role in zzso the zzso checkpoint when zzso are aligned at zzso to allow timely zzso onset and zzso zzso
