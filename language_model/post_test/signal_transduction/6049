T cell zzso acute rejection of transplanted organ continues to be a noticeable problem in solid organ zzso We showed that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso A resistant T cell zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso were isolated from fresh human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso A zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso of zzso zzso were added to the designated zzso in a zzso plate with zzso million zzso and cultured for 48 h and then zzso for zzso synthesis by zzso and zzso zzso In another parallel experiment we added zzso zzso zzso to stimulate the cells to check if zzso zzso of zzso synthesis is the sole reason for zzso of cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was performed in zzso (20 zzso 1 zzso zzso cells with or without zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso inhibited Con A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso proliferation at 77, 23, and zzso respectively, over controls and zzso at 5 zzso completely (nearly zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis in Con A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso zzso required for 50% zzso measured at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation was also inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso of 2 zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso at 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over control, which was inhibited by 24, 38, and zzso respectively, with zzso at final zzso of zzso 5, and 10 zzso zzso 

zzso has profound zzso effects zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso of human zzso This effect may be zzso via zzso zzso
