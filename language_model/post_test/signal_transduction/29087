There is accumulating evidence that zzso target of zzso zzso pathways play important roles in cell growth and survival of zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated in zzso transformed cells and that zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso abrogates such zzso We now provide evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism by which zzso promotes cell zzso involving zzso zzso suppression of expression of programmed cell death 4 zzso a tumor zzso protein that acts as an inhibitor of zzso translation by blocking the translation initiation factor zzso Our data also establish that second generation zzso zzso zzso block zzso of zzso zzso and downstream engagement of the zzso zzso protein in zzso transformed zzso Moreover, zzso protein expression is zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism for the generation of the zzso effects of such zzso zzso of zzso expression results in reversal of the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso colony formation, suggesting an important role for this protein in the generation of zzso zzso Altogether, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which zzso may promote zzso cell growth, involving sequential engagement of the zzso zzso zzso and downstream suppression of zzso zzso
