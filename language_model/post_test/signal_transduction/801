zzso results in cell shrinkage and zzso zzso processes opposed by the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso which zzso zzso to cortical zzso zzso to regulate cell shape, zzso zzso and resistance to zzso We zzso that zzso stress activates zzso zzso exchange, and zzso interaction is required for cell survival zzso zzso stimuli induced zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso expression rescued zzso cells from zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso When cells were subjected to zzso stress, zzso and zzso zzso physically associated within the zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and cell survival were inhibited in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso with defective binding to zzso zzso an upstream regulator of zzso We conclude that zzso promotes cell survival by dual zzso by defending cell volume and zzso through zzso exchange and by functioning as a scaffold for recruitment of a zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso
