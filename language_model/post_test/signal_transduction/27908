zzso surface zzso influences zzso zzso zzso and local factor zzso Moreover, the responsiveness of zzso to systemic hormones such as 1, zzso is altered by the effects of surface zzso on the zzso zzso surfaces the effects of zzso and 1, zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in zzso the effects of surface zzso on the cells, as well as in the response to zzso However, it is not yet known through which signaling pathways surface zzso exerts its effects on the response of zzso to 1, zzso The present study examined the potential role of protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso in this zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells were cultured on zzso disks with zzso values of zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by adding zzso to the cultures; similarly, zzso was inhibited with zzso or activated with zzso and zzso was inhibited with zzso zzso or zzso were included in the culture media through the entire culture period or for the last 24 h of zzso In addition, cultures were treated for 24 h with zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso The effects on cell number and alkaline zzso specific activity were determined after 24 zzso zzso activity was determined after 9 zzso and at 24 zzso Cell number was reduced on rough surfaces, and alkaline zzso activity was zzso zzso had a synergistic effect with surface zzso on alkaline zzso However, neither surface zzso nor zzso had an effect on zzso zzso treatment for 24 h inhibited cell number and alkaline zzso on all zzso however, when it was present throughout the culture period, the zzso inhibitor had no effect on cell number, but decreased alkaline zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect on cell number and alkaline zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and alkaline zzso on all surfaces and further reduced the zzso decreases in both zzso zzso had no effect when applied for 24 h and did not modify the zzso zzso however, when present throughout the culture period, it caused a decrease in proliferation and an increase in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso only inhibited cell proliferation when it was present throughout the entire culture zzso However, it decreased alkaline zzso in cultures treated for 24 zzso but increased zzso activity when it was present for the entire culture zzso The results indicate that surface zzso and zzso both mediate their effects through zzso which zzso the zzso step in zzso zzso Further zzso zzso activates zzso Surface zzso effects are also zzso through zzso but only after the cells have reached zzso and are undergoing zzso zzso The effect of surface zzso on responsiveness to zzso is zzso through zzso and not through zzso
