zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso is used traditionally for the treatment of headache, bronchitis, and nervous systems disorders including zzso 

To investigate the zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso extract zzso and the involvement of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso was evaluated through behavioral despair in forced swimming test zzso and tail suspension test zzso Swiss zzso mice were treated by oral route and after zzso were analyzed the time of zzso in the zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso against zzso zzso was evaluate through cell viability of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso were investigated by western zzso 

The zzso time in the zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso in the zzso was prevented by the zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso dose of zzso produced a synergistic zzso effect with zzso (an zzso of zzso zzso zzso blue, zzso (an inhibitor of NO zzso or zzso (an inhibitor of soluble zzso zzso In ex zzso experiments, zzso with zzso prevented the loss of cell viability induced by zzso thus zzso zzso zzso toxicity caused a decreased zzso zzso and an increased zzso zzso 

The present study provides convincing evidence of zzso and the involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso could be of potential interest for the treatment of depressive disorders and neurological conditions associated with zzso zzso
