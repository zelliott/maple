zzso are the primary zzso agent in causing zzso of domestic sheep in the whole world and, at the same time, it is an important tool for forensic zzso Surprisingly, and in contrast to its importance, almost no data regarding the zzso and molecular markers are known for this zzso In this report, we present a detailed description of the blowfly Lucilia zzso zzso and of zzso disc zzso The zzso of Lucilia strongly resembles that of zzso despite their apparent size zzso Moreover, zzso disc development appears to be equally well zzso Through zzso zzso and functional studies, we show that the Lucilia zzso zzso protein is highly zzso between the two zzso We further show that zzso are established in zzso however, zzso expression shows a more dynamic expression pattern than expected in comparison to zzso zzso of Lucilia zzso in zzso shows zzso wing zzso suggesting that Lucilia zzso blocks the zzso activity of zzso zzso Upon injection of zzso zzso we observe a zzso of zzso zzso closely resembling that of zzso Due to the large size of the zzso the distance over which zzso exerts zzso activity is up to three times larger than in zzso yet the consequences are very zzso Our data demonstrate long-range wingless signaling mechanisms adapted for patterning large zzso of naked zzso and suggest signaling properties of Lucilia zzso that are distinct from those of zzso zzso
