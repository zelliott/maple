The zzso protein zzso a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family of zzso zzso plays important roles in many fundamental cellular processes as well as the zzso of many zzso In this work, we have applied the zzso zzso microscopic method to study lateral mobility change of zzso on zzso by imaging and tracking individual zzso zzso molecules on the membrane of living zzso The single zzso molecules displayed different diffusion rates and zzso It was interesting to find that the mobility of zzso increased upon stimulation by zzso zzso the specific zzso of zzso The faster diffusion was related to the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso The results provided new information for the understanding of zzso zzso and molecular mechanism of signal zzso through zzso zzso
