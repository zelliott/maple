zzso D zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso both play a role in zzso plant responses to zzso acid zzso In this article, we show that zzso alpha 1 and its product, zzso acid zzso regulate a zzso zzso which is a negative regulator of zzso responses in zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha zzso plants lose more water than do zzso zzso The zzso closure of zzso alpha zzso leaves is insensitive to zzso but is promoted by zzso zzso treatment promotes an increase in PA from zzso in wild type but not in zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso PA binds to zzso the zzso binding is demonstrated by zzso PA with zzso from plant cells, measuring binding of PA from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso bound to PA immobilized on a zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses show that zzso 73 in zzso is essential for zzso zzso PA binding decreases the zzso activity of zzso The lack of zzso production of PA in zzso alpha zzso cells results in a decrease in the association of zzso with the plasma membrane in response to zzso These results indicate that PA produced by zzso alpha 1 zzso the function of the negative regulator zzso thus promoting zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a direct target of the zzso zzso PA provides a functional link between the two families of important signaling zzso zzso and zzso
