The principal effect of zzso on zzso cells is its stimulation of zzso zzso Previous reports indicated the significance of the zzso zzso loop in the zzso of zzso In this study, we focused on zzso and zzso principal molecules in the negative regulation of zzso zzso to further understand the zzso zzso loop in zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso levels compared with normal zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso formed a complex with the zzso zzso and the zzso effect of zzso on the promoter activity of human zzso collagen and zzso was completely impaired in zzso zzso Furthermore, the protein stability of zzso zzso type I was significantly increased in zzso zzso compared with normal zzso There was no significant difference in zzso and zzso levels between normal and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso did not affect zzso zzso type I protein levels in zzso zzso These results indicate that the impaired zzso zzso effect on zzso signaling might contribute to maintaining the zzso zzso loop in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a disturbed negative regulation of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
