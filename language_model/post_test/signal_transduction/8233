More than a quarter of the world's population is infected with zzso zzso and more than a hundred species of zzso are zzso of humans zzso Despite extensive morbidity and mortality caused by zzso zzso the biological mechanisms of zzso interactions are poorly zzso largely because of the lack of genetically zzso model zzso We have demonstrated that the insect zzso zzso zzso zzso its bacterial zzso zzso zzso and the fruit fly zzso zzso constitute a zzso model for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that zzso juveniles zzso of zzso which contain zzso in their gut, can zzso and kill zzso zzso We show that infection activates an immune response in zzso that results in the temporally dynamic expression of a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this immune response is induced specifically by zzso We also investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso recovery, the zzso process that occurs in zzso zzso upon host invasion and that is necessary for successful zzso We find that the zzso zzso and signaling pathways that control zzso recovery in zzso zzso also control zzso recovery in zzso suggesting conservation of these zzso processes across zzso and zzso zzso
