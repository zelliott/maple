Recently, a phase II clinical trial in zzso zzso zzso has suggested that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso is feasible and side effects are zzso However, zzso experimental data explaining the interaction zzso are zzso Our objective is to investigate the zzso efficacy and mechanism of combined zzso and zzso therapy in zzso in zzso cell lines zzso and zzso 

Drug effects on cell proliferation were evaluated by cell viability zzso zzso analyses were conducted according to the zzso zzso Cell cycle distribution was measured by flow zzso zzso levels of proteins related to the zzso and zzso pathways and to cell cycle progression zzso zzso were determined by western zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso alone or in combination showed significant efficacy in zzso cell proliferation in both cell lines zzso However, a zzso combined effect, associated with the order of compound treatments, was zzso zzso was synergistic with zzso zzso followed by zzso but it was zzso with the reverse treatment zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in the half zzso concentration zzso of zzso in both cell zzso zzso induced zzso arrest and significantly decreased the proportion of cells in S phase when zzso alone or followed by zzso The zzso and zzso pathways were blocked and zzso D1 expression was down regulated significantly in both cell lines by zzso zzso the zzso pathways were hardly affected by zzso and zzso D1 expression was up zzso 

zzso activity of zzso and zzso alone or in zzso is seen in zzso cell zzso The nature of the combined effects, however, depends on the particular cell line and treatment order of the two zzso zzso appears to reduce sensitivity to zzso through down regulation of zzso D1 expression by zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in zzso arrest and reduction of the zzso cell zzso when zzso is zzso after zzso in which situation, combination treatment of the two agents results in zzso on the other hand, when zzso is zzso afterward, it can continue to work since it is not cell cycle specific, as a result, combination treatment of the two agents shows an zzso zzso
