Since transforming growing zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso negative regulators of zzso signaling are likely also important regulators of the zzso differentiation zzso One such negative regulator, zzso is an zzso that is known to inhibit zzso signaling via its interaction with zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso zzso to the DNA binding zzso Based on this, we hypothesized that Ski zzso zzso signaling and zzso maturation in zzso via recruitment of zzso to zzso complexes containing zzso We tested this hypothesis in chick upper zzso zzso zzso where gain and loss of Ski expression experiments were zzso zzso of Ski not only reversed the zzso effect of zzso on the expression of zzso marker genes such as type X collagen zzso and zzso it induced these genes zzso as zzso zzso zzso of Ski by zzso interference led to a reduction of zzso and zzso expression under zzso zzso Furthermore, Ski blocked zzso induction of zzso and caused a zzso zzso of zzso consistent with the observed acceleration of zzso Regarding zzso not only does Ski associate with zzso and 3, but its association with zzso is required for recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso this recruitment of zzso in the zzso effects of Ski in zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso reversed the zzso of zzso and zzso in Ski zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso which involves its association with zzso and recruitment of zzso and 5, leads to accelerated zzso zzso
