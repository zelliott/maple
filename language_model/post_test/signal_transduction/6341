zzso protein zzso zzso are important zzso in the signal zzso pathways involved in zzso dysfunction following cerebral zzso zzso One zzso zzso regulated zzso 1/2, has been heavily implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, the contribution of zzso regulated zzso 1/2 to zzso damage following deep zzso circulatory arrest and low flow zzso bypass is zzso We attempted to correlate the extent of zzso damage present following deep zzso circulatory arrest and low flow zzso bypass with zzso zzso regulated zzso 1/2 expression in the cerebral vascular zzso 

zzso underwent normal flow zzso bypass zzso deep zzso circulatory arrest zzso and low flow zzso bypass zzso zzso were harvested following 24 h of zzso bypass zzso zzso cortical watershed zones, zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso A section of zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso with rabbit zzso zzso against zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso bypass controls, the deep zzso circulatory arrest and low flow zzso bypass zzso exhibited diffuse zzso changes with overlapping severity and zzso zzso zzso damage occurred in the frontal watershed zones and zzso zzso of the deep zzso circulatory arrest group zzso No zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso was found in the zzso bypass zzso however, zzso 1/2 zzso was present in the cerebral vascular zzso of the deep zzso circulatory arrest and low flow zzso bypass zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso regulated zzso 1/2 may play a prominent role in early cerebral zzso injury and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso regulated zzso 1/2 represents a new and exciting opportunity for the zzso of cerebral tolerance to low flow zzso bypass and deep zzso circulatory zzso
