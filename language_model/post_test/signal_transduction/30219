In this paper, we will provide evidence of the putative molecular signals and zzso events that mediate the formation of long-lasting zzso memory zzso When an animal drinks a novel taste (the zzso zzso zzso and it is later associated with malaise zzso zzso zzso the animal will reject it in the next zzso developing a long-lasting taste zzso zzso the taste cue becomes an aversive zzso and this is referred to as conditioning taste zzso Different evidence indicates that the novel stimulus zzso zzso a rapid and strong cortical zzso activity that decreases when the stimulus becomes familiar after several zzso zzso zzso via zzso receptors zzso a series of zzso events leading to plastic changes that could be related to zzso and/or long-term memory zzso zzso Such plastic changes facilitate the incoming US signals carried out by, in part, the zzso release induced by the zzso Altogether, these events could produce the cellular changes related to the switch from safe to aversive taste memory zzso A proposed working model to explain the zzso sequence of signals during taste memory formation will be zzso
