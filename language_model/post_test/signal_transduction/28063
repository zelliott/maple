Many tumor zzso favor the hypothesis that optimal zzso activity is zzso by type 1 zzso and zzso T cells, and that the production of type 2 zzso T cells may be counterproductive for effective zzso zzso Since zzso or zzso mice lack the signal zzso and zzso of zzso protein and are unable to transmit signals initiated by the type 2 zzso zzso and zzso they have been studied to confirm the zzso vs zzso zzso Using zzso tumor cells that cause primary solid tumors and zzso disease, as well as a spontaneous transgenic tumor model, multiple studies have demonstrated that zzso mice are able to reject or delay primary tumor growth, prevent recurrence of primary tumors, and/or reject established, spontaneous zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso therefore, provides significantly enhanced zzso zzso experiments with zzso mice, which lack zzso cells and hence are deficient for zzso give similar results and suggest that removal of zzso cells also enhances zzso Because immunity is enhanced in the absence of zzso or zzso it has been hypothesized that these deletions result in the removal of an inhibitor that blocks zzso zzso Several mechanisms have been tested as potential zzso including zzso T regulatory cells, zzso a zzso shift, and zzso zzso zzso Although the first three mechanisms do not appear to be relevant, zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso mice may be responsible for enhanced zzso Although additional studies are clearly needed to clarify the zzso underlying improved zzso immunity in zzso and zzso mice, deletion of these genes results in a potent zzso immunity and may be a basis for an zzso zzso
