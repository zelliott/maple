The zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that exhibits strong zzso activity against various zzso zzso zzso and a zzso and zzso 10 zzso zzso functions as a tumor zzso by zzso migration, invasion, and zzso However, whether zzso can zzso the zzso zzso of cancer cells is not zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso in gastric cancer cells and is further reduced in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of the expression of zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso and the cancer stem cell marker zzso Treatment of zzso (a zzso zzso or zzso (a zzso inhibitor of zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso converting zzso and zzso reduces zzso shedding and zzso which results in zzso of zzso genes and zzso Our data show that zzso and zzso are zzso down by zzso suggesting a physical interaction between zzso and zzso on cell zzso In addition, zzso suppresses sphere formation and sphere size of zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso domain zzso or zzso effectively reverse the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, zzso reduces zzso activity of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells increases zzso and zzso expression and sphere forming zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso properties by zzso zzso zzso shedding and zzso
