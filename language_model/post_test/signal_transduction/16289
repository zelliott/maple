zzso zzso is an important zzso marker in determining resistance to zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to clarify whether not only zzso related zzso pathways but also other zzso pathways are altered in patients with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso we examined the differences in the gene expression signatures between zzso with and without zzso zzso 

zzso and thirteen patients who underwent a surgical zzso of a primary zzso were zzso zzso zzso status was determined using the zzso zzso Acid zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profiles were compared between zzso with and without zzso zzso using the Human Genome zzso array zzso 

Among 113 zzso zzso zzso were present in 35 zzso zzso We identified 30 genes zzso that were zzso expressed between zzso with and without zzso zzso zzso Discovery Rate zzso zzso by which we were able to predict the zzso status with an accuracy of zzso Thirty discriminating genes included zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso domain containing 3 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These genes were related to not only zzso related zzso zzso but also to other zzso zzso such as the zzso pathway, the zzso B zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso exhibited a distinct gene expression signature different from zzso zzso zzso Using human zzso samples, we were able to show that there is zzso between the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso These results are necessary to be taken into account in establishing zzso strategies for patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso
