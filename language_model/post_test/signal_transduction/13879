Gene promoters perceive numerous signals and integrate this information into a single response, the zzso activity of a zzso It was speculated that zzso modification of zzso on the promoters might have an important function in storage and integration of zzso Using the genes for the core proteins of C4 metabolism in zzso as a model, we associated the perception of specific signals with the establishment of individual zzso zzso Core elements of the zzso code defined in these studies are zzso on all C4 genes and on other zzso genes that respond to similar zzso Moreover, the code is used in independent C4 zzso However, our data also advise caution because interpretation of zzso modifications might differ dependent on the promoter position of the zzso The model provided here constitutes a starting point for zzso decoding of zzso pairs in zzso gene zzso
