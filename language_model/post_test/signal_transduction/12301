Several studies have suggested that the zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso have an important protective effect on zzso cancer, and this could be at least partly due to their zzso zzso It is zzso however, how this phenomenon is triggered and what mechanisms are zzso Here, we show that both zzso and zzso have an important zzso effect on zzso cancer cells with different molecular zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso is zzso dependent, and both intrinsic and zzso pathways are zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and the subsequent release of zzso c and zzso to the zzso evidence the zzso of the intrinsic zzso The implication of the zzso zzso is shown by the zzso of zzso along with the zzso of zzso The timing of zzso zzso and the zzso of Bid with zzso suggest a zzso with the intrinsic zzso None of the death receptors that commonly initiate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found to be responsible for triggering the zzso cascade induced by zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso two likely candidates to regulate this process, play a significant zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso of two key regulatory elements of the zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso respectively, is zzso in the induction of zzso by zzso and zzso These fatty acids could potentially be useful zzso zzso agents in combination with other zzso zzso
