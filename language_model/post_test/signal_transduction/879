zzso play a fundamental role in cell differentiation and zzso zzso A signaling is zzso through a combination of zzso type II receptors zzso and the zzso type zzso zzso zzso Signaling receptors of other zzso zzso remain to be zzso Here, we found that zzso AB and zzso B are zzso for zzso zzso is an orphan zzso zzso zzso expressed in neuroendocrine zzso including pancreatic zzso The combination of zzso and zzso preferred by zzso AB and zzso B but not by zzso A, is responsible for zzso zzso of insulin from pancreatic beta cell line, zzso In contrast, all zzso activate a combination of zzso and zzso with various levels of zzso Thus, variation in zzso signaling through type I receptors is dependent upon zzso and zzso assembly of zzso zzso Thus, the differential combination of zzso zzso mediates variation in zzso zzso zzso
