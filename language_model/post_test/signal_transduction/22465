Several different types of tumors, benign and zzso have been identified in the central nervous system zzso The zzso for these tumors are related to several factors, such as the age of the patient and the location and zzso of the zzso In adults, about half of all zzso tumors are zzso whereas in pediatric patients, more than zzso are zzso For most benign zzso tumors that require treatment, zzso can offer zzso zzso or at least provide significant relief from mass zzso Unfortunately, we still lack effective treatments for most primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso However, the past decade has witnessed an explosion in the understanding of the early molecular events in zzso primary zzso tumors, and for the first time in history, zzso are seeing that a plethora of new therapies targeting these molecular events are being tested in clinical zzso There is hope on the horizon for the fight against these deadly zzso The distribution of zzso tumors by location has remained constant for numerous zzso The majority of primary zzso tumors arise in the major cortical zzso Twenty nine percent of primary zzso tumors arise from the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso The vast majority of these are zzso of which over zzso are zzso About zzso of primary zzso tumors are found in the zzso zzso region, where the zzso zzso zzso Other much less common sites of primary zzso tumors include the zzso region, zzso system, zzso brain zzso zzso nerves, and spinal zzso The distribution of zzso tumors by zzso has seen a slight increase in more zzso tumors over the past decade, possibly due to increased zzso practices or environmental zzso zzso from zzso cells, zzso represent over zzso of all primary zzso tumors and consist of zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso and zzso zzso The benign zzso make up zzso of primary zzso tumors, followed by nerve sheath tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors, and zzso are zzso The most common zzso are zzso and these tumors are typically classified by the World Health Organization zzso as zzso I through zzso Grade IV, the most zzso grade of zzso includes zzso zzso zzso the most common zzso primary zzso zzso in adults, which represents 51% of all zzso zzso zzso is zzso the most challenging to effectively treat and has the worst patient zzso This chapter is therefore primarily devoted to the current understanding of this zzso Here we describe the molecular and cellular events associated with zzso zzso initiation and zzso We also review the importance of zzso stem cell biology and tumor zzso in early zzso In addition, we present a brief description of the most common zzso primary zzso zzso in pediatric patients - zzso as well as familial cancer syndromes that include zzso as part of the zzso
