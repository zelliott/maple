zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso display a transformed zzso and do not undergo zzso differentiation or the associated zzso To determine the zzso induced by zzso a zzso active zzso with enhanced zzso exchange activity rather than impaired zzso zzso activity, zzso cell lines were established that zzso express zzso at levels of zzso comparable to the zzso zzso These zzso zzso cell lines do not possess a transformed zzso and while differentiation and zzso are impaired, these processes are not zzso as in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, while expression of either zzso or zzso results in zzso signaling through zzso only cells expressing zzso additionally possess zzso signaling through zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is not responsible for the impaired differentiation or zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that a zzso distinct from those that signals through zzso zzso or zzso is responsible for the impaired differentiation and zzso in zzso skeletal zzso expressing zzso active zzso
