zzso changes in the short-term electrical properties of zzso were investigated in the anterior zzso (AP) cell of zzso Imaging studies revealed that zzso zzso spikes and zzso evoked zzso caused zzso entry through zzso zzso channels that are distributed throughout the zzso zzso recordings from the zzso revealed a zzso outward current that was reduced when zzso entry was blocked with zzso or when the zzso concentration of free zzso was reduced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso released in the zzso from a zzso zzso compound caused a zzso of the membrane zzso These data imply that the zzso cell expresses zzso zzso zzso and that these zzso are present in the zzso When the zzso zzso current was reduced through the block of zzso entry, zzso zzso spikes and zzso evoked zzso increased in zzso zzso the zzso changes in the zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso participate in the regulation of zzso signal zzso
