zzso zzso 1 zzso has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for unspecified subset of lung zzso zzso reportedly mediates zzso signaling by zzso zzso and zzso However, we observed that zzso zzso also decreased viability of cells expressing zzso active zzso and zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso zzso level was not reduced after zzso zzso in zzso lung cancer cells, implicating that zzso mediates unknown survival zzso To gain better insight into zzso survival zzso we searched for altered zzso using mass zzso following zzso zzso zzso In total, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso of which 385 proteins zzso zzso were affected after zzso zzso A view of the altered network identified a central role of zzso zzso 1 zzso and known zzso zzso We found that zzso directly zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was induced at zzso and loss of zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso Furthermore, lung cancer cell sensitivity to zzso was highly correlated with sensitivity to pharmacological zzso zzso We additionally found that zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso at zzso zzso was associated with poor outcome in lung cancer, and loss of zzso caused growth zzso and zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso These results collectively revealed zzso as a zzso regulator through zzso of zzso and also suggested zzso as a putative zzso downstream zzso involved in lung cancer cell zzso
