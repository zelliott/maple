zzso was found to increase zzso to zzso the lifespan of male and female zzso mice most likely by reducing the increase in the hazard for mortality zzso the rate of zzso term in the zzso mortality zzso To identify the pathways that could be responsible for zzso longevity effect, we analyzed the zzso of liver from zzso male and female mice fed zzso starting at 4 months of zzso Few changes zzso zzso were observed in zzso of zzso zzso however, a large number of transcripts zzso changed significantly in zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso the male mice fed zzso were found to segregate into two groups: one group that is almost identical to control males zzso and a second group zzso that shows a change in gene expression zzso zzso with more than zzso of the genes shared with female mice fed zzso Using ingenuity zzso analysis, 13 pathways were significantly altered in both zzso males and zzso females with zzso function as the most significantly changed zzso Our findings show that zzso has a major effect on the zzso and point to several pathways that would likely impact the zzso
