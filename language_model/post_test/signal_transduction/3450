To understand how integration of multiple data types can help decipher cellular responses at the systems level, we analyzed the zzso response of human zzso zzso cells to zzso growth factor zzso using whole zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and large-scale western blots with over 1000 zzso A time course analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of zzso genes and zzso zzso including protein zzso changes measured by western zzso zzso of these disparate data types showed that each contributed zzso different components to the observed cell response to zzso and that varying degrees of zzso in gene expression and protein abundance zzso could be linked to specific biological zzso Networks zzso from individual data types were relatively zzso whereas networks derived from the integrated data zzso the known major cellular responses to zzso and exhibited more highly connected signaling zzso than networks derived from any individual zzso While cell cycle regulatory pathways were altered as anticipated, we found the most robust response to zzso zzso of zzso was induction of zzso zzso zzso highlighting the importance of the zzso system as a regulator of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the value of zzso multiple levels of biological information to more accurately reconstruct networks of cellular zzso
