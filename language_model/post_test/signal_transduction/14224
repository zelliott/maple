We performed a zzso interaction analysis using families from an zzso coronary artery disease cohort zzso This analysis was focused on zzso and expanding results from previous studies implicating single zzso zzso zzso on zzso 3 in zzso coronary artery zzso We analyzed 430 zzso on zzso 3 and identified 16 zzso that showed a zzso interaction at P zzso zzso using association in the presence of zzso subset analysis, a method that uses permutations of the data to zzso estimate the strength of the association zzso Seven of the 16 zzso were in the zzso zzso indicating a zzso enrichment for this zzso A zzso of zzso interactions in three independent studies revealed that zzso in zzso had a zzso combined P value of zzso for the interaction with zzso In a zzso zzso zzso had a P value of zzso Finally, a zzso analysis of the association results using zzso revealed several enriched pathways including the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso as defined by the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso
