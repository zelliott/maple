Both zzso analyses of zzso zzso and the development of pharmacological zzso of zzso receptors currently suffer from the lack of an zzso to measure zzso binding and the response of these interactions to zzso Indeed, zzso compounds have failed in the clinic because of secondary side effects resulting from zzso zzso Here, we have expressed zzso and zzso pairs in living cells and zzso their association using zzso lifetime imaging zzso zzso to measure zzso resonance energy transfer zzso Association of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was dependent on both the zzso and zzso zzso state, and was sensitive to zzso with small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An adaptation of the zzso revealed the zzso activity of these small zzso thus demonstrating that these compounds may induce secondary effects in zzso via zzso zzso This study provides insight into the dependence of the activity of small zzso zzso compounds upon zzso zzso and provides a novel quantitative zzso for the validation of potential zzso zzso
