The zzso family of membrane proteins has been implicated in both zzso and zzso zzso I, a protein containing two tandem C2 zzso (the zzso and the zzso in its zzso tail, is involved in regulated zzso of synaptic zzso as well as zzso zzso A related family member, zzso zzso is involved in multiple forms of regulated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In this study we show that the zzso C2 zzso in zzso zzso contain unique zzso signals and regulators of these zzso The zzso portion of the zzso is zzso in much the same way as the corresponding region of zzso zzso This signal is zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso contains an unusual zzso signal that is not seen in the zzso of zzso zzso This signal is not based on the zzso zzso in its zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso domain is both zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the zzso domain of zzso zzso contains an zzso motif that prevents zzso zzso trafficking of zzso zzso is thus governed by these two zzso zzso signals, which are concealed by zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zzso is regulated in this way to allow it to couple the processes of regulated zzso and zzso zzso
