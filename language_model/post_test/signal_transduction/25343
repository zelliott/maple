zzso are highly polarized cells with extensive zzso zzso to accommodate diverse local zzso Information flows between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as between the zzso and the nerve zzso It is critical that a zzso controls efficient molecular zzso through its zzso But this is extremely challenging to study because of the long distance molecules must travel through zzso and the apparent contextual difference in the zzso various local zzso which should not be examined in zzso zzso the action in zzso of zzso neurotransmitter receptors such as zzso receptors has been hindered by the lack of information on the control of molecular flow between such various zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have uncovered new transport systems other than the classical zzso transport in zzso particularly those utilizing various zzso containing certain zzso including zzso zzso Through integrated approaches exploiting various experimental systems, tools, and zzso studies have provided solid evidence for functional roles of specific zzso zzso in several biological processes crucial for the survival and function of zzso These include zzso transport of zzso stress response, and local zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model, studies have also revealed a novel zzso function of zzso in zzso growth zzso zzso outgrowth during a critical period of development, which requires specific zzso zzso untranslated sequences that direct zzso and temporally specific expression of zzso
