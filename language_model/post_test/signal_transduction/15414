The zzso gene encodes protein zzso During embryonic development, it is highly expressed in the zzso tract zzso zzso cushions of the developing heart, which give rise to several structures of the mature heart including the zzso zzso zzso was previously implicated in zzso zzso cancer zzso and tooth and bone development, but its role in cardiac zzso development is zzso To zzso the role that zzso plays in the developing heart we analyzed cardiac zzso zzso in mice after deletion of the zzso zzso We found that lack of zzso in the embryonic zzso leads to zzso expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso in the zzso zzso cushions of the zzso This resulted in suppression of zzso zzso strong induction of the central zzso regulator of zzso cell fate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso a default zzso program in the zzso cushion zzso and promotes differentiation along a zzso zzso Lack of zzso causes zzso of the zzso potential of zzso zzso cells, calcium deposition, and zzso zzso valve zzso These results establish zzso as a key regulator of zzso zzso cushion zzso cell fate during embryonic zzso
