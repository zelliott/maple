zzso hormone I zzso I) needs zzso zzso for its zzso action on zzso zzso in locust fat body in zzso zzso reduces this zzso effect significantly, indicating that for a major part, hormone action also requires the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Using zzso zzso was shown to stimulate both the influx and the zzso of zzso zzso also enhances the influx of zzso zzso into the fat body cells, indicating that the stimulating effect of zzso on zzso influx may be zzso through depletion of zzso zzso stores as zzso zzso is known to enhance zzso levels in locust fat zzso We show that zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso both in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso The present data are discussed in an attempt to zzso further the mechanism underlying zzso of the hormonal signal in locust fat zzso
