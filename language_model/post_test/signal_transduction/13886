Variations in T cell zzso zzso signal strength, as indicated by differential zzso of downstream signaling zzso determine the fate of zzso T cells after encounter with zzso zzso signals favor differentiation into regulatory T zzso cells containing the zzso factor zzso whereas zzso signals favor generation of zzso T helper zzso zzso We constructed a logic circuit model of zzso signaling zzso a major feature of which is an incoherent zzso loop involving both zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso by zzso target of zzso zzso leading to the transient appearance of zzso cells under zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed this behavior and the prediction that the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso could generate zzso cells even during continued zzso zzso We predicted that sustained zzso activity could suppress zzso expression upon zzso zzso suggesting a possible mechanism for the zzso observed instability of zzso zzso Our model predicted, and experiments confirmed, that transient stimulation of cells with high-dose zzso generated zzso zzso and zzso cells in proportions depending on the duration of zzso zzso Experimental analysis of cells after zzso removal identified three populations that correlated with these T cell zzso Further analysis of simulations implicated a negative feedback loop involving zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in determining zzso These results suggest that there is a critical time after zzso stimulation during which zzso in the zzso population of cells leads to increased plasticity of cell zzso
