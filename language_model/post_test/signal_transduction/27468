zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso a process that releases soluble zzso derivatives zzso into the zzso space, is zzso by the zzso of zzso receptors coupled to zzso zzso The zzso pathways involved in the release process exhibit both protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso components zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The possibility that zzso in zzso zzso concentration initiate the zzso zzso release of zzso was examined in human embryonic kidney cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C with the zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso release of zzso by zzso zzso as shown zzso The residual response was further zzso in an additive manner, by the zzso zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso both the release of zzso and the zzso zzso of several zzso one of which was identified as zzso a component of focal zzso The effects of zzso on zzso release and on protein zzso zzso were zzso and occurred over similar concentration zzso both effects were inhibited only partly by zzso zzso but were abolished by zzso or by zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso in zzso zzso levels elicit zzso release via increased zzso zzso Part of the increase in zzso release evoked by zzso zzso zzso might be attributable to a similar zzso
