Physical activity is known to increase insulin action in skeletal muscle, and data have indicated that zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in the molecular mechanisms behind this beneficial zzso zzso zzso can be used as a pharmacological tool to zzso activate zzso and the objective of this study was to explore whether the increase in zzso zzso zzso after either long-term exercise or chronic zzso administration was followed by zzso changes in insulin signaling and/or changes in zzso zzso zzso rats were allocated into three groups: an exercise group trained on treadmill for 5 days, an zzso group exposed to daily subcutaneous injections of zzso and a sedentary control zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso expression were determined in muscles characterized by different fiber type zzso Both exercised and zzso animals displayed a zzso increase in zzso transport with the most marked increase in muscles with a high content of type zzso zzso This increase was accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso signaling as assessed by zzso zzso and zzso activity was enhanced only after zzso administration and in a zzso zzso In conclusion, chronic zzso administration and long-term exercise both improve zzso zzso transport in skeletal muscle in a zzso way, and this is associated with an increase in zzso zzso
