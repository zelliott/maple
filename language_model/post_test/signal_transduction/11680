It is generally accepted that zzso occurs in human zzso through the late zzso to zzso zzso We found that zzso expression showed a zzso pattern, zzso during the late zzso zzso The decreased zzso in human zzso zzso cells during the zzso phase was consistent with the appearance of zzso cells during the same zzso The expression patterns of both zzso and zzso in zzso cells were similar to that observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be candidates for zzso zzso factors in the human zzso In contrast to zzso both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells were zzso throughout the zzso zzso In particular, zzso cells showed the most intense expression of zzso zzso from the zzso to zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso and -9 were higher from the zzso to zzso zzso than during the zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso zzso in zzso cells may be promoted by the binding of several zzso molecules to zzso promoter, and the translated zzso blocks the release of zzso c from zzso to the zzso during the zzso zzso During the zzso phase, zzso cells may undergo zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso
