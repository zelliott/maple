The exact mean time between encounters of a given particle in a system consisting of many particles undergoing random walks in discrete time is zzso on both regular and complex zzso zzso results are obtained both for independent zzso where any number of zzso can occupy the same site, and for zzso with an exclusion interaction, when no site can contain more than one zzso These zzso results are then compared with zzso simulations, showing very good zzso
