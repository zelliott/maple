zzso is one of the most aggressive types of human cancer, with zzso and fatal recurrence even after zzso intervention, for which cancer zzso cells zzso are now being held zzso Our recent findings indicated that zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways effectively promotes the commitment of zzso zzso to differentiation and thereby suppresses their zzso However, the mechanism by which these two signaling pathways are coordinated to regulate differentiation and zzso remains zzso Here, we identified zzso a common zzso target for zzso and zzso as a key zzso factor that zzso the signals from these zzso zzso blockade of both the pathways caused nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso more efficiently than blockade of either alone, and promoted differentiation of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of a zzso active zzso zzso lacking zzso sites for both zzso and zzso was sufficient to induce differentiation and reduce zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play a pivotal role in the control of differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso signaling zzso and also imply that developing methods targeting effective zzso zzso could be a potential approach to the treatment of zzso
