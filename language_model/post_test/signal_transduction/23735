The multilayered zzso is established through a zzso program, which is accompanied by a shift from zzso toward zzso divisions zzso a process under tight control of the zzso factor zzso However, the zzso signals regulating zzso activity in zzso zzso remain ill zzso Here, we reveal a role for zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso leads to a biased loss of zzso resulting in impaired zzso Upon loss of zzso zzso factors are retained in the nucleus, where they bind and inhibit zzso zzso This is reversed by small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso transgenic expression of a zzso nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso abrogates zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the present study reveals a critical role for zzso control of zzso activity in coordination of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
