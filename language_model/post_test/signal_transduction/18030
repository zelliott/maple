We have determined the expression pattern of the zzso zzso in the embryonic and adult zzso Western zzso analysis of protein zzso from zzso of adult mice show that zzso is zzso zzso but that levels of expression vary among different zzso To determine the zzso expression pattern of zzso we generated transgenic mice expressing the zzso reporter gene from the zzso zzso We show that zzso expression is highly specific within a given zzso and we identify cell types expressing this gene in the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso seminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso ubiquitous expression of the reporter gene is observed, but the highest levels of expression are specifically detected in the embryonic heart at stages zzso days zzso
