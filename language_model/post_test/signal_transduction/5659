zzso signaling is known to play a key role in development, zzso stem-cell zzso and zzso particularly through the zzso zzso involving stabilization of zzso We have previously shown that zzso mice have a zzso in zzso cells at a stage when zzso division is occurring in preference to further zzso before light chain zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso of this zzso plays a role in zzso zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso genes in the zzso mouse model of chronic zzso zzso We find that, in the course of zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and most dramatically, zzso is progressively zzso in the transformed zzso B cells of these mice, as are zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso expression by crossing into zzso mice significantly delays development of chronic zzso leukemia in this zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso signals zzso by zzso that are enlisted during zzso development may be zzso zzso in the zzso transformation of mature B zzso
