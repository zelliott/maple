A nuclear zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso and consequently zzso zzso by binding to DNA zzso This property suggests that zzso is a DNA zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso arrest occurs in zzso and zzso zzso following zzso We found that zzso zzso including zzso zzso suppressed zzso arrest and enhanced zzso arrest following zzso These observations suggested that zzso is critical for the induction of zzso arrest and is also involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso were also zzso We found that zzso stabilization following zzso was not inhibited but the zzso transient increases of zzso and zzso zzso were suppressed by zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
