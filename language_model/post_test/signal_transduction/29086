zzso zzso zzso is the initial component of a zzso zzso zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso that generates zzso for zzso zzso In liver zzso is required for the zzso activity of zzso zzso type 1, which converts inactive zzso to their active zzso zzso consequently, zzso zzso mice are relatively insensitive to zzso exhibiting zzso zzso increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of zzso and increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso in muscles normally enriched in type II zzso zzso which have increased zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso mice develop a severe skeletal zzso characterized by switching of type II to type I zzso zzso Running wheel activity and zzso zzso force generation in isolated skeletal muscle are both markedly zzso zzso muscles have normal zzso structure at the electron zzso level but contain large zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso indicative of defects in structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins involved in calcium zzso including the zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso show zzso zzso zzso analysis and real-time zzso demonstrate zzso of genes zzso proteins in the unfolded protein response zzso We propose that the absence of zzso zzso a progressive zzso by altering the zzso zzso state, thereby zzso protein folding and zzso the unfolded protein response zzso These studies thus define a novel zzso zzso that links zzso stress to skeletal muscle integrity and zzso
