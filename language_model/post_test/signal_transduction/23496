The formation of zzso in the central nervous system is a zzso process that involves coordinated zzso interactions and dramatic changes in plasma membrane zzso First, zzso send our numerous highly zzso processes to sample the zzso environment and decide which zzso to select for zzso After this decision is made and individual zzso to zzso contact has been established, the exploratory process of the zzso is converted into a flat sheath that spreads and winds along and around its associated zzso to generate a multilayered membrane zzso By zzso of the opposing zzso layers of membrane and zzso of almost all zzso from the zzso domain of the zzso the characteristic zzso zzso structure of zzso is zzso Here we highlight recent advances in identifying zzso and zzso based mechanisms that are involved in zzso selection and zzso sheath generation by zzso A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying these events is a prerequisite for the design of novel zzso repair strategies in zzso and zzso zzso
