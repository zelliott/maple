zzso of an external signal from receptors to downstream targets is often zzso by a zzso set of protein zzso that act in sequence (a zzso zzso In zzso strains of zzso zzso a signal initiated by zzso zzso is transmitted through this zzso cascade to a zzso factor zzso which is required for the expression of many zzso zzso Here it was shown that in zzso some of the same zzso and zzso are required for zzso growth, but the zzso receptors and zzso zzso protein are not required for filament zzso Thus, a similar zzso cascade is activated by different signals in zzso and zzso and mediates different zzso outcomes in the two cell zzso
