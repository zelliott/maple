zzso zzso zzso are key regulators of zzso signal zzso zzso architecture and membrane zzso The host cell zzso metabolism is targeted by zzso bacterial zzso which evolved intricate strategies to zzso zzso processes and zzso trafficking zzso Upon entering zzso host cells, zzso bacteria replicate in distinct zzso or in the host zzso zzso pathogens manipulate zzso levels to mimic or modify zzso of zzso compartments and thereby establish their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins into the host cell, some of which anchor to the zzso membrane via zzso or zzso turnover zzso zzso pathogens target zzso metabolism at the plasma zzso thus modulating their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso this strategy, zzso zzso directly zzso a zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso exploits zzso metabolism indirectly by binding to zzso zzso Thus, regardless of the zzso lifestyle of the zzso zzso metabolism is critically involved in the interactions with host zzso
