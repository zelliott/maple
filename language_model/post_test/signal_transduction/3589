The potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, B and C and zzso zzso zzso to transform primary T cells to permanent growth in zzso is restricted by the zzso host species and by viral zzso represented by distinct viral zzso We now addressed the relation between the transforming potential of the different viruses and the signaling pathways activated by zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso were transformed by all zzso zzso as well as zzso while transformation of human cells was restricted to zzso and, unexpectedly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was required for survival of all transformed zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso of all zzso In contrast, zzso signaling was zzso only for zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, the restricted transformation of human zzso likely zzso with the specific zzso targeting by these zzso These results will enable further studies into novel zzso zzso mechanisms relevant for zzso zzso
