zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso plays a critical role in nuclear zzso zzso zzso and production of zzso zzso in various inflammatory diseases including zzso zzso We previously reported a novel zzso inhibitor zzso D, zzso which is zzso in experimental arthritis zzso In the present study, we characterized the pharmacological properties of zzso D and investigated the mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso D inhibited zzso zzso activity with zzso selectivity against zzso The cellular analyses revealed that zzso D selectively blocked zzso promoter activity among major cellular signaling zzso such as the zzso zzso pathway, consistent with zzso of the zzso signaling zzso including zzso of zzso In addition, zzso D inhibited zzso production of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso zzso The correlation between zzso effect on zzso production and plasma concentration of the compound was observed in zzso zzso administration of zzso D decreased gene expression of zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso in the zzso of zzso mice with zzso of paw zzso zzso zzso D was rapidly distributed to the zzso zzso rather than healthy zzso and where it decreased the gene expression of zzso zzso by a single oral zzso Furthermore, zzso D completely inhibited arthritis progression even when treatment occurred after disease zzso These data suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso in local inflamed zzso is one of the mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
