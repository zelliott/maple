zzso zzso protein zzso A and zzso zzso B have been implicated as second zzso in the zzso zzso action zzso Since zzso zzso more zzso release, the zzso action zzso may share some common second zzso with the zzso induction zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso protein zzso A and zzso zzso B are involved in the induction of zzso beta release by human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso beta zzso zzso acid zzso With regard to zzso zzso it peaked 30 zzso after zzso zzso A role for zzso zzso in zzso beta induction was suggested since zzso was sufficient to induce zzso beta release from zzso zzso stimulation of zzso also activated an early peak of protein zzso A zzso A requirement of protein zzso A in zzso beta induction was suggested since zzso zzso beta release was inhibited with a selective protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, to examine the role of zzso zzso B, incubation of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso B consensus sequence produced a zzso enhancement of zzso zzso beta release, whereas a zzso containing an unrelated zzso motif had no zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso B plays a negative role in the zzso beta induction zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
