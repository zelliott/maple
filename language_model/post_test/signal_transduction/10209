Energy balance exerts a critical influence on reproduction via changes in the circulating levels of hormones such as zzso This zzso of the neuroendocrine zzso axis ultimately involves variations in the activity of zzso zzso expressing zzso Here we studied the effects of insulin in primary zzso cell cultures as well as a zzso zzso cell line that we generated by conditional zzso of adult zzso zzso These cells, which represent the first successful conditional zzso of zzso zzso retain many of their mature zzso zzso In addition, we show that they express the insulin zzso zzso their stimulation with insulin activates both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signaling pathways and stimulates a rapid increase in the expression of zzso demonstrating their responsiveness to this zzso Further work performed in parallel in immortalized zzso cells and primary zzso cultures containing zzso zzso shows that insulin zzso the expression of zzso in both zzso In primary cultures, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the stimulation of zzso expression by insulin, whereas blockade of the zzso zzso zzso has no zzso In conclusion, these data strongly suggest that zzso zzso are directly sensitive to insulin and zzso for the first time the zzso zzso signaling zzso in the central effects of insulin on the neuroendocrine zzso zzso
