The mechanism of zzso cell proliferation in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso remains zzso We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which homocysteine affects the expression of zzso A and D1 in human zzso artery zzso zzso zzso treatment induced proliferation of zzso and increased the expression levels of zzso A and zzso zzso down either zzso A or zzso D1 by small interfering zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and dominant negative Ras zzso abolished zzso zzso A zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the zzso zzso D1 zzso zzso also induced transient zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso blocked cell zzso expression of zzso A and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso differential zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways and zzso expression of zzso A and D1 are dependent on zzso zzso zzso may accelerate progression of zzso zzso by promoting zzso zzso
