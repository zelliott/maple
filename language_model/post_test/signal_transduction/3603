We have investigated the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso flow zzso we showed that zzso and zzso are zzso and form complexes on the surface of activated T zzso We also demonstrate that activated zzso can zzso zzso zzso T cells through the zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso signaling on zzso cells, we used the zzso clone zzso zzso zzso with a truncated form of the zzso zzso to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon challenge with zzso in zzso the production of zzso by zzso zzso was greatly reduced and, in zzso the zzso zzso was unable to induce zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was also effective in preventing transfer of disease by primary zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso analysis of pancreatic infiltrates after transfer of zzso zzso cells revealed an overall reduction of cell numbers and zzso production by both T cells and zzso These data indicate that zzso is an important signaling zzso on zzso zzso T cells and contributes to their zzso zzso zzso
