zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso of the heat shock protein 60 zzso first discovered to be an zzso for zzso zzso clones in non-obese diabetic zzso zzso zzso vaccination with zzso can arrest the spontaneous zzso process both in zzso mice and in humans associated with a zzso to zzso zzso shift specific for the zzso T zzso We now report that zzso can directly signal human T cells via innate zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso T cells responded to lower zzso of zzso than resting zzso T cells, but zzso of zzso T cells greatly increased their sensitivity to zzso Mouse T cells, but not zzso were also sensitive to the innate effects of zzso zzso and adoptive transfer of diabetes by zzso T cells from zzso mice could be inhibited by zzso treatment before zzso Thus, T cells do respond innately to zzso and signaling by soluble zzso through zzso could contribute to the treatment of type 1 zzso zzso may stop the destruction of beta cells by signaling in concert both innate and zzso receptors on T zzso
