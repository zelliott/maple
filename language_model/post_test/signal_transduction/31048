The requirement for zzso to promote differentiation of zzso zzso T cells into zzso zzso cell populations was established by classical in zzso zzso More recent in zzso data, however, indicate that signaling through the zzso is not essential for acquisition of the zzso zzso In order to reconcile these seemingly contradictory conclusions, we have taken advantage of the ability of the zzso zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cell development and drive zzso cell zzso We show that the initial development of zzso T cells is independent of zzso signaling but that the subsequent expansion of zzso zzso T cells in a competitive environment that also contains zzso potential is positively influenced by zzso zzso We find that the production of zzso is the key zzso factor required to maintain zzso dominance and that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso expansion can only be achieved by zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, in the absence of zzso zzso reduced zzso production is due to the lack in expansion of an zzso zzso population, rather than a global zzso in the production of zzso by zzso T zzso Thus, the evolution of zzso dominance is achieved at the expense of zzso cell development, normally restrained by zzso in an zzso zzso We conclude that zzso cell development in response to zzso zzso zzso requires both zzso and zzso to act in concert on zzso populations of both zzso and zzso zzso
