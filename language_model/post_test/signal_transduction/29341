zzso stem cells zzso in zzso are a valuable model to explore of how adult stem cells are regulated in zzso zzso dissection of this system has shown that stem cell fate is determined and maintained by the stem cell's zzso zzso or zzso In zzso zzso the stem cell niche -- the cap cell cluster in females and the hub in males -- acts as a signaling center to recruit zzso from among a small population of zzso primordial germ cells zzso zzso signals from the niche specify and regulate stem cell fate by maintaining the zzso state of the zzso next to the zzso zzso cells that do not receive the niche signals because of their location assume the default fate and zzso Once zzso are zzso zzso junctions maintain close association between the stem cells and their niche and help to orient stem cell division so that one daughter is displaced from the niche and zzso In zzso stem cell fate depends on bone zzso protein zzso signals from the cap zzso in zzso hub cells express the zzso zzso zzso which activates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in stem zzso Although the signaling pathways operating between the niche and stem cells are different, there are common general features in both males and zzso including the arrangement of cell types, many of the genes used, and the logic of the system that maintains stem cell zzso
