The molecular pathways that participate in regulation of gene expression are being progressively zzso zzso signals, including the binding of zzso zzso and soluble molecules to cell membrane zzso activate specific signal zzso that process information inside the cell leading to zzso in gene zzso Some of these zzso when zzso to the cell nucleus may bind to zzso complexes and thereby modify the zzso activity of specific zzso However, the basic molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression are found in many different cell and tissue zzso thus, the mechanisms underlying zzso gene expression are still zzso In this review we focus on the study of signals that are conveyed to the zzso We propose that the way in which zzso signals are integrated may account for zzso gene zzso We argue that the integration of signals depends on the nature of the structural organization of cells zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso that defines a particular cell type within a zzso Thus, gene expression can be envisioned as being regulated by the mutual influence of zzso and zzso organizations, zzso in zzso
