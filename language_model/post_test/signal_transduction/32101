zzso operated patients with head and neck cancer may benefit from the addition of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to zzso This study was designed to assess improved outcomes and identify zzso zzso 

Patients provided informed consent for tumor zzso analyses and, when eligible, were further enrolled in the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso phase II trial of zzso zzso with zzso + zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients were included in the zzso study, whereas 27 did not meet zzso for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso survival zzso rate was zzso and did not differ between zzso patients treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The similarity of zzso zzso between zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso and similar zzso zzso zzso for all groups, allowed us to conduct statistical analyses on the entire zzso On zzso analysis, elevated expression of zzso by Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso both by zzso was significantly associated with shorter zzso There was a significant interaction between zzso and zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso power of high zzso zzso patients with elevated zzso expression benefited from zzso whereas those with low zzso fared zzso 

zzso treatment zzso no significant clinical benefit on zzso in an zzso population of patients with head and neck zzso Our results point to the potential advantage of zzso treatment for zzso based on zzso zzso zzso This should foster zzso analyses in trials involving zzso zzso
