The root zzso of zzso zzso is formed by alternate files of hair and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso two zzso cells eventually develop a hair, while those zzso only one zzso cell do zzso Here we propose a network model that zzso most of the available genetic and molecular data on the regulatory and signaling pathways underlying root zzso zzso The network architecture includes two zzso one formed by the genes zzso R zzso zzso and zzso and the other one by the signal zzso proteins zzso and zzso Both parallel pathways regulate the activity of zzso and zzso which in turn control the development of root zzso The regulatory network was simulated as a zzso system of eight discrete state zzso The distinction between zzso cells zzso one or two cortical cells was accounted for by fixing the initial states of zzso and zzso zzso The model allows for predictions of zzso and pharmacological effects because it includes the zzso zzso The zzso system reaches one of the six stable states depending upon the initial state of the zzso variable and the zzso zzso Two of the stable states describe the zzso patterns observed in mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and under normal zzso zzso The other four states zzso to changes in the number of hair cells due to zzso induced changes in zzso zzso This model provides a hypothesis on the interactions among genes that zzso zzso factors that regulate root hair development and the proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso This is the first effort to use a zzso system to understand the complex genetic regulatory interactions that rule zzso primary root zzso The advantages of this type of models over zzso zzso representations are zzso
