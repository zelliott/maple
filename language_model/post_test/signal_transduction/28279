zzso interactions are critical for the formation of gastrointestinal buds such as the zzso from the zzso but the mechanisms regulating this process remain zzso To investigate this problem, we have studied the zzso and spatial expression of key genes known to orchestrate branching zzso At zzso zzso growth factor 10 zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso above the future zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is found throughout the gut zzso From zzso zzso zzso expression is found throughout the zzso zzso Other relevant signaling molecules such as Sonic zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are found throughout the gut zzso including the zzso zzso expression is also seen for zzso but only from zzso zzso By contrast, Bone zzso 4 zzso and zzso are specifically expressed in the zzso of the zzso bud at zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso leads to similar zzso characterized by an arrest of zzso invasion into the zzso zzso zzso However, a bud of zzso zzso zzso tissue is maintained throughout zzso Our results further indicate that zzso zzso acts mostly through the zzso zzso zzso thereby triggering invasion of the zzso zzso into the adjacent zzso via an increased rate of zzso proliferation at the tip of the zzso Thus, zzso signaling via zzso appears to be critical in the extension of the zzso into the zzso during zzso zzso
