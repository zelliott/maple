zzso is a zzso specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso type III zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso has been used extensively to identify zzso agents that zzso the zzso However, the molecular effect of zzso other than serving as zzso inhibitor in cells is less zzso The present study addressed this zzso in the zzso Based on structural similarity with zzso cancer zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso we hypothesized that zzso may act on pathways similar to that affected by these compounds in the human prostate cancer cell zzso We found that treatment of zzso cells with zzso led to zzso effects on multiple zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell cycle and growth that was correlated with zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and protein zzso This effect of zzso may due in part to zzso of zzso estrogen, and zzso growth zzso zzso pathways as zzso treatment led to zzso of zzso and protein expression of marker genes involved in these zzso We also found zzso activates zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso The effects of zzso were observed at 25 zzso a concentration lower than Ki zzso zzso for zzso zzso Based on these results we reasoned that zzso exerts zzso effects in cells and that biological effects of zzso may not be due solely to zzso of zzso
