The root zzso zzso of zzso is established zzso as the main source of root cells, and its activity is maintained by complex zzso signaling between stem cells and mature zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to regulate aerial zzso function and zzso growth in zzso 

Here we show that zzso zzso zzso also have root growth and patterning zzso zzso of zzso root zzso indicate abnormal numbers of cells in zzso files and zzso cell zzso as well as zzso stem cell division zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso markers for stem cells and differentiated root cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso root growth zzso but not marker zzso or patterning zzso are rescued by growth on media containing zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso and zzso function together in zzso signaling to positively regulate cell zzso differentiation of root cell types, and stem cell zzso In addition, zzso and zzso control zzso root growth by modulating zzso response after zzso
