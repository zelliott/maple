zzso are used in the clinical treatment of oral zzso zzso including both early and late zzso zzso variation in zzso including a common zzso of advanced zzso suggest that changes in zzso functions might characterize tumor zzso To investigate a genetic basis for this hypothesis, an in zzso zzso model of zzso involving normal zzso zzso T zzso zzso and zzso zzso oral zzso was zzso under identical culture conditions using zzso technique zzso zzso zzso for expression of 52 genes related to zzso metabolism and zzso The variable detection of between zzso transcripts in the cell lines, involving zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and responsive zzso indicated specificity in regards to the expression of known zzso genes in oral zzso The transformed cell lines zzso exhibited differences as compared to zzso zzso lower transcript levels for cellular zzso binding zzso the cellular zzso acid binding protein II zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso whereas in contrast, the levels of zzso I were zzso zzso for proteins interacting with nuclear zzso receptors were similarly expressed among the cell types, whereas transcripts for zzso zzso were generally not zzso Finally, transcripts of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso The overall results imply selective expression of zzso functions in normal and transformed zzso and that cell transformation can impair the capacity for binding and storage of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso These multiple zzso are consistent with possible zzso zzso during oral zzso
