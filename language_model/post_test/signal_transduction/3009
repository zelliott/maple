The zzso feeding system with its high degree of plasticity and well characterized zzso zzso is well suited for investigations of memory zzso We used an zzso zzso learning that food is zzso zzso to investigate the signaling pathways underlying zzso memory zzso in zzso During a single massed training session, the animal associates a specific seaweed with the failure to zzso generating short-term (30 zzso and long-term (24 zzso zzso We investigated whether the same training protocol induced the formation of zzso We found that massed zzso training resulted in temporally distinct protein zzso memory evident 4-6 h after zzso Through in zzso experiments, we determined that the formation of zzso required protein zzso A, protein zzso C, and zzso Moreover, the maintenance of zzso required zzso zzso zzso III, and zzso because zzso of any of these zzso after training or before testing blocked the expression of zzso In contrast, additional experiments determined that the maintenance of long-term memory appeared independent of zzso zzso zzso Using Western zzso we found that sustained zzso zzso was dependent upon protein zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso Thus, massed zzso zzso zzso memory requires protein synthesis as well as persistent or sustained zzso signaling for zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso and long-term memory are induced by the same training zzso considerable differences exist in both the combination and timing of signaling zzso that induce the formation and maintenance of these temporally distinct zzso
