Previous studies on zzso interactions at zzso receptors have often focused on zzso binding zzso because zzso binding seemed to reflect functional zzso The zzso zzso agent zzso is known to bind with similar affinity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors whether or not the receptors are occupied by the zzso zzso To determine zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso the effects of zzso were measured in contracting guinea pig left zzso and on zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso reduction of zzso contraction force in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without any effect on the zzso of zzso consistent with an zzso zzso In contrast, zzso shifted the zzso curve of the zzso zzso M to the right without affecting the zzso effect, in a formally competitive manner zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso remained zzso bound in the presence of zzso this indicates that zzso can no longer act as an zzso In support of this hypothesis, zzso acted as a competitive zzso against zzso M in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso yielded similar zzso zzso suppressed zzso stimulation of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso without shift in zzso whereas it competitively shifted the response to zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M binding data corresponded with the functional zzso In conclusion, zzso converted the zzso zzso into an zzso novel type of functional zzso zzso
