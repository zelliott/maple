The mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso an zzso zzso remains zzso zzso of zzso zzso the release of zzso oxide zzso from zzso cells, which has led us to test the hypothesis that the observed zzso effect induced by the systemic administration of zzso depends on the zzso zzso The possible involvement of an zzso link in the zzso effect of zzso was also zzso The zzso effect induced by systemic administration zzso or zzso of zzso was evaluated using the rat paw zzso mice zzso and writhing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso effect in the zzso zzso and writhing zzso The zzso effect of zzso in a dose that had no sedative effect assessed by zzso rod test, was significantly reduced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso but not zzso was inhibited by zzso Our current results suggest that the zzso effect of systemic zzso does not involve the zzso zzso and is modulated by the zzso zzso
