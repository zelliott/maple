In previous studies, we have shown that zzso zzso regulatory T cells produce high levels of zzso in a cell surface and/or zzso form, and blockade of such zzso by zzso curtails the ability of these cells to suppress zzso T cell proliferation and B cell zzso production in in zzso zzso zzso In further support for the role of zzso in suppression by zzso T cells, we show in this study that another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also reverses suppression by mouse zzso T cells as well as their human counterparts, zzso T zzso In addition, we show that zzso T cells exposed to zzso T cells in zzso manifest zzso of zzso and induction of zzso the latter a zzso surface zzso In further studies, we show that while zzso T cells from zzso mice can suppress zzso T cell proliferation in zzso these cells do not protect recipient mice from colitis in the zzso transfer model in zzso and, in addition, zzso but not zzso T cells from normal mice protect recipient mice from colitis in this zzso Together, these studies demonstrate that zzso produced by zzso T cells is involved in the zzso activity of these cells, particularly in their ability to regulate zzso zzso
