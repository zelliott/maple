Previous studies have implicated zzso zzso proteins in signaling leading to inflammatory zzso production induced by zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to play a central role in response to zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso proteins are coupled to zzso zzso of signaling zzso To inhibit zzso protein function, human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso toxin zzso an inhibitor of zzso interaction, or zzso with dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The cells were subsequently zzso with zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso together with an zzso or zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso induced zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with empty zzso zzso zzso with zzso inhibited zzso zzso 1/2 zzso (30 zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso active zzso and zzso plasmids zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso (27 zzso zzso and 41 zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the function of zzso zzso of G zzso has no effect on zzso zzso 1/2 zzso These data support our hypothesis and provide the first evidence that zzso signaling pathways are activated by zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso activates zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso independently of zzso signaling to zzso zzso
