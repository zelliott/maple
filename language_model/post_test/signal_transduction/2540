The role of the zzso in inducing and patterning adjacent neural and zzso zzso is well zzso We provide evidence that the zzso is also required for one of the earliest known steps in the development of the zzso an zzso derived zzso At a zzso stage in chick zzso when the zzso touches the zzso removal of zzso eliminates subsequent expression of several markers of zzso zzso bud development, including insulin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression can be initiated and maintained in zzso chick zzso grown in zzso with zzso zzso zzso however, does not express pancreatic genes when zzso with the same zzso The results suggest that the zzso provides a zzso signal to zzso to specify pancreatic fate in a zzso zzso
