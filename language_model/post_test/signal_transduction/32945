We have previously shown that zzso zzso stimulates zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso adrenal zzso through zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the zzso pathways involved in the zzso action of zzso Exposure of zzso adrenal zzso to zzso provoked a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso production and a parallel decrease in membrane zzso zzso zzso of adrenal zzso with zzso also induced a zzso increase of zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso totally abolished the zzso effects of zzso on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly modify zzso zzso or zzso zzso Administration of the zzso C inhibitor zzso or the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso to zzso zzso adrenal slices significantly reduced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso administration of the two zzso almost completely suppressed the zzso effect of zzso Taken together, these data indicate that, in the zzso adrenal zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso is zzso through zzso of both the zzso C and the zzso zzso zzso zzso
