Fusion proteins between the human zzso zzso zzso and either wild type or certain zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso display zzso zzso activity that can be inhibited by the inverse zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulator of G protein signaling zzso 1 or zzso to zzso expressing these fusion proteins resulted in zzso of this zzso zzso activity without significantly altering the binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso For a zzso zzso fusion protein the increase in zzso zzso activity was greater than zzso zzso kinetic analysis demonstrated that the effect of zzso was as a zzso protein for the fusion zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso both zzso and inverse zzso produced much more robust regulation of zzso zzso activity than in their zzso This allowed detection of the partial zzso nature of zzso which has been described previously as a neutral zzso at the zzso zzso Of a range of zzso zzso only zzso functioned as a neutral zzso in the presence of zzso These studies show that addition of a zzso zzso protein provides a simple and novel means to elevate the fraction of zzso membrane zzso activity contributed by the zzso activity of a zzso By so doing, it also greatly enhances the ability to detect and analyze the effects of inverse zzso and to discriminate between neutral zzso and those with low levels of positive intrinsic zzso
