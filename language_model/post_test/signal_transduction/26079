Deep vein zzso associated with advanced cancer is known as zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributes to tumor zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (AP) zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso activities, protein zzso and cell zzso in zzso cancer cells, and these actions were significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activity and cell zzso were blocked by zzso important zzso of signaling zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results showed that zzso induced zzso protein expression through zzso and zzso zzso de zzso protein zzso Twist can regulate zzso transition zzso and increase tumor zzso However, we observed that zzso zzso increased Twist zzso and its protein level was zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In addition, Twist could increase zzso but not zzso to promote tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed zzso Twist and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In conclusion, our study showed that zzso zzso zzso Twist at the zzso level to enhance cell zzso These findings show that zzso zzso Twist via zzso to make tumor cells zzso and also establish a link between the zzso disorder and cancer zzso
