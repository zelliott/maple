zzso oxide zzso controls numerous zzso processes by zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates both NO synthesis by NO zzso and zzso zzso by zzso We report that, unexpectedly, the zzso antagonists, zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited zzso zzso in zzso cells evoked by an zzso NO zzso with zzso values of 11, 80 and 180 zzso zzso Here we sought to zzso the underlying zzso 

We used zzso cell suspensions to determine the influence of zzso zzso on all steps of the zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso zzso were used to test effects of zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso in the cells did not depend on changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of NO were both inhibited by the zzso antagonists, ruling out increased loss of zzso or NO as zzso Instead, zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso The zzso was not in competition with zzso nor did it arise from displacement of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso indicating that it acts in an uncompetitive zzso 

The disruption of every stage of NO signal zzso by common zzso antagonists, unrelated to zzso zzso cautions against their utility as pharmacological zzso More zzso the compounds exemplify a novel class of zzso zzso that, with improved zzso may be zzso zzso
