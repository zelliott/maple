Plant hormones have pivotal roles in the regulation of plant growth, development, and zzso Additionally, they emerged as cellular signal molecules with key functions in the regulation of immune responses to microbial zzso insect zzso and beneficial zzso Their signaling pathways are interconnected in a complex network, which provides plants with an enormous regulatory potential to rapidly adapt to their zzso environment and to zzso their limited resources for growth and survival in a zzso zzso Plants activate their immune system to counteract attack by pathogens or zzso zzso zzso successful plant enemies evolved ingenious mechanisms to zzso the plant's hormone signaling zzso to suppress or evade host zzso Evidence is emerging that beneficial zzso microbes also zzso the zzso immune signaling network to establish a prolonged zzso association, highlighting the central role of plant hormones in the regulation of plant growth and zzso
