zzso forms the zzso and regulates certain zzso signaling zzso Both functions rely on the zzso properties of zzso Signal zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso through a direct transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso However, at high zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso This report demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso by binding the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso was specific, because zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso binding or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso and zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso zzso zzso this process in both zzso cells, containing a zzso zzso pathway, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at the plasma membrane was demonstrated with zzso laser zzso zzso Although zzso bound to both zzso and zzso zzso facilitated the interaction between zzso and zzso but not that between zzso and zzso However, zzso did augment formation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso membrane binding of zzso at zzso and zzso sites appeared to inhibit zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso zzso and also inhibited zzso activity in zzso zzso Thus, zzso depending on local membrane zzso may serve as a positive or negative regulator of zzso zzso Rapid changes in membrane zzso composition or in the zzso might modify zzso signaling through such a zzso
