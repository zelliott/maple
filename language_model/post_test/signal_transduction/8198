zzso cross talk between the zzso derived zzso and the underlying zzso is required for regional patterning and proper differentiation of the developing zzso zzso Though both zzso and zzso participate in zzso the zzso is thought to play a prominent role in the determination of the zzso zzso during development and in adult zzso However, the molecular basis for this instructional dominance is zzso In fact, surprisingly little is known about the cellular origins of many of the critical signaling molecules and the gene zzso events that they zzso Here, we profile genes that are expressed in the separate zzso and zzso compartments of the zzso mouse zzso The data indicate that the vast majority of soluble zzso and zzso of signaling pathways such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed predominantly or exclusively by the zzso accounting for its ability to dominate instructional cross zzso We also catalog the most highly enriched zzso factors in both zzso The results bolster previous evidence suggesting a major role for zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Finally, we find that while zzso enriched genes tend to be highly tissue restricted in their zzso zzso enriched genes tend to be broadly expressed in multiple zzso Thus, the unique zzso signature that characterizes the zzso zzso is instructed and supported by a zzso that itself expresses genes that are largely zzso zzso
