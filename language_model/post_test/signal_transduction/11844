We sought to explore the treatment effects and the repair mechanisms of bone zzso derived zzso stem cells zzso during zzso acute lung injury zzso zzso were delivered through the tail veins of rats 24 h after zzso zzso of zzso The results showed that zzso did not zzso the zzso changes of zzso and pulmonary zzso We found that the activated zzso signaling may regulate the differentiation of zzso and is associated with lung zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and tissue repair process in zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that activated zzso zzso signaling induced most zzso to differentiate into zzso or zzso in zzso However, zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso promotes zzso differentiation of zzso induced by native zzso zzso cells which are beneficial to repair the injured lung zzso zzso of zzso signaling after zzso transplantation ameliorated pulmonary zzso and improved pulmonary function which attenuated the lung zzso In zzso study, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso to express zzso zzso which was attenuated by zzso Furthermore, zzso activated zzso signaling in lung zzso to enhance the expression of collagen I, zzso and zzso muscle zzso but zzso attenuated these proteins zzso These findings demonstrated that zzso zzso signaling plays a key role in regulating differentiation of zzso in zzso or in zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Our study suggested that zzso of abnormal activated zzso signaling would promote zzso zzso differentiation to repair lung injury and reduce pulmonary zzso
