zzso zzso cell cultures were established from zzso transgenic fish using a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso that was engineered to express zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cultures, initiated from zzso were treated with zzso to eliminate the zzso cells and select for the zzso expressing zzso zzso of zzso a zzso type I zzso zzso prolonged zzso stem cell zzso survival in culture and enhanced zzso transmission of the zzso following transplantation into recipient zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited the growth and survival of zzso female zzso stem cells zzso in zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso continued to express the zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso markers zzso and zzso for at least six weeks in zzso zzso experiments revealed that 6 zzso zzso cell cultures maintained in the presence of zzso were able to successfully colonize the zzso in zzso of recipient larvae and produce functional zzso in the resulting adult zzso zzso zzso transmission was not successful when the zzso were cultured 6 weeks in the absence of zzso before zzso The results indicate that zzso signaling is zzso to zzso but required for the survival of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso signaling could provide a strategy to zzso culture conditions of zzso stem cells from other zzso
