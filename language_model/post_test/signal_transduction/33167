wingless and zzso signal during zzso induction in zzso to regulate expression of the zzso gene zzso Here, we define a minimal wingless response sequence in the zzso zzso of zzso We show that this sequence is recognized by the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binding factor 1) in a zzso complex with zzso zzso the zzso target of the wingless signaling zzso In stable zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso by zzso depends on zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso the need for wingless signaling and causes zzso in the zzso zzso and wing that mimic wingless zzso Finally, efficient zzso stimulation by zzso in the zzso depends also on the zzso response sequence and is limited zzso by zzso zzso Thus, zzso coordinates zzso from multiple zzso signals, consistent with its architectural role in regulating the assembly of zzso zzso zzso
