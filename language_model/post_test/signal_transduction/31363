The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes for a zzso zzso zzso zzso an established zzso zzso required for releasing zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is under the control of carbon zzso repression and is induced by growth in zzso In this report, we identified an zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso system flanked by two predicted zzso proteins that is absolutely required for the expression of zzso All four genes were found to be required for optimal growth of zzso zzso on zzso medium and for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso expressing the response regulator suggested that the zzso system works in concert with the zzso zzso This zzso was also shown to activate a zzso cluster located immediately downstream and zzso an zzso II zzso for a zzso sugar : zzso zzso which was found to zzso regulate the expression of zzso Using zzso zzso it was found that zzso could signal induction of the zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso protein was shown to bind to the promoter regions of zzso and zzso in gel mobility shift zzso Thus, a zzso signal zzso zzso activates zzso zzso and the expression of an zzso II complex that functions in a feedback loop to sense the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso
