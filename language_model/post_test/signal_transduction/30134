zzso zzso is a growth factor that significantly stimulates proliferation and survival of the primitive cells of zzso and zzso zzso To determine the mechanism of action of zzso the zzso activity and signal zzso zzso of zzso were investigated using a zzso leukemia cell line, the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli and zzso by a series of column zzso with a purity of more than zzso zzso significantly supported the survival of zzso cells after deprivation of zzso colony stimulating factor and activated zzso zzso zzso When the zzso cells were treated with two specific zzso to zzso zzso or zzso a significant loss of cell viability with evidence of zzso was zzso Moreover, the protein zzso B zzso one of the downstream zzso of zzso survival zzso was activated in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and its downstream molecular Bad at zzso 136 was induced by zzso but was blocked by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso activities and zzso zzso zzso Such an effect of zzso was also significantly blocked by either zzso or zzso These results indicate that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso death through a zzso zzso
