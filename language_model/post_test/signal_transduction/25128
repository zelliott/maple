zzso are implicated in the zzso of alcoholic liver disease in humans and in experimental models of alcohol zzso The major sources of these zzso are zzso cells which represent more than zzso of tissue zzso in the zzso zzso cells are highly responsive to the effects of ethanol, zzso and human zzso virus zzso zzso These agents, either independently or in zzso may exacerbate the production of zzso zzso are agents that are highly zzso to zzso cells and zzso The levels of these zzso in zzso and tissue are elevated in patients with alcoholic zzso alcoholic zzso diseased zzso viral zzso and in experimental models of chronic alcohol zzso zzso influx of zzso from the gut into the portal circulation is suggested to play an important role in the zzso of zzso cells which leads to enhanced zzso zzso The zzso of zzso during alcohol consumption is zzso During the early phase of alcoholic liver disease, zzso or zzso zzso This is also associated with zzso zzso of the zzso In the later stage, zzso of zzso or zzso production and migration of zzso cells into the liver are observed, and this may lead to liver zzso Selective zzso of zzso synthesis and release may involve differential zzso of the zzso factors required for zzso gene zzso Increased zzso release following alcohol consumption may also regulate zzso zzso in zzso cells via zzso and zzso mechanisms and vice zzso In addition, infection with zzso may further compromise the liver to more zzso During zzso infection, a pre-existing liver disease superimposed on chronic alcohol consumption may also exacerbate zzso replication and zzso zzso in the liver, because of the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate zzso production by zzso cells and stimulate migration of inflammatory zzso in the zzso
