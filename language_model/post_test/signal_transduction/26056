The cellular response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as one of the zzso models for understanding the long-range control of tissue growth and pattern formation during animal zzso Nevertheless, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding zzso regulation of the zzso itself, as well as the nature of the downstream zzso response to zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso zzso a novel target of zzso activity in zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses zzso zzso a zzso repeat zzso in the regulation of wing growth and vein zzso At the molecular level, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso protein that zzso zzso MAD zzso indicating that it regulates zzso signaling at or above the level of zzso zzso Furthermore, based on genetic interactions with the zzso protein zzso 2 and zzso interactions with the zzso zzso we propose that zzso acts in the zzso space where it completes a novel zzso loop that zzso zzso zzso
