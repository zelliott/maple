zzso 6 zzso is a zzso zzso which regulates the immune response, the zzso reaction and zzso zzso plays a critical role in differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, and is a potent growth factor for zzso and zzso A relationship between zzso and zzso plasma cell abnormalities has been zzso zzso production of zzso was first suggested to be related to zzso with zzso production in patients with cardiac zzso A role of zzso in the generation of zzso has also been zzso In support of these clinical and experimental zzso we demonstrated that transgenic zzso mice carrying the human zzso gene showed a massive zzso zzso with production of zzso However, the zzso was not zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is genetically zzso can induce zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice were zzso to zzso mice to zzso the genetic influence on zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso was generated in some of the zzso mice, indicating that zzso plays a key role in the zzso zzso of plasma cell zzso
