zzso zzso peptides are key proteins in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso While zzso zzso very rapidly to form early diffuse zzso supplemental zzso deposition is required to form mature zzso zzso We here investigated the role of nuclear zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso damage and zzso zzso In rat primary zzso and human zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso death, reduced the levels of the zzso protein zzso enhanced the zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activated the zzso zzso by selectively inducing the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and promoted an zzso profile of gene zzso As zzso of the zzso pathway, we tested the capability of a zzso zzso decoy zzso the zzso drug aspirin and the selective zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso to modify the zzso zzso These treatments, zzso applied before zzso exposure, completely inhibited zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso The zzso decoy also inhibited the zzso release of zzso zzso restored the levels of zzso and prevented zzso zzso and zzso of zzso These results open up interesting perspectives on the development of novel strategies targeting out zzso zzso zzso for pharmacological intervention in zzso
