zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso and temporally regulated by a number of positive and negative regulatory zzso These regulatory mechanisms control the zzso and duration of the signals initiated at the cell surface to have a normal or zzso biological outcome in development and disease, zzso In the past decade, the zzso zzso family of proteins has been identified as zzso of zzso signaling in normal development and zzso This review summarizes recent advances concerning the biological activities modulated by zzso family zzso their interactions with signaling zzso and their involvement in cardiovascular diseases and zzso The diversity of mechanisms in the regulation of zzso expression and activity in cell systems emphasizes the crucial role of zzso proteins in development and growth across the animal zzso
