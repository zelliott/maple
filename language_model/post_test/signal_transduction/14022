zzso insects can manipulate zzso resistance and are able to suppress effective zzso zzso zzso defenses by the induction of inefficient salicylic acid zzso based zzso As a result, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in transgenic plants is anticipated to cause complex interactions between zzso insects and their host plants due to predicted contradiction between two defense zzso the toxicity of various zzso and the zzso of zzso via a branch of the activated zzso 

Here, we investigated the effect of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso factor, on the zzso zzso zzso a zzso insect zzso Our performance zzso indicated that the zzso made the transgenic plants a more suitable host for zzso zzso than zzso zzso plants, although these plants accumulated significantly higher levels of zzso zzso analyses of indicator genes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways followed by zzso of the zzso and zzso hormone levels, indicated that zzso zzso infestation periods longer than 8 hours, caused higher levels of activity of zzso signaling in transgenic plants and higher levels of zzso signaling in zzso zzso 

Taken together, these results emphasize the important role zzso defenses play in protecting plants from successful infestation by zzso zzso and likely other zzso zzso It also indicates the necessity of zzso feeders to suppress these defenses for efficient zzso of plant zzso Our data also indicate that the defensive chemistry produced by the zzso zzso has only a minor effect on the insect zzso
