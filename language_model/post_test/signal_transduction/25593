The cellular zzso state is an important zzso of metal zzso In this study we investigated the influence of cadmium zzso and copper zzso stress on the cellular zzso balance in relation to zzso zzso and damage in zzso zzso Both metals were easily taken up by the roots, but the zzso to the zzso parts was restricted to zzso zzso In the roots, zzso directly induced an zzso burst, whereas zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso production via zzso zzso seems important in zzso stress caused by zzso Furthermore, in the roots, the zzso metabolism plays a crucial role in controlling the gene regulation of the zzso zzso mechanism under zzso zzso zzso zzso were also noticed with regard to the zzso regulation of zzso gene expression in both roots and zzso The appearance of zzso zzso is zzso it can be an indication of zzso damage as well as an indication of zzso zzso as zzso are induced after metal exposure and are initial zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso cellular zzso imbalance is strongly dependent on the chemical properties of the metal and the plant organ zzso The stress intensity determines its involvement in downstream responses in relation to zzso damage or zzso
