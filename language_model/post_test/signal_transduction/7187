zzso brain zzso is essential in mental zzso Physical activities can zzso mental problems by enhancing zzso zzso However, such activity is not always possible in disabled individuals or patients with zzso zzso zzso a form of physical activity, has been found to mimic effects of voluntary zzso Focusing on zzso zzso we addressed a question: Does local mechanical loading to the skeleton elevate expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso that is a zzso zzso for brain zzso A 5 zzso knee loading was applied to mice using 1 N force at 5 zzso for 1,500 zzso A zzso treadmill running was used as an exercise zzso control, and a zzso tail suspension was used as a stress zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined 30 zzso - 2 h in three brain regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain stem zzso We demonstrated for the first time that knee loading and treadmill exercise zzso the zzso level of zzso in the zzso while tail suspension zzso zzso The protein level of zzso in the zzso was also zzso by knee loading and zzso by tail zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso by tail suspension can be partially suppressed by zzso of knee zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso and zzso was not significantly altered with knee zzso In this study we provided evidence that peripheral mechanical loading can activate central zzso zzso suggesting that physical cues may mediate zzso zzso signaling in the zzso
