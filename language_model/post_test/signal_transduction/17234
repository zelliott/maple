In a forward genetic screen for regulators of zzso development in zzso we identified zzso , a zzso which exhibits failed outgrowth of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso leads to a zzso to zzso substitution in the zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso the zzso maturation of the zzso its trafficking to the plasma zzso and diminishes the zzso of its zzso zzso Interestingly, during zzso met and its zzso zzso are expressed in pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso Although Met signaling elicits zzso and migratory responses in varied zzso normal proliferation rates in zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso cells suggest that met primarily functions zzso in pancreatic tail zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso the zzso pancreatic zzso further indicating that Met signals through migratory pathways during zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso cells were excluded from the zzso but not zzso compartment in the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso duct and zzso zzso at the leading edge of the growing zzso rescued the zzso zzso Altogether, these results reveal a novel and essential role for zzso signaling in the zzso ducts during zzso zzso
