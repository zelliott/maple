Various approaches attempting to zzso the functional interaction structure of a hidden zzso network from experimental zzso zzso have been zzso however, due to both experimental limitations and zzso complexities, a large majority of these approaches have been zzso In particular, with respect to the zzso of such networks, there are zzso a zzso problem: too many network zzso with too few available sampling points, zzso a zzso complexity problem: exponential complexity if a zzso information is unavailable for regulatory zzso and zzso an experimental measurement problem: no guidelines for an appropriate experimental design for distinguishing direct and indirect influences among network zzso Here, we sought to develop a new methodology capable of identifying the correct functional interaction structure with only a few sampling points through relatively simple zzso We also attempted to provide guidelines for an experimental design capable of supporting this methodology by taking proper zzso of the direct influences among the network zzso In the present study, we considered an experiment where zzso were taken at two sampling time points with alternate zzso zzso or zzso of initial conditions while keeping the same initial conditions for zzso network zzso and propose a new method of identifying the functional interaction structure from such zzso The proposed method is able to avoid the zzso problem caused by the practically limited number of sampling time points, and does not suffer from the zzso complexity problem, as it only uses a simple algebra based on the Mean Value zzso (see zzso mathematical zzso without any other complicated zzso In addition, we provide a detailed zzso for an experimental design that can take proper zzso of the direct influences among the network zzso through zzso of initial zzso The proposed method is particularly useful for cases investigating the local interaction structure around a specific network zzso of zzso An example, based on simulated data, is provided to illustrate the proposed zzso
