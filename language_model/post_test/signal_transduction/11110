zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which is frequently coupled with zzso proteins to interact with its zzso for the regulation of zzso zzso cell growth and zzso in response to a variety of biological zzso The zzso zzso zzso family members were first identified as zzso proteins of zzso for regulating zzso transforming and zzso zzso In the present study, we used a zzso zzso screen to identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso This finding led us to investigate the role of Abi in linking zzso and zzso These three proteins formed a zzso complex in zzso and zzso zzso The expression of Abi in cells greatly enhanced the formation of the zzso complex, suggesting that Abi functions as an zzso protein zzso the binding between zzso and zzso We show that Abi promotes zzso zzso of zzso at zzso 15 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and Abi in zzso zzso cells led to suppression of cell zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in cell cycle zzso
