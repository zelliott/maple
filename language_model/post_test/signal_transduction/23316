The zzso zzso is a major zzso in all zzso cells which performs multiple functions including protein and zzso synthesis and zzso drug zzso and zzso storage and zzso The zzso zzso and its specialized muscle counterpart the zzso zzso is the largest and most extensive of zzso storage zzso in zzso cells, often occupying in excess of zzso of the cell zzso There are three major components of zzso storage zzso which mediate their major zzso zzso zzso zzso by pumps and zzso storage enhanced by zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso Through zzso release channels in its zzso the zzso and plastic structure of the zzso zzso allows zzso release to be rapidly targeted to specific zzso sites across the whole zzso That several zzso zzso zzso release channels are also activated by zzso itself, contributes to zzso zzso membrane zzso which is the principal basis for generating zzso complex cellular zzso signals, allowing specific processes to be regulated by this universal zzso In addition, the zzso zzso forms discrete junctions with the plasma membrane and zzso of zzso such as zzso and zzso forming zzso at their zzso that play critical roles in zzso signaling during key cellular processes such as cellular zzso zzso and zzso At these junctions key zzso transport and regulatory processes come into play, and a recurring theme in this review is the often tortuous paths in identifying these mechanisms zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso and structural diversity of zzso zzso
