zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso plays zzso roles during embryonic development, but the mechanisms by which this zzso signals in zzso have not previously been zzso zzso studies have implicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the principal zzso of zzso signal zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso To determine the zzso requirements for zzso zzso we generated mice zzso in which the zzso site on zzso is zzso zzso zzso die during late zzso and exhibit defects in neural tube closure and in the development of the tail bud and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso is able to drive zzso functions during zzso and zzso and drives normal zzso responses to zzso These findings indicate that zzso uses distinct signal zzso mechanisms in different zzso zzso and that some essential functions of this zzso are zzso by zzso zzso
