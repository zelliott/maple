The factors and signaling pathways controlling zzso human cell properties, both embryonic and zzso have not been fully zzso Failure to account for functional zzso within human embryonic stem cell zzso cultures has led to zzso results in previous work examining zzso influences governing zzso fate zzso renewal zzso differentiation zzso zzso Here, we attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies with recent reports demonstrating that an zzso produced in zzso niche regulates zzso Moreover, we focus on the zzso zzso signals within the in zzso zzso niche allowing for the maintenance and/or expansion of the zzso zzso cell zzso Based on this, it is clear that separation of zzso apart from their differentiated zzso will be essential in future studies involving their molecular zzso zzso how zzso factors control zzso zzso and differentiation will allow us to culture and differentiate these zzso cells with higher zzso This knowledge will be essential for clinical applications using human zzso cells in zzso zzso
