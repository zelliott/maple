The zzso boundary zzso is a well-known organizing center during zzso brain zzso The zzso forms at the expression boundary of zzso and zzso mutually repressive zzso zzso factors expressed in the zzso and anterior zzso zzso The genetic hierarchy of gene expression at the zzso is complex, involving multiple positive and negative feedback zzso that result in the establishment of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on either side of the boundary and the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso derives from the zzso part of the zzso zzso segment, zzso 1 zzso which zzso a distinctive zzso to give rise to the zzso zzso within which the various zzso zzso types are zzso Previous studies in the mouse have shown that zzso is essential for zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show here that in the zzso zzso and zzso are required zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso but that this requirement is alleviated by knocking down zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the entire zzso genetic program is progressively lost in zzso double zzso but is rescued by zzso zzso This rescue of the zzso genetic program depends on rescued zzso zzso however the rescue of zzso zzso zzso is independent of both zzso and zzso Based on our findings we propose a revised model for the role of zzso in zzso zzso
