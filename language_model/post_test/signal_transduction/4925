To identify and characterize zzso mothers against zzso zzso changes in immune cell populations following infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 24) mice zzso zzso of zzso were infected with zzso zzso and changes in immune cell populations zzso zzso natural killer zzso cells, T regulatory zzso were measured in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 0 zzso 3 zzso 7 d and 28 d zzso using flow zzso zzso changes in T zzso and zzso zzso cells were also assessed after 28 d in zzso colon tissue using zzso 

As previously observed, zzso but not zzso mice, developed zzso zzso at 4 zzso zzso No significant changes in T cell zzso were observed in the zzso or in the zzso between zzso at any time zzso However, zzso and zzso cells, an zzso T zzso population, as well as zzso cells zzso were significantly higher in the zzso of zzso mice at 7 d and 28 d zzso In the zzso a higher number of zzso cells were present in zzso compared to zzso mice at zzso which did not significantly change during zzso However, the number of zzso zzso cells, a marker of zzso zzso significantly increased in zzso mice 28 d zzso compared to both zzso mice and to baseline zzso This was consistent with more severe colitis development in these zzso 

Data suggest that defects in zzso signaling increase zzso to zzso zzso colitis through zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso
