zzso of red light zzso zzso zzso by the shoot bottom turned off the zzso process in zzso To understand the signaling cascade leading to this zzso response, certain signaling components were zzso in zzso grown in different light zzso Upon analysis the gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso were severely zzso in zzso grown without zzso and having their shoot bottom exposed to red light zzso and was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with blue light resulted in zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that blue light is able to zzso G protein zzso Treatment of zzso analog zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of gene expression of both zzso and zzso To probe further, zzso of signal zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso added along with zzso solution to the roots of 4-day-old zzso zzso grown on zzso paper and transferred to red zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to elicit any zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly reversed the zzso suppression of zzso zzso of proteins zzso in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso revealed respective zzso or zzso of zzso of several zzso proteins in zzso zzso These suggest that signal zzso of red light perceived by the shoot bottom to suppress zzso is zzso by zzso protein zzso
