zzso is a zzso zzso produced by a newly proposed zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells can be generated by treatment of zzso T cells with zzso and zzso in zzso However, it is still not clear how zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso two zzso factors activated by zzso zzso are required for zzso differentiation in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in T cells resulted in impaired zzso zzso which was zzso with enrichment of repressive zzso modification zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso partially rescued zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins may zzso zzso directly from the zzso zzso because zzso and zzso can bind zzso Our data shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso cell zzso revealing that the zzso zzso regulates zzso production through an zzso zzso
