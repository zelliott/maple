zzso stem zzso cell zzso and zzso are maintained by several signaling zzso and by expression of intrinsic factors, such as zzso and zzso The signaling zzso are activated by zzso factors, such as leukemia zzso factor, bone zzso zzso and zzso However, the mechanism that regulates zzso signaling in zzso cells is zzso zzso zzso zzso chains are zzso present as the cell surface zzso and are known to play crucial roles in regulating several signaling zzso Here we investigated whether HS chains on zzso cells are involved in regulating signaling pathways that are important for the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of HS chain zzso inhibited mouse zzso cell zzso and induced spontaneous differentiation of the cells into zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso signaling through HS chains was found to be required for the regulation of zzso zzso We propose that HS chains are important for the zzso signaling required for mouse zzso cell zzso and zzso
