We previously have demonstrated an obligatory requirement for zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation during T zzso zzso and have proposed that zzso may act as zzso agents in the regulation of certain cellular zzso for example, during cell cycle zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we have been interested to determine which, if any, cell cycle entry events are affected by zzso zzso Given the requirement for both zzso zzso and altered gene expression during the zzso to zzso phase transition, we have attempted to establish the extent to which zzso zzso affects global gene expression patterns during cell cycle entry, and to isolate and characterize zzso whose expression patterns are responsive to zzso zzso during this zzso Using differential display in a zzso screening approach, we have identified 10 zzso species whose expression patterns were altered in response to zzso of zzso zzso during cell cycle zzso The expression patterns of 4 of these 10 zzso were unaffected during cell cycle arrest caused by a different zzso zzso zzso interference with zzso zzso events, zzso that the altered expression patterns seen were not simply a consequence of cell cycle zzso This suggests that the expression of these 4 zzso is regulated by a mechanism both necessary for cell cycle entry and sensitive to zzso zzso zzso protection zzso confirmed that 2 of these 4 zzso were indeed responsive to zzso zzso These observations strongly suggest an involvement for zzso zzso in the regulation of gene expression during the zzso to zzso phase transition, in peripheral blood zzso cells at zzso
