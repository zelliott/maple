Our previous study showed there was a change of zzso zzso expression profile, and zzso was significantly down regulated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, was identified to be a target gene of zzso which suggested zzso might be associated with insulin resistance zzso or zzso However, it is not known whether zzso play any role in the development of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso or negative control zzso were treated with high zzso and high insulin for zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso transport zzso zzso expression level was measured by using quantitative real-time zzso zzso The protein expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by western zzso zzso 

We further confirmed that zzso was down regulated in zzso by zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso protein zzso while it had no significant effect on zzso zzso expression in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso 

In this study, our data demonstrate that zzso reverses high zzso and high insulin induced zzso in zzso zzso possibly through modulating the zzso pathway, and zzso may be a new therapeutic target for zzso diseases such as zzso and zzso
