In the growth arrested cultures of bovine carotid smooth muscle, zzso (10 - 100 zzso a protein zzso inhibitor with wide spectrum suppressed the cell proliferation induced by zzso and increase of zzso zzso was more potent in the zzso activity than zzso a zzso zzso but less than zzso another zzso protein zzso zzso Since zzso plays an important role in the signal zzso leading to the cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso in zzso the zzso effect of zzso to carotid smooth muscle cells is likely to be exerted through zzso dependent zzso
