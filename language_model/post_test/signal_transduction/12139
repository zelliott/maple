It has been well documented that zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso isolated from the creosote bush, zzso zzso has zzso activity in zzso and in zzso Several mechanisms have been identified that could contribute to these actions, as zzso directly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are established zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso the transforming growth factor beta zzso type I zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso In cultured cells, zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso treatment and by a zzso active zzso of zzso type I zzso zzso zzso also inhibited downstream zzso zzso zzso by both zzso treatment and the zzso active zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso in crude cell zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso screening select zzso demonstrated that modification of zzso structure resulted in altered potency against the zzso These results indicated that the structure of zzso can be modified to achieve increased zzso Together our data provide a novel mechanism for zzso activity which could help explain its zzso activity, and suggest that zzso could serve as a structural motif for developing zzso zzso zzso with selectivity for zzso type I zzso
