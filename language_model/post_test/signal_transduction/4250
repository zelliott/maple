zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso results in growth, zzso and membrane trafficking zzso and in some strains zzso is zzso A previous study identified five genes which, in zzso rescue zzso strains of zzso zzso Now we report that one of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of the zzso zzso The zzso proteins are abundant zzso proteins of approximately 30 zzso with numerous zzso and a diverse array of reported zzso The zzso protein is zzso zzso identical to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso identical to a previously reported zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso Single deletions of zzso or zzso have no zzso zzso but deletion of both zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso although not as well as zzso In addition, the slow growth of viable strains of zzso zzso is further impaired when combined with single zzso zzso often resulting in zzso zzso of zzso genes also partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso restores zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso did not rescue zzso zzso These genetic interactions suggest that zzso zzso proteins are zzso and may play a role in both zzso transport and Ras signaling zzso
