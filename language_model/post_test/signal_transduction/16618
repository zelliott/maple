In this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso homocysteine influences synthesis and release of zzso zzso zzso which is deeply involved in vascular zzso and zzso plaque zzso zzso were carried out in cultured human zzso exposed to zzso zzso homocysteine after a 24-hour culture with zzso containing zzso zzso Both in zzso and cell zzso we evaluated zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso effects were investigated also after cell exposure to zzso specific zzso inhibitor zzso (30 zzso to evaluate the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso evidenced that zzso activity is increased both in zzso media and in cell zzso starting from zzso incubation with 100 zzso zzso Western zzso analysis evidenced increased zzso levels in both zzso media and cell zzso Cell exposure to zzso and zzso prevented homocysteine effects on zzso zzso zzso at zzso associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, increases zzso activity, synthesis and zzso in zzso through a mechanism involving the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that homocysteine is directly involved in mechanisms leading to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
