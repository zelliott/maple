zzso and zzso studies suggest that diets that are rich in zzso zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso zzso reduce the risk of colon zzso Studies conducted in our laboratory have indicated that synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is less toxic and more effective than zzso zzso and zzso the major zzso compound in natural zzso zzso Through zzso zzso analysis, we have demonstrated earlier that the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso modulated more than one signaling zzso by altering several genes involved in colon cancer zzso There is increasing interest in the use of combinations of low doses of zzso agents that differ in their specific modes of action as this approach can minimize toxicity and increase efficacy in model zzso In the present study we assessed the efficacy of zzso and zzso individually and in combination at low doses in zzso colon cancer cells, using cell growth zzso and zzso as measures of zzso zzso On the basis of western zzso and zzso analysis, we also determined the effects of zzso and zzso on the levels of expression of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso all of which presumably participate in colon zzso A 48 h incubation of zzso cells with 5 zzso each zzso or zzso induced cell growth zzso and zzso and altered the expression of the above molecular zzso Interestingly, the zzso of these cellular and molecular parameters was more pronounced in cells treated with low doses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso each) in combination than in cells treated with these agents individually at higher zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings are viewed as highly significant since they will provide the basis for the development of combinations of low dose regimens of zzso and zzso in zzso models against colon zzso and, ultimately, in human clinical zzso
