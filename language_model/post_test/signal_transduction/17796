Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso produces a zzso called zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso environment where it zzso iron, and the resulting zzso complexes are transported back into the bacteria by a cell surface zzso protein zzso zzso also acts as a zzso zzso inducing the production of three zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso a signal to the zzso part of the zzso zzso factor zzso The signal is transmitted to the zzso part of zzso which controls the activity of an zzso family zzso zzso factor protein zzso This results in the production of the zzso factors zzso zzso A and zzso zzso Here, we show that a second divergent branch of this zzso zzso regulates the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the activity of a second zzso zzso factor, zzso which is required for the synthesis of zzso and the presence of zzso greatly increases the activity of zzso so that production of zzso is zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a zzso zzso system of this sort and the first example of an zzso factor protein zzso that directly regulates the activities of two different zzso zzso factor proteins zzso and zzso
