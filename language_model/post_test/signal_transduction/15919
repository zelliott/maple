zzso acid zzso is an important zzso that regulates plant growth, development, dormancy and stress zzso Recently, it was discovered that zzso is produced by a wide range of animals including sponges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and by various zzso zzso and cells zzso pancreatic cells, and zzso stem zzso zzso is a universal signaling zzso that stimulates diverse functions in animals through a signaling zzso that is remarkably similar to that used by plants; this zzso involves the sequential binding of zzso to a membrane zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso which results in the overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the stress response zzso and light) in animal cells, immune responses in zzso insulin release from pancreatic zzso cells, and the expansion of zzso and colon stem zzso zzso also zzso the growth and zzso the differentiation of cancer zzso Unlike some drugs that act as cell zzso zzso when functioning as a growth regulator, does not have significant toxic side effects on animal zzso Research indicated that zzso is an zzso immune regulator in animals and has potential medicinal applications for several human zzso This article summarizes recent advances involving the discovery, signaling pathways and functions of zzso in zzso
