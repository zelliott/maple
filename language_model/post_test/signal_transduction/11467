zzso studies have identified zzso in key regulators of the zzso zzso in a variety of zzso most frequently in colon zzso However, whether the zzso is activated in clinical cancer samples is not easily determined, and therefore it is useful to find markers that could be surrogates to show zzso of the zzso zzso Gene expression profiles were analyzed in zzso a colon cancer cell line in which zzso levels are stabilized as a consequence of truncated zzso zzso coli and were compared with profiles of the same cells zzso with zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in the levels of zzso and human naked zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the proteins zzso by both of these zzso are known zzso of the zzso zzso In 30 human cell lines derived from different origins, zzso and zzso were expressed only in human colon cancer cell lines that are known to have zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Further, levels of both zzso and zzso zzso were also found to be elevated in about zzso of laser zzso cells from human colon tumors compared with laser zzso cells of normal zzso from the same patient zzso The increased expression of zzso and zzso correlated with zzso in zzso zzso coli in the same patient zzso These results reveal that it is possible to detect zzso of a zzso zzso in human cancer samples with specific zzso
