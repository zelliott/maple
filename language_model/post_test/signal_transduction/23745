zzso between the immune and skeletal systems in inflammatory bone diseases are well zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms that coordinate the resolution phase of inflammation and bone turnover have not been zzso Here we investigated the direct actions of the zzso zzso zzso E1 zzso on zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso model of zzso maturation and inflammatory bone zzso Investigation of the actions of zzso treatment on the specific stages of zzso maturation revealed that zzso targeted late stages of zzso maturation to decrease zzso formation by zzso zzso vital zzso and migration zzso confirmed that membrane fusion of zzso precursors was zzso The zzso fusion protein zzso was specifically targeted by zzso zzso binding and was zzso by zzso zzso did not affect the induction of the essential zzso zzso factor nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso or its nuclear zzso however, zzso binding to the zzso promoter was significantly inhibited by zzso with zzso treatment as shown in zzso mobility shift zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso act directly on zzso in addition to zzso of zzso providing a novel mechanism for modulating zzso signaling in zzso inflammatory zzso
