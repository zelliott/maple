The zzso zzso is not only involved in cell zzso but also acts as an zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, and its expression is increased in human zzso An irreversible zzso of zzso such as oxidized zzso zzso might block zzso zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso we carried out basic studies to test this idea and to examine the feasibility of using zzso to treat zzso zzso We first found that zzso conditions zzso the zzso and zzso commonly seen in solid zzso induced zzso zzso zzso release from zzso melanoma zzso Then, we compared the proliferation rates of zzso melanoma zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso clone zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso The proliferation rate, as well as the zzso release, of zzso zzso cells was lower than that of zzso zzso zzso Next, the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso melanoma cell growth was examined in zzso and in zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso melanoma cell proliferation in zzso and also significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso released zzso may serve as an zzso signaling zzso We propose that the zzso zzso is a promising target for treatment of solid zzso
