All species need an immediate reply to the microbial pathogens that is part of an effective immune response and is essential for the survival of most zzso This reply is known as the innate immune response and is characterized by the de zzso production of zzso that either kill the microbes directly or activate zzso cells to zzso and kill zzso The innate immune response can be driven through specific recognition systems, the best example being an interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso For a long time, the brain was considered to be a privileged organ from an zzso point of view, zzso to its inability to mount an immune response and process zzso Although this is partly true, the zzso shows a well-organized innate immune reaction in response to systemic bacterial infection and cerebral zzso The zzso and zzso receptors are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is able to cause a rapid zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso and zzso as well as a wide variety of zzso molecules in zzso A delayed response to zzso takes place in cells located at boundaries of the zzso and in zzso across the zzso zzso without having direct access to the brain zzso pathogens have the ability to trigger an innate immune reaction throughout cerebral zzso This review presents evidence supporting the existence of such a system in the brain, which is finely regulated at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this system is not harmful toward zzso zzso
