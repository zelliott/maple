In the zzso germ line, zzso small interfering zzso zzso ensure zzso stability by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso involves small zzso of zzso zzso that are mainly produced from the zzso strand and function through the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of the zzso family of zzso interference zzso zzso which are expressed in the zzso and in surrounding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition to this zzso zzso zzso has also been implicated in diverse functions in zzso zzso 

Here, we show that two zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso are silenced by an zzso zzso zzso that has characteristics of the zzso zzso and that specifically recognizes and destroys the zzso zzso of the zzso This zzso depends on zzso in the zzso cells surrounding the zzso Interestingly, this zzso is active in all the zzso zzso examined from zzso to adult zzso In these zzso cells, while the zzso still involves the strict recognition of zzso zzso it displays the marked difference of being independent of the zzso zzso Finally, we present evidence that in all the zzso zzso the repression is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso 

Our data shed further light on the zzso mechanism that acts to target zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells throughout fly zzso They demonstrate that different zzso zzso pathways are involved in zzso versus other zzso zzso since zzso is necessary for zzso in the former zzso but is zzso in the zzso They further demonstrate that these pathways are controlled by the zzso zzso locus which ensures the overall protection of zzso against the zzso effects of random zzso zzso
