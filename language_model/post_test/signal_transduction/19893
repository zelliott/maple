Small molecules stabilize specific protein zzso from a larger ensemble, enabling molecular switches that control diverse cellular zzso We show here that the converse also holds zzso the zzso state of the zzso zzso can direct distinct zzso of the bound zzso zzso zzso that mimic the effects of zzso in driving protein zzso allowed zzso of the partial zzso zzso zzso with both the zzso active and inactive zzso of the zzso zzso The intermediate zzso activity induced by zzso is associated with the zzso binding differently to the active and inactive zzso of the zzso zzso of a series of chemical derivatives demonstrated that altering the ensemble of zzso binding zzso changes signaling zzso The zzso of different zzso binding zzso to distinct active and inactive protein zzso defines a new mechanism for zzso zzso signaling zzso
