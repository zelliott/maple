Adult stem cells act as a zzso source of zzso cells during tissue zzso Despite expanded research in stem cell biology, understanding how growth and migration of zzso adult zzso stem cells zzso are governed by interactions with growth factors is very zzso One important property of zzso is the presence of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the cellular response to soluble zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was proven by zzso and Western zzso Signal zzso was analyzed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused robust zzso of zzso and zzso which could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso proliferation was determined by zzso zzso Stem cell migration was analyzed in a modified zzso zzso zzso with zzso led to cell proliferation and induced cell migration, but did not change the zzso state of the zzso In the zzso injured zzso zzso cells express high amounts of zzso zzso our results may highlight a mechanism underlying zzso zzso Thus, future in zzso studies that focus on the effects of zzso on recruitment of zzso to sites of injury are zzso
