The regulation of zzso cell zzso proliferation and zzso is critical to nerve zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso regulate the activity of different zzso in SC including zzso zzso zzso C and zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso These effects imply a possible participation of zzso in the regulation of SC zzso We have now investigated the effects of zzso on the proliferation and zzso of zzso and compared them with the responses to zzso growth factor zzso a known zzso in these zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso increased the incorporation of zzso and the proportion of SC in S and zzso with a zzso decrease in the zzso stage zzso Treatment with zzso produced rapid changes in the zzso of the zzso characterized by the appearance of cell spreading with shorter zzso The response to zzso was considered to represent a zzso zzso in contrast to the effects of zzso which decreased zzso incorporation in immortalized SC zzso and lead to a differentiated zzso with longer zzso While both zzso and zzso displayed a zzso effect on zzso treatment with zzso did not affect the zzso of these cells to a significant zzso A role for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the changes in zzso and proliferation of zzso driven by zzso was suggested by the effects of selective zzso of these pathways zzso and zzso zzso The unique pattern of signaling pathways recruited by zzso and its combined effects on regulation of zzso and proliferation of SC suggest an important role for this zzso during nerve zzso
