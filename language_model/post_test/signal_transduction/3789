The zzso nature of zzso release is apparently regulated by alternating sequential changes in two zzso hormones, zzso releasing hormone zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso appears to involve zzso negative zzso Recently a new zzso involved in zzso release was zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso peptides and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is associated with increased zzso zzso and electrical activity in zzso containing zzso zzso We show that zzso mice with zzso blocks zzso of these zzso by zzso Similarly, zzso inhibited the action of zzso To determine whether this zzso negative feedback on zzso zzso was zzso or by zzso stimulation of zzso release from zzso zzso we selectively zzso the gene for one of the five specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the knockout mice, both zzso and zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso did, however, increase zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus, consistent with zzso stimulation of zzso release from zzso zzso Thus, zzso negative feedback involves signaling between zzso and zzso zzso with the signal being zzso specifically through zzso zzso 2 zzso
