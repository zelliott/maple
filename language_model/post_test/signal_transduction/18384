We explored the role of zzso protein signaling in the regulation of zzso zzso production and T helper cell type 1 zzso T cell zzso In initial studies, we showed that treatment of normal mice with zzso toxin zzso which zzso zzso protein zzso enhanced the capacity of zzso to produce zzso in response to both microbial and zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment increased the production of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso by zzso zzso These findings were zzso by the fact that zzso zzso mice exhibited enhanced production of zzso and zzso by zzso and of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we showed that while normal zzso mice infected with zzso major exhibited a zzso zzso those treated with zzso when infection was initiated exhibited a healing zzso along with an enhancement of zzso zzso responses in draining zzso zzso Further, healing was prevented by zzso of zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso protein signaling has a primary role in the regulation of zzso production and the induction of zzso responses in zzso
