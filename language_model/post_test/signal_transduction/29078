As a zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso system, carbon monoxide zzso has been neglected for many years, and only recently has its role as an essential signaling zzso been zzso In the past decade, the use of CO gas in zzso experimental models of disease has produced some remarkable data indicating that its therapeutic delivery to zzso could alleviate inflammatory processes and cardiovascular zzso However, the inherent toxic nature of CO cannot be ignored, knowing that inhalation of uncontrolled amounts of this gas can ultimately lead to serious systemic complications and zzso zzso From a clinical perspective, a key question is whether a safe and zzso effective threshold of CO can be reached locally in zzso and zzso without delivering potentially toxic amounts through the zzso The advent of zzso molecules zzso a group of compounds capable of carrying and liberating controlled quantities of CO in cellular systems, appears a plausible alternative in the attempt to overcome the limitations of CO zzso Although in its infancy and far from being used for clinical applications, the zzso technology is supported by very encouraging biological results and reflected by the chemical versatility of these compounds and their endless potential to be transformed into zzso zzso
