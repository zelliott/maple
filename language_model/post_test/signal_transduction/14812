We previously identified zzso zzso as a gene contributing to the risk of developing zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso zzso mice display behavioral abnormalities that are reversed by zzso an zzso antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of zzso We now present evidence that zzso zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso interacts with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of cells expressing zzso and zzso leads to the association of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso stimulates zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a key regulatory site that zzso channel zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso mice, and this zzso can be reversed by zzso at a dose that reverses their behavioral zzso We also demonstrate that short-term synaptic plasticity is altered and zzso long-term zzso is impaired in zzso zzso mice, and incubation of zzso slices from these mice with zzso reversed those zzso zzso zzso signaling through zzso may contribute to the zzso of schizophrenia through dysfunction of zzso zzso Thus, our data support the zzso hypothesis of zzso
