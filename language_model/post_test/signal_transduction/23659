In plant cells, zzso and zzso routes intersect at the zzso network zzso zzso zzso where zzso are further sorted correctly and in a timely zzso zzso sorting is essential for plant survival and therefore zzso complex molecular zzso zzso proteins zzso play key roles in this process by recruiting coat proteins and selecting zzso for different zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was recently identified at the zzso and shown to be essential for zzso However, little was known about other cellular activities affected by zzso in zzso or the zzso consequences of such zzso We report here that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is essential for protein sorting at the zzso zzso loss of zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso some of which were suggestive of disrupted zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso was compromised in the zzso In addition, cell zzso was zzso We further demonstrate that zzso is critical for zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a key link in the sophisticated trafficking network in plant zzso
