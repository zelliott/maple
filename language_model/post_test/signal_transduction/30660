zzso zzso by nuclear hormone receptors is well zzso but their cooperation with other signaling pathways to activate zzso remains poorly zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso induce zzso differentiation of acute zzso leukemia zzso cells in a synergistic zzso We used the promoter of zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso to model the mechanism underlying the cooperative induction of target genes by zzso and zzso We show a functional zzso response element in the zzso promoter, which is zzso bound by zzso in zzso zzso zzso stimulates release of zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso proteins and additional zzso factors to the promoter, but these changes cause only a modest induction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso binding of zzso to the promoter, which is crucial for full induction of zzso Furthermore, zzso plus zzso greatly enhanced the level of zzso Pol II zzso on the zzso promoter, via synergistic recruitment of zzso We propose that zzso mediates zzso of zzso to facilitate binding of zzso factors, which cooperate to enhance Pol II zzso providing a mechanism zzso nuclear receptors interact with other signaling pathways on the level of zzso
