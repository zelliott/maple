zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso constituent zzso in a number of human inherited disorders collectively referred to as zzso The occurrence and significance of zzso zzso interplay with signaling molecules is an old question, suggested by pioneer studies performed in zzso However, this relevant question has remained substantially zzso until data obtained in cellular and zzso models of zzso have indicated two main aspects of zzso A zzso The first aspect is that zzso establish functional interactions with different protein platforms, the second aspect is that zzso zzso activity and altered function may elicit different effects in different cells and tissue types and even in different districts of the same zzso Both these observations strongly suggest that signaling mechanisms targeting zzso zzso or its binding partners may regulate such a plastic zzso A number of very recent data show involvement of zzso as zzso and zzso or zzso as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cellular zzso Moreover, altered zzso of signaling in zzso and rescue of the pathological zzso in animal models by zzso of signaling zzso strongly suggest that signaling zzso related to zzso zzso may be implicated in the zzso of zzso and may represent targets of therapeutic zzso In face of such an open perspective of basic and applied research, we review current evidence of zzso zzso interplay with signaling zzso with particular emphasis on the zzso zzso interaction and on the biological significance of their zzso
