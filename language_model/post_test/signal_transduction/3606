The four protein complexes termed zzso sorting complexes required for transport zzso are key zzso of zzso body zzso zzso budding and cell zzso which share a membrane deformation process with the same zzso change: zzso budding away from the zzso Independent studies of the signal zzso pathways that mediate ambient pH sensing and adaptation in zzso and zzso revealed that these pathways share a zzso signaling mechanism that zzso zzso complexes for its zzso This zzso in zzso termed the zzso pathway, consists of both a sensing complex, which senses ambient alkaline zzso and a zzso complex, which zzso and thereby activates the key zzso factor zzso Since the zzso complex is thought to be formed and activated on a platform of a zzso zzso component zzso the organization, regulation and function of this zzso are dependent on the function of zzso zzso
