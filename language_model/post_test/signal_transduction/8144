Plants have evolved a variety of responses to elevated temperatures that minimize damage and ensure protection of cellular zzso New information about the structure and function of heat stress proteins and molecular zzso has become zzso At the same time, zzso analysis of zzso has revealed the involvement of factors other than classical heat stress responsive genes in zzso Recent reports suggest that both plant hormones and zzso oxygen species also contribute to heat stress zzso Additionally, an increasing number of zzso that have altered zzso have extended our understanding of the complexity of the heat stress response in zzso
