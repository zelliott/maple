Although it is well established that zzso of the zzso zzso triggers zzso via the zzso zzso during zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso it remains to be determined which zzso components are responsible for the zzso zzso and stabilization of zzso Here, we analyzed the expression pattern and neighborhood relationship of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein is highly enriched in the zzso fraction and is predominantly expressed in zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a drastic decrease in the relative abundance of this zzso Chemical zzso showed a potential overlap between the zzso zzso face membrane protein and the zzso zzso zzso channel, suggesting tight zzso interactions between these two zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle proteins have a strong tendency to zzso and the zzso region of skeletal muscle fibers forms zzso membrane complexes involved in the regulation of zzso and signal zzso
