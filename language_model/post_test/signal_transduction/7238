Abstract The production of various zzso zzso species in excess of zzso zzso defense mechanisms promotes the development of a state of zzso stress, with significant biological zzso In recent years, evidence has emerged that zzso stress plays a crucial role in the development and perpetuation of zzso and thus contributes to the zzso of a number of debilitating zzso such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, or neurodegenerative zzso zzso affect all stages of the inflammatory response, including the release by damaged zzso of molecules acting as zzso danger signals, their sensing by innate immune receptors from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso families, and the zzso of signaling pathways initiating the zzso cellular response to such zzso In this article, after zzso the basic aspects of zzso biology and zzso we review in detail the current knowledge on the fundamental connections between zzso stress and inflammatory zzso with a special emphasis on the danger zzso zzso group zzso the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso as well as the zzso factor nuclear zzso
