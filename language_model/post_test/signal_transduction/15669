We investigated regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso playing an essential role in the maintenance of surface fluid in human airway zzso zzso zzso The present study reports that zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduction of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso stimulates zzso zzso by zzso an entry step of zzso across the zzso membrane through zzso zzso zzso To clarify the mechanism stimulating zzso by zzso we verified involvement of protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or a zzso zzso agent did not affect the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso inhibitor zzso significantly diminished the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso without zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso is involved in the zzso action of zzso The zzso action on zzso zzso was suppressed with zzso A zzso an inhibitor of zzso transport from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was not observed in the presence of an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso stimulates zzso zzso by causing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or an zzso factor to the zzso membrane in human airway zzso zzso zzso However, the surface density of zzso was not increased by zzso but zzso elevated the activity of zzso These observations indicate that zzso stimulates zzso zzso by zzso zzso via zzso of an zzso factor through an zzso zzso zzso
