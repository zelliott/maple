Both zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso and their associated zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the development of zzso This study examined the effects of naturally occurring chronic zzso chronic zzso on spinal zzso processing in sheep and focused on potential zzso in spinal PG and NO signaling zzso Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were significantly lower in animals suffering from chronic inflammation zzso compared to control animals zzso zzso was restricted to the side zzso to the inflammation zzso from zzso side: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced zzso in zzso and cervical spinal zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso X zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso animals relative to control zzso No difference was detected in zzso or zzso or in zzso zzso a marker of zzso active zzso zzso failed to detect any change in levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, a marked increase in the zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso was detected in zzso spinal zzso tissue from animals with chronic zzso This increase in zzso zzso expression indicates that spinal zzso are important in the spinal response to chronic peripheral zzso zzso mechanical zzso may not be directly linked to changes in spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the bilateral changes in zzso suggest that this zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso response zzso
