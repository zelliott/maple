zzso zzso is a soft tissue zzso with poor prognosis and lack of response to conventional zzso zzso The regulatory mechanisms for the rapid proliferation of zzso zzso cells and the particular aggressiveness of this zzso remain poorly zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso have been shown to play important roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso BAY zzso a potent zzso activated factor zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling zzso both in zzso and in zzso In this study, we examined the zzso proliferation effects of zzso in zzso zzso growth and evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Our results indicated that zzso effectively inhibited cellular proliferation and zzso zzso of these two zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso levels, caused zzso arrest and S phase decrease, and induced zzso as confirmed by flow zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso levels significantly zzso whereas expression levels of the proteins zzso and zzso were unchanged in response to zzso treatment in zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that zzso is effective for growth zzso of zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and suggest that zzso may be a new therapeutic option for patients with zzso zzso
