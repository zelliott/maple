zzso is implicated in the regulation of complex zzso zzso zzso and cognitive zzso However, the zzso mechanisms zzso this neurotransmitter exerts its actions remain largely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of molecular weight zzso is a zzso that has primarily been characterized in relation to zzso zzso Here we report that zzso regulates zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors causes an increased zzso state at zzso the protein zzso A site, and a decreased zzso state at zzso the zzso zzso 5 zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso receptors increases the zzso state of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso effects induced by compounds that selectively release zzso were greatly reduced in zzso knockout zzso Our data indicate that zzso is essential not only for zzso but also for zzso zzso
