To develop a primary human zzso zzso cell model for chronic zzso leukemia zzso and study signal zzso and molecular regulation mechanisms in zzso 

We developed a human model of zzso positive zzso by zzso normal human zzso zzso blood zzso cells with a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso We also examined whether this model recreated the cellular zzso of zzso by assessing cell zzso cell migration, cell proliferation and cell zzso 

We found that significantly more zzso colony forming units grew from zzso expressing cells, zzso of zzso expressing zzso cells to zzso was decreased but migration over zzso was enhanced compared with mock zzso zzso zzso In this model, we showed that the presence of zzso leads to elevated levels of zzso in zzso expressing zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso expressing cells which zzso with the expression of zzso 

This primary human zzso model recreates most of the features of zzso and provides a useful tool to study signal zzso and downstream molecular regulation zzso by the zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso
