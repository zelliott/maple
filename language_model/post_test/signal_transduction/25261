zzso is a normal zzso process which eliminates cells that do not receive adequate zzso zzso One of the pathways zzso zzso is controlled by the small zzso of the zzso family, also involved in cell zzso differentiation and zzso Another major zzso zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso zzso which is activated by a variety of stress and mediates growth arrest or zzso in normal zzso We show here that upon detachment from the zzso zzso zzso undergo rapid zzso that can be rescued by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso efficiently triggers zzso in adherent zzso Interestingly, zzso is not observed in zzso cells either cultured in suspension or inhibited for zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso extinction in normal cells activates zzso zzso Using specific zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate that, in our experimental system, zzso signals survival, while zzso activity is required for zzso Our data constitute the first demonstration that zzso and zzso control pathways that require simultaneous zzso through zzso zzso and zzso to induce zzso
