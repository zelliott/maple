zzso undergo complex sequences of precisely timed events during the process of zzso These zzso events, which comprise zzso egg recognition, zzso reaction, and zzso fusion, are regulated by the zzso of different zzso signaling zzso The efficacy and accuracy of signal zzso pathways often depend on the assembly of zzso signaling complexes, thereby zzso and guiding the flow of regulatory zzso To address the question whether zzso zzso the most abundant protein interaction zzso involved in the assembly of zzso signaling complexes, are present in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso approaches were performed with specific primer pairs for the zzso zzso zzso domain protein zzso The results revealed that this scaffolding zzso which comprises 13 different zzso zzso is expressed in mouse zzso To obtain further support for the expression of the zzso domain protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments were performed using a zzso zzso zzso analyses of the spatial zzso profile revealed that zzso is concentrated within the zzso region of round as well as zzso mouse zzso These results were confirmed in experimental approaches demonstrating that zzso zzso was shed off from the zzso region after zzso zzso To examine whether zzso is also present in other zzso zzso zzso approaches were performed with isolated bovine as well as human zzso The results revealed prominent zzso expression which was restricted to the zzso zzso region and, most notably, to the equatorial segment of the zzso The zzso expression profile of zzso in zzso of different zzso species suggests that this zzso protein may be involved in organizing signaling molecules zzso primary reactions of zzso
