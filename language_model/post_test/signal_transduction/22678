In recent years it became clear that zzso possess a host of zzso channels that may be distributed zzso over their membrane zzso In cortical zzso for example, it was demonstrated that the resting membrane zzso zzso is higher (the membrane is zzso at zzso zzso regions than at more zzso zzso How does this spatial zzso in zzso affect the zzso function of the zzso The present study aims at providing basic insights into this zzso To this end, we have zzso studied the fundamental effects of membrane zzso in passive cable zzso Keeping the total membrane zzso over a given modeled structure fixed zzso a constant number of passive zzso zzso the classical case of cables with uniform membrane zzso is contrasted with various zzso cases with the following general zzso zzso For zzso cables with zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso improves zzso transfer from the input location to the zzso The steeper the zzso the larger the zzso zzso This effect is further enhanced when the stimulation is zzso and consists of a synaptic input rather than a current zzso zzso Any zzso in zzso decreases the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The system time constant zzso is larger in the zzso case than in the corresponding uniform zzso zzso When zzso zzso relax with zzso the zzso tree is not zzso in the zzso case, at zzso with the uniform zzso The effect of membrane zzso on signal transfer in reconstructed zzso trees and on the zzso relation of the zzso is also considered, and experimental methods for assessing membrane zzso in zzso are zzso
