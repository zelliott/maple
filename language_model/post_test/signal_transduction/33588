We used peripheral nerve zzso already employed clinically to reconstruct devastating peripheral nerve injuries, to study zzso cell zzso plasticity in adult zzso By modulating the zzso treatment zzso we were able to study zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in transgenic mice whose zzso expressed zzso under regulatory elements of either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly expressed zzso while zzso expression was zzso by zzso and in some cases, zzso were zzso labeled with zzso to enable in zzso zzso zzso imaging of these mice demonstrated that zzso zzso were rejected within 20 zzso Cold preserved zzso zzso required an initial phase of SC migration that preceded zzso zzso thus delaying zzso and maturation of the SC zzso Mice zzso with zzso demonstrated mild zzso zzso but the most robust zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and motor zzso zzso While characterized by fewer zzso zzso mice treated with the zzso blockade zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated virtually no graft rejection during the 28 day experiment, and had significant increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with any other zzso These results indicate that even with SC zzso nerve zzso can occur to some degree, particularly with zzso zzso However, we found that zzso blockade facilitate optimal zzso formation and maturation of zzso as indicated by protein expression of zzso basic protein zzso zzso and zzso
