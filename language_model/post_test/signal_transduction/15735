zzso zzso factors released from the stressed gut during shocked states contribute to the development of acute lung injury zzso and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome zzso Since zzso receptors zzso act as sensors of tissue injury as well as microbial invasion and zzso signaling occurs in both zzso and zzso models of zzso zzso injury, we hypothesized that factors in the zzso zzso zzso after trauma zzso shock zzso mediate zzso lung injury via zzso zzso 

The concept that factors in zzso zzso zzso the gut recreates zzso is evidenced by our findings that the infusion of zzso zzso collected from animals subjected to global zzso injury, into zzso zzso zzso mice induced lung zzso Using zzso mice that harbor a zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso was necessary for the development of zzso zzso zzso lung injury as determined by Evan's blue dye zzso lung zzso and zzso zzso levels as well as the induction of the zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fully and partially attenuated zzso zzso increases in lung zzso zzso Additional studies in zzso deficient mice showed that zzso zzso was not involved in the pathology of zzso zzso lung zzso Lastly, the zzso samples were devoid of bacteria, zzso and bacterial DNA and passage of zzso through an zzso removal column did not abrogate the ability of zzso zzso to cause lung injury in zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso factors in the zzso zzso zzso after zzso are capable of zzso zzso lung injury via zzso zzso
