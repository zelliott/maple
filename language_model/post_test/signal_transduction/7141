The dip in blood pressure during the zzso is paradoxically associated with an increase in total peripheral resistance and occurs at a time when the vascular response to zzso compounds is zzso and to zzso zzso However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for this zzso variation are not well zzso We have investigated the role of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso in the control of contraction in zzso resistance arteries using wire zzso combined with quantitative zzso analysis of gene zzso and western zzso analysis of zzso Small rings of zzso zzso isolated from rats at two opposing zzso corresponding to the zzso active and zzso were mounted in a wire zzso zzso exhibited a zzso variation in their zzso to zzso with a reduced zzso contraction during the zzso versus the zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were also more responsive to zzso with zzso during the zzso with an zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso in zzso vessels zzso These differences were abolished in the presence of zzso zzso zzso reveals a functioning peripheral zzso clock in zzso arteries and a zzso increase in zzso NO zzso zzso levels in zzso versus zzso vessels zzso which translated to a zzso increase in total zzso protein zzso The zzso variation in the response of zzso resistance vessels to zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso zzso
