The presence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease zzso and the loss of zzso zzso with the degree of zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated in tangle formation in zzso As a direct test of the requirement for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso actions in zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso precursor protein or zzso elevated their expression of zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso When such activated zzso were placed in zzso with primary zzso zzso a significant increase in the zzso of zzso zzso was accompanied by a decline in zzso zzso Similar effects were evoked by treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso attenuated the influence of activated zzso on zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso was zzso Some effects of zzso zzso on zzso appear to be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso because activated zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and an inhibitor of zzso reversed the influence of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results, together with previous zzso suggest that activated zzso may contribute to zzso pathology in zzso through their production of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso and synaptic zzso
