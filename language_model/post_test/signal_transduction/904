The development of the mouse zzso zzso occurs zzso zzso zzso of local growth factor pathways stimulates rapid zzso and branching of the zzso zzso through the fatty zzso Earlier studies showed that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso mediates this action of zzso In the present study we show that adult zzso zzso mice exhibit a marked reduction in levels of zzso zzso and liver zzso transcripts compared with zzso Whole mounts of the adult zzso zzso zzso revealed ducts that extended to the limits of the fat zzso however, the number of zzso branch points in the zzso tree of the zzso was reduced by half compared with that of zzso zzso In contrast, adult zzso mice with a zzso deletion of the zzso gene obtained by zzso zzso strategy maintained the normal levels of zzso zzso zzso transcripts and did not exhibit a branching deficit in this zzso It was previously reported that this specific loss of liver zzso causes serum levels of zzso zzso to decrease by approximately zzso whereas the levels of tissue zzso transcripts remain zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose that zzso not zzso zzso is important for zzso branching zzso
