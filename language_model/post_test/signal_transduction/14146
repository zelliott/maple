Energy zzso is crucial for maintaining normally functioning zzso disturbances in this balance often cause various zzso The limb region 1 zzso domain containing 1 gene zzso encodes the zzso protein that possesses 9 putative zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to be involved in the zzso in aiding the export of zzso In this study, we determined that zzso plays a regulatory role in the plasma zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso resulted in an zzso signaling of the insulin zzso zzso and its downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso and live total internal reflection zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and the zzso but not with the zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis and zzso rescue experiments indicate that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and is involved in the unique zzso zzso of the zzso zzso selectively interacts with the zzso The zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso recycling zzso and consequential enhancement of the zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso plays an imperative role in zzso and regulating the zzso of the zzso
