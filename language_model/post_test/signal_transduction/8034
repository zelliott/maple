zzso into a zzso state is an important survival strategy for many organisms when challenged by environmental stress, including low zzso cold temperatures and lack of food or zzso The molecular mechanisms that regulate transitions to and from zzso states, and stabilize long-term viability during zzso are proving to be highly zzso across zzso zzso A number of these mechanisms were identified and explored using zzso zzso as the model system, particularly from the research contributions made by Dr Peter zzso Lutz in his explorations of the mechanisms of zzso suppression in zzso zzso Here we review some recent advances in understanding the zzso mechanisms of zzso arrest with a focus on ideas such as the strategies used to reorganize zzso priorities for zzso zzso molecular controls that suppress cell functions zzso zzso zzso transcription, translation, cell cycle zzso changes in gene expression that support zzso and enhancement of defense mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that stabilize zzso and promote long-term viability in the zzso zzso
