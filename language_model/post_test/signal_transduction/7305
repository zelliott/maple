To investigate whether obesity zzso a zzso signaling axis in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso was determined in human zzso and zzso and mouse zzso cells and in zzso hosted by zzso lean and zzso obesity zzso zzso female zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated for 3 weeks with zzso inhibitor zzso 1 week after the zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso 3 and 4 in BC cells, but zzso expression showed opposite pattern in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso zzso showed that a functional zzso signaling axis was involved in the proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso onset was affected by obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso : p zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced BC growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso : p zzso zzso zzso did not influence the caloric intake of mice but increased carcass and/or body weights of lean and zzso mice zzso with zzso cells, which could be related to the improvement of health conditions (less aggressive zzso zzso BC from obese mice had higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso than lean zzso zzso of zzso signaling reduced protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and significantly decreased zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects were more prominent in zzso zzso Present data suggest that zzso zzso zzso which could be involved in the reported higher zzso and aggressiveness and, poor prognosis of BC in obese zzso
