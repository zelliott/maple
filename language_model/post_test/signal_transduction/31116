We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the regulation of feeding and energy expenditure in zzso We zzso that zzso may have a zzso action through its putative zzso zzso to mediate the central zzso effects of peripheral zzso zzso Here we examine the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on feeding in mice, including zzso zzso gene knockout animals zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso inhibited feeding in zzso mice under both zzso and nocturnal feeding zzso In contrast to the observations made in zzso mice, neither zzso nor zzso reduced food intake in zzso zzso The reduction in feeding and the release of zzso induced by systemic injection of the zzso zzso was similar in both zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso acting through zzso is involved in regulating food intake and may be a key zzso in the central zzso actions of zzso
