The nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso family of zzso factors has recently been implicated with a role in zzso zzso expression of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso has been shown to transform immortalized zzso zzso in zzso while zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been found in a number of human zzso where it has been shown to contribute towards various aspects of the tumor zzso Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of an zzso zzso that is sufficient to promote the transformed zzso We further demonstrate that this zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor via a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this effect of sustained zzso signaling on the zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso is not restricted to zzso zzso but is also observed in the zzso and zzso human cell zzso Most importantly, we find that the zzso depletion of zzso zzso significantly zzso the ability of zzso to transform zzso zzso Taken together, our results afford significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso potential of zzso zzso activity by demonstrating that zzso zzso activity zzso cells via an zzso zzso zzso that is critically dependent upon the activity of the zzso zzso zzso
