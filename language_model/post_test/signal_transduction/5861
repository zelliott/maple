Pulmonary zzso bodies zzso are densely zzso groups of complex sensory airway receptors involved in the regulation of zzso Together with their surrounding zzso cells, they exhibit stem cell potential through their capacity to zzso depopulated areas of the zzso following lung zzso We have employed zzso live cell imaging zzso and novel zzso techniques in a new ex zzso lung slice model to unravel potential zzso signaling pathways within the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated high amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using a zzso method adapted to create a uniquely sensitive and selective zzso for the direct detection of zzso release from zzso ex zzso we demonstrated zzso zzso release from zzso following their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso receptors confirmed the central role of zzso in zzso interactions between zzso cells and zzso zzso Combined calcium imaging, zzso and zzso showed that zzso to functional zzso receptors zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells communicate with their cellular neighbors in the zzso zzso by releasing zzso which rapidly evokes zzso zzso of surrounding zzso zzso Besides zzso acting on the zzso zzso expressing zzso sensory nerve terminals between zzso cells, local zzso zzso signaling within this potential stem cell niche may be important to both normal airway function, airway zzso zzso after injury, and/or the zzso of small cell lung zzso
