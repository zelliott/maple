The zzso zzso calcium channel zzso functions in zzso to regulate neurotransmitter zzso It comprises a clinically relevant target for chronic zzso We have validated a calcium zzso approach to assessing zzso pharmacology in two stable zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels were opened by addition of zzso and zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso on a zzso imaging plate reader zzso zzso expression and zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines responded to zzso with adequate zzso zzso from both cell lines were inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso stable, and zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso Other known zzso zzso were characterized including cadmium, zzso zzso and zzso zzso values correlated with literature zzso zzso Novel zzso pharmacology was identified in classes of compounds with other primary pharmacological activities, including zzso channel zzso and zzso Novel zzso channel compounds with high potency at zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso The highest potency at zzso zzso zzso identified was zzso
