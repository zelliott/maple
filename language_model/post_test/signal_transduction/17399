To reconstruct the evolutionary origin of zzso animals from their zzso ancestors, the zzso sequences of diverse zzso relatives are zzso However, only the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been reported to zzso Here we completely sequence the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the closest known zzso relative of zzso besides zzso zzso of this zzso alter our understanding of the molecular complexity of zzso zzso ancestors showing that they had a richer repertoire of proteins involved in cell zzso and zzso regulation than previously zzso only with the zzso zzso Some of these proteins were zzso lost in zzso In contrast, most zzso zzso systems controlling development evolved later zzso with the emergence of the first zzso We propose that the acquisition of these zzso zzso systems and the zzso of pre-existing genes drove the evolutionary transition from zzso zzso to zzso
