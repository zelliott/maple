zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as one of the zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso zzso has been described as a tumor zzso in various types of zzso However, the molecular function of zzso gene has never been examined in human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso functions as a tumor zzso gene and zzso of this gene may induce zzso and inhibit tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso revealed that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso samples and zzso cell lines, zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso promoter region in zzso cell lines showed it to be densely zzso whereas there was no zzso of zzso promoter in normal zzso zzso zzso of cell growth and colony formation in zzso cells compared with controls were zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso and suppressed in zzso tumor zzso Also, zzso signaling activity and zzso expression were reduced by zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first report documenting that the zzso is zzso by promoter zzso and functions as a tumor zzso gene by inducing zzso in zzso zzso
