The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso lower lip zzso cell zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso with regional zzso zzso and 20 zzso without zzso were selected for analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The percentage of positive cells was evaluated according to the following zzso score 1 zzso in zzso of zzso score 2 zzso in zzso of zzso and score 3 zzso in zzso of zzso zzso intensity was evaluated according to the following zzso score 1 zzso or weak zzso and score 2 zzso zzso 

Regarding the percentage of positive cells, most tumors with and without zzso showed score 3 for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso tumors exhibited higher percentage of positive cells in comparison with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso With respect to zzso intensity, most zzso with and without zzso showed score 2 for zzso zzso zzso zzso and score 1 for zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso most zzso tumors presented score 2, whereas most zzso tumors showed score 1 zzso zzso zzso Strong expression of zzso showed a statistically significant association with advanced clinical staging zzso zzso zzso and high score of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest that disturbances in the zzso signaling zzso may be involved in the development of zzso and that the strong expression of zzso might be indicative of the development of zzso in these zzso
