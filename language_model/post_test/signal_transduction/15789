zzso combined zzso with zzso produced a negative interaction and failed to improve survival when compared with chemotherapy or zzso alone in the treatment of zzso cell lung cancer zzso The present study investigated the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso and clarified the underlying zzso 

The effects on cell zzso zzso signaling pathway, and zzso expression were evaluated in a panel of human zzso cell lines harboring zzso zzso with three different combination zzso sequential treatment with zzso followed by zzso zzso sequential treatment with zzso followed by zzso zzso or zzso treatment zzso + zzso 

The zzso zzso effects differed between zzso and zzso cell lines carrying zzso zzso A synergistic zzso activity was obtained with zzso treatment followed by zzso in all cell lines, with mean zzso values of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso cells for the zzso zzso The mean zzso values for the zzso sequence were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The mean zzso values for zzso zzso treatment were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso compared with that in zzso controls zzso zzso zzso in zzso + zzso in zzso + zzso in zzso and + zzso in zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso sequence produced significantly greater zzso of zzso zzso compared with the opposite sequence zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and release are responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The data suggest that the sequence of zzso followed by zzso is an appropriate treatment combination for zzso cell lines harboring zzso zzso Our results provide molecular evidence to support clinical treatment strategies for patients with lung zzso
