The zzso B zzso zzso can undergo a zzso zzso resulting in an zzso zzso truncated zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso processing affects zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were zzso performing zzso zzso preparations and total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and its downstream zzso was investigated performing shedding zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso truncated but not the full-length or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In zzso zzso cells, only zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso to membrane zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, the zzso of zzso was efficient and zzso In zzso cells, the shedding activity was also impaired by zzso zzso The subsequent zzso zzso was long-lasting only for the full-length zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso might depend on the presence of zzso within the cell zzso The data further suggest that zzso enrichment of zzso receptors does not facilitate the release of zzso zzso zzso However, independent of their zzso zzso receptors are able to induce an zzso zzso
