zzso nuclear zzso B zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso We have shown that zzso has preferential loss of the zzso region where zzso exist, which is suggested to involve in zzso of zzso The mechanisms causing zzso activity in zzso remain zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be frequently zzso in diffuse large zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso status of these genes by direct sequencing in 24 zzso cases including 9 cases with loss of zzso previously identified by array comparative zzso zzso We showed that genetic zzso of these genes were not found in zzso a finding differing from that of most zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in other genes are likely to be relevant in zzso of zzso case without zzso zzso
