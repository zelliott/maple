The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso but its contributions to progression and zzso have not been zzso Here, we show that zzso is elevated in breast cancer as well as in zzso zzso and zzso tumors in which its expression level zzso positively with distant zzso zzso zzso in normal or zzso human zzso zzso cells increased their zzso properties in zzso and in zzso markedly increasing zzso transition zzso and the zzso capacity of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in aggressive breast cancer cells inhibited these zzso zzso we found that zzso modulated zzso zzso at the promoter of the zzso regulatory gene zzso in a manner associated with its zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, in human breast zzso zzso expression correlated positively with zzso expression and distant zzso Taken together, our findings reveal a pivotal role of zzso in regulating the zzso behavior of breast cancer zzso
