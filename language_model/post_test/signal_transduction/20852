Several lines of evidence indicate that interactions among transmission lines can take place at the level of the cell membrane via interactions among zzso integral or associated to the cell zzso involved in signal recognition and zzso The present view will focus on this last subject, zzso on the interactions between receptors for chemical signals at the level of the zzso membrane zzso zzso By zzso interaction we mean that a neurotransmitter or zzso by binding to its zzso zzso the characteristics of the zzso for another zzso or zzso Four types of interactions among transmission lines may be considered, but mainly zzso zzso interactions have been dealt with in this article, exemplified by the zzso of zzso receptors via zzso receptors and zzso zzso The role of zzso interactions in the integration of signals is discussed, especially in terms of zzso of incoming signals, of integration of zzso signals, and of zzso zzso
