zzso family proteins known as zzso have been characterized as structural components of zzso that stabilize and strengthen zzso by enhancing attachments with the intermediate filament zzso However, zzso and their close relatives are emerging as versatile scaffolds for multiple signaling and zzso processes that not only facilitate junction dynamics but also more globally regulate diverse cellular zzso While zzso of zzso functions contribute to inherited diseases and cancer zzso the functional significance of the multiple zzso zzso and the mechanisms by which their behaviors are regulated remain to be zzso
