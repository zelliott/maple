Type I zzso play an outstanding role in innate and zzso immunity by enhancing functions of zzso cells, inducing differentiation of zzso promoting zzso class switching in B cells and stimulating zzso functions of T zzso The increased production of zzso by zzso zzso cells could be responsible for not only efficient zzso zzso but it also may be a pathological factor in the development of various zzso zzso The first evidence of a genetic link between type I zzso and zzso diseases was the observation that elevated zzso activity is frequently detected in the zzso of patients with systemic lupus zzso and that this trait shows high zzso and familial zzso in their first-degree healthy zzso To date, a number of genes involved in zzso zzso have been associated with various zzso zzso Patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso syndrome, zzso zzso and a fraction of patients with zzso arthritis display a specific expression pattern of zzso genes in their zzso termed the zzso zzso Here, in an attempt to understand the role of type I zzso in the zzso of zzso we review the recent advances in the zzso of zzso diseases focusing on the association of genes involved in type I zzso zzso
