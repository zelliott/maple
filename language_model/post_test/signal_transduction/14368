Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso a highly nuclear zzso expressed in the zzso may participate in the control of zzso especially in regulating the production of zzso and inflammatory zzso cellular proliferation and zzso In order to delve into the zzso mechanisms and zzso pathways of zzso zzso we have studied the effects of zzso a zzso zzso on the extent and severity of acute zzso colitis caused by zzso administration of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso The inflammatory response was assessed by gross appearance, zzso zzso activity, zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso levels and a zzso study of the zzso We determined zzso zzso production as well as the zzso zzso and zzso expressions by zzso and Western zzso The nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression levels were also measured by Western zzso Finally, since zzso zzso zzso zzso we tried to clarify its effects under early acute inflammatory zzso zzso following zzso induction was characterized by increased zzso wall zzso zzso diffuse inflammatory cells zzso necrosis reaching an zzso index zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced the zzso zzso associated with zzso administration and the zzso with the highest zzso In addition, the degree of zzso zzso and the zzso levels were significantly zzso zzso significantly reduced the rise in the zzso zzso zzso generation compared with zzso zzso The zzso levels remained stable throughout the treatment in all zzso The zzso expression was elevated in zzso zzso however zzso administration reduced the zzso zzso A high expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins appeared in colon zzso from control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment drastically decreased zzso There were no significant changes in zzso after zzso treatment when compared to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso seems to zzso the acute colitis through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
