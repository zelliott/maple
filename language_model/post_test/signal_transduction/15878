zzso oxide zzso has been proposed to zzso zzso receptors zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso NO synthesis also can cause zzso cell zzso Using zzso zzso and cortical cell cultures, we have addressed the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso protected cortical cells from zzso death and led to zzso zzso In contrast, no evidence was gained for the presence of this protective zzso in zzso zzso in which zzso NO synthesis was confirmed to be zzso zzso opposing effects of NO depended on the zzso of different zzso zzso The zzso relevance of this observation was investigated in zzso and zzso zzso isolated from rat zzso and cerebral zzso following zzso zzso status zzso In zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso factor induced NO synthesis and inhibited zzso currents present in isolated zzso zzso In conclusion, we identified a zzso zzso response in the rat cerebral zzso induced by elevated zzso A low performance of this zzso in brain areas including the zzso may be related to their selective vulnerability in zzso such as zzso lobe zzso
