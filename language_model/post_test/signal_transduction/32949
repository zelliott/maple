Studies of animal models and human subjects with zzso suggest that cardiac zzso and zzso chamber zzso show distinct zzso characteristics that may be dependent on specific signaling zzso 

In this study, we characterize right zzso zzso chamber size, zzso zzso zzso mass, and ejection fraction zzso in human subjects with chronic heart failure from primary pulmonary hypertension zzso zzso zzso 10) and idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent gated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the zzso were zzso classified based on the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso and degree of wall thickness zzso v eccentric pattern of zzso Within this zzso five abnormal zzso could be zzso In zzso subjects, in whom the RV is subjected to the uniform insult of chronic pressure overload, four different abnormal zzso were zzso 

These data indicate that distinct zzso zzso chamber zzso may be classified by zzso and that a uniform insult can result in multiple RV zzso
