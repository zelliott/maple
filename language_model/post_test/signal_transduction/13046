zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an essential step in cell signaling by multiple hormones, zzso and growth factors, including growth hormone zzso and zzso Previously, we identified zzso beta as a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 96, zzso Here, we investigated whether the zzso of zzso by zzso beta is specific to zzso and zzso beta or extends to other zzso or other members of the zzso beta zzso When zzso beta was zzso with zzso or zzso zzso beta failed to increase their zzso However, zzso beta bound to both and was zzso by zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso a zzso of zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso of zzso but did not affect the activity or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso bound to and was zzso by all three zzso zzso with these data, in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in response to zzso and zzso These results suggest that 1) zzso beta specifically activates zzso 2) zzso zzso regulates both zzso and zzso and 3) both zzso beta and zzso may serve as adapter proteins for all three zzso independent of any role they have in zzso zzso
