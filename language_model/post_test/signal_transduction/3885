The zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be important in synaptic zzso zzso development, normal brain function and zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso cells, a zzso of rat zzso zzso cell line, release zzso oxide zzso as measured by in zzso zzso combined with electron zzso resonance zzso zzso when challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of NO production in zzso and zzso cells as observed by spin zzso Free zzso zzso zzso 22 (1997) zzso In the present study, we provide zzso evidence for the expression of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, that express only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid that expresses both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also show that treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso NO release by zzso zzso zzso and that this response can be attenuated by zzso the cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, there was no effect on zzso zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso Similar experiments were carried out using zzso cells since the binding properties and functional characteristics of their zzso receptors have been previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso using zzso influx and zzso binding as functional measures, zzso Brain zzso 22 zzso zzso Our results show that zzso cells significantly increase zzso levels when challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso over control zzso and that this response can be attenuated by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso changes in zzso levels was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not significantly changed by the addition of the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso II action on zzso zzso in zzso cells was completely inhibited by the addition of both the zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso NO and zzso production through a mechanism involving the zzso zzso zzso
