Animal studies have indicated that pancreatic zzso zzso cells have zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells can differentiate into zzso precursors that can be converted to pancreatic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about human zzso cell zzso We developed zzso and genetic lineage tracing methods to study the fate of human zzso cells in zzso 

Human zzso tissue was obtained from organ donors, zzso and zzso Cell proliferation and survival were measured, and cell zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso tracing methods were developed based on selective binding and zzso by zzso cells of a labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tracing methods were developed based on zzso introduction of a zzso reporter system, controlled by the zzso zzso 

Both tracing methods showed that human zzso cells can zzso into cells that express specific zzso zzso such as zzso 19, zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within 1 week of culture, all surviving zzso cells had acquired a zzso zzso This zzso was decreased by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells have plasticity similar to that described in zzso zzso These results might be used to develop therapeutic strategies for patients with diabetes or pancreatic zzso
