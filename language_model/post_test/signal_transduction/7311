zzso zzso zzso T cells, known as zzso zzso T cells zzso survey tissue stress through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors such as zzso zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso directly stimulates zzso in natural killer zzso cells and zzso zzso T cells to augment zzso zzso In activated zzso zzso cells, zzso signals also via the zzso zzso that triggers both zzso and zzso zzso It remains controversial whether zzso on zzso is a primary zzso zzso or functions only as a zzso zzso and signaling pathways initiated by zzso zzso in zzso have not been zzso We show that stimulation of short-term zzso lines with zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso signaling pathway, but does not induce zzso production or zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso signaling was not crucial for zzso killing of zzso zzso target zzso Thus, zzso can function as a zzso stress zzso that directly triggers zzso in zzso at least after zzso via the zzso zzso signaling zzso
