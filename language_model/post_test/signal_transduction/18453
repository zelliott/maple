In this study we zzso the effect of zzso novel protein zzso C delta zzso zzso zzso on zzso synthesis and zzso potential in the highly zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso The zzso capacity in zzso and into zzso in zzso were also zzso Although zzso zzso express the zzso delta zzso zzso cells do not express this zzso at levels zzso by Western zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells we also studied the effect of zzso zzso a zzso of specific zzso of zzso and of zzso 1, a potent zzso and zzso drug and a partial zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate a pivotal role for this zzso in zzso synthesis and the close relationship between zzso delta expression and its association with the particulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso cells zzso zzso delta and all the clones isolated showed increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 decreased zzso delta zzso the zzso zzso level and zzso capacity in both cell zzso Therefore both treatments were able to abolish the effects of zzso zzso zzso
