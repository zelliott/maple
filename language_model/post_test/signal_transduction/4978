zzso resistance zzso is one of the obstacles for leukemia therapy, the major cause is an zzso of zzso zzso leading to increased drug zzso We investigated the zzso of zzso resistance and the possible mechanism by which the zzso inhibitor zzso affects the expression of the zzso resistance gene zzso in the zzso cell zzso The drug resistance of the cells and the cellular toxicity of zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso drug zzso and cell zzso were detected by flow zzso The expression of zzso zzso was examined by zzso quantitative zzso The expression levels of nuclear zzso B zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso were detected by western zzso and zzso activity was detected by zzso zzso zzso increased in a zzso manner after adding zzso zzso decreased zzso degradation, decreased zzso and zzso zzso activity, reduced zzso zzso zzso and increased the zzso zzso concentration in zzso cells in zzso The zzso reversed zzso zzso resistance in a zzso manner as the result of decreasing zzso degradation, thus preventing the zzso of zzso into the nucleus and leading the zzso of zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso zzso the zzso drug concentration increased, and then zzso was zzso
