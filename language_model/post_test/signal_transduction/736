zzso a typical zzso zzso induced in tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suspension cells the synthesis of zzso oxygen species and zzso of the external medium that are dependent on the zzso of calcium from internal zzso We used specific zzso to zzso the signal zzso triggered by zzso compared with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso had no effect on the zzso burst and pH changes induced by both zzso Similarly, zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso A, had no effect on the induction of these defense zzso However, the response to both zzso was completely blocked by zzso a specific inhibitor of animal protein zzso C zzso The responses induced by zzso but not those induced by zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso C zzso On the other hand, the activity of zzso zzso zzso measured using a zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and not by cholesterol and zzso A specific inhibitor of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso by zzso but not that induced by zzso These results suggest that the zzso signal zzso leading to the zzso burst and zzso changes includes zzso and zzso whereas this response induced by zzso includes zzso and zzso
