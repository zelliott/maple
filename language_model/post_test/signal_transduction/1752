Vitamin C is present in the zzso as zzso acid, functioning primarily as a zzso for zzso reactions and as an zzso to zzso free zzso Human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso an increase in zzso oxygen species zzso and uses zzso for some signaling zzso We therefore investigated the effect of vitamin C on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with vitamin C decreased zzso levels of zzso and inhibited the production of zzso induced by zzso Vitamin C suppressed zzso zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso manner as was zzso of zzso zzso induced by both zzso 3 zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was suppressed by vitamin C zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso reporter construct containing zzso sites was also inhibited by vitamin zzso These results substantiate the importance of zzso in zzso signaling and indicate a role for vitamin C in zzso zzso signaling zzso Our findings point to vitamin C as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso in host defense cells and a possible role in controlling inflammatory zzso
