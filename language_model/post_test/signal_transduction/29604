zzso protein zzso zzso are involved in the negative regulation of zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso both zzso and zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso activity is essential for maintaining a low level of signaling through the cell integrity zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a role of this zzso on cell wall zzso cells lacking zzso displayed an increased sensitivity to the cell zzso compound zzso zzso We have observed that the zzso zzso region of this zzso was responsible for binding to the zzso domain of zzso the zzso that operates in this zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments revealed that both proteins act on each zzso zzso bound and zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a consequence of the zzso of the cell integrity zzso In addition, alternative use of translation initiation sites at zzso resulted in two protein forms that are functional on zzso and became equally zzso following zzso of this zzso Under zzso conditions, a decrease in the affinity between zzso and zzso was observed, leading us to suggest that the mechanism by which zzso controls the action of zzso was via the zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate the existence of zzso mechanisms of regulation of zzso in zzso and provide new insights into the negative control of the cell integrity zzso
