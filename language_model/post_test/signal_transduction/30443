The neural mechanisms through which the state of zzso arises and zzso remain zzso One common belief is that emergence from zzso is the inverse process of zzso brought about by elimination of zzso drugs from their zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso may result from specific interactions of zzso with the neural circuits regulating sleep and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have the potential to alter the stability of the zzso zzso In this report, we refine the role of the zzso zzso system in zzso emergence from, but not entry into the zzso state, and in doing so, we distinguish mechanisms of induction from those of zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso two commonly used general zzso inhibit zzso expression in zzso but not adjacent zzso hormone zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso are inhibited by these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which causes acquired zzso zzso delays emergence from zzso without changing zzso zzso zzso studies with a selective zzso zzso zzso confirm a specific zzso effect on zzso emergence without an associated change in zzso We conclude that there are important differences in the neural zzso zzso induction and zzso These findings support the concept that emergence zzso in part, on recruitment and stabilization of zzso regions of zzso
