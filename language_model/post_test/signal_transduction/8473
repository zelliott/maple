Safety concerns have arisen about the possibility of zzso agents zzso promoting tumor growth and increasing the zzso of zzso zzso events zzso Because of the reported presence of zzso receptors zzso on tumor cells, it was questioned if zzso had the potential for promoting tumor growth through stimulation of zzso and tumor vessels and/or enhanced tumor zzso Studies have shown that zzso zzso can be isolated from tumor cells, but the presence of zzso protein has not yet been proven because of a lack of specific zzso against zzso It is questionable whether zzso on tumor cells are functional and there is no evidence that zzso zzso the approved indication in patients receiving zzso can stimulate zzso on tumor cells in zzso zzso are frequent in cancer patients, resulting from the effects of zzso disease, cancer treatments, and zzso zzso are a leading cause of death in cancer zzso There are concerns about zzso and a possible higher risk for zzso and shorter survival in cancer zzso The higher risk for zzso associated with zzso appears to be a class effect, but the risk may be particularly pronounced when zzso are used off label, as seen in clinical trials that targeted zzso levels higher than those recommended by current zzso labeling and trials that enrolled patients who were not anemic at zzso zzso treatment should be used within labeling zzso
