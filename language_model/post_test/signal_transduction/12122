zzso is identified to lower the serum cholesterol level in human and zzso through the induction of low density zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To evaluate its potential in preventing zzso the effect of zzso on zzso development in zzso zzso zzso mice was zzso In zzso mice, zzso induced in zzso foam cell formation and promoted zzso zzso The foam cell formation induced by zzso was also observed in mouse zzso cells, as well as in mouse and human primary zzso By inducing scavenger zzso A zzso expression in zzso zzso increased the zzso of modified LDL zzso zzso zzso expression was also observed in zzso foam cells in zzso and in the cells at zzso zzso Analysis in zzso cells indicated that zzso induced zzso expression by suppressing zzso zzso which led to sustained zzso zzso Our results suggest that to evaluate the potential of a zzso compound in alleviating zzso its effect on the cells involved in zzso development, such as zzso should also be zzso zzso of foam cell formation could zzso the beneficial effect of lowering serum zzso
