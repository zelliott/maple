zzso is an important zzso zzso in the gut but its signaling system is not fully developed in the zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso This study aimed to evaluate the zzso maturation of zzso signaling in the small zzso 

In zzso zzso for real-time measurement of zzso at the zzso surface, zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso were used to examine zzso handling in zzso segments from guinea pigs of different zzso 

zzso zzso levels significantly declined over the first three zzso weeks, after which the levels increased and reached their maximum at 9 weeks zzso zzso levels were insensitive to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso until the animals reached 3 weeks zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso revealed that the zzso turnover was significantly lower in zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso expression was extremely low in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso showed that zzso zzso cells were zzso localized in the zzso region in zzso and the number of zzso cells was significantly higher in zzso zzso 

zzso expression is low in the zzso zzso and zzso signaling matures zzso zzso zzso levels decrease during the first three zzso weeks as zzso expression zzso zzso zzso levels increase after 3 weeks zzso possibly due to an increase in zzso cell zzso zzso maturation of zzso signaling zzso with dietary changes in the developing guinea zzso
