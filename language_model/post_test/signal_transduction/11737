The zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso The zzso effect was zzso zzso zzso fold over zzso levels, and the zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response in arteries with the zzso zzso removed was similar to the response in intact zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced parallel shifts of the zzso curve to zzso with the following order of potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso stimulation activates zzso zzso in cerebral zzso and that the zzso receptors zzso this increase are similar to the zzso zzso
