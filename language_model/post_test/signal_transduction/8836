Although zzso zzso zzso has been known to regulate many biological systems, including zzso cell differentiation and zzso it is not well understood how the zzso specificity of the zzso signaling is zzso While the zzso signal zzso is regulated in many ways, a direct zzso of zzso activity in zzso is not zzso Thus, examinations of zzso regulators will provide zzso but nonetheless important information to zzso the distribution of zzso zzso In the present study, three zzso of zzso zzso genes were identified from avian zzso and their expression patterns were examined during the zzso zzso zzso genes were strongly expressed in muscle, liver, and nervous system zzso suggesting their zzso roles on the zzso signaling in the development of these zzso
