zzso zzso stem zzso cells were first generated by forced expression of zzso factors zzso in zzso Recently, zzso cells have been generated more rapidly and efficiently using zzso with or without other zzso zzso However, the specific and collaborative roles of zzso and zzso factors in zzso acquisition and maintenance remain to be further zzso Here, based on the zzso profiling in mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 1, 2, 4, or 8 day, two zzso cell lines and zzso cells, representing zzso zzso and maintenance steps, we found that two unique zzso sets are responsible for different steps of zzso generation, and the zzso expression profiles of zzso cells are very similar to that of zzso zzso Furthermore, we searched for zzso factors binding sites at the promoter regions of zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso such as the zzso and zzso clusters are directly activated by zzso zzso The GO and zzso enrichment for candidate target gene sets of zzso or zzso provided a clear picture of division and collaboration between zzso and zzso during completion of the zzso zzso Compared with the pathways regulated by zzso we found that zzso play critical roles in regulating zzso zzso such as the zzso junction and zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, we blocked zzso expression using zzso zzso and found that the level of zzso was decreased following this treatment, and the efficiency of zzso generation was significantly zzso By combining zzso analysis, zzso analysis and functional experiments, this study provides new ideas for investigating the important roles of zzso the mechanisms of zzso and related signaling zzso and the potential for many more applications of zzso in zzso cell zzso
