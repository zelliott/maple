zzso zzso zzso is a frequent complication of zzso zzso This chronic lung disease results from arrested zzso airway development and is most common in infants exposed to inflammatory zzso In experimental models, inflammation zzso expression of zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso interactions during lung zzso however, the mechanisms connecting inflammatory signaling with reduced growth factor expression are not yet zzso In this study we found that soluble inflammatory zzso present in zzso fluid from zzso infants can prevent zzso airway zzso In addition, zzso treatment led to local production of zzso that inhibited airway branching and zzso expression in zzso zzso fetal mouse lung zzso Both direct zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso that activate zzso reduced zzso zzso whereas zzso that signal via other inflammatory pathways had no zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter failed to identify genetic elements required for direct zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso appeared to interfere with the normal stimulation of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso physically interact at the zzso zzso These findings indicate that inflammatory signaling through zzso zzso the normal expression of zzso in fetal lung zzso by interfering with the zzso machinery critical for lung zzso
