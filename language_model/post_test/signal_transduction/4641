zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor of zzso tuberculosis zzso is an important regulator of immune responses during zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso through the zzso zzso and initiate zzso inflammatory responses, leading to lung zzso zzso Although various immune cells are recruited to lung zzso the roles of other immune cells, especially during the initial process of zzso zzso are not zzso In this study, zzso signaling on zzso played an important role in zzso lung inflammation by promoting zzso and innate immune zzso zzso were recruited during the early stage of lung inflammation following zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso was required for zzso of zzso sites in a zzso model induced by zzso zzso zzso signaling on zzso increased cell adherence by enhancing zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso The zzso effects were dependent on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways by zzso and zzso treatment zzso induced zzso surface zzso zzso oxygen species, and zzso production by zzso These zzso immune responses correlated with the degree of zzso expression on zzso zzso The zzso relevance of the zzso zzso immune response was confirmed by defective immune responses in zzso mice upon zzso infections with zzso zzso mice had higher inflammation levels and zzso loads than zzso zzso zzso depletion with zzso zzso caused a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression upon zzso treatment, and reduced levels of immune cell recruitment during the initial stage of zzso These findings suggest a new role of zzso signaling on zzso during zzso zzso
