zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a central role in suppressing zzso by modulating the activities of zzso family proteins and/or zzso To study the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was examined using a simulated zzso model with cultured rat zzso zzso sealed in closed zzso zzso zzso treatment attenuated simulated zzso decline in the activity of zzso Although zzso treatment had no effect on the expression of zzso in zzso and the level of zzso zzso zzso it inhibited zzso zzso of zzso 9 and zzso Moreover, zzso transfer of the dominant negative form of zzso objected zzso zzso effects, zzso the suppression of zzso and zzso activities by zzso These findings provide the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso in cardiac zzso with the increase in zzso activities, by zzso zzso
