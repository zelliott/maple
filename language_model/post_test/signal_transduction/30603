zzso zzso can release a variety of zzso zzso that play a crucial role in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso is required for the induction of experimental zzso zzso Previously we demonstrated that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and that zzso are one cellular source of zzso in zzso zzso In the present study we investigated the zzso expression and regulation of zzso a key zzso of zzso in human zzso We demonstrated the zzso expression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Using signaling zzso zzso we showed that blocking zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso significantly reduced zzso expression in zzso The regulatory role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression was further confirmed by decreased expression in zzso zzso with zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways play an important role in regulation of zzso expression on human zzso and are thus potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of zzso
