zzso stimulates zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso in human subjects and cell zzso As recent advances have enabled the study of primary zzso L cells, this study aimed to characterize zzso pathways in native zzso L zzso L cells were identified using transgenic mice with zzso expression of fluorescent zzso zzso were studied in primary zzso cultures from adult mice, or zzso by flow zzso for expression zzso zzso zzso was monitored in cultures loaded with zzso and zzso was studied using zzso resonance energy transfer sensors expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso triggered zzso release from primary cultures, but zzso was the most zzso increasing zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso Several zzso acids triggered zzso changes in L cells, comparable in magnitude to that induced by zzso zzso zzso responses were abolished in low zzso solution and attenuated in zzso free solution, suggesting a role for zzso dependent zzso and zzso zzso The greater effectiveness of zzso as a zzso was paralleled by its ability to increase zzso in zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso to zzso of that produced by a zzso zzso whereas zzso only increased zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was without zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso in L cells, which may account for the effectiveness of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso agents like zzso that target synergistic pathways in L cells might play a future role in the treatment of type 2 zzso
