The immune system provides a highly sophisticated surveillance mechanism to detect diverse zzso and to protect the host zzso from invading pathogens and altered cells zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso immune responses depend on the recognition of zzso by specific zzso receptors that are expressed on the surface of T and B zzso zzso T cells provide regulatory functions and direct the zzso immune system to respond appropriately to a particular zzso zzso zzso T cell responses against viral infections and tumor cells, zzso responses against zzso bacteria and zzso zzso zzso T cells express zzso zzso which recognize zzso zzso on proteins expressed by the class II major zzso complex, the same proteins that present zzso to the T cell zzso Recent progress in T cell biology has identified multiple regulatory functions of zzso during zzso development and zzso stimulation of mature T helper zzso Signaling pathways induced by engagement of zzso independently of T cell zzso signaling mediate these regulatory zzso In this review, we discuss the regulation of T cell signaling and emphasize the functional consequences of proper and improper zzso zzso zzso
