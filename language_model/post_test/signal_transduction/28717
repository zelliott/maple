zzso is one of the most complex events in embryonic zzso However, little information is available regarding the molecular events that occur during zzso To identify regulatory genes and underlying mechanisms involved in the differentiation of embryonic stem zzso cells to zzso gene expression profiling was performed using zzso zzso In mouse zzso cells, we compared the gene expression of each differentiated cell stage using a zzso lineage selection zzso Of zzso zzso 1633 zzso known regulatory genes were zzso expressed at least zzso or greater at one or more zzso At stage 3, during which zzso cells differentiate into neural stem cells, zzso of nearly 1000 genes was zzso Most of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, 18, zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling molecules zzso zzso and zzso family zzso and zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso were zzso However, some genes which may play important roles in maintaining the zzso of zzso cells zzso factor 2, 4, 5, 9, zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, and zzso were zzso The many genes identified with this approach that are modulated during zzso will facilitate studies of the mechanisms underlying zzso cell zzso neural zzso and zzso
