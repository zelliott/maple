T zzso are the primary cells responsible for maintaining the immune zzso There are many intricate mechanisms involved in the regulation of T cells and the zzso family of adhesive surface proteins plays a pivotal role in the control of T zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins that are not merely zzso molecules but also function in T cell zzso by providing a scaffold for signaling and zzso proteins that are adept at zzso signals from the inside of the cell to the outside zzso zzso or from the outside of the cell to the inside zzso zzso The signaling property of zzso allows for rapid responses to changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso whether the T cell needs to adhere or zzso zzso can quickly accommodate either state of the zzso Once cells are guided to sites of infection, zzso or zzso zzso zzso can also participate in the zzso zzso or termination of the zzso This review will focus on the aspects of zzso T cell zzso affinity and zzso control of zzso signaling molecules involved with zzso association of zzso in zzso zzso and negative regulation of zzso
