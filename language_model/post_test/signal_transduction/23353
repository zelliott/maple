zzso is an zzso hormone that is predominantly zzso by zzso and has important roles in zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is also involved in the regulation of many zzso zzso such as the zzso adrenal zzso and zzso However, its biological role in male zzso is largely zzso The present findings demonstrate the presence of zzso receptors zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 2) in zzso cells derived from mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso successfully inhibited the signaling zzso zzso by zzso zzso At the molecular level, we provide compelling evidence that zzso achieves this by suppressing nuclear zzso zzso through promotion of zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, our data clearly indicate that zzso plays a protective role in zzso cells through its zzso zzso
