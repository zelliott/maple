During the past year, crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in complex with several zzso zzso have been zzso Some structures have zzso in zzso active zzso whereas others appear to be in inactive or native zzso The differences between these two classes of structures provide further understanding of how zzso activity may be zzso in the cellular environment and how zzso can zzso zzso at a molecular zzso All of these structures provide a basis for designing selective protein zzso zzso of use in the treatment of cancer and zzso zzso
