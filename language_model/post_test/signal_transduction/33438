The zzso two zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso cell zzso zzso and tumor cell growth despite of sharing a low zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso Here, we explored a possible zzso mechanism of action of zzso by focusing on zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso cell migration induced by basic zzso growth factor or vascular zzso growth factor in a zzso manner and tube formation on zzso It blocked basic zzso growth zzso or vascular zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and formation of zzso stress fibers and focal zzso Interestingly, zzso alone induced the weak zzso of focal zzso zzso whereas it inhibited focal zzso zzso zzso induced by growth zzso When zzso zzso promoted zzso and spreading of zzso cells compared with bovine serum zzso However, treatment with zzso blocking zzso markedly diminished zzso cell zzso to immobilized zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso also altered the binding level of zzso zzso to zzso cells in zzso cell sorting zzso Indeed, a blocking zzso against zzso zzso or knocking down of zzso zzso expression prevented the zzso effect of zzso in cell zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso cell migration through zzso of signaling and zzso zzso in part by interfering with zzso zzso
