Different levels and timing of zzso zzso zzso activity have been proposed to specify three distinct cell types in the zzso zzso Two of these, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso muscle pioneers zzso are zzso by expression of zzso zzso and zzso and require the highest levels of zzso for their zzso We have defined a minimal zzso element sufficient to drive reporter expression specifically in zzso and zzso This element binds both zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso We found a strict negative correlation between nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells and show that zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso even when zzso zzso is zzso zzso driving nuclear zzso of zzso suppresses the induction of zzso expression even when zzso zzso activity is zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso is depleted by zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that a synthetic form of the zzso zzso interacts with zzso specifically in the zzso of zzso cells in the developing zzso and that this interaction depends upon zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso promoter zzso repressive and zzso signals from the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to limit its expression to zzso and zzso We suggest a novel basis for zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso target genes is promoted by a direct interaction between zzso and truncated zzso an interaction that is zzso by zzso induced depletion of the zzso
