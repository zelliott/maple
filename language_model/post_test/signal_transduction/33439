The zzso signaling of natural killer zzso cells is crucial in the regulation of innate immune zzso Here we show that the association of zzso an zzso zzso of zzso cells, with zzso 2 zzso recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and facilitated zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cells was higher in zzso zzso mice but was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mice were less susceptible than zzso mice to mouse zzso infection, an effect that was abolished by depletion of zzso zzso Our findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which the zzso signaling in zzso cells is zzso
