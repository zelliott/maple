The development of an engineered tissue requires a clear understanding of the interactions between the individual zzso In this study, we investigated how the addition of zzso acid zzso to a cartilage tissue engineered scaffold alters zzso zzso and specifically the expression of zzso growth zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso were embedded (7 million zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing varying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso were cultured with zzso IGF-1, and gene expression was monitored at days 1, 4, and 8 for IGF-1, IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso binding protein 3 zzso type II collagen and type I zzso In zzso zzso were zzso for 24 h with zzso IGF-1 before being implanted zzso in severe combined zzso zzso samples were analyzed using zzso at days 7, 14, and zzso zzso indicate that, with the addition of high levels zzso zzso of zzso IGF-1 can become zzso within the zzso and therefore interfere with the delivery of IGF-1 to zzso In zzso and in zzso data showed that increasing the concentration of zzso in an zzso zzso can decrease zzso IGF-1 zzso zzso expression did not change with zzso zzso and the addition of any zzso did not significantly alter zzso zzso zzso continuously expressed zzso type II collagen in zzso and in zzso throughout the study for all the zzso However, for all the zzso zzso investigated, zzso showed more of a zzso zzso as indicated by greater expression of type I collagen than with no zzso in zzso and in zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso interferes with the delivery of IGF-1 to zzso affecting the zzso expression of IGF-1 signaling molecules and the resulting zzso zzso and therefore demonstrating the critical effect of zzso scaffolds on zzso cell zzso
