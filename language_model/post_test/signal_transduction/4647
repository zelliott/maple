zzso oxygen species zzso are toxic zzso molecules that can damage multiple components of the cell and have been proposed to be the primary cause of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso capable of detoxifying zzso one type of zzso The fact that zzso is present in all zzso organisms raises the question as to whether zzso is absolutely required for animal life and whether the loss of zzso activity will result in decreased zzso Here we use the genetic model zzso zzso zzso to generate an animal that completely lacks zzso activity zzso zzso We show that zzso worms are viable and exhibit a normal zzso despite markedly increased sensitivity to multiple zzso This is in stark contrast to what is observed in other genetic model organisms where the loss of a single sod gene can result in severely decreased zzso zzso the mechanism underlying the normal lifespan of zzso worms reveals that their longevity results from a balance between the zzso signaling and the toxicity of zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that zzso activity is zzso for normal animal lifespan but is required to survive acute zzso Moreover, our findings indicate that maintaining normal stress resistance is not crucial to the rate of zzso
