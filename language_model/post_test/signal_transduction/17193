Our zzso expression signature of zzso cell zzso revealed that zzso expression was significantly decreased in cancer zzso suggesting that zzso is a candidate tumor zzso We investigated the functional significance of zzso in cancer cells and identified what are to our knowledge novel zzso zzso cancer pathways in zzso cell zzso 

zzso of function studies using mature zzso were performed to investigate cell zzso migration and invasion in the zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso cell zzso To identify zzso zzso molecular pathways and responsible genes in zzso cell zzso we used gene expression and in zzso database zzso Loss of function zzso were performed to investigate the functional significance of zzso target zzso 

Restoration of mature zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell zzso migration and zzso Gene expression studies and zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso involved in the focal zzso zzso was directly regulated by zzso A zzso study of zzso revealed significant zzso of cell zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso and protein expression was significantly zzso in zzso cell zzso clinical zzso 

Loss of tumor zzso zzso enhances cancer cell migration and invasion through zzso of the focal zzso pathway, especially zzso as an zzso function in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer pathways and responsible genes provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso
