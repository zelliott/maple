The Ras inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso interferes with Ras membrane interactions that are crucial for zzso signaling and cellular zzso zzso had been successfully evaluated in clinical trials of cancer zzso Interestingly, its effect is zzso by targeting Ras zzso that serve as key coordinators for Ras proper folding and delivery, thus offering a novel target for cancer zzso The development of new zzso zzso has revealed that the specific modifications to the zzso zzso group by zzso and zzso yielded compounds with improved growth zzso zzso When zzso was combined with additional therapeutic agents its activity toward Ras was significantly zzso zzso should be tested not only in cancer but also for genetic diseases associated with abnormal Ras zzso as well as for various inflammatory and zzso zzso where Ras plays a major zzso We conclude that zzso has a great potential both as a safe zzso drug and as a promising immune zzso zzso
