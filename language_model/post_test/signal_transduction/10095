zzso hearing loss is often associated with damage of cochlear hair cells and/or of the zzso of the auditory zzso This damage can result from a variety of causes, zzso genetic disorders, aging, exposure to certain drugs such as zzso infectious disease and intense sound zzso zzso events that mediate aspects of zzso damage to hair cells have been partially zzso Several independent research groups have demonstrated a crucial role of zzso protein zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are important zzso of signal zzso from the cell surface to the zzso zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso protein zzso family, are strongly activated in cell culture conditions by stress inducing zzso including ultraviolet light, heat shock and tumor necrosis zzso therefore they are also referred to as zzso protein zzso In hair cells zzso treatment was shown to activate the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso and thereby zzso of zzso factors and consequently to altered gene zzso There are many nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of the downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso is the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex composed of members of the zzso and zzso zzso A variety of different stimuli is known to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is thought to play a central role in zzso gene expression in response to external zzso In this study we have analyzed the effect of zzso treatment on the downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso treatment of zzso of organ of zzso results in increased zzso zzso binding zzso The main component of these zzso zzso complexes is the zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso zzso induction is transient and occurs exclusively in hair cells of rat organ of zzso zzso
