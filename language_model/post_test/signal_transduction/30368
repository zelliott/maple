zzso is a zzso zzso protein induced under hypoxic stress, with the zzso gene being under direct regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso zzso cell death and an aggressive zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso cancer was zzso 

The zzso patterns of zzso expression in 72 early zzso zzso of the zzso cell type were zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso factor zzso zzso and with prognosis was also zzso 

zzso was strongly and extensively expressed in the zzso of cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso This high zzso zzso was not related to zzso grade, depth of zzso invasion or steroid hormone zzso zzso There was, however, a significant association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, particularly, zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, high zzso was associated with poor survival in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso seems to be an important zzso zzso involved in zzso cancer zzso Given that high zzso zzso being linked with poor zzso outcome, has been linked with a zzso response to zzso therapy (as previously indicated in experimental zzso high zzso expression may be an indicator for zzso zzso in stage I zzso zzso
