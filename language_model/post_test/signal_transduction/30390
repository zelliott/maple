The mechanisms underlying the initiation of zzso in fish are poorly zzso and whether the zzso zzso zzso previously designated G zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso play a significant role, as has been established in zzso is not yet zzso We determined (via real-time zzso zzso patterns of expression in the brain of zzso zzso and zzso and a suite of related genes in the zzso zzso axis and analyzed them against the timing of zzso germ cell development in male and female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso were found to be expressed only in the brain, zzso and zzso of adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso within the brain provided evidence for their zzso roles and a likely zzso role for zzso in this species (which, like other zzso does not appear to express zzso In both zzso zzso expression in the brain increased at the onset of zzso and reached zzso expression in males when zzso type B appeared in the zzso and in females when cortical zzso zzso first appeared in the zzso the zzso of which differed for the two zzso However, zzso expression was considerably lower during more advanced stages of zzso and zzso The expression of zzso closely aligned with that of the zzso genes zzso in zzso suggesting the zzso system in fish has a similar role in zzso to that occurring in zzso and this hypothesis was supported by the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso fish injected with zzso zzso (2 zzso wet zzso An intriguing finding, and contrasting that in zzso was an elevated expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in sex steroid zzso in the brain at the onset of zzso and in females slightly in advance of the zzso in the expression of zzso
