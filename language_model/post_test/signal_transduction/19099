Prior work has shown that chronic cadmium exposed rat liver zzso cells zzso become zzso transformed after protracted low level cadmium zzso Acquisition of zzso resistance is common in zzso and the present work explores this possibility in zzso zzso zzso cells were resistant to zzso induced by zzso or an acute high concentration of cadmium as assessed by flow zzso with zzso Three key zzso protein zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells after acute cadmium zzso However, the levels of zzso zzso were markedly decreased in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso activity was also suppressed in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso growth factor zzso used as a positive control for stimulating zzso zzso was much less effective in zzso cells than control zzso zzso zzso a strong zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso to levels similar to the zzso control cells and also enhanced zzso in response to cadmium in zzso zzso zzso zzso which is thought to potentially inhibit zzso was strongly zzso in zzso zzso Further, in zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly increased after cadmium exposure compared with similarly treated zzso zzso zzso These results indicate zzso cells acquired zzso resistance, which may be linked to the specific suppression of the zzso zzso and is associated with zzso zzso which, in turn, may impact this signal zzso zzso The acquisition of zzso resistance may play an important role in cadmium zzso by contributing to both tumor initiation and zzso zzso
