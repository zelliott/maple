zzso of signaling proteins including zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurs in zzso cell zzso However, the zzso value of these markers is zzso No prior study correlated the expression of these signaling proteins with clinical zzso Further, zzso of these proteins has not been zzso zzso may reflect zzso between signaling zzso The aim of this zzso study was to investigate the zzso and zzso of zzso and related signaling proteins in zzso and explore their relationship to clinical zzso 

zzso consecutive cases of zzso treated from 1996 to 2002 at zzso Park Cancer Institute were zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue sections was performed using zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso independently scored the protein zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were commonly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso There was a significant association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in tumor zzso A noteworthy association was shown between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the Cox zzso hazard model identified the use of chemotherapy zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as the best zzso of overall zzso 

zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso are commonly expressed in zzso zzso of zzso and use of systemic chemotherapy or radiation may correlate with improved zzso
