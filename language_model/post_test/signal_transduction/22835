The zzso zzso zzso which has zzso zzso activity in its zzso domain, is expressed by a large variety of cell zzso Few investigations into the regulation of zzso expression by zzso stimuli have been zzso As the zzso promoter contains potential binding sites for zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso we investigated the influence of zzso type I zzso and zzso and type II zzso on zzso gene expression of zzso B zzso Using the zzso B cell line zzso we found by zzso analysis a rapid zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso at 6 zzso with each type of zzso This induction was independent of protein zzso suggesting that zzso gene zzso does not require zzso but is merely under direct zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was followed within 24 h by induction of membrane zzso which coincided with rises of zzso zzso activities, that is, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to induce or zzso the other zzso zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, treatment of zzso cells of patients with B chronic zzso leukemia zzso with zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso mirrored by plasma membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further investigation in relation to zzso gene zzso and zzso behavior remains to be zzso
