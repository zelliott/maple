A number of studies suggest that zzso zzso the zzso cells of the central nervous system, are also a source of zzso zzso such as zzso that may influence survival of zzso zzso What is less clear is how the release of these molecules may be zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from cortical zzso on zzso zzso as well as regulatory mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso work determined that zzso derived from cortical zzso increased the numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso Furthermore, zzso acting through zzso and not zzso or zzso zzso receptors increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of zzso actions to release zzso in zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced robust release of zzso Moreover, release zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso lineage cells release zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso release is regulated by zzso acting through zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Thus zzso and zzso may be molecules that support zzso interactions in the zzso
