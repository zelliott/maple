The intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of Parkinson's disease and is possibly related to zzso injury in zzso However, the molecular zzso for this zzso are not well zzso We review the evidence of selective zzso of zzso zzso to excessive zzso zzso stimulation and discuss the molecular pathways that differentiate between zzso and pathological signaling leading to this particular form of zzso zzso In zzso as well as in zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso severe pruning of zzso and selective death of zzso zzso In primary cultures of zzso this form of injury is zzso through release of calcium from zzso stores zzso leading to loss of calcium zzso zzso stress, and zzso of the zzso factor zzso and the cell death protein zzso zzso modification of zzso may be an important target for zzso in Parkinson's disease and perhaps in prevention of other zzso zzso
