The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family are involved in the zzso of the biologically active zzso zzso acid zzso Since it is possible that an increased local zzso activity would reduce the effects of zzso in vascular injury, we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso levels in human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso 

The expression of zzso was investigated in cultured zzso using real-time zzso The metabolism of zzso was analyzed by zzso liquid zzso and the inhibitor zzso or small interfering zzso zzso was used to suppress zzso zzso 

zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene expression or reduction of zzso zzso activity by using zzso or the inhibitor zzso respectively, increased zzso signaling and resulted in decreased cell zzso The zzso inhibitor also induced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression accelerated zzso zzso in zzso giving rise to an zzso feedback zzso zzso of this loop with a zzso inhibitor increased zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso may be a therapeutic alternative to zzso zzso zzso
