Analysis of zzso zzso sequences for regulatory regions depends on a reliable recognition of individual zzso zzso Since some of them have a very low zzso sequence pattern, additional criteria are zzso 

Using molecular zzso techniques, we have created a complete database for the conversion of base sequences into profiles of structural parameters of zzso On this basis, search routines can be developed that scan for profile zzso They may be used instead of or, probably most appropriate in most cases, in combination with conventional sequence pattern zzso
