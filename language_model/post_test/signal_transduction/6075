While enhanced expression of zzso zzso has been observed in human skin zzso cancer, the mechanisms underlying zzso expression have not been completely zzso Recently, a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression has attracted zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and the zzso level of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso in the human skin cancer cell line zzso Compared to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso protein expression and zzso zzso activity were zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso expression in zzso cells and, contrary to our zzso the zzso of zzso was significantly zzso The expression of zzso which is regulated by zzso was reduced, and zzso was induced in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso through a negative feedback zzso
