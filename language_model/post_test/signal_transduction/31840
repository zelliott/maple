T cells play an important role in the zzso immune system, quickly zzso zzso functions in response to small numbers of zzso peptides but rarely zzso in response to constant interaction with most zzso zzso Emerging experimental evidence suggests that key zzso signaling proteins such as the T cell zzso and the zzso protein zzso are zzso organized into small clusters on the T cell zzso We use zzso zzso zzso computer simulations to study how the zzso distribution of molecules affects the portion of the T cell signaling network in which the zzso zzso originating in T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the effects of protein zzso we compare the signaling response from zzso with clustered proteins to the signaling response from zzso with zzso distributed zzso Given a fixed amount of zzso (a proxy for degree of zzso zzso that must diffuse into contact with zzso zzso the zzso homogeneous system responds faster and results in higher levels of zzso zzso Analysis of the spatial distribution of proteins demonstrates that, in the homogeneous system, nearest zzso and zzso proteins are closer on average and fewer zzso molecules share the same closest zzso zzso leading to the faster response zzso The results presented here suggest that spatial zzso of proteins on the T cell membrane may suppress the propagation of signal from zzso to zzso thus providing a regulatory mechanism by which T cells suppress zzso zzso signals induced by stimulation of T cell receptors by zzso zzso Because this suppression of zzso signals may occur at a cost to sensitivity, we discuss recent experimental results suggesting other potential mechanisms by which zzso and zzso may interact to initiate T cell zzso
