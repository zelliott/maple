zzso are classically defined as molecules that control patterning by acting at a distance to regulate gene expression in a zzso zzso In the zzso wing zzso disc, zzso zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso that organizes patterning along the zzso axis and specifies at least three different zzso of gene zzso Although the prevailing view is that zzso functions in the zzso wing disc as a classical zzso a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and zzso concentration thresholds has not been zzso Here, we provide evidence that the interpretation of zzso signaling depends on the history of exposure to zzso and propose that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple zzso Using mathematical zzso we predict that at steady state, only two zzso can be defined in response to zzso suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations suggest that a spatial zzso of the zzso zzso occurs, zzso a transient state in which the zzso profile is expanded compared to the zzso zzso zzso Through a zzso examination of zzso target gene zzso we observe that the patterns initially expand zzso and then zzso providing in zzso evidence for the zzso The zzso gene network architecture suggests this zzso results from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In fact, when the network structure was altered such that the zzso gene is no longer zzso in response to zzso zzso we found that the patterns of gene zzso which have distinct borders in zzso discs, now zzso Our results support a model in which zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene zzso
