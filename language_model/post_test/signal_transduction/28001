zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family, provides expansion and survival signal to T zzso Its zzso zzso in addition to its ability to zzso T cells, signals back into zzso presenting cells promoting their zzso and zzso Recently, zzso has been proposed as a therapeutic target to improve and sustain zzso immune zzso Several activated T leukemia and B zzso cell lines expressed zzso or zzso respectively, and soluble zzso has been found in zzso of leukemia zzso However, the functionality and role of these zzso molecules in zzso zzso are until now zzso Interestingly, we observed zzso zzso and zzso zzso on both human T and B leukemia cell zzso The zzso zzso expression on zzso T or B leukemia cells presents some differences compared to zzso expressed on zzso T leukemia zzso Surprisingly, in spite of the low expression level, both tumor zzso and zzso molecules signaled in T and B leukemia cells inducing proliferation and zzso zzso In addition, zzso system zzso opposed the zzso drug zzso effects, reducing the zzso DNA fragmentation and stimulating proliferation of zzso leukemia zzso Although the role of leukemia zzso system in zzso is unknown, these data suggest that these zzso molecules might zzso an advantage to zzso tumors promoting survival, sustaining cellular growth and contributing to drug zzso
