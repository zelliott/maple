The zzso represents an essential stress sensor for the zzso However, the molecular consequences of zzso damage and their possible link with neurodegenerative diseases remain to be zzso Here, we show that zzso damage is present in both genders in Parkinson's disease zzso and in the pharmacological zzso model induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso with zzso disruption restricted to zzso zzso zzso show zzso zzso that resemble zzso such as progressive and differential loss of zzso zzso and locomotor zzso At the molecular level, zzso disruption results in increased zzso levels and zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso activity, leading to zzso dysfunction and increased zzso stress, similar to zzso In turn, increased zzso stress induced by zzso causes zzso and zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso these observations suggest that the interplay between zzso dysfunction and increased zzso stress, involving zzso and zzso zzso may constitute a destructive axis in experimental and sporadic zzso
