Recent clinical evidence has failed to demonstrate the benefits of zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso suggesting potential loss of protective effects of HDL at high zzso This study aimed to investigate the zzso effects of HDL on in zzso and in zzso functions of human zzso zzso cells zzso and related zzso 

Early and late outgrowth zzso were generated from human circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced viability of late outgrowth zzso which was reversed dose zzso by zzso In the absence of oxidized zzso zzso HDL at low zzso zzso zzso equal to zzso zzso in zzso enhanced zzso tube formation by zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso to high zzso zzso zzso of HDL paradoxically enhanced zzso zzso and impaired tube formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso prevented high zzso zzso zzso and improved in zzso tube formation, as well as in zzso capacity of zzso of zzso 

While protecting zzso from the injury of oxidized zzso zzso moderate to high zzso of HDL paradoxically impaired zzso and related zzso in the absence of oxidized zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso providing zzso evidence of potential hazard effects of zzso
