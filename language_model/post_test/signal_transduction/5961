zzso occurring variation within the human zzso zzso results in an zzso acid substitution in the zzso zzso of the zzso This single zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso occurs at a frequency of zzso in the general zzso It is noteworthy that this zzso has been linked to attention deficit zzso disorder and has been associated with schizophrenic patients that do not respond to treatment with zzso To evaluate functional consequences of this zzso zzso signaling was investigated in zzso cells zzso expressing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso had reduced ability to activate zzso C and D, suggesting that signaling through both zzso and zzso pathways is zzso This conclusion was supported by zzso of G protein zzso which documented a loss of zzso high affinity binding and a decreased turnover of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso data revealed an altered zzso zzso resulting in a blunted signal downstream of zzso zzso This diminished signaling implies that the zzso zzso zzso alters zzso responses, possibly contributing to psychiatric zzso
