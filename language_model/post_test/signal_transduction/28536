zzso zzso 1 and 6 are important zzso that function via the zzso respectively, of the zzso factors zzso and zzso We have observed that a specific type of zzso B DNA sequence motif supports both zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso with zzso zzso This activity, in contrast to that zzso by zzso DNA motifs that do not efficiently bind zzso zzso is shown to be uniquely dependent upon signal zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are shown to physically zzso in zzso and this interaction appears to inhibit the function of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The distinct zzso form of zzso is also shown to interact with zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso with zzso bound to zzso zzso These data argue for a novel zzso factor zzso mechanism that may help resolve inconsistencies previously reported regarding the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso activity during the zzso zzso
