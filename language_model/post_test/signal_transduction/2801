zzso has two zzso responses, zzso and zzso zzso is the zzso for these responses and the signal zzso process involves zzso zzso zzso This causes transient changes in zzso zzso ultimately resulting in zzso or zzso To identify components that make up this signal zzso pathway, we generated zzso strains by zzso zzso Seven new zzso genes were identified zzso zzso of six of these are zzso by the transforming DNA and therefore should be easily zzso To order the zzso in the pathway, we characterized them zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have normal zzso zzso currents zzso and zzso currents zzso but their pattern of swimming does not change in the normal manner when the zzso zzso concentration is zzso suggesting that they have defects in the ability of their zzso to respond to changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso lack the zzso but have normal zzso suggesting that they are defective in the zzso zzso channel or some factor that regulates zzso zzso zzso have multiple zzso zzso zzso are defective in a component essential for zzso but zzso during zzso this component appears to be located downstream of the zzso but upstream of the zzso
