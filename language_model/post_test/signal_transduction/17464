To investigate whether tumor necrosis zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso injury through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso of the superior zzso artery in rats followed by zzso zzso and the rats were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso After surgery, part of the zzso was collected for zzso zzso The zzso layer was harvested for zzso and protein zzso which were used for further real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso injury, cell zzso zzso of zzso protein and zzso signaling zzso were zzso 

zzso significantly enhanced expression of zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein levels, induced severe zzso injury and cell zzso activated zzso and activated the zzso signaling zzso zzso with zzso markedly zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein levels, whereas zzso zzso did not affect the expression of zzso induced by zzso However, zzso with zzso or zzso dramatically suppressed zzso zzso injury and cell zzso and significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

The results indicate there was a zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso
