zzso cellular zzso have a zzso cap structure zzso zzso that zzso binding to zzso and is required for efficient zzso A specific initiation factor, zzso mediates the function of the cap and consists of three zzso one of which, zzso binds the zzso This zzso is present in limiting amounts in the cell, and is thought to be regulated by zzso decreased zzso of zzso following various treatments zzso with a decrease in cellular translation zzso These observations suggest that zzso lies on the zzso signal zzso pathway, and we reasoned that zzso of zzso might profoundly affect cellular growth zzso We report here that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso causes their zzso transformation as determined by three criteria: formation of transformed zzso on a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation in nude zzso
