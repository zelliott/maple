Many zzso zzso that cause zzso zzso produce zzso zzso proteins that are retained within the zzso zzso zzso and cause zzso cell zzso zzso zzso factor 6 zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso signaling pathways that maintain zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate how zzso and zzso signaling affected zzso zzso in cells, which could identify new molecular therapies to treat retinal diseases associated with zzso protein zzso 

To examine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were expressed in cells expressing zzso human zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso synthesis rapidly activated downstream zzso To examine zzso effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso were expressed in cells expressing a genetically altered zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rapidly activated zzso and downstream zzso By use of these strategies, it was examined how selective zzso or zzso signaling affected the fate of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels in the cells with minimal effects on zzso zzso zzso protein zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso reduced both levels of zzso zzso zzso and many other proteins in the zzso 

This study indicates that selectively zzso zzso or zzso prevents zzso zzso from accumulating in zzso zzso signaling may be especially useful in treating retinal degenerative diseases arising from zzso zzso by zzso clearing zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso
