The aim of the present study was to identify zzso pathways driving the resistance of zzso cells to zzso induced by zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso Although nuclear zzso B zzso was activated by zzso its zzso by zzso failed to sensitize these zzso zzso The zzso of protein zzso C zzso by zzso zzso completely abolished the zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso triggered zzso and enhanced the zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is activated by zzso and its zzso by zzso zzso the cells to zzso This is correlated with the zzso of zzso of zzso protein of 27 zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso activates zzso which does not drive any zzso response, and zzso which plays an zzso function probably through zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso are involved in the control of survival zzso
