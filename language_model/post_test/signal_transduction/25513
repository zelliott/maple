The latest advancement in zzso research provided an increasing evidence that inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways play a relevant role in zzso zzso and clinical studies on depression highlighted an increased production of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, acute and chronic administration of zzso or zzso zzso were found to trigger depressive zzso According to the zzso hypothesis, depression would be due to a stress-related increased production of zzso zzso that, in turn, would lead to increased zzso and zzso brain damage and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with production of zzso zzso zzso along the zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced availability of zzso and zzso zzso zzso would also play a role in the onset of the zzso resistance, underlying the overdrive of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways would lead to the brain damage observed in depression through both reduced zzso and increased zzso Besides the zzso system, other targets, possibly within the zzso zzso should be considered for the future treatment of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors may all represent possible therapeutic targets for novel zzso In addition, it should be also clarified the role of the existing zzso drugs in the treatment of depression, and those compounds with the zzso and zzso properties should be examined either as zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, the molecular inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways might provide new targets for zzso development and might be crucial to establish a rational treatment of depression zzso zzso to its zzso zzso
