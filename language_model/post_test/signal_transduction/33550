High energy intake and excessive body zzso impair zzso in zzso zzso High energy intake and excessive zzso also increase serum zzso Our objective was to determine if an infusion of zzso decreases proliferation of zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso quarter per d with or without 10 zzso of zzso growth factor zzso was infused via the zzso canal into zzso zzso of zzso dairy zzso zzso quarters were used as zzso After 7 d of treatment, zzso was infused zzso and zzso were slaughtered approximately 2 h zzso zzso from 3 regions of the zzso zzso was collected and zzso for zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased the number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso of the cell cycle by zzso in zzso quarters and by zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not alter the number of zzso zzso cells within the cell cycle, as indicated by zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso was very low in these zzso but zzso significantly increased labeling in zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression in zzso quarters but did not alter zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that a high concentration of zzso in the bovine zzso zzso reduces proliferation of zzso zzso zzso The reduced proliferation is accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso suggesting a possible mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Whether zzso might be a zzso regulator of zzso remains to be zzso
