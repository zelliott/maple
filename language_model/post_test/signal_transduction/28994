Many clinical zzso and zzso data in the past suggested that zzso disease zzso is correlated with an acute immune dysfunction caused by zzso In our preliminary study, zzso zzso 4 signal pathway, which could activate nuclear zzso zzso and induce excessive product of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed to be significantly activated during acute phase of zzso zzso But the zzso factors and regulatory mechanism are still zzso In this study, the authors further investigated the changes and zzso of regulatory factors for signal zzso of zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Forty-eight children with zzso zzso children with infectious disease zzso and zzso zzso healthy children were zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso were used to evaluate the expression levels of regulatory and effective factors in zzso zzso 4 zzso signal pathways and zzso factors in peripheral blood zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein in zzso was analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso group were elevated significantly during acute phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of regulatory factors zzso and zzso in patients with zzso or ID were found to be higher than those in the healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso but no significant differences in these parameters were detected between zzso patients and ID patients zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of regulatory factors such as zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to some zzso and expression level of zzso zzso in zzso patients were found to be lower than that in normal controls zzso zzso zzso while all of the four regulatory factors were found to be lower than those in ID patients zzso zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients were significantly higher than those in ID patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso elevated remarkably the expressions of regulatory factors zzso and zzso in zzso patients or healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso All of the four zzso factors were found to be significantly zzso after stimulation with zzso in controls zzso zzso zzso No responses to zzso were observed in expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso except for increased zzso of zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso patients with coronary artery zzso zzso were detected to be higher than those in zzso patients without coronary artery zzso zzso during acute phase zzso zzso zzso while those of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso group were lower than that in the latter zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in zzso zzso expression level was detected between the two groups zzso zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso protein on surface of zzso cells in zzso group were found to be higher than those in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Disturbance of zzso factors may be one of the factors causing zzso zzso function in zzso
