zzso an zzso zzso has been reported to be a potential zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of action of one of the recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso production and expression of various zzso proteins were measured following zzso treatment in leukemia cell zzso zzso animal models were used to evaluate the effect of zzso in comparison with zzso on progression of breast zzso and zzso zzso and western zzso studies were performed to understand the mechanism of zzso action both ex zzso and in zzso 

We have determined the zzso value of zzso in many zzso and breast cancer cell lines and found zzso cells most sensitive zzso 5 zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment leads to the zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis showed zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso upon treatment with zzso Besides, zzso zzso of zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso suggest that it zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, we observed a reduction in tumor growth and significant increase in survival upon oral administration of zzso (20 zzso six zzso in zzso In comparison, zzso was found to be more potent than its parental analogue zzso based on both ex zzso and in zzso zzso Further, zzso and western zzso studies indicate that zzso treatment led to zzso of tumor cell proliferation and zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso even in animal zzso 

Thus, our results suggest that zzso could be used as a potent zzso zzso
