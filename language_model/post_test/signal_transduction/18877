The role of zzso an zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso muscle zzso during nurse cell formation, was investigated by following the expression zzso and distribution of zzso (both protein and zzso in the infected muscle cell, as well as the expression zzso of the transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling zzso factor genes zzso zzso and zzso which cooperate with zzso zzso analysis using an zzso zzso indicated that in the early stages of infection (13 and 18 days zzso zzso the increased expression of the zzso protein was limited to the zzso zzso and not the enlarged zzso or zzso zzso At a later stage of infection zzso and 28 days zzso the zzso protein was limited to the enlarged zzso in the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso At 48 days zzso the zzso protein was barely zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that expression of the zzso gene increased from 13 days zzso reached a peak at zzso days zzso and then decreased to a low level by 48 days zzso zzso zzso for the zzso signaling zzso factor genes zzso zzso and zzso were similar to that of zzso These findings provide evidence that the zzso protein is involved in nurse cell formation through the zzso signaling zzso process in the host cell zzso
