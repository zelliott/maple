It has long been recognized that zzso receptors cooperate with the zzso during zzso tissue zzso and zzso But how this occurs is less zzso A host of zzso regulators have been reported to have functional and zzso linkage with zzso zzso The challenge remains to find zzso patterns within this increasingly large corpus of molecular zzso In this review we discuss one approach, to identify distinctive functional zzso that contribute to different adhesive zzso We illustrate this by considering zzso surface zzso which is zzso at both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further argue that regulatory zzso such as zzso serve to coordinate the molecular components of this zzso apparatus into a cohesive zzso
