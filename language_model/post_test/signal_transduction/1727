zzso zzso zzso activated through growth factor zzso generates a zzso second messenger, zzso zzso zzso is instrumental in zzso pathways that trigger cell zzso zzso zzso survival and other zzso However, some targets of zzso are yet to be zzso We demonstrate that zzso a unique zzso zzso specifically binds zzso On stimulation by growth factors, zzso zzso which is dependent on zzso but independent of zzso moved to cell membrane zzso known as zzso However, zzso zzso lacking the ability to bind zzso blocked membrane zzso induced by zzso growth factor or zzso growth zzso zzso shows low zzso with zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange to zzso zzso zzso showed impaired membrane zzso after stimulation with zzso growth factor, and failed to activate zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a new type of zzso which, independently of zzso zzso signals from zzso zzso receptors to zzso
