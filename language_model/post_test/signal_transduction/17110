The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3) zzso pathway, which is normally zzso by the zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso component zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Novel treatments based on the regulation of zzso protein levels could therefore have value in the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory zzso such as zzso To this end we carried out a screen of zzso existing medicinal compounds to identify zzso of zzso gene expression and identified the zzso zzso and zzso as effective zzso of zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso This was in contrast with the action of traditional zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which effectively suppress zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso also effectively suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso which led to suppression of zzso of the zzso zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that their ability to induce zzso gene expression is zzso Supporting this idea was the observation that the general zzso inhibitor compound C zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso induction in zzso Indeed, the ability of zzso to induce zzso expression requires zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and not zzso In the present paper we therefore describe novel molecular actions of zzso which control zzso gene induction and suppression of zzso zzso in zzso These mechanisms could potentially be exploited to develop novel zzso zzso
