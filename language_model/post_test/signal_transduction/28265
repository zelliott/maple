The perception of zzso stresses and signal zzso to switch on zzso responses are critical steps in determining the survival and reproduction of plants exposed to adverse zzso Plants have zzso zzso responses as well as responses which protect the plants from more than one environmental zzso There are multiple stress perception and zzso zzso some of which are specific, but others may zzso at various zzso Recently, progress has been made in identifying components of zzso pathways involved in salt, drought and cold zzso zzso analysis has defined the zzso zzso pathway, in which a salt zzso calcium signal is probably sensed by the zzso protein zzso which then activates the protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex regulates the expression and activity of zzso zzso such as zzso to re-establish cellular zzso zzso under zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for the regulation of the zzso zzso and acquired freezing zzso although at present the zzso events that activate the zzso zzso factor during cold stress are not zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso pathways appear to be involved in zzso stress zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso may act as zzso points of multiple zzso as well as zzso stress zzso zzso Forward and reverse genetic analysis in combination with expression profiling will continue to uncover many zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the zzso complexes will be required to determine specificity and zzso in zzso stress zzso zzso
