The zzso protein with a death domain, zzso was identified as a zzso target gene whose main role is to execute zzso in a zzso zzso To investigate the zzso role of zzso in zzso we generated zzso zzso Here, we report that, although zzso expression is zzso upon DNA damage, zzso mice undergo zzso normally not only in response to DNA damage, but also in response to various zzso stress signals and to death zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is not required for DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, in the absence of zzso both zzso processing and zzso occur in response to DNA zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso does not play an essential role for all zzso or zzso zzso zzso
