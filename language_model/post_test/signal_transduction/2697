The availability of zzso cell lines expressing the five cloned zzso receptors has allowed extensive families of synthetic zzso to be screened for their binding affinities to these zzso zzso zzso in the zzso series have high affinity for zzso and low affinity for zzso and zzso zzso to these zzso can have profound effects on their residual affinity for zzso and zzso Several linear zzso incorporating the critical zzso of all active zzso exhibit selectivity for either zzso zzso or both, but little affinity for the other zzso From these zzso we have assembled a panel of compounds with a useful degree of specificity for zzso zzso and zzso and these have been used to evaluate zzso involvement in various zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth hormone release zzso completely with zzso affinity and it appears from preliminary results that zzso of pancreatic zzso release is also zzso zzso zzso on gastric acid zzso show a high degree of dependence on zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso of insulin release, zzso release and binding to rat pancreatic zzso cells is highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells have particularly high affinity for zzso zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso is proving to be of great value in zzso the zzso roles of each zzso It is anticipated that these and future generations of zzso will have distinct therapeutic advantages over zzso itself and presently available zzso zzso
