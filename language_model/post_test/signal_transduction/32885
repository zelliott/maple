The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been recovered as a soluble zzso from the culture media of cells by a process that involves zzso zzso This zzso may be zzso by several treatments, including zzso treatment or protein zzso C zzso In this report we have investigated the cellular site and zzso activities involved in zzso zzso and the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso occurs when the zzso is at, or near, the cell surface, and it can be prevented by agents that affect protein zzso zzso generates several zzso fragments, and their generation can be zzso blocked by zzso documenting the involvement of multiple plasma membrane zzso The major zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso does zzso in zzso and zzso is able to associate with zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso zzso results in an active zzso that induced zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso by this natural cellular mechanism appears thus to serve not only as an outlet of zzso binding fragments, but also to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso In the nervous system this zzso zzso zzso could play important roles in the development and survival of zzso
