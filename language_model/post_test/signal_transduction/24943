zzso delivered to zzso cells through zzso are critical for the zzso of immune zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso factors zzso are key elements of the signal zzso pathways of many zzso zzso family members, including zzso We show for the first time that engagement of zzso in intact B cells zzso the rapid zzso of zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso We found that zzso engagement also results in its zzso together with zzso and zzso to membrane zzso regions of the plasma membrane enriched in signaling molecules such as the zzso family zzso Using a zzso zzso of zinc or a zzso zzso zzso we show that the putative zzso zzso of zzso contribute to their recruitment to zzso and to the downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zinc zzso and zinc finger zzso of zzso are required for communication between zzso and zzso signaling molecules and may serve a similar role in the signal zzso pathways of other zzso zzso family zzso
