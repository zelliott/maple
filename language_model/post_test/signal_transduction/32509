One zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a cascade of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that this zzso is also present in zzso cells of zzso zzso With optical recordings from the cell's zzso zzso we show that this zzso when activated by zzso leads to an increase of zzso zzso It is further shown that there is a second zzso zzso on the zzso of these cells which is modulated by calcium and can be activated by the application of zzso
