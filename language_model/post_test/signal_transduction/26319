zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso factor zzso are associated with zzso of zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso zzso zzso zzso has a significant role in the regulation of zzso zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso through molecular zzso zzso virtual screens, and biological zzso One of the zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and improved zzso tolerance in zzso This zzso inhibitor appeared to act through zzso because the inhibitor exerted no additional effects on zzso metabolism in the zzso zzso Our study of zzso mice showed that zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not cause in increase in insulin production but resulted in increased zzso activity and zzso production in the zzso Given that the zzso inhibitor improved zzso tolerance in a zzso model of type 2 diabetes zzso we suggest that zzso may be a potential therapeutic target for treating type 2 zzso
