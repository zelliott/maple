zzso 330 zzso is a member of a family of receptors related to the low density zzso zzso zzso Although several zzso have been shown to bind zzso in zzso zzso the ability of zzso to mediate zzso zzso has not been zzso To develop a cellular model for zzso function we screened a variety of cultured cell lines and identified several that expressed this zzso including immortalized rat type II zzso and a human and two zzso tumor cell zzso Using type II zzso zzso of a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and two new zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso the 39 zzso zzso protein known to antagonize zzso binding to zzso in zzso binding zzso completely inhibited both zzso and degradation of the zzso zzso by type II zzso This suggested that the clearance of these zzso was dependent on either zzso or the zzso protein zzso which shares several zzso characteristics with zzso By using zzso zzso to zzso the cellular zzso and degradation of the zzso were inhibited by zzso remaining zzso zzso and degradation activity could be partially inhibited by zzso zzso against zzso These findings indicate that zzso like other zzso family members, mediates zzso of its zzso In addition, zzso acts in concert with zzso in type II zzso to mediate clearance of a variety of proteins involved in zzso zzso including zzso complexes zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
