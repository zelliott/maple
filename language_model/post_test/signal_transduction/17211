Human idiopathic fetal growth restriction zzso is associated with zzso zzso Previously, we reported that the expression of zzso gene zzso 3 zzso is increased in idiopathic zzso zzso and is a regulator of zzso zzso zzso Here, we identify the downstream targets of zzso in zzso cell zzso We zzso the high levels of zzso in zzso using an zzso zzso construct and zzso this using zzso zzso zzso for zzso in cultured zzso Using a real-time zzso gene zzso candidate target genes of zzso zzso and zzso were identified as regulators of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were further assessed in zzso zzso and showed increased zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso the expression of multiple regulators of zzso differentiation and that expression of these regulatory genes is abnormal in zzso
