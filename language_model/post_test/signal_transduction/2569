zzso actions of zzso on the adrenal zzso were demonstrated by several zzso As only a few data about signal zzso exist, the aim of the present study is to establish a cellular model on which both zzso of zzso receptors are zzso zzso studies using zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso were performed on bovine zzso cells and a zzso cell zzso The zzso calcium signal was determined by a zzso signal using a zzso zzso Both zzso of zzso binding sites are present on either crude membrane zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso of the adrenal zzso Although the density of zzso and zzso on the plasma membrane fraction is almost equal, on the zzso membrane fraction zzso of zzso sites was double that of the zzso zzso An increase in zzso calcium signal could be obtained during stimulation of zzso cells by various zzso and zzso zzso Because a zzso of zzso could not be obtained in zzso cells, adrenal zzso zzso cells may be a more suitable model for investigating zzso zzso signal zzso
