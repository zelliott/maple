zzso improves insulin sensitivity and has zzso effect in animal models and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso improves insulin action have not been clearly zzso In the present study, we examined the protein levels and zzso state of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso the association between zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso associated zzso zzso activities, and the zzso status of zzso and zzso zzso in the liver and the muscle of 6 month-old zzso rats treated with zzso There was no change in zzso zzso and zzso protein levels in both zzso of treated rats zzso by zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in both zzso while zzso zzso zzso was increased in liver of zzso treated zzso The zzso zzso was increased in the liver and the zzso zzso zzso was increased in the muscle of zzso treated zzso These data indicate that these regulations of early steps of insulin action may play a role in the zzso mechanism for the improved insulin sensitivity observed in this animal zzso
