To test whether zzso can prevent zzso cognitive deficits in a zzso zzso 

After noting that zzso exposure zzso prolonged zzso of the zzso analog zzso acid zzso within zzso fluid, we tested whether zzso injection of zzso would produce memory deficits similar to those observed after zzso zzso We then tested whether zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso could protect animals treated with clinically relevant doses of zzso zzso against developing memory zzso Finally, we asked whether zzso affected this zzso beyond zzso the zzso zzso by altering expression of the zzso zzso or affecting zzso of zzso or zzso within the central nervous zzso 

Four zzso doses of zzso induced deficits in spatial memory, zzso at least one month following the final zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to reproduce this zzso zzso administration of zzso during the period of zzso exposure was zzso decreasing the zzso of zzso spatial memory deficits from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neither altered expression of zzso receptors within the zzso nor blunted the zzso increases in zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso zzso including zzso contribute to cognitive deficits observed after zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso reduces the zzso of cognitive deficits in rats treated with zzso methotrexate, and may therefore benefit patients with cancer receiving similar zzso
