zzso zzso was studied in zzso in zzso cells following zzso with a green fluorescent protein construct containing the zzso zzso targeting signal 1 zzso zzso imaging and evaluation of difference images revealed that zzso attach to zzso in a zzso requiring step and are transported in an zzso zzso Following zzso of zzso zzso zzso movements were arrested, indicating regulation by zzso zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso two drugs which are known to activate zzso G zzso zzso toxin which prevents zzso protein zzso completely abolished the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso suggesting that the G protein belongs to the zzso zzso At least one zzso of the G protein is zzso zzso as demonstrated by the observation that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso efficiently blocks zzso zzso and that the effect of zzso and zzso is largely abolished by various zzso zzso zzso In zzso these data provide evidence for a new type of regulation of zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso signaling zzso This type of regulation has not been observed so far with other cell zzso such as zzso the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso is regulated individually for each cell zzso by distinct mechanisms enabling the cell to fulfill its vital zzso
