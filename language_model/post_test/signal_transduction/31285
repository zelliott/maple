Whether an zzso feedback or zzso modifier actually has an effect on the zzso properties of a zzso zzso depends not only on the zzso modifier effect itself, but also on the control properties of the affected zzso zzso in the zzso of which it is zzso Different modification mechanisms are zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso Hill zzso In conclusion, it is shown that, whereas a modifier effect on zzso and product binding zzso zzso can be an effective negative feedback zzso it is much less effective as a positive zzso zzso The prediction is that zzso effects that change the apparent limiting zzso would be more effective in zzso zzso
