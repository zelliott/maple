zzso A zzso has previously been shown to be a full zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but is only able to cause partial zzso zzso of the zzso compared to substance P zzso zzso and SP share the same zzso acid sequence at their zzso active site zzso but differ in structure at their zzso zzso These observations have led to the proposal that the zzso zzso of zzso peptides affect the zzso but not the zzso activities of the zzso Some of the zzso proteins contain SP and the zzso zzso zzso K zzso and zzso gamma zzso which contain zzso at their zzso and are zzso zzso In this study, the abilities of zzso zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso second zzso zzso signaling and rapid zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso In addition, a similar analysis was performed using several zzso zzso peptides in order to obtain additional insight into the role of the zzso zzso domain in these zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found, like zzso to be full zzso of rat zzso zzso signaling but, unlike zzso were also able to cause full rapid zzso zzso of the zzso The extended zzso zzso of zzso and zzso thus increase the zzso activities of these zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso tested, all were full zzso but zzso and zzso had only partial zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso structures of these peptides also zzso affect zzso versus zzso activities of the zzso
