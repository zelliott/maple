A previous study demonstrated that activated zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso We now report that the effect of zzso is on a region of the zzso zzso upstream of the zzso terminal zzso recognition zzso This observation is consistent with previous observations from this laboratory suggesting that zzso binding to zzso involves a region of the zzso zzso immediately upstream of the zzso recognition domain zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso We further demonstrate that zzso has no effect on the binding of zzso or a cloned and expressed zzso binding zzso zzso to the recently described zzso signaling zzso as assessed by direct binding and signal zzso zzso
