The molecular pathways controlling zzso zzso cell zzso formation and maturation are poorly zzso The zzso cell zzso zzso zzso mouse is characterized by zzso in zzso a gene discovered in an zzso zzso context, but whose actual function in development and disease is zzso We found abnormal development of zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso mice and linked this deficit to a deletion zzso in zzso 7 of zzso With single cell gene profiling and zzso gene transfer, we analyzed a molecular zzso downstream to zzso underlying abnormal zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso We discovered that zzso zzso dramatically increases zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which interferes with zzso zzso signaling and zzso protein regulation of zzso stability, leading to underdevelopment of zzso cell zzso These findings provide insight into zzso role in zzso development and why its absence renders zzso cells more zzso
