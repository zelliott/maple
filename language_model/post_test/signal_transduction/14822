The nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of liver cells before its zzso by therapeutic drugs and zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso in mouse liver, the regulatory mechanism of which remains poorly zzso Given the finding that zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso here we investigated the regulatory role of zzso growth factor zzso signal in zzso zzso in the zzso of mouse primary zzso zzso treatment effectively zzso the induction of zzso zzso gene by zzso and zzso in mouse primary zzso On the other hand, zzso by zzso zzso of an zzso downstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso gene and zzso the zzso promoter activity in the absence of zzso zzso treatment increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 in the zzso thus decreasing the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and increased nuclear zzso zzso in the absence of zzso These results are consistent with the conclusion that the zzso zzso of zzso is the zzso signal that sequesters zzso in the zzso of mouse primary zzso
