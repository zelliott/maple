zzso recruitment is a key step in the inflammatory zzso Several changes in the cell zzso take place during zzso zzso and zzso zzso resting T cells become polarized during zzso developing a well defined zzso projection designated as cellular zzso We found that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and, to a lower extent, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to induce zzso formation and zzso zzso in T zzso zzso to zzso or zzso A similar zzso effect was observed during T cells binding to the zzso fragments of zzso and zzso that contain the binding sites for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure concentrated the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso for zzso and emerged to the outer milieu from the area of contact between zzso and protein zzso In addition, we found that other zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso also redistributed to the zzso zzso upon zzso zzso whereas a wide number of other cell surface receptors did not zzso zzso displayed a selective effect among different T cell zzso zzso beta had more potent action on zzso T cells and tumor zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso alpha targeted selectively zzso T zzso We have also examined the involvement of zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso zzso were able to induce zzso formation and zzso zzso whereas zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso formation, thus pointing out a role for zzso signaling in the development of this zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso induced by zzso was completely zzso by zzso zzso zzso the formation of this membrane projection appears to be dependent on G proteins signaling zzso In addition, the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso formation and zzso zzso in response to zzso was suggested by the prevention of this phenomenon with the zzso agent zzso zzso Interestingly, this agent also inhibited the zzso cell zzso but not the cell zzso to zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate that zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso is a novel function zzso by zzso this phenomenon may represent a mechanism that significantly contributes to the recruitment of circulating zzso to inflammatory zzso
