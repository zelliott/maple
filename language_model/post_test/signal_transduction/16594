Restricting the availability of iron is an important strategy for defense against bacterial zzso zzso tuberculosis survives within the zzso of zzso consequently, iron acquisition is particularly difficult for zzso zzso because the zzso membrane is an additional barrier for its iron zzso However, little is known about the iron transport and acquisition pathways adapted by this zzso in zzso zzso iron sources are usually mobilized by zzso zzso Here, we describe direct evidence that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso efficiently extract zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso associated with the zzso zzso ready for iron zzso zzso the zzso complex accumulates with high selectivity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso storage and zzso In our experiments, these zzso zzso droplets were found in direct contact with zzso poised for iron zzso The existence of this previously zzso iron acquisition zzso indicates that zzso have taken advantage of zzso zzso mechanisms for iron zzso and zzso sorting for iron acquisition during zzso The zzso could represent a new target for the control of zzso zzso
