zzso defects in both zzso and zzso in elderly result in a reduction in the efficacy of vaccines to many Gram positive bacteria like zzso zzso zzso zzso from aged mice have been shown to have a zzso in production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but exhibit increased production of zzso upon zzso zzso Here we showed that aged zzso demonstrate similar zzso zzso zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso or killed zzso zzso We hypothesized that an zzso increase in activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso may be playing a zzso role in the zzso zzso zzso We found that gene expression of both the regulatory zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of Class zzso zzso is higher in aged than in young zzso zzso The zzso increase in the activity of zzso was also demonstrated by an zzso of zzso and its downstream target, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as heat killed zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso could rescue zzso zzso in aged zzso and enhance the relevant zzso zzso needed to support zzso zzso and zzso
