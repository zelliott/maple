zzso modeling and zzso analysis are essential for understanding the dynamics of the complex gene networks that control normal development and zzso and can help to understand how zzso of that control leads to abnormal outcomes such as zzso Our objectives here are to discuss the different mechanisms by which the local zzso and mechanical zzso which is comprised of various signaling zzso cell types and the zzso zzso zzso affects the progression of zzso cells, and to present new results on two aspects of these zzso We first deal with the major processes involved in the progression from a normal cell to a zzso cell at a level accessible to a general scientific zzso and we then outline a number of mathematical and zzso issues that arise in cancer zzso In Section 2 we present results from a model that deals with the effects of the mechanical properties of the environment on tumor growth, and in Section 3 we report results from a model of the signaling pathways and the tumor zzso zzso and how their interactions affect the development of breast zzso The results emphasize anew the complexities of the interactions within the zzso and their effect on tumor growth, and show that tumor progression is not solely determined by the presence of a clone of zzso zzso cells, but rather that it can be zzso
