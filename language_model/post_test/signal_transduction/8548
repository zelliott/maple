zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that contains two zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Although zzso are generally considered to be negative regulators on the basis of their ability to oppose the effects of protein zzso zzso zzso is unusual in that it promotes the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by receptors for various growth factors and zzso The molecular basis for the zzso of zzso is also zzso In the zzso state, the zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso domain, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso the binding of zzso via its zzso zzso to zzso growth factor receptors or zzso zzso however, results in disruption of this zzso interaction, leading to exposure of the zzso domain and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso proteins with artificial zzso in the zzso zzso domain have been shown to act as dominant active zzso in zzso Such zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were subsequently identified in individuals with Noonan syndrome, a human zzso disorder that is sometimes associated with juvenile zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso were found to be associated with pediatric zzso zzso is also thought to participate in the development of other zzso disorders, but in a manner independent of such zzso zzso zzso and functional studies of zzso and genetic analysis of zzso in human disorders have thus zzso to provide new insight into the zzso of cancer as well as potential new targets for cancer zzso
