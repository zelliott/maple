To review current knowledge on the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and interacting signaling pathways in predisposition to tumor formation in primary pigmented zzso zzso disease zzso a type of bilateral adrenal zzso zzso related to the multiple zzso zzso Carney complex, and also in isolated zzso and other zzso 

We review the pertinent literature and discuss genetic defects associated with various zzso and zzso zzso 

A decade ago, we discovered that zzso and the Carney complex are caused by zzso zzso zzso encodes the protein zzso A zzso regulatory zzso type zzso an important regulator of zzso signaling in most zzso Recently, we described zzso or zzso abnormalities in a variety of other zzso in some of these cases, zzso in additional genes of the zzso signaling pathway, the zzso were zzso zzso analyses of human zzso or animal models showed that abnormal zzso signaling in the adrenal zzso and also in other zzso such as bone, leads to proliferation of zzso zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso 

Recent findings indicate the relevance of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso disease and point to the zzso signaling zzso as a potential important zzso of zzso related to increased zzso or zzso signaling (or zzso
