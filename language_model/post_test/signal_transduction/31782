The zzso zzso has the capacity fully to zzso its tail after zzso Previously, we have established that this zzso process requires the operation of several signaling pathways including the bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we have addressed the signaling requirements for spinal zzso and muscle zzso in a zzso zzso Two methods were used namely zzso of transgenic spinal zzso to a wild type host, and the use of the zzso conditional transgenic system to express zzso in the individual zzso For the zzso experiments, the tail was zzso through the zzso which contained a temperature zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso For the zzso experiments, treatment with zzso was used to induce cell autonomous zzso of the zzso or the zzso zzso in either spinal zzso or zzso The results show that both spinal zzso and muscle zzso depend on both the zzso and the zzso zzso This experimental design also enables us to observe the effect of zzso of zzso of one tissue on the zzso of the zzso Regardless of the method of zzso we find that reduction of spinal zzso zzso reduces zzso of other parts of the tail, including the zzso zzso In contrast, reduction of muscle zzso has no effect on the zzso of the spinal zzso In common with other zzso systems, this indicates that soluble factors from the spinal zzso are needed to promote the zzso of the other zzso in the zzso
