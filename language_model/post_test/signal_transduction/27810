In zzso zzso assembly of zzso zzso structures called zzso zzso is temporally and zzso coordinated with the assembly of the muscle zzso apparatus, suggesting that signals are exchanged between these cell types to position zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein recognized by zzso zzso zzso is a candidate for such a signaling zzso The zzso although expressed by zzso first reflects the pattern of muscle elements and only later reflects the pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that in adult worms zzso and zzso zzso show zzso zzso Further, cell zzso studies show the zzso muscle cells are necessary for normal zzso zzso To investigate zzso role in zzso zzso we characterized the zzso locus zzso and zzso zzso is a novel zzso protein of approximately 500 zzso The zzso domain contains at least 32 zzso type III repeats and the zzso domain contains unique zzso In zzso lacking zzso muscle cells zzso when embryonic muscle contraction zzso Later in development, zzso zzso become zzso and are not restricted to regions of the zzso previously contacted by zzso These results suggest zzso helps maintain the association between the muscle zzso apparatus and zzso zzso zzso
