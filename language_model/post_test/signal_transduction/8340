zzso T zzso zzso kill targets by releasing zzso agents from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso zzso to a target, allowing its zzso receptors to recognize zzso This triggers a signal zzso cascade that leads to the polarization of the zzso zzso and zzso towards the target, followed by zzso that occurs specifically at the site of zzso As with zzso production by helper T cells zzso zzso target cell killing is absolutely dependent on zzso influx, which is involved in regulating both zzso and zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso influx in zzso as in zzso cells, occurs via zzso zzso The molecules that couple increases in zzso to zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso which plays a critical role in zzso production by zzso cells, is also involved in zzso zzso zzso although the relevant zzso remain to be identified and zzso zzso is only one zzso step zzso There are thus striking similarities and important differences between zzso signals in zzso cells and zzso illustrating how cells can use similar signal zzso pathways to generate different functional zzso
