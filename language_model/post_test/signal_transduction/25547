The factors responsible for regulating zzso expression in certain zzso states have been zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter activity levels were measured in zzso zzso and direct or indirect zzso of zzso with zzso using real time zzso and zzso activity, zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso and promoter activity levels zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso cells compared with the zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso level in zzso zzso indirectly with zzso zzso promoter activity was also significantly induced by zzso in direct zzso and indirect zzso zzso of zzso with zzso These data suggest that while zzso treatment significantly induced zzso expression at the zzso level, the presence of an inflammatory process exerted by zzso can augment this effect in the muscle zzso
