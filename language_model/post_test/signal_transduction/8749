Cellular response to external stimuli requires propagation of corresponding signals through molecular signaling zzso However, signaling pathways are not isolated information highways, but rather interact in a number of ways forming sophisticated signaling zzso Since defects in signaling pathways are associated with many serious diseases, understanding of the zzso between them is fundamental for designing zzso targeted zzso Unfortunately, we still lack technology that would allow high zzso detailed measurement of activity of individual signaling molecules and their zzso This zzso developing methods to prioritize selection of the molecules such that measuring their activity would be most zzso for understanding the zzso Furthermore, absence of the reaction zzso necessary for detailed modeling of signal propagation raises the question whether simple zzso models could provide useful information about such zzso 

We study the combined signaling network of three major zzso signaling zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our study involves zzso analysis and dynamic modeling of this network, as well as an experimental zzso of the model by measuring the response of selected signaling molecules to differential stimulation of zzso zzso and insulin zzso We introduced two novel measures of the importance of a zzso in the context of such zzso Based on these measures several zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected for monitoring in the network simulation and for experimental zzso Our simulation method relies on the zzso network model combined with zzso propagation of the zzso Most (although not all) trends suggested by the simulations have been confirmed by zzso 

The simple model implemented in this paper provides a valuable first step in modeling signaling zzso However, to obtain a fully zzso model, a more detailed knowledge regarding parameters of individual interactions might be zzso
