The role of transforming growth zzso zzso during zzso is complex and zzso reflecting its ability to function as a tumor zzso in normal and zzso zzso and as a tumor promoter in their late-stage zzso The switch in zzso function is known as the zzso zzso whose manifestations are intimately linked to the initiation of zzso transition zzso programs in developing and progressing zzso Indeed, as zzso cells emerge from zzso programs zzso by zzso they readily display a variety of acquired zzso that provide a selective advantage to growing zzso including zzso enhanced cell migration and invasion; zzso heightened resistance to zzso agents, targeted zzso and radiation zzso and zzso zzso expansion of zzso and zzso cell populations that zzso tumor zzso and disease zzso At present, the zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms that enable zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso the zzso activities of zzso remain incompletely zzso Additionally, the molecular mechanisms that counter zzso programs and limit the aggressiveness of late-stage zzso events that transpire via zzso transition zzso zzso also need to be further zzso Here we review recent advances that provide new insights into how zzso promotes zzso programs in late-stage zzso cells, as well as how these events are balanced by zzso programs during the development and zzso progression of human zzso
