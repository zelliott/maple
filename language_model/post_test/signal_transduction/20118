Patient survival in pancreatic cancer remains poor with zzso zzso zzso The target specific molecular agent zzso a dual zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown significant activity against zzso and zzso zzso Since pancreatic tumors frequently zzso these zzso we investigated its effects, both alone and in conjunction with zzso or zzso The pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with varying doses of zzso zzso The effects on zzso protein zzso and on the cell survival protein zzso were determined by western zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso and zzso was measured using the zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso experiments were conducted with varying zzso of zzso or zzso and zzso were constructed to evaluate therapeutic zzso zzso inhibited protein zzso in the range of zzso a clinically achievable zzso The zzso cells showed a zzso zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso at the same zzso that blocked zzso zzso The addition of zzso or zzso to these cells resulted in synergistic zzso The zzso cells also demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso dual zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso results in significant reduction of pancreatic cancer cell growth and zzso These effects occur at clinically achievable zzso and are synergistic with the effects of zzso or zzso These findings support the potential role of zzso in the treatment of pancreatic zzso
