zzso requires migration of zzso to the zzso zzso with subsequent differentiation into foam zzso We showed previously that the scavenger zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso family zzso zzso exchange factors zzso in zzso from zzso zzso mice and that zzso modified zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We also discovered that zzso zzso of oxidized zzso zzso and foam cell formation were reduced in zzso zzso We now tested the hypothesis that zzso play a role in zzso zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso zzso mice fed a Western diet had significant reduction in total zzso zzso area (by en face zzso compared with zzso mice, with no significant differences in body weight or plasma zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed fewer zzso and foam cells in zzso mice compared with zzso mice, indicating impaired foam cell generation and zzso of zzso to zzso zzso An zzso video zzso zzso zzso with fluorescent zzso zzso showed reduced zzso of zzso zzso to zzso carotid arteries compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, fewer zzso labeled zzso zzso accumulated in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso oxidized zzso was dependent on zzso 

These results for the first time link zzso to zzso zzso development and suggest that zzso act as critical molecular links zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso
