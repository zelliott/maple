The precise coordination of cell cycle exit and cell fate zzso is essential for generating the correct proportion of retinal cell types during zzso The decision to exit the cell cycle is regulated by intrinsic and zzso zzso There is growing evidence that zzso can regulate cell proliferation and cell fate zzso during the early stages of zzso development prior to the formation of synaptic zzso We found that the zzso neurotransmitter zzso regulates retinal zzso cell proliferation during embryonic development of the zzso zzso and zzso receptors are expressed in embryonic retinal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to a zzso decrease in cell proliferation without inducing cell death or zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors induced retinal zzso cells to prematurely exit the cell zzso Using a zzso zzso to follow the zzso expansion of individual retinal zzso cells, it was observed that blockade of zzso receptors increased the proportion of large zzso showing that zzso of zzso zzso activity can have long-term consequences on retinal cell zzso Real time reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso does not alter the levels of the zzso and proteins that regulate the zzso zzso Instead, the activity of the zzso zzso is reduced in the presence of zzso These data indicate that zzso regulates retinal zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
