Wheat is an excellent species to study freezing tolerance and other zzso zzso However, the sequence of the wheat zzso has not been completely characterized due to its complexity and large zzso To circumvent this obstacle and identify genes involved in cold zzso and associated zzso a large scale zzso sequencing approach was undertaken by the zzso zzso of zzso Stress zzso zzso 

We generated zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso libraries constructed from wheat plants exposed to various zzso stresses and at different zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso for which zzso were available from the National Science Foundation wheat zzso sequencing program and DuPont were also zzso and used in the zzso zzso of the combined zzso with zzso and zzso yielded a few large clusters containing several thousand zzso that were zzso to routine zzso zzso To resolve this problem, the sequence proximity and zzso were identified by an zzso distance graph to manually break clusters into smaller zzso Assembly of the resolved zzso generated a zzso unique sequence set zzso zzso and zzso zzso Digital expression analyses indicated that the zzso zzso is enriched in zzso genes compared to the other public zzso Over zzso of the unique sequence set was zzso and classified into functional categories according to Gene zzso 

We have zzso zzso different zzso an almost zzso increase in zzso sequences compared to the available wheat public zzso Digital expression analysis combined with gene zzso helped in the identification of several pathways associated with zzso zzso The zzso resources and knowledge developed by this project will contribute to a better understanding of the different mechanisms that govern stress tolerance in wheat and other zzso
