In this article we review some of our recent work concerning the effects of nutrition and exercise on protein synthesis and signal zzso in human musculoskeletal zzso A great deal of new information is being generated by the application of recently refined techniques for measuring protein zzso The field remains one that is largely descriptive but increasingly we are beginning to discern mechanisms underlying lean tissue zzso growth and wasting especially as multidisciplinary tools are applied to its zzso Several types of exercise and nutrition are potent stimuli for protein synthesis in skeletal zzso By contrast, collagen in the zzso zzso in muscle and zzso appears to be mechanically but not nutritionally zzso The rates of collagen turnover in a variety of zzso are sufficiently high to account for a zzso proportion of whole body protein zzso One of the most recent surprises is the high turnover rate of human bone collagen and its anabolic response to zzso As our understanding of the normal physiology of these processes advances, we become better able to construct testable hypotheses concerning the effects of zzso and disease on the musculoskeletal zzso Current evidence suggests that one of the major problems with loss of muscle during zzso is an inability of the tissue to respond adequately to increased availability of zzso
