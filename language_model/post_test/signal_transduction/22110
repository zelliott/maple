zzso is a major zzso degradation zzso for cellular components in zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for quality control of the zzso in order to avoid the zzso of zzso zzso Its stimulation by various stressful situations, including zzso zzso is important in maintaining cell zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is regulated differently depending on whether zzso cells adhere to collagen I or collagen IV, proteins typical of zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso We observed that the zzso levels of zzso were higher in cells zzso on collagen IV than in cells zzso on collagen I or on zzso zzso However, the stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso as reflected by the buildup of zzso and the increase in the zzso zzso was higher in cells zzso on collagen I than in cells zzso on collagen zzso These contrasting results were not due to differences in the zzso zzso of zzso complex 1 zzso Interestingly, cells zzso on collagen IV formed numerous focal zzso zzso whereas fewer zzso were observed in cells zzso on the other zzso This implies that focal zzso zzso zzso was more robustly activated by collagen zzso zzso the expression of zzso by zzso in cells zzso on collagen IV shifted the zzso zzso of these cells to an zzso zzso zzso zzso under both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, cells zzso on collagen IV were less dependent on zzso to survive in the absence of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso components can zzso zzso and mitigate its role in cell zzso
