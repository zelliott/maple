zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that can closely cooperate with zzso in zzso as does zzso Although the molecular mechanism of this cooperative transformation remains unknown, it is speculated that, similar to zzso zzso contributes to transformation by zzso zzso In this study, therefore, we examined the effect of zzso expression on zzso zzso of zzso zzso triggered by serum zzso Our results showed that, rather than zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through an enhancement of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso since the suppression of this activity by a specific zzso inhibitor abolished the zzso stimulation by zzso A zzso zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso expression alone in the absence of zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso zzso cells, indicating that the zzso activity of zzso and the activated zzso signaling zzso were required for zzso stimulation by zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso stimulates as a zzso zzso the death signaling zzso by zzso at a step upstream of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso zzso might function zzso with zzso through the zzso of a zzso which regulates the common signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso
