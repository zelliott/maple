zzso of zzso activates a zzso zzso cascade leading to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso exchanges of the visual zzso zzso between the outer and inner segment of rod zzso occur through the narrow connecting zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso 1 in a specific domain of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size exclusion zzso and kinetic zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso 1 binds with high affinity and specificity to zzso The assembly of zzso complex is zzso by the zzso The zzso assembly of a G protein with zzso is a novel aspect of the supply of signaling proteins in sensory cells and a potential link between molecular zzso and signal zzso in zzso
