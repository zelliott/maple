To gain a better understanding of the molecular changes taking place in citrus fruit tissue following the application of the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso surface wounds using an zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso of P zzso zzso and a zzso change difference as biologically zzso the data indicated that zzso putative zzso showed significant expression changes following wounding and zzso application relative to wounded zzso zzso results of selected genes were validated by reverse zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The data indicated that zzso application induced the expression of the genes zzso Respiratory burst zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso peel tissue treated with zzso zzso Moreover, suppression was correlated with significantly higher levels of hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso radical production in zzso surface zzso Interestingly, large amounts of hydrogen zzso were detected inside zzso cells recovered from wounded fruit zzso indicating the ability of the zzso to activate zzso oxygen species when it is in contact with plant zzso This study provides the first global picture of gene expression changes in zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
