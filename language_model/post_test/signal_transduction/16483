We introduce a zzso complexity reduction method for the automatic identification and analysis of dynamic network zzso in zzso zzso based on zzso zzso of a minimal model dimension represented by the number of zzso active zzso zzso Our zzso exploits a generalized sensitivity analysis along state zzso and subsequent singular value decomposition of sensitivity zzso for the identification of these dominant zzso zzso It allows for a dynamic zzso analysis of zzso species in kinetic models that can be exploited for the zzso zzso of a minimal model on small time intervals and offers valuable functional insight into highly zzso reaction mechanisms and network zzso We present results for the identification of network zzso in a simple zzso chemical reaction, time scale separation based model reduction in a zzso zzso system and network decomposition of a detailed model for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
