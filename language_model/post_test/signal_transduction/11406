Cellular responsiveness to human zzso 6 zzso requires the expression of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of responsiveness to zzso is generally controlled by zzso zzso A viral zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by human zzso and has zzso activity similar to zzso on a number of cell zzso zzso differs from zzso in its zzso zzso requiring only zzso Total human B cells isolated from peripheral blood, which are predominantly zzso as well as sorted zzso B cells, could be zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso as indicated by induction of zzso signaling zzso zzso This suggests that the ability of zzso to stimulate B cells expressing little or no zzso allows it to act on a larger pool of target B cells, compared to human zzso
