zzso a negative regulator of the zzso signaling pathway, contains a zzso regulator of G protein signaling zzso core zzso zzso we demonstrate both in zzso and in cells that this domain interacts with the alpha zzso of the zzso G protein zzso but not with the closely related zzso or with several other zzso G zzso zzso zzso binds the activated form of zzso a behavior consistent with other zzso zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso that of zzso zzso does not affect intrinsic zzso zzso by zzso Despite its inability to act as a zzso zzso we demonstrate that in cells, zzso can compete for zzso binding with the zzso domain of zzso a known zzso protein that links zzso signaling to zzso of the small G protein zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso 231 breast cancer zzso These findings establish that the zzso domain of zzso is able to directly interact with the alpha zzso of zzso G protein zzso and provide a unique tool to zzso zzso signaling zzso
