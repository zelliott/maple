Development of zzso center zzso B cells and zzso helper T zzso cells requires the zzso factor zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso of zzso in B cells and helper T cells is regulated by complex signals including those generated through their zzso zzso which take place in various zzso depending on their zzso zzso In the last several years, it has become possible to detect zzso protein in individual B cells and T cells by zzso zzso with the newly developed zzso or by using the reporter zzso zzso using these zzso have started to clarify zzso location of early zzso zzso in B cells and T cells, and contributed to reveal the zzso and zzso of B cells in the early and late phase of zzso zzso They also started to reveal the diversity, zzso and/or instability of zzso zzso We zzso the recent findings made by tracking zzso expression together with the updated knowledge about dynamics of zzso B cells and helper T cells and discuss them in relation to possible signaling requirements for the development of zzso B cells and zzso zzso
