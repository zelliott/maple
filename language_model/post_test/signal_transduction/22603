zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal through the zzso signal zzso zzso The key components involved are the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the family of signal zzso and zzso of transcription, the protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas considerable information has been accumulated concerning the zzso of zzso for the individual zzso zzso data on the availability of the proteins involved in zzso zzso signal zzso are zzso Nevertheless, availability of these zzso determined by the balance of protein synthesis and degradation, also influences zzso zzso signal zzso Here, we present a comprehensive set of data on the zzso of the key molecules involved in the zzso signal zzso zzso The turnover rates for the various proteins differ zzso Three groups of zzso proteins can be zzso whereas the feedback zzso zzso zzso and zzso are very short-lived, zzso zzso and zzso have an extremely slow turnover zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso is reduced to almost 50% of the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show intermediate zzso Our data imply that zzso components activated by zzso modifications are zzso whereas the activity of very short-lived proteins is regulated mainly at the zzso zzso
