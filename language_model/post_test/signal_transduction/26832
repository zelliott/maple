zzso and zzso studies of humans have revealed a close association between zzso diseases and zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso can zzso to zzso zzso following zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso invades zzso zzso cells zzso derived from the human zzso and zzso proliferation through induction of arrest in the zzso phase of the cell zzso The purpose of the present study was to identify signaling pathways zzso cellular impairment caused by zzso zzso Following zzso zzso infection, the expression of zzso was induced and zzso zzso responses consistent with response to DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an essential regulator of DNA damage zzso was shown to be activated together with its downstream signaling zzso zzso while the zzso zzso protein zzso was not zzso The zzso of zzso prevented both zzso arrest and zzso caused by zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both zzso arrest and zzso The regulation of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso exhibited zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso diminished both zzso arrest and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso activates cellular DNA damage signaling pathways that lead to zzso arrest and zzso in zzso
