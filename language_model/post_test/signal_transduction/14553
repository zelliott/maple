The pancreatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for pancreatic development and insulin gene transcription, whereas zzso has a deleterious effect on zzso zzso However, the relationship between zzso and zzso is poorly zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso could suppress zzso promoter activity, which relied on T cell factor zzso binding elements zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso was markedly decreased on zzso zzso but zzso of zzso short hairpin zzso zzso this zzso zzso expression did not induce zzso degradation nor did it alter their zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso acids zzso of zzso harboring an zzso domain, which might lead to the reduction of zzso complex levels and zzso their binding activity with zzso promoter zzso Moreover, zzso zzso interference caused cell proliferation and zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso functioned as a key regulator for maintenance of zzso function, at least in part, through controlling zzso expression and the loss of its regulatory function may be an alternative mechanism for zzso zzso and zzso found in zzso
