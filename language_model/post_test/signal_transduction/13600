zzso activity in plants is closely related to nitrogen zzso and an zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso nitrogen sources in a zzso zzso In this study, we have identified another regulatory system of zzso de zzso zzso in response to nitrogen zzso In rice, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in response to zzso applied nitrate and zzso with accompanying zzso of zzso zzso of roots with zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso abolished the zzso and zzso induction of zzso and zzso while zzso application induced their zzso Thus, neither nitrate nor zzso but zzso or a related zzso is essential for the induction of these zzso genes in zzso On the other hand, zzso induction of zzso occurs in zzso at least to some zzso In transgenic lines zzso the expression of zzso which is the dominant zzso in rice roots, the zzso increase of zzso in the zzso sap was significantly reduced, and zzso shoot growth was retarded despite sufficient zzso We conclude that plants possess multiple regulation systems for zzso zzso zzso to zzso growth in response to nitrogen zzso
