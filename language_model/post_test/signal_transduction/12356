We have characterized the role that the zzso protein plays in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso by the use of zzso defective in the putative upstream components of the zzso zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso controls the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso under conditions that damage the cell wall, thus defining zzso as a signaling element of this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso display altered sensitivity to zzso red, zzso zzso or zzso indicating that this protein is involved in cell wall zzso zzso (as well as zzso and zzso is involved in the transmission of the signal toward zzso zzso by the zzso zzso as revealed by the use of activated zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso have a stronger defective invasion zzso than zzso zzso when tested on certain solid media that use zzso or zzso as a carbon source or under zzso Interestingly, zzso contributes to growth under conditions of high zzso when both branches of the zzso zzso are altered, as triple zzso zzso zzso zzso (but not any single or double zzso are zzso However, this phenomenon is independent of the presence of zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, and zzso zzso are not affected in this zzso following an zzso zzso These results reveal essential functions in zzso invasion, cell wall zzso and growth under conditions of high zzso for zzso in zzso zzso and suggest the divergence and specialization of this signaling zzso in zzso zzso
