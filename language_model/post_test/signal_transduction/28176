In zzso cells, as in other target cells, zzso elicits long-term and short-term responses which involve zzso and zzso mode of actions, zzso There is evidence indicating that zzso of zzso zzso pathways may participate in the responses induced by zzso through its zzso zzso In this study we have evaluated the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso from young (3 zzso and aged (24 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the hormone stimulates zzso zzso zzso in young rat zzso zzso effect on zzso is zzso zzso at 2 zzso zzso is zzso zzso to zzso and decreases with zzso zzso also zzso the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso effect which was evident at 1 zzso zzso and reached a maximum at 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and activity is greatly reduced in zzso from old zzso In both, young and aged animals, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was effectively suppressed by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and suppressed to a great extent by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso with an important role in zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not involved in zzso zzso zzso In agreement with this data, zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso showed that the hormone has no effect on the zzso activity in rat zzso Taken together, the present study suggest that in zzso cells, zzso zzso is an important mechanism of zzso involved in zzso and zzso regulation and that this mechanism is impair with zzso
