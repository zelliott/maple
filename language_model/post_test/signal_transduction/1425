The effect of zzso on the hormonal regulation of zzso zzso was studied in the rat anterior zzso The zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso but zzso the zzso activity in an irreversible manner in the presence of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso at lower zzso and inhibited at higher zzso zzso treatment enhanced the zzso and abolished the zzso phase of zzso gamma S zzso In addition, zzso also attenuated the zzso effects of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso II on zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso showed an additive effect on the stimulation exerted by zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in anterior zzso and on zzso zzso levels in cultured vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of two protein bands of Mr zzso and zzso referred to as zzso and zzso respectively, in the anterior zzso and zzso protein in the zzso referred to as zzso zzso treatment inhibited the labeling of all these bands in a zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from bovine brain was also inhibited by zzso zzso However, zzso had no significant effect on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the interaction between zzso and Go and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso turnover have to be zzso
