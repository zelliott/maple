The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of the hypoxic response as it leads to the zzso degradation of zzso zzso such as zzso which in turn increases the stability of zzso factor zzso In the present study, we identify the zzso zzso zzso as zzso interaction partner that zzso zzso at five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso exhibit different zzso zzso and consequently change in zzso degrading zzso zzso zzso zzso is more active than the zzso zzso zzso and shows an increased ability to trigger the zzso zzso response and zzso We also found that zzso zzso increases zzso stability, whereas zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso conditions cause a zzso zzso zzso and degradation which ultimately also results in an impaired zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso of zzso at zzso is impaired under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a molecular mechanism underlying chemotherapy resistance in solid zzso
