We examined the effect of insulin on nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso activity in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso insulin receptors zzso at zzso and zzso zzso sites zzso zzso In zzso cells, insulin caused a specific, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex was identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso B: 1) was related to insulin zzso number and zzso zzso activity since it was markedly reduced in parental zzso cells which proved to respond to insulin growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was dramatically decreased in zzso zzso 2) persisted in the presence of zzso and was blocked by zzso zzso aspirin and sodium zzso three compounds interfering with I zzso B degradation and/or zzso zzso zzso B complex zzso 3) was independent of both zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and 4) was dependent on zzso zzso activity since zzso zzso B DNA binding activity was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso reporter gene expression was blocked in zzso cells expressing a zzso dominant negative zzso This is the first evidence that insulin activates zzso B in zzso cells through a zzso mechanism requiring both insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
