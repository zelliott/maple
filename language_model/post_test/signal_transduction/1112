Little is known about how nerve growth factor zzso signaling controls the regulated assembly of zzso that zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that a tightly regulated and localized zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the growth cone is essential for rapid zzso growth induced by zzso This zzso activated zzso signaling is conveyed downstream through a localized zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two zzso coupled zzso control zzso growth via regulation of a zzso plus end binding zzso zzso zzso coli zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso signals are zzso to the zzso zzso via zzso of a zzso cell polarity signaling zzso
