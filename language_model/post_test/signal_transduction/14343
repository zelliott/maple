Except for the most organized mature zzso liver zzso cells zzso can differentiate into many other types of cells in the liver including zzso In addition, zzso are demonstrated to be able to give birth to other kinds of zzso cell types such as zzso zzso Even more, under some bad conditions, these zzso could generate liver cancer stem like cells zzso through zzso zzso In this review, we mainly concentrate on the molecular mechanisms for controlling cell fates of zzso especially differentiation of zzso zzso cells and zzso First of all, to certificate the cell fates of zzso the following three features need to be taken into account to perform accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso and zzso functional assessment including in zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso attention should be paid to zzso materials (such as growth factors and chemical zzso progressive materials including zzso and zzso signaling zzso and zzso materials (such as liver enriched zzso zzso zzso some recommendations were proposed to zzso zzso and enrich the effective production of zzso cells out of zzso At the end, the potential regulating mechanisms for generation of zzso by zzso were carefully zzso The differentiation of zzso is a gradually progressing process, which consists of three main steps: zzso progression and zzso It's the unbalanced distribution of affecting materials in each step decides the cell fates of zzso
