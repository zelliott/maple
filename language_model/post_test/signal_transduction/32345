zzso zzso is widely viewed as the main second zzso in zzso zzso and it has been proposed that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso allows free zzso to accumulate and directly zzso target proteins (the zzso zzso We assessed the role of zzso zzso 1 and 2 in zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso 1 zzso signaling pathway, in which zzso of zzso is required for zzso of zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso and this occurred via transient formation of a zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were inhibited by zzso of zzso but also by zzso of zzso This suggests that these two zzso zzso have distinct roles in the cellular zzso response and compete for available zzso zzso These data imply that zzso can function as a zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso receiving the zzso signal and zzso it into a zzso bond that is subsequently transmitted to the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso Interestingly, in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed zzso higher molecular weight complexes, suggesting that multiple proteins are targets for zzso zzso via a zzso zzso This model of active zzso signal distribution via zzso exchange is consistent with zzso function in zzso and explains how zzso may trigger specific zzso bond formation in zzso zzso
