Higher plants are zzso organisms that perceive environmental cues such as light and chemical signals and respond by changing their zzso Signaling pathways zzso a complex network of interactions to orchestrate zzso and zzso responses such as zzso fruit zzso zzso zzso regulation, and shoot or root zzso In this session, the mechanisms of signaling systems that trigger plant responses to light and to the gaseous hormone, zzso were zzso These signals are first sensed by a zzso and transmitted to the nucleus by a complex zzso A signal may be transmitted to the nucleus by any of several systems including zzso binding proteins zzso zzso which change activity upon zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which zzso zzso and activate a series of zzso and membrane zzso channels, which change zzso characteristics of the zzso The signal is zzso in the nucleus as a change in the activity of zzso zzso which are zzso factors that specifically interact and zzso the regulatory regions of zzso Thus, detection of an environmental signal is transmitted through a zzso pathway, and changes in zzso factor activity may coordinate changes in the expression of a portfolio of genes to direct new zzso zzso
