zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an important zzso of zzso cell proliferation and zzso The purpose of the present studies was to investigate the role of zzso in the tumor response to zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso radiation zzso 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 zzso in zzso and zzso survival was zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated in zzso nude mice and then treated with zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso Mean fractional tumor volume was used to evaluate treatment zzso To determine whether zzso enhances tumor zzso by targeting zzso cells, we performed zzso survival zzso with human zzso vein zzso zzso Surviving zzso were calculated after treatment with zzso radiation (5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1, 10, and 100 zzso To determine whether zzso zzso enhances tumor zzso we employed zzso zzso zzso to treat human tumor zzso zzso were exposed to zzso radiation (four zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and treated with zzso zzso zzso 5, and 25 zzso in four zzso zzso Mean fractional tumor volume was used to evaluate treatment zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism contributing to the observed zzso radiation interaction, we exposed human zzso vein zzso cells to zzso radiation (5 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of cell zzso was zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso clones were equivalent zzso zzso 146 vs zzso However, the zzso zzso were more resistant to the zzso effects of zzso radiation than the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a faster doubling time zzso vs zzso zzso and a shorter growth delay (15 vs 23 zzso than zzso zzso The surviving fraction of human zzso vein zzso cells after exposure to zzso radiation was significantly enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso vs zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that stimulation of zzso and zzso was zzso after exposure to zzso zzso 

These findings represent the first genetic evidence that factors other than inherent tumor cell zzso are important zzso of zzso zzso strategies targeting zzso and other zzso cell survival mechanisms may be used to enhance the zzso effects of zzso
