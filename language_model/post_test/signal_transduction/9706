zzso requires precise, zzso expression of numerous genes and coordinated interaction of signal zzso and gene regulatory networks, disruption of which may contribute to the zzso of neural tube defects zzso zzso zzso are key zzso of cell and tissue zzso To define potential roles of zzso in development of the zzso neural tube zzso zzso zzso analysis was conducted to establish expression profiles, and identify zzso target genes and functional gene zzso 

The zzso expression profiles in zzso embryonic zzso derived from zzso days zzso zzso and zzso were defined and compared utilizing zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene expression changes were verified by zzso quantitative zzso zzso The zzso R package and the zzso zzso zzso method were zzso for cluster analysis of the zzso zzso zzso associations among selected zzso were examined via zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso chips enabled examination of zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso of these was detected in zzso embryonic zzso zzso analysis revealed several zzso regulated expression clusters among these expressed zzso Target analysis of zzso expressed zzso enabled identification of numerous target genes associated with cellular processes essential for normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis revealed interactive zzso networks which connected zzso expressed zzso with their target zzso and highlighted functional zzso 

The present study defined unique gene expression signatures of a range of zzso in the developing zzso during the critical period of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso target genes and gene interaction pathways revealed that specific zzso might direct expression of numerous genes zzso zzso which have been shown to be indispensable for normal zzso This study is the first to identify zzso expression profiles and their potential regulatory networks in the developing zzso zzso
