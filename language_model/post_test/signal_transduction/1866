The zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso can inhibit zzso by direct zzso We have mapped all zzso zzso sites in zzso showing that zzso 43, zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso in zzso and induced by zzso in zzso zzso 43 zzso decreased the binding to Ras in zzso but not in zzso zzso However, the zzso activity of a zzso zzso was fully inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso 259 increased the zzso zzso activity and rendered it largely resistant to zzso by zzso zzso increased zzso zzso 259 zzso in a zzso manner with zzso that correlated with zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso 338 zzso of zzso previously shown to be required for zzso zzso zzso 338 zzso of a zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso Using zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso is the sole target for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso and that zzso zzso is zzso mainly through zzso 259 zzso
