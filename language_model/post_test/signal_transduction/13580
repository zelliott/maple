The zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso that regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso is known to be involved in tissue fibrosis, including zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso zzso vitamin D zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso signal zzso through direct interaction with zzso In mouse models of tissue fibrosis, zzso treatment prevented zzso zzso through the suppression of zzso signal zzso Based on the structure of the zzso complex, we generated 2 synthetic zzso These zzso selectively inhibited zzso signal zzso without zzso zzso zzso and significantly attenuated zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that zzso suppression of zzso signal zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso In addition, these zzso did not cause zzso resulting from stimulation of the zzso activity of the zzso Thus, our study provides a new strategy for generating chemical compounds that specifically inhibit zzso signal zzso Since zzso signal zzso is reportedly involved in several disorders, our results will aid in the development of new drugs that do not cause zzso adverse effects, such as zzso
