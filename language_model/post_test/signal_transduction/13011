We investigated the effects of caffeine zzso on skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and insulin signaling zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On two occasions, seven men performed zzso zzso knee zzso exercise at 3 h before the zzso zzso (5 zzso or zzso was administered in a randomized, zzso fashion 1 h before the zzso During the zzso zzso zzso disposal was reduced zzso zzso zzso in caffeine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the total area under the curve over 100 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in caffeine was reduced zzso zzso zzso by approximately 50% in rested and exercised zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso activity before and during insulin infusion in both zzso Exercise increased insulin sensitivity of leg zzso zzso in both caffeine and zzso zzso increased insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities, and zzso zzso of protein zzso B zzso significantly but similarly in rested and exercised zzso Furthermore, insulin significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity equally in both zzso zzso did not alter insulin signaling in either zzso Plasma zzso and muscle zzso zzso were increased in zzso We conclude that 1) caffeine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in rested and exercised human skeletal zzso 2) zzso impairment of zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity are not accompanied by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but may be associated with increases in zzso and intramuscular zzso zzso and 3) exercise reduces the zzso effects of caffeine on insulin action in zzso
