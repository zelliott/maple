The zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso by a mechanism that requires binding of zzso to zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso and an intact zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso a recently identified zzso downstream zzso with zzso potential, but did activate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso as indicated by experiments demonstrating that zzso a zzso specific inhibitor at low zzso suppressed zzso colony formation of zzso zzso cells, and that a zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity inhibited zzso transformation of zzso bone zzso cells in zzso and suppressed leukemia development in zzso zzso In zzso zzso using mouse zzso zzso cells, the ability of zzso zzso domain zzso zzso to induce growth zzso colony formation and leukemia in zzso mice was markedly enhanced by expression of zzso active zzso In zzso infected mouse zzso cells, the zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain was unable to zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in contrast, expression of a zzso active zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso function of zzso Together, these data demonstrate the requirement for the zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso and document the essential role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
