zzso zzso symptomatic carotid zzso are associated with a high risk of stroke in the short zzso Although carotid zzso is effective in reducing this stroke risk, it is frequently not applied within the time window for significant zzso We investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in acutely zzso tissue factor zzso and tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso in unstable carotid zzso 

During a zzso period, 64 patients who had experienced a transient zzso attack or stroke with good recovery within 6 weeks before surgery and 12 zzso patients with a zzso carotid zzso were zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was investigated in zzso zzso The effects of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in cell culture zzso zzso biopsy specimens from zzso samples zzso were incubated with medication for 4 zzso zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso Western zzso analysis, flow zzso and activity zzso 

zzso but not zzso was zzso in zzso removed from patients with recent symptoms and no evidence of zzso zzso but not zzso impaired the induction of zzso in human zzso cells and reduced resting levels of zzso activity in vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso zzso from human zzso zzso Both zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso reduced zzso expression and activity, respectively, in zzso biopsy zzso A low expression of zzso was found in zzso biopsy specimens with little evidence of zzso zzso 

This study suggests that both zzso and zzso zzso have beneficial effects in acutely reducing zzso in unstable carotid zzso
