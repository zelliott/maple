The zzso zzso zzso must complete a complex zzso in its zzso zzso host, the main zzso for zzso The zzso resists infection with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso by engaging the zzso immune signaling pathway, zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso resulted in a decrease in the transcript abundance of zzso which is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso the two genes also resulted in an increased zzso of the zzso to bacterial and zzso zzso infection, but not to infection with the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso of zzso or other key factors of the zzso zzso however, they participate in the regulation of the zzso pathway, which is crucial for the zzso defense against zzso zzso
