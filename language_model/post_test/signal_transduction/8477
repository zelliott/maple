Upon zzso zzso cell surface signaling receptors are zzso through a process tightly regulated by zzso proteins and zzso protein 2 zzso to orchestrate zzso Although the molecular identities and roles of zzso proteins are becoming zzso it is still unclear what determines the zzso zzso zzso which is mainly regulated by the zzso of zzso apparatus to the activated zzso 

Here we employed the kinetic analysis of zzso and zzso recruitment to show that zzso a zzso of zzso interacts directly with zzso D zzso a zzso signaling protein and this zzso the membrane recruitment of zzso and the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso interaction requires the binding of zzso with zzso acid, its own zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso regulation of zzso zzso is achieved by zzso zzso which senses the zzso zzso and triggers the zzso of zzso near to the activated zzso
