zzso is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by zzso recruitment and retention in the vessel zzso An important zzso of zzso zzso interaction is the zzso zzso zzso The zzso products of zzso including oxidized zzso zzso accumulate in zzso zzso and strongly induce zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso The goal of this study was to identify the zzso events leading to induction of zzso by zzso in vascular zzso zzso 

In a systems zzso analysis of zzso isolated from 96 different human donors, we showed that zzso zzso growth factor zzso transcript levels are strongly correlated to zzso induction by zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso confirmed the role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be stored in an inactive form and zzso is dependent on processing by a zzso and zzso zzso to a form that can activate the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso was shown to rapidly induce zzso processing and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso we identified 3 zzso that regulate zzso induction and directly demonstrated that zzso increases zzso activity in the cells using a zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence for one mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso involving zzso binding of zzso to zzso on zzso Free zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso induction by zzso and both a zzso analog and a cell surface zzso blocker strongly inhibited zzso activity induction by zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that this zzso zzso may regulate at least zzso of genes induced by zzso in zzso 

This study is the first report demonstrating a role for the zzso zzso axis in zzso induction of zzso in zzso These studies highlight a role for specific zzso as initiators of zzso action and provide evidence for a role of zzso interaction of zzso in zzso of zzso
