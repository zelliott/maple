In zzso maturation of zzso is a crucial step in assisted zzso technologies in zzso however, the molecular mechanisms of zzso contribution to zzso zzso potential require more zzso Based on zzso data, we studied by using real-time zzso and western zzso in bovine zzso cells, the zzso of expression of several candidate genes involved in zzso stress response, zzso steroid metabolism and signal transmission throughout zzso zzso of the components of the main signaling pathways were also zzso In addition, zzso was performed in different maturation zzso which influenced the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A1 zzso transcript and protein abundance significantly decreased throughout zzso zzso Similarly, transcript levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein levels of three zzso zzso zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased along with progression of maturation and especially since 10 hours of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were particularly increased at 10 hours of zzso This expression pattern supposed the role of these factors during zzso zzso check point of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were higher in 199 basic zzso medium as compared to the medium zzso enriched in zzso and growth factors, in which we recorded the higher zzso rate and zzso zzso Higher zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso or zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso competence and zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso These factors and signaling pathways in zzso cells are potentially involved in controlling different stages of zzso nuclear maturation and zzso of its zzso zzso
