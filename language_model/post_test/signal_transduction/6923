Roots play important roles in plant survival and productivity as they not only anchor the plants in the soil but are also the primary organ for the zzso of nutrients from the zzso The growth and development of roots depend on the zzso and maintenance of the root zzso Here, we report a previously unknown role of TIME FOR zzso zzso in controlling root zzso size in zzso The results showed that loss of function of zzso reduced root zzso length and cell number by decreasing the competence of zzso cells to zzso This was due to the zzso expression of zzso genes for decreased zzso zzso transport in zzso leading to low zzso zzso in the roots responsible for reduced root zzso which was verified by zzso application of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso key zzso factors in zzso the patterning of the root stem cell zzso was also zzso in zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso and zzso plants at either dawn or zzso We also suggested that the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso may not be involved in the regulation of zzso in controlling the root zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso functions in an zzso loop for maintenance of zzso root zzso
