Several fluorescent proteins zzso are prone to forming zzso zzso This zzso tendency is exacerbated when zzso are confined to zzso or when fused to naturally zzso zzso zzso of zzso limits their suitability for creating zzso with proteins of zzso Unfortunately, no standardized method evaluates the biologically relevant zzso state of zzso Here, we describe a quantitative visual zzso for assessing whether zzso are sufficiently zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by virtue of their constrained zzso zzso achieve high effective zzso We exploited this propensity to develop an zzso to measure zzso tendencies to zzso in zzso zzso were fused on the zzso end of an zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and expressed in zzso zzso were scored based on the ability of zzso to zzso with proteins on zzso zzso and restructure the zzso from a zzso network into organized smooth zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio of nuclear envelope and zzso structures mean fluorescent zzso for cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso or zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso established standards for comparison of zzso zzso We tested three zzso and identified two as sufficiently zzso while a third previously reported as zzso was found to strongly zzso
