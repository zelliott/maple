The formation of discrete functional areas is a key event in the development of the cerebral zzso The expression patterns of several molecules associated with zzso guidance reveal zzso of regional identity during fetal development within the cortex, with different zzso features acquired at very early to later stages of zzso Cell culture experiments suggest that complex mechanisms regulate the differentiation of zzso zzso In all instances that we have examined thus far, however, the final zzso adopted by cortical zzso is governed by the capacity of the cell to respond to zzso zzso this is reflected in the zzso of zzso expression by zzso and the zzso and spatial distribution of such signals within the zzso
