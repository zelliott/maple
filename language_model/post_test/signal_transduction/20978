In the zzso fungus zzso zzso cell fusion is governed by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso receptors belong to the seven zzso class that are coupled to zzso G zzso We have isolated four genes zzso to zzso zzso alpha zzso of G zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso in other zzso species, while zzso is zzso zzso zzso in individual genes were viable and only disruption of zzso caused a discernible zzso zzso zzso strains were unable to respond to zzso and thus were zzso A zzso active zzso of zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso were able to mate without zzso zzso indicating that zzso plays an active role in transmission of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso is also required for zzso development, although zzso zzso is not essential for this zzso
