zzso is released in zzso zzso The biological relevance of the resulting fluctuating cortisol concentration has not been zzso 

zzso of the biological consequences of zzso cortisol zzso 

A novel flow through cell culture system was developed to deliver zzso zzso or continuous cortisol to zzso The effects of cortisol dynamics on cell proliferation and survival, and on gene expression were zzso In addition, effects on zzso zzso zzso expression levels and zzso as a potential mediator, were zzso 

zzso cortisol caused a significant reduction in cell survival compared to continuous exposure of the same cumulative dose, due to increased zzso Comprehensive analysis of the zzso response by zzso identified genes with a differential response to zzso versus continuous zzso zzso These were confirmed with zzso Several zzso factor binding sites were enriched in these zzso regulated target zzso including zzso protein zzso A zzso regulated reporter gene zzso was, as predicted, also zzso regulated by zzso compared to continuous cortisol zzso zzso there was no effect of cortisol delivery zzso on either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exert important effects on target cell gene zzso and zzso This is not due to differences in cumulative cortisol exposure, or either zzso or zzso of the zzso This suggests a novel means to regulate zzso zzso
