zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of two identical alpha beta zzso which assemble into either of two zzso structures, T or zzso Recent studies on zzso and partially zzso zzso have revealed that zzso exists between the alpha and the beta zzso of each zzso zzso and have led to a symmetry rule for zzso zzso zzso the zzso R structure is energetically favored over the T structure when each zzso zzso contains at least one zzso zzso
