An improved understanding of the factors that regulate the migration of human embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso would provide new insights into human heart development and suggest novel strategies to improve their zzso integration after zzso zzso Since nothing has been reported as to the factors controlling zzso migration, we hypothesized that zzso would migrate in response to the zzso zzso and soluble signaling molecules previously implicated in heart zzso To test this, we screened candidate factors by zzso zzso for effects on zzso zzso followed by validation via zzso imaging and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso response from zzso with cells seeded on a steep zzso zzso showing nearly a fivefold greater migratory activity than cells on uniform zzso Studies with zzso zzso indicated that zzso and migration on zzso are zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Next, we screened 10 soluble candidate factors by zzso zzso and found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso an approximately twofold increase in migration over zzso This effect was confirmed using the zzso zzso in which zzso zzso showed approximately twofold greater closure than zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso showed that this factor was zzso as well as zzso and zzso responses were inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso show robust zzso responses to zzso and zzso findings that have implications on both cardiac development and zzso zzso
