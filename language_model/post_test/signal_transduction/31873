The primary zzso is a zzso of cell zzso and zzso dysfunction is associated with zzso kidney disease, retinal zzso zzso neural tube zzso and obesity zzso Signaling molecules for zzso pathways are concentrated in the zzso and this is essential for efficient zzso zzso are zzso from zzso and zzso zzso numbers are seen in many zzso and in some zzso We tested the effect of zzso zzso on zzso function and found that cells with extra zzso often formed more than one zzso had reduced zzso concentration of zzso in response to Sonic zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso dilution zzso was also observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of extra zzso and zzso disrupted zzso organization in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso sclerosis gene zzso also had extra zzso and diluted zzso zzso In most cells, extra zzso were clustered and shared the same zzso pocket, suggesting that the zzso pocket is the zzso structure for trafficking of zzso zzso Thus, extra zzso and zzso disrupt signaling and may contribute to disease zzso
