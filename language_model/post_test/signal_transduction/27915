zzso between a T cell zzso zzso and various zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso or altered zzso zzso in the context of major zzso complex zzso molecules can trigger different T helper cell zzso zzso zzso zzso we studied the T cell response induced by a zzso zzso zzso class II zzso namely zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that the soluble zzso zzso binds zzso and specifically to zzso zzso expressed by a T cell zzso Administration of zzso in zzso induced differentiation of resting and activated zzso T cells toward a zzso response, as indicated by the increase of zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso and decrease of zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso T zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso presented by the zzso zzso to T cells, the nominal synthetic zzso induced a zzso zzso response, and the zzso zzso zzso peptides induced a mixed zzso zzso Independent of zzso processing, soluble zzso was almost 2 logs more potent in stimulating zzso T cells than the nominal zzso zzso of zzso T cells toward the zzso response occurred upon interaction of soluble zzso with zzso and zzso molecules followed by early zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and negative signaling of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso molecules may provide a new tool to study the mechanisms of signaling toward zzso differentiation and may also provide a potential zzso approach to zzso zzso T cells toward protective zzso immune zzso
