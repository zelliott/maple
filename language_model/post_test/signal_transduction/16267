Growth differentiation factor 15 zzso is a novel zzso showing close association with cardiovascular zzso The biological mechanism and clinical use of zzso in cardiovascular diseases have been well zzso We review recent investigations from both basic research and clinical trials into the biological role of zzso 

The data were obtained mainly from zzso via zzso and from our own zzso 

Laboratory investigations revealed that zzso has zzso effects on cellular survival by several signaling zzso zzso zzso in several cardiovascular pathological processes such as cardiac zzso zzso injury and zzso plaque zzso As well, zzso was found a zzso zzso of heart failure and acute coronary zzso The evidence for diagnostic or therapeutic utility is zzso 

zzso has great potential as a zzso in cardiovascular diseases, especially for zzso and is seen as a zzso protective zzso but the exact mechanism of zzso in cardiovascular diseases remains zzso
