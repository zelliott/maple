The zzso zzso system is essential for zzso and zzso growth of zzso tuberculosis zzso in human and mouse zzso or in zzso Here, zzso and truncated zzso sensor proteins were shown to participate in zzso reactions using zzso zzso characteristic of zzso signaling zzso zzso activity originating from zzso zzso construct was inhibited in presence of zzso suggesting zzso zzso by the response zzso In zzso binding of zzso is consistent with the in zzso zzso repression, indicating zzso assembly of the zzso initiation complex at elevated zzso of zzso zzso protection studies reveal a consensus recognition sequence within the zzso promoter that includes three zzso direct repeat zzso Each repeat unit adjusts to the consensus zzso zzso in the sequence of the zzso direct repeat units relieved zzso zzso repression in presence of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso its own expression by zzso zzso with the repeat zzso Together, these results identify so far unknown zzso genetic zzso in the regulatory region of the zzso promoter that are central to understanding of how zzso may possibly function as a global regulator in zzso
