Maintaining mobility is a critical element for the quality of zzso zzso muscle, the primary organ for zzso zzso zzso deterioration in size, structure, and zzso Recent research suggests that zzso stress is an important zzso for zzso The level of zzso stress imposed on aging muscle is influenced by two fundamental biological zzso the increased generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso It appears that despite increased zzso production, aging muscle has a decreased gene expression of zzso zzso possibly due to a diminished ability for cell zzso A major benefit of zzso exercise is to induce a mild zzso stress that stimulates the expression of certain zzso zzso This is zzso by the zzso of zzso signaling zzso For example, gene expression of muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso is enhanced after an acute bout of exercise preceded by an elevated level of zzso and zzso zzso An increase in de zzso protein synthesis of an zzso zzso usually requires repeated bouts of zzso Aging does not abolish but seems to zzso training adaptations of zzso zzso Thus, for zzso muscle, training should be assisted with supplementation of zzso antioxidants to research the optimal level of zzso
