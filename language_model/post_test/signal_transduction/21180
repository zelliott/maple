zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso on hair cell zzso were studied in an intact cochlear zzso where the zzso and zzso surfaces could be separately zzso with different zzso zzso zzso The speed and extent of zzso adaptation increased as the concentration in the patch zzso of the zzso buffer zzso was zzso In zzso zzso zzso or less, the zzso adapted almost completely, with a mean time constant of zzso zzso zzso For a fixed internal zzso zzso the zzso zzso varied with hair cell location, increasing towards the zzso end of the zzso and the time constant of adaptation decreased zzso At a given cochlear location, hair cells with larger zzso zzso displayed faster zzso We suggest that zzso adaptation accounts for a variable zzso filter observed in the acoustic tuning zzso zzso The effects of zzso of 50 zzso zzso zzso depended on the zzso concentration of the zzso with 3 zzso zzso adaptation was zzso but in most recordings with zzso or zzso zzso zzso rapid adaptation was zzso The zzso curve was also shifted less the lower the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso half of the zzso retained adaptation at a higher zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso or with the zzso inhibitor zzso caused a rightward shift in the zzso curve which was independent of the internal zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the free zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the hair bundle zzso the position of the zzso curve of the zzso The factors which may be important for the correct functioning of adaptation in zzso are zzso
