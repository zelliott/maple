zzso possess a complex zzso system which plays a major role in zzso zzso Taking into account a considerably high concentration of one of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in this organ and previously reported zzso activity against colon cancer cells in zzso we measured its content in human normal and zzso kidney zzso zzso concentration was considerably higher in normal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso than in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso In in zzso experiments, zzso in higher zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso DNA synthesis and migration of zzso cancer zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may affect cell cycle regulators and zzso pathways through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso protein and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may be suggested as an zzso agent, controlling the growth of zzso or a zzso zzso
