To date, the zzso molecular targets through which dietary zzso zzso fatty acids zzso suppress the inflammatory process have not been zzso Because cholesterol and zzso zzso have been proposed as platforms for zzso zzso regulated signaling zzso at the plasma zzso we determined the in zzso effects of fish oil and highly zzso zzso acid zzso zzso on T cell zzso zzso composition and the membrane zzso distribution of zzso molecules zzso zzso C zzso zzso for zzso of T cells, and zzso before and after zzso Mice were fed diets containing 5 zzso g corn oil zzso 4 zzso g fish oil zzso a mixture of zzso zzso plus 1 zzso g corn oil, or 4 zzso g corn oil plus 1 zzso g zzso zzso zzso for 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into zzso T cell zzso raft and soluble membrane zzso resulting in a zzso reduction in raft zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso With respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited by fish oil zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso zzso was zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that dietary zzso alters T cell membrane zzso composition and suppresses the zzso signaling zzso
