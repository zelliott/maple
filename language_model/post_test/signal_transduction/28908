zzso long- or zzso syndrome may lead to life-threatening zzso zzso and sudden cardiac zzso Apart from the rare zzso zzso common genetic zzso in zzso a zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso regulator, have recently been associated with zzso zzso variations in a human zzso association zzso zzso had been zzso of playing a role in cardiac zzso indeed, its zzso role in the heart (if zzso is zzso To define the biological effects of zzso in the heart, we investigated zzso zzso protein expression and zzso interactions in the heart and performed zzso studies in isolated zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso We find that zzso protein is expressed in the heart and interacts with zzso to accelerate cardiac zzso by zzso of zzso calcium zzso Our findings provide a rationale for the association of zzso gene zzso with extremes of the zzso zzso in human zzso
