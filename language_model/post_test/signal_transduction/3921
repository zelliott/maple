zzso are known to be zzso molecules in zzso stem zzso We studied the interaction between the molecular structure of zzso zzso and their promoting mechanisms of the zzso processes in human zzso zzso zzso The effect of various zzso from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion and zzso zzso production was examined by human zzso using zzso cells of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a marked zzso effect on the zzso and zzso fusion in a zzso manner, while zzso zzso zzso zzso and neutral zzso did zzso The relative zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso was the highest among the tested zzso Both zzso fusion rate and zzso of zzso zzso were elevated significantly when coated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso gave a five times higher rate than that of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the terminal zzso acid zzso is essential for the enhancement of zzso and that the number of zzso acid molecules in the zzso is related to the enhancement of the zzso fusion zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso release from zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, to clarify the trigger or the signal zzso mechanism of zzso zzso we examined the effect of protein zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso in the range of concentration without cell damage, while zzso zzso and zzso did zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso II may be involved in the induction of zzso and zzso fusion zzso by zzso
