Once thought of as toxic zzso of cellular zzso zzso oxygen species zzso have been implicated in a large variety of zzso zzso Several zzso systems contribute to zzso production in vascular zzso cells, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and the zzso electron transport zzso The respiratory chain is the major source of zzso in most zzso cells, but the role of zzso zzso in vascular cell signaling has received little zzso A new paradigm has evolved in recent years zzso that, in addition to producing zzso zzso also play a key role in cell signaling and regulate a variety of cellular zzso This review focuses on the emerging role of zzso zzso as signaling molecules in vascular zzso zzso Specifically, we discuss some recent findings that indicate that zzso zzso regulate vascular zzso function, focusing on major sites of zzso production in zzso zzso factors modulating zzso zzso production, the zzso and clinical implications of zzso zzso zzso and zzso considerations in the study of zzso contribution to vascular zzso zzso
