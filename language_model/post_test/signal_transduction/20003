zzso oxide zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in a multitude of zzso and zzso processes in plants, which has been reported to display both zzso and zzso properties in zzso Several reports exist highlighting the protective action of sodium zzso zzso an NO zzso which demonstrate its important role as a signal zzso in plants responsible for the expression regulation of zzso and other defense zzso However, the mode of application of this compound varies greatly between zzso The present study provides a comprehensive efficiency comparison of the most commonly used application methods using zzso zzso on mature (40 day) zzso zzso zzso zzso of NO content in both leaves and roots suggests that vacuum zzso is the most efficient method for NO donation in leaf zzso whereas zzso application resulted in highest NO content in zzso NO content correlated with activity levels of nitrate zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso involved in the generation of NO in plants and which is known to be regulated by NO zzso
