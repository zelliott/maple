zzso expression of CA IX zzso zzso zzso is to a major extent regulated by zzso zzso zzso which is important for zzso zzso and consists of the zzso zzso zzso and the partner factor zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso We have previously observed that zzso competes with the zzso for interaction with zzso under conditions when both zzso regulated factors are zzso We have therefore investigated whether zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso might interfere with CA IX zzso The results from the present study suggest that zzso treatment reduces hypoxic induction of both CA IX zzso and protein zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of the zzso promoter was significantly reduced by expression of zzso zzso active zzso which activates zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso is critical for both hypoxic induction and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
