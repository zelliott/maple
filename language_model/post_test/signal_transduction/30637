zzso zzso the principal zzso in green tea, has been shown to be a potent zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a cell surface zzso for zzso that mediates the zzso activity of zzso Indeed, expression of zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to tumor zzso however, the molecular basis for the zzso activity of zzso in zzso is not entirely zzso Here we show that zzso using a direct genetic screen, zzso translation zzso factor zzso zzso is identified as a component responsible for the zzso activity of zzso zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso targeting zzso 1 zzso at zzso and activates zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in tumor cells results in zzso of zzso tumor growth zzso in zzso Additionally, we found that zzso is zzso by zzso through zzso Overall, these findings zzso both zzso and zzso in zzso signaling for cancer prevention through zzso
