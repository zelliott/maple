The onset of zzso in zzso cells is triggered by localized zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso crystal suggested that zzso may form zzso in some zzso In this study, we use zzso zzso resonance energy transfer imaging to demonstrate that zzso zzso are present at a zzso level on the cell surface and accumulate at the zzso zzso we reveal two conditions under which zzso are highly zzso First, zzso zzso are more zzso in zzso prolonged cell contacts with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso This is consistent with a model zzso the zzso functions to increase zzso zzso Second, we show that zzso zzso result in an increased level of an inactive zzso bound to the zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso We also find a consistent zzso in signaling onset in these zzso This supports a role for zzso zzso in maintaining active signaling zzso We suggest that zzso of the zzso ratio may permit tuning of zzso thresholds during initial zzso
