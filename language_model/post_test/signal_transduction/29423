zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is well established as a key genetic step in the development and growth of pancreatic zzso However, the means by which zzso Ras signaling promotes uncontrolled pancreatic tumor cell growth remains to be fully zzso The recent use of primary human cells to study zzso zzso provides important model cell systems to dissect this signaling zzso This chapter describes the establishment and characterization of zzso human pancreatic zzso cells to study mechanisms of Ras growth zzso An important strength of this model system is the ability of zzso activated zzso to cause potent growth transformation in zzso and in zzso We have zzso this cell system to evaluate the zzso activity of small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso This model will be useful for genetic and zzso dissection of the contribution of downstream zzso signaling in zzso growth zzso
