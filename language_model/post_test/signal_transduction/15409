zzso zzso factor zzso which mediates zzso growth, zzso and synaptic zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso The present study investigated the expression of zzso in response to the zzso of group I zzso zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso in zzso cells, which peaked by zzso after zzso exposure, was attenuated by the zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso expression reduced in cultures zzso with protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed high zzso expression in zzso of zzso cells after zzso of incubation with zzso zzso but this was lower in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of group I zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression via zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso
