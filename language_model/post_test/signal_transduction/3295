zzso traits describe parameters associated with growth, size, survival, and zzso zzso variation is a hallmark of biological diversity, yet researchers commonly observe that one of the major axes of zzso variation after controlling for body size involves zzso among growth, zzso and zzso This persistent pattern of zzso among these specific traits has engendered a search for shared mechanisms that could zzso or facilitate production of variation in zzso zzso zzso traits are one candidate mechanism that may zzso the integration of life history and other zzso zzso However, the vast majority of this research has been on the effects of steroid hormones such as zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Here we propose an expansion of the focus on zzso and zzso hormones and review the potential role of zzso growth zzso zzso in shaping the zzso integration of multiple zzso zzso IGF-1 is a zzso zzso hormone largely produced by the zzso We zzso a vast array of research demonstrating that IGF-1 levels are susceptible to environmental variation and that IGF-1 can have potent zzso effects on zzso growth and reproduction but decrease zzso We review the few studies in natural populations that have measured plasma IGF-1 zzso and its associations with zzso traits or other characteristics of the zzso or its zzso We focus on two case studies that found support for the hypothesis that IGF-1 mediates zzso divergence in suites of zzso traits in response to varying ecological conditions or artificial zzso We also examine what we view as potentially fruitful avenues of research on this topic, which until now has been rarely investigated by evolutionary zzso We discuss how IGF-1 may facilitate zzso plasticity in zzso strategies in response to early environmental conditions and also how selection on zzso controlling IGF-1 signaling may mediate population divergence and eventual zzso After consideration of the interactions among zzso zzso and IGF-1 we suggest that IGF-1 be considered a suitable candidate mechanism for zzso zzso zzso Finally, we discuss what we can learn about IGF-1 from studies in zzso zzso The zzso literature in laboratory and zzso animals documenting relationships among IGF-1, growth, zzso and lifespan demonstrates the potential for a number of new research questions to be asked in zzso zzso zzso how IGF-1 mediates zzso traits in zzso animals could lead to great insight into the mechanisms that influence zzso zzso
