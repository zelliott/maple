zzso zzso zzso are involved in signal zzso from a variety of zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling and the zzso production of inflammatory proteins zzso zzso 

We sought to demonstrate proof of concept in patients with stable plaque zzso 

Patients were zzso with vehicle, zzso or zzso zzso zzso cream once a day or zzso twice a day for 28 zzso Additional groups included two active zzso zzso zzso cream or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both the zzso and the zzso cream improved zzso zzso zzso and zzso and reduced zzso area compared with zzso A composite zzso score decreased by greater than 50% with the zzso doses of zzso compared with zzso for vehicle zzso zzso application of zzso was well tolerated with few mild adverse events zzso Mean plasma zzso of zzso after topical application of zzso to zzso cream were in the low zzso range, representing a fraction zzso of the half zzso zzso concentration zzso in whole blood for zzso of zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

This study was limited by the relatively short study duration and small sample zzso 

zzso zzso is safe, is well zzso and exhibits clinical activity in the topical treatment of zzso
