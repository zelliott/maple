zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin signaling following zzso zzso fetal growth restriction zzso were the focus of our zzso Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the fetal zzso zzso adapts during an zzso gestation by increasing zzso zzso protein zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and insulin signal zzso protein zzso Growth zzso and whole heart tissue were obtained at 55 days zzso age zzso 90 zzso and 135 zzso zzso zzso 145 zzso in fetuses from control zzso and zzso zzso pregnant zzso Additionally, in 135 zzso animals, zzso blood was obtained and zzso ultrasound was used to determine zzso artery zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso zzso profiles to calculate zzso zzso - zzso and resistance zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin signal zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso and zzso content were zzso Compared to zzso controls, zzso zzso fetal body weights and zzso zzso fetal weights and gross heart weights were zzso Heart weights as a percent of body weights were similar between C and zzso sheep at 135 zzso zzso zzso animals had zzso lower fetal zzso plasma zzso and insulin zzso zzso lower zzso blood oxygen content and higher plasma zzso zzso zzso higher zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso protein and insulin zzso beta protein zzso ) zzso zzso higher zzso zzso content, and zzso higher zzso artery zzso zzso and resistance zzso The zzso zzso fetal zzso adapts to reduced circulating zzso and insulin zzso by increasing plasma membrane zzso and zzso protein zzso The increased zzso zzso PM and zzso protein zzso likely contribute to or increase the zzso delivery of zzso and, together with the increased zzso zzso enhance zzso zzso which allows for maintained zzso growth commensurate with fetal body zzso
