To investigate the roles of zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso transition zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso 

Human zzso were incubated with zzso with various zzso for indicated zzso Cell viability was zzso by zzso zzso zzso Changes were observed by zzso zzso marker zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso marker zzso zzso were analyzed by Western zzso The pull-down zzso was used to measure zzso zzso In the prevention experiments, the specific inhibitor for zzso zzso ROCK zzso was used to inhibit the activity of zzso 

Human zzso zzso with zzso were converted from a zzso zzso structure into an zzso zzso shape zzso zzso of human zzso with zzso induced de zzso expression of zzso and zzso and loss of zzso Also, zzso treatment resulted in zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression but attenuated zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso signaling pathways is most likely involved in zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso
