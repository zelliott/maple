We reported previously that the zzso zzso zzso zzso monkey showed regionally specific zzso zzso in zzso imaging, similar to that observed in the early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease zzso However, further pathological analyses of this model at the molecular level are needed to validate it as a feasible model for zzso Two zzso monkeys were injected with 2 zzso zzso into the zzso zzso at day 1, 7 and zzso Two control monkeys were given normal zzso At 5 months after injection, the expression levels of genes zzso 9 upstream molecules in zzso growth factor zzso signaling and markers for 4 zzso populations in the frontal cortex, zzso zzso cingulate, zzso and zzso zzso of control and zzso treated zzso monkeys were zzso zzso quantitative zzso analyses demonstrated that the overall zzso expression of zzso zzso genes was mainly impaired in the anterior part of the zzso frontal cortex, and zzso similar to the early stage of zzso The changes were accompanied by the loss of zzso and zzso The zzso part of the zzso did not show degenerative zzso The present study provides important fundamental information on the zzso monkey model for zzso These results may help guide future studies using this model for the investigation of pathological mechanisms and the development of drugs for zzso
