zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso It serves as an zzso zzso for adhesive proteins and is the zzso member of the zzso zzso Its major global structural features have been zzso mainly during the last zzso Since 1995, there has been a substantial increase in structural information on zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of isolated zzso I zzso have been zzso Although a high resolution picture of a whole zzso zzso is not yet available, the crystal structures together with zzso zzso and modeling data provide a useful framework for interpreting current experimental evidence on zzso correlations of zzso molecules and for guiding further zzso The aim of this zzso is to update a previous one zzso recent zzso functional and structural data of zzso and other zzso in the perspective of an emerging model of the structure, and zzso signaling mechanism through, zzso zzso
