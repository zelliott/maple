zzso is best known for its function in targeting proteins for degradation by the zzso Recent studies have revealed several new functions of zzso that are independent of zzso zzso These functions include the novel signaling roles of zzso in DNA repair and the zzso of protein zzso such as zzso zzso In both cases, a novel form of zzso chain linked through zzso of zzso plays an important regulatory zzso zzso also has signaling roles that are distinct from those of zzso as illustrated from the studies of DNA zzso Thus, zzso and zzso have emerged as important signaling mechanisms that control diverse zzso and pathological zzso
