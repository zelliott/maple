The mechanisms by which growth factors trigger signal zzso pathways leading to protection against zzso are of great zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso on zzso zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso cells with zzso a DNA zzso zzso zzso caused zzso However, cells zzso with zzso but not those zzso with zzso were resistant to this zzso The protective effect of zzso against the zzso zzso was abolished in the presence of either zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso thus implicating the zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso action of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso the sustained zzso of zzso for several hours but that zzso zzso the zzso only zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso was inhibited for at least 24 h after zzso zzso but it was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso remained on the cell surface until at least 30 zzso after zzso addition but that the zzso zzso level on the cell surface was attenuated at an earlier time after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso but not zzso transmitted protective signals against zzso zzso by causing sustained zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, the difference in zzso capacity between zzso and zzso is explained, at least in part, by the delayed zzso of the zzso zzso
