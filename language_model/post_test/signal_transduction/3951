The zzso are members of the zzso hydrocarbon class of environmental chemicals that includes the zzso and zzso The zzso were used over a period of 40 years for number of industrial zzso Their appearance in the zzso and biological samples from wildlife, as well as documented cases of accidental poisoning led to the banning of their manufacture in zzso The zzso continue to be of concern to environmental zzso because of their persistence in the environment and reports that exposure to relatively low levels may be associated with subtle behavioral and neurological deficits, particularly if exposure occurs during zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been reported in humans and confirmed in several laboratory animal species, including zzso zzso During the last 20 years, there has been an attempt to understand the cellular bases of zzso behavioral and neurological effects in animal zzso Exposure of adult animals to a single, relatively high dose of zzso decreases the content of several brain zzso while repeated exposure to lower zzso doses appears to affect brain zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso affects zzso remains zzso It is now known that some zzso zzso have a structural zzso that zzso binding to an zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso like other zzso compounds, including zzso zzso Some zzso zzso on the other hand, have structural zzso zzso zzso that diminish access to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that appear in the brain following in zzso exposure demonstrate the highest potency in terms of decreasing zzso content in zzso cells and zzso calcium zzso mechanisms in zzso The biological significance of the effects of the zzso on zzso content or calcium zzso with regard to the behavioral and neurological effects observed following zzso exposure in zzso is not zzso Recent research, however, suggests that zzso can alter a number of zzso processes that may be important for zzso For example, zzso zzso in zzso function during development may zzso some of the zzso effects of zzso reported in humans and animal zzso Additional research on the zzso seems warranted in a number of areas, including zzso 1) structural requirements necessary for binding to the zzso 2) zzso of zzso zzso in zzso content and calcium zzso in zzso 3) relationship between observed zzso effects in zzso and effects in zzso and 4) relationship between zzso zzso effects and crucial zzso processes such as those controlled by zzso hormone zzso
