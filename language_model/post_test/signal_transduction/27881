zzso or programmed cell death zzso is the subject of much current investigative zzso zzso zzso and many adult organ systems require the tight zzso of cellular proliferation and zzso to ensure proper zzso and optimal tissue zzso Over the past decade, our knowledge of the genetic basis underlying the execution of zzso in zzso has progressed enormously, thanks largely to groundbreaking studies performed in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the components of the signaling apparatus that links the various death stimuli and the receptors they stimulate to the execution mechanism remain relatively zzso It is only in the past 4 years that studies of signal zzso via members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso have identified a plethora of novel signaling zzso including molecules that are directly involved in zzso zzso and others that regulate the induction of cell zzso This zzso review focuses on the biology of zzso and signaling through members of the zzso zzso zzso as revealed by the study of zzso zzso zzso These genetic zzso animals are invaluable tools not only for confirming or zzso a proposed function of a particular gene in an in zzso setting, but also for uncovering novel functions for a gene that were not anticipated from conventional in zzso zzso In the field of zzso as for many other areas of biomedical research, knockout mice and cell lines can be used as models for studying human disease, with the ultimate goal of developing therapeutic zzso
