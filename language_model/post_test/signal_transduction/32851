zzso released from zzso and zzso zzso stores plays important roles in zzso synaptic zzso including long-term depression zzso of synaptic zzso At zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso stores appear to mobilize some of the zzso necessary to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed as an zzso zzso of zzso receptors in sea zzso eggs and several zzso cell zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso signaling pathways play a key role in inducing zzso We show that zzso production of zzso increases zzso concentration in zzso slices in zzso and that blockade of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso stores each prevent the induction of zzso at zzso zzso zzso A lack of effect of zzso infusion of either zzso zzso indicates a probable zzso site of zzso
