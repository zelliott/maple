zzso zzso factor zzso also known as zzso zzso in inflammatory zone 1), is an important player in lung zzso However, the effects of zzso on cell zzso molecules involved in lung inflammation remain largely zzso In the present work, we tested whether zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and dissected the possible signaling pathways that link zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso instilled zzso into adult mouse zzso results in a significant increase of zzso production in vascular zzso zzso type II, and airway zzso zzso In cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso cells, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression via the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interference zzso attenuated zzso zzso expression in zzso We showed that zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and, zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso Meanwhile, zzso production was zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso by expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso also strongly induced zzso of zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Our findings connect zzso to signaling pathways that regulate zzso and thus reveal the critical roles that zzso plays in lung zzso
