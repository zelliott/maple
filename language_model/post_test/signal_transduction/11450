Development of strategies for prevention of breast cancer development requires an understanding of the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cells at early stages in zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso and zzso affect different signal zzso zzso we investigated their effects on established mouse zzso zzso cell lines zzso reflecting early stages in zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso were zzso in all three immortalized zzso and the cells lacked zzso zzso activity, zzso using a reporter zzso suggesting that zzso in cell zzso may be very early events in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with expression zzso zzso zzso or zzso or the control zzso and zzso pooled cells from each line were confirmed by reverse zzso chain reaction to express the zzso zzso this expression persisted in the cells zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso changes depended both on the zzso and the target zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, expression of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso changes in zzso including reduced contact zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso activity, but neither zzso zzso upon those cells the ability to produce tumors in zzso zzso cells were highly zzso to the effects of both zzso with the only measurable changes being increased zzso levels induced by both zzso and increased proliferation of the zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso similar to zzso or zzso zzso cells and displayed an increased rate of proliferation in zzso and markedly increased zzso in zzso following zzso with zzso but not with zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling is redundant in the zzso zzso cells and indicate that zzso effects in the immortalized zzso and zzso cells were not sufficient to mediate a zzso zzso This study showed that the zzso and zzso zzso have similar but distinguishable effects on immortalized zzso and that the genetic background of the zzso cells greatly influences the consequences of zzso expression at early stages of cell zzso
