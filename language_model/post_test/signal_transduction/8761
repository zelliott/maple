zzso disease zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso stem cell zzso Current treatment of zzso relies on zzso regimens, considerably increasing the zzso of opportunistic zzso As T cells mediate both zzso as well as protection against viral infections and the zzso disease, strategies to selectively target zzso T cells without zzso zzso and zzso immunity are highly zzso zzso of T cells is accompanied by increased expression of the zzso heat shock protein of 90 zzso zzso which zzso several key signaling pathways crucial for zzso zzso In this study, selective targeting of zzso in activated T zzso with zzso zzso already applied successfully in zzso therapy resulted in induction of zzso predominantly in activated zzso Moreover, if T cells were zzso with zzso zzso cells, zzso T cells were selectively zzso In contrast, third party reactions including zzso zzso immunity were zzso and functionally fully zzso These data suggest that zzso represents a novel target for selective depletion of zzso T cells, and provide the rationale for application of zzso zzso as potential approach to selectively prevent and treat zzso in zzso stem cell transplantation recipients without zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
