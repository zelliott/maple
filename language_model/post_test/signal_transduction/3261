zzso zzso has been identified to exert beneficial effects in preventing zzso bone zzso However, the active ingredients and mechanism of action remain zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso II zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso differentiation and maturation of rat primary zzso as well as its relevant molecular zzso We found that zzso II exhibits a significant induction of zzso differentiation and zzso in primary zzso zzso II stimulates zzso differentiation at various zzso from early to late stage of differentiated zzso Furthermore, induction of differentiation by zzso II is associated with increased expression of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and increased expression of zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks the effect of zzso II on cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but only partly decreases zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is essential in zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso and is partly involved in zzso zzso In conclusion, although in zzso studies are required in the future, as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso II may become a novel candidate that is beneficial for stimulating the zzso activity resulting in bone formation, which has not been recognized and reported zzso
