The zzso zzso zzso are important zzso of zzso small zzso The zzso family consists of two groups, type I and type II, which have different modes of regulation and zzso zzso a type II zzso influences behavior and locomotor function in mice and has an ascribed role in zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso has a zzso zzso specificity very similar to the other type II zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso activity is inhibited by a zzso corresponding to its zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso zzso into this zzso reduces zzso zzso of zzso and increases zzso of its zzso zzso zzso I) in zzso Finally we determine two zzso structures of zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso zzso We determined the zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso with the type II zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso with zzso These findings provide new insights into the zzso relationships of zzso and may facilitate development of zzso targeted zzso
