zzso experiments for example using zzso interference zzso offer an attractive way to zzso gene function in a high zzso zzso The placement of hit genes in their functional context and the zzso of underlying networks from such data, however, are challenging zzso One of the problems in network zzso is the exponential number of possible network zzso for a given number of zzso Here, we introduce a novel mathematical approach to address this zzso We formulate network zzso as a linear zzso problem, which can be solved efficiently even for large-scale zzso We use simulated data to evaluate our approach, and show improved performance in particular on larger networks over zzso art zzso We achieve increased sensitivity and zzso as well as a significant reduction in computing zzso Furthermore, we show superior performance on noisy zzso We then apply our approach to study the zzso signaling of human primary nave zzso zzso as well as zzso signaling in zzso resistant breast cancer zzso In both cases, our approach recovers known interactions and points to additional relevant zzso In zzso zzso our results predict an important role of negative and positive feedback in controlling the cell cycle zzso
