zzso cell zzso zzso survival, and zzso are controlled by the membrane zzso zzso zzso upon interaction with stem cell factor zzso Here we describe a single point zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A to T zzso at position zzso zzso 17) of the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso 787 substitution by zzso zzso and analyze the consequences of this zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso mice carrying the single zzso acid exchange of zzso lacks both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In bone zzso mast cells zzso the zzso zzso does not affect zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso but strongly zzso zzso zzso production, zzso enhancement, and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso downstream signaling in zzso zzso is normally initiated zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso but fails to be sustained zzso In addition, zzso zzso does not efficiently mediate zzso zzso leading to the absence of subsequent zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso Thus, zzso provides zzso signals for zzso zzso and zzso
