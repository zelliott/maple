zzso are nearly ubiquitous environmental zzso that are produced as byproducts during industrial zzso including the zzso of paper and zzso zzso of animal zzso material with zzso has been a concern for both laboratory and farm zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of cotton balls, provided to mice for enrichment, caused induction of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which typically is zzso through zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts and protein in the liver were increased significantly by either exposure to cotton balls or treatment with a single dose of zzso zzso controls displayed low levels of zzso transcript and zzso levels of zzso zzso These results suggest that cotton balls are potentially contaminated with zzso and/or zzso compounds that act as potent zzso of zzso in laboratory animals if used as zzso zzso This study underscores the necessity of considering zzso content in products used for enrichment in animal zzso
