zzso in the zzso zzso signaling zzso leading to its zzso are known to cause the majority of zzso zzso However, few genes targeted by this zzso have been demonstrated to affect tumor development in zzso Here we show that zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene expressed in the base of zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso tumors and human colon zzso Moreover, by comparing tumor development in zzso zzso zzso (multiple zzso zzso mice expressing or lacking zzso we found that zzso zzso significantly reduces the formation and growth of zzso in zzso However, invasion of zzso zzso tumors is enhanced by a lack of zzso In line with this, zzso of zzso reduced the growth potential of human zzso cancer cells and their ability to form zzso zzso a prerequisite for local invasion of tumor zzso Our data indicate a novel zzso between zzso and zzso zzso pathways that influences zzso tumor formation and zzso
