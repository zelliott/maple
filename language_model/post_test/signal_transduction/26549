Early experiments showed zzso had obvious therapeutic effect on viral zzso but zzso was unstable in zzso To overcome this zzso we used zzso as a lead compound to zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we compared the therapeutic effects of zzso with zzso on zzso virus B3 zzso viral zzso zzso as well as investigated the possible zzso The zzso and zzso effects in zzso were evaluated on zzso cells infected by zzso and rat zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 50% toxic concentration zzso in zzso cells was zzso higher than in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice were infected with zzso for establishing zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso reduced the viral zzso and cardiac pathological changes in a zzso zzso zzso virus zzso were significantly lower in the 50 zzso zzso group than in zzso zzso In addition, zzso could significantly inhibit the replication of zzso zzso and the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We further observed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso in a zzso manner, and reduced Toll like zzso zzso 4 protein level in zzso These results suggest that zzso had a promising therapeutic effect on zzso with a highly significant favorable effects and less toxicity than zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on zzso might be through zzso of inflammatory zzso
