zzso and zzso are two protein zzso zzso of type zzso zzso zzso that act as key regulators in the responses of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso They are involved in the control of zzso seed zzso zzso closure and zzso growth zzso Analysis of the zzso properties of zzso revealed high sensitivities towards zzso and zzso fatty zzso Furthermore, the protein zzso activity of zzso is very sensitive to zzso which has recently emerged as a secondary zzso of zzso zzso Upon zzso challenge, zzso is rapidly zzso with an zzso value of 50 zzso in the presence of reduced zzso zzso studies with zzso oxide and manipulation of the zzso status of zzso in zzso indicate that zzso of critical zzso zzso is responsible for zzso The levels of the major cellular zzso compounds zzso and zzso in leaves and zzso of zzso zzso are compatible with a zzso role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso is considered to exert negative regulation on zzso zzso Thus, transient zzso of this protein zzso by zzso would allow or enhance the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso represents a likely target for zzso of a hormonal zzso zzso in higher zzso
