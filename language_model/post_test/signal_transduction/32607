The coordinated interplay of zzso zzso and zzso is necessary for cell zzso Using zzso cells, we found that zzso growth factor I zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and collagen in a zzso and zzso manner, suggesting that zzso triggers the zzso of different zzso On the other hand, zzso promotes the association of insulin zzso zzso 1 with the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cells expressing zzso show reduced zzso zzso compared with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso This impairment of cell migration is recovered by zzso of a zzso active zzso Interestingly, zzso cells show a larger number of focal zzso contacts than zzso cells, suggesting that zzso activity zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso regulates zzso protein zzso activity, the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has only a marginal effect on zzso cell zzso The role of zzso as a general regulator of cell zzso induced by other zzso agents and zzso is zzso
