zzso regulatory T zzso cells are believed to play an important role in suppressing zzso and maintaining peripheral zzso How their survival is regulated in the periphery is less zzso Here we show that zzso cells express receptors for gamma chain zzso and are dependent on an zzso supply of these zzso to overcome zzso withdrawal zzso in zzso This result was validated in zzso by the zzso of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso mice which have arrested zzso deprivation zzso We also found that zzso and zzso expression were zzso in the absence of these zzso zzso cells from zzso mice do not depend on zzso for survival demonstrating that zzso increases their dependence on zzso by suppressing zzso production in zzso zzso Our study reveals that the survival of zzso cells is strictly dependent on zzso and zzso producing cells because they do not produce zzso Our study thus, demonstrates that different gamma chain zzso regulate zzso zzso in the periphery by zzso regulating survival and zzso These findings may shed light on ways to manipulate zzso cells that could be zzso for their therapeutic zzso
