Within the nuclear zzso family, zzso (also known as zzso zzso itself by its ability to bind a target sequence (the zzso as a zzso and by its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso in T zzso We now report on a novel mechanism of zzso action that is zzso by zzso These zzso bind a zzso response element zzso which has been identified as a target of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso Both halves of the zzso zzso are required for responsiveness to zzso signals, like zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso but not zzso zzso The in zzso signaling function of zzso thus appears to be zzso by zzso acting on a zzso response element of unusual spacing between its zzso This mechanism may represent the biologically relevant paradigm of action for this zzso of orphan nuclear zzso
