In the zzso zzso two zzso factors, zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso factor, have been shown previously to have similar effects on the survival of zzso zzso Here, we compared the signaling mechanisms for zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso factor, focusing on the zzso protein zzso and the zzso factor zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that many zzso zzso the receptors for zzso cell zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso suggesting that they are responsive to both zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso factor induced a rapid zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso responsive zzso zzso there were significant differences in the zzso and pharmacology of the zzso The zzso of zzso protein zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso factor was zzso within 2 zzso the level of zzso protein zzso zzso returned to zzso In contrast, the effect of zzso zzso factor was long zzso the zzso protein zzso remained zzso for up to 4 h after zzso zzso factor zzso zzso a specific inhibitor for zzso protein zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso cell zzso zzso factor signaling through zzso protein zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Both zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso factor induced the zzso of zzso responsive zzso protein in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso blocked the zzso responsive zzso protein zzso induced by zzso cell zzso zzso factor, but not that by zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that, although both zzso zzso factor and zzso cell zzso zzso factor act on zzso zzso zzso the two factors have different signaling mechanisms, which may mediate their distinctive biological zzso
