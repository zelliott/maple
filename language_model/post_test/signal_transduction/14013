Alzheimer's disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and is the most common cause of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso features zzso zzso of two proteins in the brain, zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso both of which have been linked to the small zzso modifier zzso A large body of research has zzso many of the molecular and cellular pathways that zzso zzso including those involving the abnormal zzso and zzso zzso However, a full understanding of the zzso and zzso of the disease has remained zzso zzso there are currently no effective therapeutic options that can modify the disease progression and slow or stop the decline of cognitive zzso As part of the effort to address this zzso there needs a better understanding of the signaling pathways that become impaired under zzso pathology, including the regulatory mechanisms that normally control those zzso One such mechanism involves zzso which is a zzso modification zzso that is involved in regulating many aspects of cell biology and has also been found to have several critical zzso zzso Early studies have indicated that the zzso system is likely altered with zzso pathology, which may impact zzso levels and zzso zzso Although still a relatively unexplored topic, zzso will likely emerge as a significant factor in zzso zzso in ways which may be somewhat analogous to other regulatory zzso such as zzso Thus, in addition to the upstream effects on zzso and zzso processing, there may also be downstream effects zzso by zzso zzso or other zzso factors on zzso signaling zzso Multiple proteins that have functions relevant to zzso pathology have been identified as zzso zzso including those involved in synaptic zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso studies will determine how these zzso functions in zzso and zzso cells may be impacted by zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present a review of the current literature on the involvement of zzso in zzso as well as an overview of the zzso proteins and pathways that are potentially zzso with zzso zzso
