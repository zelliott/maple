zzso markers like zzso zzso status, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression have zzso value in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso These may be zzso because of the coincidental expression of zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso signaling and the signaling function of zzso in zzso This study shows that zzso zzso B cells respond in zzso more readily than zzso zzso and normal B cells to zzso migratory signals through enhanced surface zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and increased responsiveness to its zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular migration zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso cells exhibit sustained zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso zzso a survival factor produced by zzso zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso cells, the survival of zzso but not zzso zzso cells is significantly enhanced by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso an effect that is partially blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso These advantageous migratory and survival responses may promote easier access to and greater proliferation in zzso centers and explain in part the more progressive nature of zzso zzso
