Sonic zzso zzso signaling is required for the growth and patterning of many zzso in zzso zzso but important aspects of the zzso signal zzso zzso are poorly zzso For example, the zzso transport protein zzso is a cell autonomous negative regulator of zzso zzso but the process affected by zzso has not been zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso acts upstream of zzso zzso factors in patterning neural cell types in the spinal zzso Double zzso analysis indicates that the primary target of zzso is the zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso zzso have additive effects on zzso Analysis of zzso protein suggests that zzso also has a role in promoting the production of zzso zzso Although the membrane proteins zzso and zzso change zzso zzso in response to zzso double zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso does not work through either zzso or zzso Instead, zzso appears to regulate zzso zzso of essential components of the zzso zzso that act downstream of zzso and upstream of zzso zzso
