In this study we demonstrate that zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso cell line, during cell growth, need the zzso of multiple zzso binding sites or zzso zzso to mediate signal zzso The loss of one of these affects the cellular zzso Moreover, zzso the zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso on the cell surface and zzso signal zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso cells are always zzso positive during cell growth, we suppose that at least another zzso along with zzso may be involved in setting up a cell surface complex able to receive and zzso the signal triggered by zzso In our experimental system the protein that offers a third binding site to zzso may be represented by a 33 zzso protein bearing zzso zzso
