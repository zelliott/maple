zzso zzso 2 zzso plays a key role in the host defense against Gram zzso positive zzso bacteria and their cell wall envelope zzso However, little is known about the expression of zzso in the middle ear under zzso media zzso conditions, and its role in the persistent zzso media with zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the zzso cell wall zzso zzso zzso activated the expression of zzso in the middle ear zzso cells through the nuclear factor zzso B zzso signaling zzso while I zzso B alpha zzso zzso a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso zzso the expression of zzso induced by zzso This study suggests that the existence of residual zzso may maintain a low profile of zzso production in the middle ear zzso and thus contribute to the zzso of zzso
