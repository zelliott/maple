zzso zzso are the ultimate target of pathways sensing zzso damage and zzso on the cell cycle zzso Here, we provide evidence that Aurora A zzso was inhibited upon generation of zzso breaks in zzso We demonstrate that zzso was not downstream of zzso and that zzso of zzso and zzso by DNA damage occurred zzso Using a cell line functionally deficient in zzso a selective zzso inhibitor and zzso to zzso we show that zzso signals were delivered to zzso through a zzso zzso With regard to the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we found that the point zzso zzso rendered zzso resistant to zzso by DNA zzso By means of two distinct approaches we examined the impact of zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso transient expression of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso led to bypass of the DNA damage zzso zzso direct zzso of highly active zzso into zzso arrested cells precisely after induction of DNA damage resulted in zzso zzso We show that the mechanism through which zzso allowed entry into zzso was zzso of zzso thus indicating that zzso plays a key role upstream of zzso A model depicting the possible role of zzso at the onset of zzso and upon DNA damage is zzso
