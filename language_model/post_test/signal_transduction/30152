The circulating level of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso is elevated in various zzso states including type 2 diabetes, zzso cancer, and zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso in the development of insulin resistance, we examined the effects of zzso treatment on zzso insulin action and zzso metabolism in zzso during zzso zzso in awake zzso zzso of zzso blunted zzso ability to suppress zzso zzso production and zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Acute zzso treatment also reduced zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, and this was associated with defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and increases in fatty zzso levels in skeletal zzso In contrast, we found that zzso of zzso a predominantly zzso zzso prevented zzso defects in zzso insulin action and signaling zzso Additionally, zzso zzso protected skeletal muscle from zzso and zzso defects in insulin action and signaling activity, and these effects were associated with decreases in intramuscular fatty zzso zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso alter zzso and skeletal muscle insulin action in zzso and the mechanism may involve zzso zzso in zzso fat zzso These findings zzso an important role of inflammatory zzso in the zzso of insulin zzso
