zzso fractures show reduced callus formation and delayed bone zzso Cellular sources of fracture healing are zzso stem cells zzso that differentiate into zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso such as zzso We hypothesized that impaired signal zzso and reduced zzso differentiation capacity in response to zzso may zzso the delayed fracture zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso heads of healthy and zzso zzso zzso was carried out by bone mineral zzso in an zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso Signal zzso was assessed by western zzso of zzso and zzso as well as by quantitative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso differentiation was assessed by zzso zzso Red zzso zzso zzso featured an accurate zzso pattern of zzso but a significantly reduced zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso showed significantly reduced zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso expression showed adequate zzso due to zzso zzso The global zzso differentiation in standard zzso differentiation media was reduced in zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso were shown to feature an adequate induction of zzso differentiation due to zzso zzso Taken together, we here demonstrate osteoporosis associated zzso in zzso signaling but sustained specific zzso differentiation capacity in response to zzso zzso zzso may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of fractures in zzso zzso
