While studying blue zzso effects of zzso 1 zzso zzso we observed premature opening of the hook in zzso zzso grown in complete darkness, a zzso that resembles the one described for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso also showed reduced zzso of zzso under blue zzso These zzso zzso and zzso zzso required the presence of zzso in the growth media and were not additive in the zzso zzso double zzso suggesting zzso signaling convergence between zzso and zzso signaling zzso Both, zzso and zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso typically used for plant zzso zzso recognized a 54 zzso band in the wild type but not in zzso and zzso zzso We propose a model where zzso zzso modification of zzso alters its zzso zzso
