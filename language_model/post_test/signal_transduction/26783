The zzso group protein zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso originally found to prevent untimely differentiation of zzso embryonic stem zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso is also expressed in zzso neural stem cells zzso We showed that zzso expression is zzso during zzso differentiation into zzso or zzso However, high levels of zzso remained present in zzso zzso until zzso This study aimed to zzso the target genes of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

We performed zzso zzso followed by zzso sequencing to detect the target genes of zzso in zzso and zzso We found zzso target genes of zzso in zzso During zzso zzso the occupancy of these genes by zzso was zzso However, when the zzso differentiated into zzso zzso of these genes remained targets of zzso Analysis of the target genes indicated that the repressive activity of zzso in zzso concerns genes involved in stem cell zzso in cell cycle control and in preventing neural zzso Among the genes in zzso that were still zzso by zzso were most prominently those associated with zzso and zzso committed cell zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso caused loss of stem cell zzso blocked their proliferation and ultimately induced zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso due to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and ultimately in zzso 

Our data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso in zzso is crucial for zzso activity and maintenance of neural zzso During differentiation towards zzso zzso repression continues particularly to suppress other neural fate zzso zzso is completely zzso during differentiation towards zzso and zzso allowing zzso of these differentiation zzso The specific fate choice towards zzso or zzso is apparently controlled by zzso regulators other than zzso
