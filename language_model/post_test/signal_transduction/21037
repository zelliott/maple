The zzso zzso product zzso which is specifically expressed in zzso cells, contains multiple structural motifs commonly used by zzso signaling zzso Although a variety of stimuli including zzso zzso have been shown to zzso zzso zzso little is known about the zzso signal zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the role of zzso in the zzso signaling zzso by characterizing its interaction with other zzso using the human zzso cell line, zzso zzso and zzso analyses have demonstrated that zzso was associated with the zzso zzso zzso in an zzso manner and was zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso with the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as zzso and zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was shown to be zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso by an in zzso binding zzso and confirmed by the presence of in zzso zzso activity associated with zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso was associated with zzso in zzso and that zzso could be zzso by activated zzso in zzso These results suggest the possible role of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
