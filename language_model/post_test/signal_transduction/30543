Salt zzso Sensitive 1 zzso a plasma membrane zzso zzso in zzso is a salt tolerance zzso crucial for the maintenance of zzso zzso in saline stress zzso zzso zzso is unstable at normal growth conditions, but its stability is substantially increased under salt stress and other zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment increases the stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso is inherently unstable and rapidly zzso with a zzso of approximately 10 zzso Rapid zzso of zzso zzso requires new protein zzso zzso zzso zzso stability is zzso by zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso is also involved in the zzso of zzso zzso stability, presumably through the control of zzso zzso zzso The zzso required for zzso zzso instability resides in the zzso region within the zzso zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in the zzso gene render zzso zzso more tolerant to zzso a zzso zzso causing zzso stress, indicating that zzso plays negative roles in tolerance of zzso zzso A hypothetical model for the signaling zzso involving zzso pH changes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and downstream signaling zzso is proposed, and the biological significance of zzso induction of zzso zzso stability is zzso
