zzso and zzso signaling pathways are required for initial patterning of cell fates along zzso (AP) and zzso zzso zzso respectively, of sea zzso zzso during zzso and early zzso zzso These mechanisms are connected because expression of zzso depends on early zzso zzso Here, we show that an important subsequent function of zzso signaling is to control the shape of the zzso expression domain and maintain correct zzso of different cell types along the axes of the zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso region of the zzso is severely altered during early zzso zzso at this time, zzso and its downstream target genes zzso and zzso are expressed zzso extending zzso to the zzso They override the initial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso eliminating the zzso contribution to the gut and zzso the zzso band zzso zzso and occasionally beyond, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso is located at the border of the zzso zzso oral zzso and by zzso stages it is in the same plane near the zzso on the zzso zzso In normal zzso a zzso process zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells during early zzso focusing zzso signaling to the zzso region where it suppresses zzso zzso These subsequent interactions between zzso and zzso signaling are thus mutually zzso each limiting the range of the other's activity, in order to maintain and stabilize the body plan initially established by those same signaling pathways in the early zzso
