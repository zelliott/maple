A new zzso zzso zzso with an appended zzso zzso has been zzso and shown to exhibit significant and zzso usefulness for zzso sensing toward zzso zzso The molecular recognition was based on the bridging interaction of the zzso ring of zzso with the zzso center of the zzso while the zzso signal for the recognition process was the zzso zzso zzso The sensor was constructed and applied for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso solution by zzso the sensing material in a zzso zzso zzso When the membrane was bathed in an alkaline solution void of zzso zzso zzso was present in the zzso form, and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso With the presence of zzso in the sample solution, zzso was extracted into the membrane phase and bridged with the zzso center of the zzso causing the zzso zzso to be converted to its zzso zzso Since the formation of zzso zzso was accompanied by the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso the chemical recognition process could be directly translated into a fluorescent zzso With the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso in sample solution from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso M can be zzso The limit of detection was zzso zzso zzso zzso The optical selectivity zzso obtained for zzso over biologically relevant zzso acids and zzso met the selectivity requirements for the determination of zzso in biological zzso zzso zzso values obtained by the zzso membrane fell in the normal range of the content reported in the literature and were in good agreement with those obtained by zzso
