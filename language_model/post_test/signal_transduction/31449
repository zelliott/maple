The cell division axis determines the position of daughter cells and is therefore critical for cell zzso During zzso zzso most cell divisions take place within the plane of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Harris, zzso zzso In zzso zzso imaging of cell divisions during zzso in the developing zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation and mode of cell division in the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S A 100, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution of the zzso plasma membrane during zzso divisions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, zzso The cellular constraints responsible for this preferential orientation are poorly zzso Combining zzso and zzso zzso imaging of chick neural zzso the events responsible for positioning the zzso zzso and their dependence on zzso were zzso The results indicate that the zzso forms with a random zzso However, the final orientation of cell divisions is dependent on two main factors: zzso an early rotation of the zzso that zzso it within the plane of the zzso and zzso a specific limitation of zzso zzso despite free rotation around the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso leads to zzso cell divisions after a correct initial rotation of the zzso Our data reveal a specific role for zzso in the maintenance of zzso orientation, prior to zzso Thus, zzso could be a key player potentially regulated by the zzso program or by the neural stem cell environment to control the balance between zzso and zzso zzso during normal or pathological zzso
