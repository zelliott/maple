The protection of the zzso from the maternal adverse environment during early pregnancy is considered to be achieved by the establishment of a zzso zzso barrier created by zzso cells immediately surrounding the zzso zzso Normally, the polarized zzso acts as a barrier by regulating zzso passage of substances through tight zzso The expression of tight junction proteins in the zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso is consistent with this zzso However, limited information is available regarding the nature and regulation of the zzso barrier that is created by zzso zzso cells during zzso We show here that the tight junction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are all expressed and physically associated in zzso zzso cells of the primary zzso zone forming a barrier surrounding the zzso with the loss of adjacent zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to be the stimulus for the creation of this barrier, since isolated inner cell mass or artificial stimuli failed to induce such a zzso Furthermore, the primary zzso zone induced by the normal zzso is zzso to zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso expression of tight junctions forms a temporary barrier in cells of the primary zzso zone that restricts the passage of zzso stimuli such as maternal zzso to the zzso
