zzso zzso also called zzso is a zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso may participate in the regulation of cardiovascular function and fluid and zzso zzso To evaluate the role of zzso on zzso zzso function, zzso paced zzso zzso zzso were acutely exposed to zzso and the following indexes were zzso peak zzso zzso time to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso fluorescent zzso Our results revealed that zzso (10 zzso to 10 zzso significantly increased zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the zzso effect of which zzso zzso was somewhat comparable to those zzso by zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso significantly shortened zzso zzso without affecting time to zzso similar to zzso and zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso release, with a zzso increase of approximately zzso and facilitated the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects were abolished by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso (1 zzso zzso of protein zzso C using zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso (1 zzso Our data suggest that zzso acutely zzso zzso zzso function through, at least in part, a protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso
