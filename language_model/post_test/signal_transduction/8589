Current therapies for the zzso zzso disease multiple sclerosis zzso target zzso but do not directly address zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family regulate survival and differentiation of both neural and immune cells, and we recently identified expression of the family member zzso in active zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso regulates the clinical course and zzso of experimental zzso zzso a zzso model that mimics many of the clinical and zzso features of zzso zzso the effects of zzso are achieved via a combination of zzso and direct zzso zzso zzso mice displayed a significant increase in clinical severity and zzso of experimental zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso loss were all exacerbated in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso displayed milder clinical signs and zzso than zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in T zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was generated via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and was associated with a decrease in the size of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso strongly reduced zzso and zzso zzso in primary cultures of mouse zzso zzso zzso these data reveal that zzso regulates inflammatory zzso via a unique combination of zzso and zzso zzso signaling may represent a therapeutic avenue to restrict zzso inflammation and zzso zzso survival in zzso zzso zzso
