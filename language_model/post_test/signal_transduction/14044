zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to zzso zzso zzso family whose function remains zzso In our previous studies, zzso was found to be a novel potent zzso of zzso transition zzso in zzso zzso which has been classified as type 2 zzso However, whether zzso could induce type 3 zzso in zzso needs further zzso In this study, we showed that zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso of this protein promoted migration and invasion via zzso zzso of zzso attenuated migration and invasion of zzso and zzso cells in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso are positively regulated by zzso Taken together, we provide evidence for a zzso and invasion axis in zzso cells and it provides novel insights into the mechanism of migration and invasion of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso
