The zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is a cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this gene occur in nearly zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso These zzso in part, result in zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso effectively inhibited the proliferation of acute zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The zzso that inhibited 50% growth were approximately zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as measured by zzso zzso on day 2 of zzso zzso zzso zzso the levels of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cells as measured by Western zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso was combined with zzso a zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso of both zzso and zzso cells were zzso enhanced in association with further zzso of zzso and zzso in these zzso Taken together, zzso blockade of zzso and zzso signaling represents a promising treatment strategy for individuals with leukemia who possess zzso zzso of zzso
