The enteric nervous system zzso is entirely derived from neural crest and its normal development is regulated by specific molecular zzso Failure in complete zzso formation results in zzso gut conditions such as zzso disease zzso Recently, zzso expression has been demonstrated in mouse enteric neural crest derived cells and zzso was shown to work zzso with zzso in the development of the zzso 

In the present report, zzso zzso were isolated and characterized from the zzso gut from children diagnosed with and without zzso and the expression of zzso receptors was zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells demonstrated that both zzso and zzso were present in human enteric neural crest zzso In addition, we also performed a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in a cohort of zzso patients, evaluating them for the first time as zzso genes for the zzso Several zzso zzso were zzso most of them affecting highly zzso zzso acid zzso of the protein and located in functional zzso of both zzso which suggests a possible deleterious effect in their biological zzso 

Our results suggest that not only zzso but also zzso might mediate a complementary zzso to the zzso zzso supporting zzso and differentiation of precursor cells during zzso zzso These findings, together with the detection of sequence zzso in zzso zzso and zzso genes associated to zzso and, in some cases in combination with zzso or zzso zzso provide the first evidence to consider them as zzso genes for zzso
