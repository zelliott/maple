zzso hormone zzso is a zzso that zzso its signals via a G zzso zzso As yet, not many targets of zzso have been identified, able to justify the critical role of this hormone on zzso zzso On the other hand, among the biological activities of the zzso zzso zzso growing interest has been attracted by the regulation of zzso zzso Recently, we have shown that treatment of mouse primary zzso cells with zzso enhances the activity of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso whereas it does not affect the zzso that zzso zzso nor the level of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which, respectively, zzso and degrade the other major zzso zzso were not regulated by zzso Interestingly, zzso stimulation by zzso occurred through protein zzso A and zzso pathways that were able to zzso zzso activity (via zzso of accessory zzso and zzso gene expression (via an zzso response element on the promoter zzso Taken together, these data identify zzso as the only target of zzso among the elements of the zzso system, with a critical impact on zzso cell zzso and thus zzso and male zzso
