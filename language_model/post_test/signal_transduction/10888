G zzso receptors zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to mediate important cellular responses such as zzso differentiation and zzso Recent advances in the field suggest that zzso zzso of zzso might be important for diseases such as cancer and cardiac zzso Depending on the zzso and cell type, zzso signaling involves zzso of several different zzso By zzso different zzso of zzso zzso can fine-tune their effects on target zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling pathways also initiated by zzso may modify the biological read out of the zzso zzso This review focuses on the mechanisms how zzso and zzso zzso elicit zzso of different zzso and the resulting different biological zzso
