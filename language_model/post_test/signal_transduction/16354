zzso zzso viruses are sensed by receptors zzso zzso gene zzso which trigger formation of the zzso zzso signaling zzso complex on zzso zzso this leads to the zzso of zzso factor family zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso of zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso It remains to be zzso how zzso activates zzso In this study, we report that zzso protein with zzso repeats 3 zzso is significantly induced upon zzso virus zzso zzso expression or zzso of zzso could, respectively, enhance or impair zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso repeat motif zzso of zzso interacts with the N zzso zzso of zzso thus bridging zzso to zzso on the zzso zzso of this interaction markedly zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, host zzso responses are significantly zzso or crippled in the presence or absence of zzso zzso our study characterizes zzso as an important zzso in innate zzso revealing a new function of the zzso family proteins zzso protein with zzso zzso
