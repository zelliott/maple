Upon pathogen infection, plants undergo dramatic zzso zzso to shift from normal growth and development to immune zzso During this rapid process, the zzso zzso complex has been recognized as an important player to fine-tune zzso and zzso zzso zzso by acting as an zzso between zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso II zzso Here, we review current understanding of the role of five functionally characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in plant zzso All these zzso zzso positively regulate resistance against zzso zzso bacteria or zzso zzso While zzso appears to regulate defense against zzso pathogens via relaying signals from upstream regulators and zzso modification to zzso the other four zzso zzso locate at different positions of the defense network to convey zzso zzso zzso understanding the role of zzso in plant immunity needs to characterize more zzso zzso in both zzso and other plant zzso Identification of interacting proteins of zzso zzso will further help to reveal their specific regulatory mechanisms in plant zzso
