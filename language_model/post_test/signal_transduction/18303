zzso zzso are used to treat a variety of cardiovascular disorders; however, the signal zzso pathways and zzso mechanisms zzso by these agents are not fully zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso agents enhance the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel in single zzso from coronary arteries by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso data revealed that 10 zzso zzso zzso or zzso opens zzso channels in coronary zzso and that this effect is attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A, zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso also opened zzso channels in these zzso and this effect was reversed by zzso zzso zzso measurement confirmed that zzso or zzso stimulates zzso activity in coronary arteries but does not elevate zzso Finally, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso channels was zzso in a zzso zzso patch by addition of zzso zzso activated by either zzso or zzso In contrast, channel gating was unaffected by exposure to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso In zzso findings from zzso and zzso zzso experiments provide direct evidence that zzso zzso open zzso channels in coronary zzso by zzso of zzso (but not via zzso zzso zzso confirmed this zzso mechanism of zzso action in these zzso This signaling zzso is a novel mechanism for regulation of zzso channel activity in vascular smooth muscle and other zzso
