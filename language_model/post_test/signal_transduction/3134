Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial zzso in the descending zzso zzso tract zzso in the developing spinal cord, one of the most important nerve pathways for pain, sensory and motor zzso We provide evidence that zzso floor zzso Sonic zzso zzso is responsible for the establishment of decreasing zzso in both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso directions in the zzso spinal zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso components of the zzso pathway, zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and enriched in the descending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso by zzso interactions and zzso of zzso Using a zzso zzso we showed that zzso graded zzso zzso by zzso signaling pushed the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso spinal zzso and zzso graded zzso zzso by zzso signaling simultaneously restricted the zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso errors of zzso zzso zzso were observed in various zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to push descending zzso zzso zzso in the zzso direction, and to restrict these zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso maintains spatial zzso zzso in the developing spinal zzso
