zzso flexible regulation of zzso light reactions in plant zzso is a prerequisite to provide sufficient energy flow to downstream metabolism and plant growth, to protect light reactions against zzso and to ensure controlled cellular signaling from the zzso to the zzso Such comprehensive regulation occurs via the control of zzso energy transfer to and between the two zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso across the zzso membrane zzso and of electron transfer from zzso to zzso electron zzso In this opinion article, we propose that these regulatory mechanisms, functioning at different levels of zzso energy conversion, might be interconnected and describe how the zzso and integrated function of these mechanisms might enable plants to zzso to a full array of environmental zzso
