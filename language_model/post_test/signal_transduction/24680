There is little question but that bacterial zzso zzso remain one of the most potent stimuli which can affect zzso zzso Although the precise zzso mechanisms responsible for this remain to be fully zzso there is now evidence accumulating from a number of laboratories that functional receptors for these bacterial products do exist and may contribute to the initial triggering zzso Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus as to which of the candidate receptors identified to date serves as the primary binding target for zzso and it is possible that the difference in zzso cell types, zzso zzso and detection systems will all influence the nature of the zzso At the present time, therefore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be considered as possible zzso zzso With the exception of the zzso protein identified by Hampton and his co-workers, there exists some experimental evidence for a functional role for each of the molecules so far zzso It is apparent that the molecular cloning and sequencing and subsequent zzso characterization of these zzso receptors will be required to determine unequivocally their role in zzso triggering zzso Such information will be invaluable in sorting out the relevant zzso second signals involved in zzso zzso Although much new information has recently been accumulated on potential signaling pathways for zzso the definitive events remain far from unequivocally zzso In view of the obvious importance of zzso interactions in the overall capacity of the zzso host to respond appropriately to the potentially hostile zzso environment, a precise zzso of zzso zzso zzso is critical to our understanding of this important inflammatory zzso zzso
