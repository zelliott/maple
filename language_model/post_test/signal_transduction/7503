The zzso zzso is a classic example of a rapidly zzso tissue fueled by dedicated resident stem zzso These stem cells reside at the zzso base, generating committed progeny that mature into the various functional zzso lineages while following a rapid migratory path toward the zzso Two models of zzso stem cell location were proposed half a century ago and data have been presented in support of both models, dividing the scientific zzso zzso markers have been identified and validated using new techniques such as in zzso lineage tracing and ex zzso zzso zzso The zzso stem cell niche comprises both zzso cells, in particular the zzso cell, and the zzso zzso where zzso zzso and soluble factors regulate stem cell zzso This review highlights the recent advances in identifying and characterizing the zzso stem cells and their defining zzso
