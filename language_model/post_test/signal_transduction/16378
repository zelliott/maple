zzso exhibit beneficial effects on human health, particularly in the maintenance of zzso zzso in a complex manner notwithstanding the diversity of an zzso zzso between zzso Thus, it is highly probable that some common molecules zzso by zzso and/or zzso bacteria contribute to the maintenance of zzso zzso and protect the zzso zzso from zzso zzso To address this question, we aimed to isolate the zzso compound from a zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso which possess the ability to induce zzso heat shock proteins in mouse small zzso zzso zzso was incubated in MRS broth and the zzso was passed through with a zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with the culture zzso and zzso expression was evaluated by Western zzso zzso components were separated by ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso gel zzso and zzso Finally, we identified that the zzso fraction was zzso zzso zzso a simple repeated structure of zzso which is a common product of zzso and other bacteria associated with zzso zzso without any definitive zzso zzso Then, zzso P was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso P significantly induced zzso from zzso zzso In addition, Poly P suppressed the zzso zzso zzso in the mouse small zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso and zzso counteract its protective zzso Daily zzso administration of zzso P (10 zzso improved the inflammation grade and survival rate in zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso This study, for the first time, demonstrated that zzso P is the zzso responsible for maintaining zzso barrier actions which are zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso
