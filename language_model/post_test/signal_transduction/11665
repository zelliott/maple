New approaches for treatment of invasive zzso infections are necessary to cope with emerging resistant zzso pathogens of zzso In this paper, three different strategies are presented and evaluated to find zzso zzso drugs and their zzso While experimental data obtained with potent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of zzso origin are encouraging more efforts are needed to verify and exploit the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to hinder the cell separation of zzso and the fragmentation of zzso zzso quite effectively and, zzso they may be implicated in future therapies of systemic zzso In addition, zzso zzso proteins possessing a broad zzso spectrum may also provide us with promising new agents for the treatment of different kinds of zzso zzso zzso zzso
