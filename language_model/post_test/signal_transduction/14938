In zzso the zzso of the zzso fluid is maintained near a predetermined zzso through a negative feedback regulation of zzso zzso salt appetite and zzso This zzso control is believed to be zzso by zzso zzso which zzso regulate the electrical activity of command zzso that mediate each of these zzso zzso zzso Our present understanding of the zzso cellular and network basis that zzso the central control of zzso is largely derived from studies on primary zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso which release hormones that regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso exhibit changes in action potential firing rate that vary in proportion with zzso zzso This effect results from the intrinsic zzso zzso potential which these cells generate via a molecular zzso complex that may comprise various members of the transient zzso potential zzso zzso family of zzso channel zzso notably zzso and zzso zzso evoked changes in the firing rate of zzso zzso then regulate the electrical activity of downstream zzso in the zzso through graded changes in zzso zzso
