zzso zzso primordial zzso are essential for maintenance of the zzso lifespan of female zzso Recently, it was found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso of primordial zzso by an zzso deletion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso negative regulator zzso results in premature zzso of the entire pool of primordial zzso indicating that zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso is important for control of zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso signaling in zzso of primary and further developed zzso also plays a role at later stages in zzso development and zzso we zzso deleted the zzso gene from zzso of primary and further developed zzso by using transgenic mice expressing zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso was efficiently deleted from zzso of primary and further developed zzso as indicated by the elevated zzso of the major zzso downstream component zzso However, zzso development was not altered and zzso maturation was also normal, which led to normal fertility with zzso litter size in the zzso zzso Our data indicate that properly controlled zzso signaling in zzso is essential for control of the development of primordial zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling in zzso does not appear to affect the development of growing zzso This suggests that there is a zzso function of zzso signaling in mouse zzso that controls zzso zzso
