The zzso locus is required for the formation of zzso zzso bodies and spores by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies have suggested that zzso zzso are defective in the production of an essential signal zzso used in zzso communication and that zzso is required for the expression of many zzso zzso Recently we have determined that the zzso locus encodes components of a zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso complex involved in zzso zzso acid metabolism in many bacteria and higher zzso During zzso growth in zzso zzso this zzso complex appears to participate in the production of the zzso fatty acids found in this zzso zzso zzso fatty acids (including the zzso fatty zzso have been observed to have a variety of effects on developing zzso These effects include: zzso the zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso acceleration of the rate of zzso and zzso rescue of zzso by certain zzso zzso These and other results suggest a model in which the zzso fatty zzso zzso during growth, are released from cellular zzso by a zzso regulated zzso during zzso zzso This model proposes that one or more of the zzso fatty acids that are released constitutes the zzso which must be transmitted between cells to complete zzso zzso zzso
