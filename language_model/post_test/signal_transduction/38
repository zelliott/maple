zzso zzso during the zzso period is the single most important cause of acute newborn mortality and chronic zzso Despite our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of zzso injury, an effective clinical therapy has yet to be established to mitigate brain damage and improve the prognosis and well-being of these newborn zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso is a well-known zzso factor, essential for the survival and functional maturation of immature zzso This study demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of IGF-1 at 24 and 48 hours of recovery significantly reduced zzso injury to immature rat brains and improved long-term memory and cognitive zzso zzso therapeutic effects likely involve its ability to prevent delayed zzso as we demonstrated in primary cortical zzso cultures under oxygen and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects parallel the activities of zzso and its zzso signaling pathway, suggesting a potential zzso zzso Overall, evidence from this investigation strongly supports zzso potential therapeutic use in the treatment of zzso zzso in newborn zzso
