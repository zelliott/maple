zzso zzso zzso a zzso has gained relevance to multiple sclerosis through the discovery of zzso zzso recently approved as an oral treatment for zzso forms of multiple zzso Its mechanism of action is thought to be zzso through an active zzso zzso zzso that resembles zzso and alters zzso trafficking through zzso zzso zzso However, previously reported expression and in zzso studies of zzso receptors suggested that direct zzso effects of zzso might theoretically occur through zzso zzso on zzso and zzso To identify zzso cells functionally contributing to zzso activity, genetic approaches were combined with cellular and molecular zzso These studies relied on the functional assessment, based on clinical score, of conditional zzso mouse zzso lacking zzso in zzso cell lineages and challenged by experimental zzso zzso zzso an animal model of multiple zzso All conditional zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso trafficking that responded normally to zzso In marked contrast, zzso was attenuated and zzso efficacy was lost in zzso zzso lacking zzso on zzso zzso but not on zzso In zzso zzso studies confirmed that zzso loss of zzso was the key zzso in functionally affected zzso zzso in zzso clinical scores were paralleled by reductions in zzso zzso loss, and zzso zzso rescue and pharmacological experiments supported the loss of zzso on zzso through functional antagonism by zzso as a primary zzso zzso These data identify zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso efficacy and zzso zzso signaling pathways within the zzso as targets for multiple sclerosis zzso
