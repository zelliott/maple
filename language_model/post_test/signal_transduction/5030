zzso expression and gap zzso zzso communication zzso zzso by zzso 43 zzso junction A1 zzso are required for zzso fusion into the zzso the outer functional layer of the human zzso zzso also impacts zzso signaling through zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso and its downstream target zzso are key players in zzso fusion and exert their actions through the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the molecular role of the zzso protein and its interaction with this zzso pathway, we zzso stable zzso cell lines established from the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso at its zzso would inhibit zzso fusion and protein interaction with either zzso or zzso In the zzso and zzso lines, stimulation with zzso caused 1) increase in zzso zzso levels, 2) increase in percentage of fused cells, and 3) zzso of zzso zzso Cell fusion was inhibited by zzso blockade using zzso Neither zzso which express low levels of zzso nor the zzso cell line demonstrated cell fusion or zzso of zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso treatment in both zzso and all zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso prevented the induction of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso is upstream of zzso All cell lines and zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gap junction plaques zzso in zzso to areas of fusing zzso as demonstrated by the loss of zzso zzso in the plasma membrane in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso interaction play important functional roles in zzso cell zzso
