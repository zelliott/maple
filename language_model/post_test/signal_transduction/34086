The regulation of zzso acid zzso zzso is essential for plant responses to drought zzso In this study, we examined the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and dehydrated zzso zzso zzso plants using specific zzso against zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso analysis revealed that in zzso plants, zzso and zzso proteins were localized in vascular zzso cells most abundantly at the boundary between zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso protein was zzso in these zzso In zzso plants, zzso was detected exclusively in the vascular zzso cells together with zzso and zzso In zzso zzso using the zzso probe for zzso showed that the zzso expression of zzso was also restricted to the vascular zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells revealed that, among nine zzso genes zzso the early induction of most genes was zzso restricted to vascular cells at 1 h and then some spread to zzso cells at 3 zzso The spatial constraint of zzso expression in vascular zzso provides a novel insight into plant systemic response to drought zzso
