Whether heart rate predicts the development of sustained hypertension in individuals with hypertension is not well zzso We carried out a prospective study to investigate whether clinic and ambulatory heart rates assessed at baseline and changes in clinic heart rate during 6 months of follow-up were independent zzso of subsequent blood pressure zzso 

The study was conducted in a cohort of zzso white, stage 1 zzso individuals from the zzso study, never treated for hypertension and zzso for an average of zzso zzso Data were adjusted for baseline zzso age, sex, body zzso physical activity habits, parental hypertension, duration of hypertension, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and change of body weight from zzso 

Clinic heart rate and heart rate changes during the first 6 months of follow-up were independent zzso of subsequent zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso regardless of initial zzso and other zzso (all P zzso zzso A significant interaction was found between sex zzso and baseline resting heart rate on final zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The ambulatory heart rate and the heart rate zzso effect did not add zzso information to that provided by the clinic heart zzso Patients whose heart rate was persistently elevated during the study had a doubled fully adjusted risk zzso confidence zzso zzso of developing sustained hypertension in comparison with subjects with a normal heart zzso 

zzso clinic heart rate and heart rate changes during the first few months of follow-up are independent zzso of the development of sustained hypertension in young persons screened for stage 1 zzso
