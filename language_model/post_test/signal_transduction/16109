A zzso zzso vaccine expressing the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to induce a mixed zzso zzso immune response in mice and to require zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso signaling for the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso cells zzso are critical in innate and zzso zzso the present study assessed the role of zzso expression by the zzso vaccine in DC zzso Bone zzso DC from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso or zzso zzso and the DC responses to different stimuli were compared by assessing zzso zzso zzso zzso production, and signaling zzso The DC response to both zzso and zzso was dependent mainly on zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and major zzso complex class II zzso zzso zzso Lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso were produced by zzso DC than by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso DC showed decreased zzso zzso compared to that induced by DC zzso with zzso However, zzso DC produced a higher level of zzso than zzso zzso The low zzso and high zzso zzso profile expressed by zzso DC may represent a shift toward a zzso response, as suggested by the increased expression in zzso These results provide novel evidence that a zzso protein expressed by a zzso zzso vaccine can zzso affect DC zzso
