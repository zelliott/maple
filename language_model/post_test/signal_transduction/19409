Evidence shows that administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production and inflammatory response resulting in neurodegenerative zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso compound, has been reported to possess zzso and zzso zzso Our previous studies have demonstrated that zzso could protect mouse brain against zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the protective effect of zzso against zzso inflammatory response in the prefrontal zzso and explored the potential mechanism of its zzso Our results showed that zzso administration significantly improved behavioral performance of zzso mice in zzso test and Morris water maze zzso One of the potential mechanisms of this action was decreased advanced zzso end products zzso zzso and protein zzso levels in the prefrontal zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the results also showed that zzso significantly reduced the number of activated zzso cells and zzso decreased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso levels in the prefrontal zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased zzso induced the expression of zzso for advanced zzso end products and inhibited zzso zzso nuclear zzso in the prefrontal zzso of zzso zzso The aforementioned effects of zzso could zzso brain inflammatory zzso
