A growing body of evidence indicates that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate gene expression in zzso zzso As zzso zzso and zzso are not DNA binding zzso regulation of gene expression is accomplished through zzso modification of their zzso These include zzso response regulators, DNA binding proteins and proteins that mediate zzso and zzso This review summarizes our current understanding of how zzso and zzso mediate gene expression in zzso Further studies to identify environmental signals that trigger the signaling cascade and zzso of mechanisms that regulate zzso between zzso signaling zzso zzso systems, and components of the zzso and zzso machinery will facilitate a greater understanding of zzso gene zzso
