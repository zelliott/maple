Cancer zzso is mainly caused by zzso zzso understanding the nature of the genes involved in this process has become a zzso Given the zzso of zzso in cancer cells, considerable focus has been directed toward characterizing zzso genes in the context of relevant signaling pathways rather than treating genes as independent and equal zzso One signaling cascade implicated in the regulation of cell growth, invasion and zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions as an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso and is a zzso zzso in different cancer zzso By utilizing statistical analysis of clinical data integrated with experimental zzso we recently identified components of the zzso signaling zzso relevant to breast cancer zzso Using the zzso zzso as an example, we show how prior biological knowledge can be efficiently combined with zzso patient data to identify gene regulatory mechanisms that control zzso
