zzso zzso cells in the zzso adopt many zzso features of zzso zzso These zzso changes typically are not observed in zzso However, zzso cells do not fully zzso a zzso cell zzso because they lack expression of mature zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined by zzso for expression of zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These three proteins define the earliest stages of zzso cell development but are not expressed in zzso zzso cells or normal zzso zzso was expressed in 25 of 25 zzso and zzso and zzso in 23 of 25 zzso zzso predominantly in type C zzso cells and zzso zzso Most zzso of the zzso expressed all three zzso In primary invasive and zzso melanoma, expression of each of the three proteins was limited to zzso of zzso but was not observed in any melanoma in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso expressed all three proteins zzso P zzso zzso These data confirm and extend earlier studies by showing that terminal differentiation of zzso in the zzso zzso some aspects observed in the earliest stages of zzso cell development and that invasive zzso follow a divergent zzso zzso these early differentiation events may help to identify specific defects in the relevant signaling pathways and establish zzso targets for therapy of zzso zzso
