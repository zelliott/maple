zzso signaling is highly coordinated in excitable zzso such as heart, but the organization of zzso signaling in zzso is less zzso We examined zzso signaling in zzso cells expressing the zzso gap junction protein zzso zzso or the cardiac gap junction protein zzso plus a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in wild type cells increased zzso in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the zzso signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were zzso zzso of zzso zzso rather than zzso resulted in a small increase in zzso that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap zzso However, zzso of zzso in cells zzso with low zzso of zzso resulted in a much larger increase in zzso which spread to neighbors via gap zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso similarly had increased sensitivity to zzso and could signal to neighbors via gap zzso Higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso signals in all zzso In zzso or zzso but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso signals in zzso are organized by three factors: 1) zzso must be generated in each cell to support a zzso signal in that zzso 2) gap junctions are necessary to zzso zzso signals among zzso and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone zzso will initiate zzso signals and thus serve as zzso for their zzso Together, these factors may allow zzso to act in an zzso zzso fashion rather than as a collection of isolated zzso
