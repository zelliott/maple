zzso coupled receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are important key switches in signal zzso zzso A novel class of proteins was identified in the zzso of two unrelated organisms that harbor both a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso contains one zzso which is crucial in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso each zzso twelve zzso zzso these are currently the only species that have these two zzso combined in one zzso Here, the structural and regulatory characteristics of zzso are presented and zzso It is hypothesized that, upon zzso zzso are able to trigger zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso
