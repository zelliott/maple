The zzso zzso zzso is known to play a role in B cell zzso As the engagement of the B cell zzso zzso is known to lead to B cell proliferation and zzso we studied zzso alpha expression in human B cells after zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso alpha zzso and zzso in human zzso B zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso and surface expression by zzso zzso is inhibited by the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused negligible zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and surface zzso No zzso is observed with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso by using zzso zzso fragments strongly zzso zzso zzso alpha expression in human B cells, confirming the role of zzso zzso in zzso induction of zzso alpha zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid and zzso induce zzso alpha zzso zzso In contrast, zzso A, an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso alpha zzso These results suggest that induction of zzso alpha expression in B cells following engagement of zzso involves zzso of protein zzso zzso
