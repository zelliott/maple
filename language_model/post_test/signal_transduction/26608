The zzso zzso acid zzso affects a wide range of stages of plant development as well as the plant's response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in commercial crops holds promising potential for improving crop zzso Several decades of research have been invested in attempts to identify the first components of the zzso signaling zzso It was only in 2009, that two independent groups identified the zzso protein family as the plant zzso zzso This finding was followed by a surge of studies on zzso signal zzso many of them using zzso as their zzso The zzso signaling cascade was found to consist of a zzso regulatory mechanism assembled from three protein zzso These include the zzso zzso the zzso family of zzso and the zzso family, zzso It was found that zzso zzso inhibit zzso activity, and that zzso zzso zzso Researchers today are examining how the zzso of the zzso signaling cascade in zzso can be applied to improvements in commercial zzso In this article, we have attempted to review recent studies which address this zzso In it, we discuss various approaches useful in identifying the genetic and protein components zzso Finally, we suggest possible commercial applications of genetic manipulation of zzso signaling to improve crop zzso
