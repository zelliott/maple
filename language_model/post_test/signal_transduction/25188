A large number of zzso processes in the adult liver are regulated by nuclear receptors that require zzso with zzso X receptors zzso In this study, we have used zzso zzso to disrupt the mouse zzso gene specifically in zzso Although such mice are viable, molecular and zzso parameters indicate that every one of the examined zzso pathways in the liver zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is compromised in the absence of zzso These data demonstrate the presence of a complex zzso in which zzso is integrated into a number of diverse zzso pathways as a common regulatory component of cholesterol, fatty acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso metabolism and zzso
