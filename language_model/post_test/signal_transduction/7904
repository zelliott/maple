The zzso of an zzso zzso is composed of zzso and skein cells that are both zzso active and zzso through zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of an adult frog, with typical zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, is zzso identical to the zzso zzso Two important issues have not yet been addressed in the study of the development of zzso zzso One is the origin of adult zzso cells in the zzso zzso and the other is the mechanism by which zzso zzso cells are transformed into adult zzso cells in a zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso The cell lineage relationship between the zzso and adult zzso cells was determined by examining the expression profiles of several genes that are expressed specifically in zzso and/or adult zzso cells and differentiation profiles of zzso zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso hormone zzso zzso analyses using several markers led to the identification of the skin transformation center zzso where the conversion of zzso skin to the adult counterpart is taking zzso The zzso emerges at a specific place in the body skin and at a specific stage of zzso zzso The zzso progressively zzso into and zzso the adjacent zzso region of the trunk skin as a zzso develops, converting the zzso skin into the zzso skin, but never into the tail zzso The zzso to zzso skin conversion requires an zzso zzso The genesis of zzso zzso cells is suppressed in the tail zzso due to the influence of underlying zzso in the tail zzso zzso signaling is one of the molecular cues of zzso zzso In addition, a unique feature of zzso skin metamorphosis is presented referring to the skin of other zzso zzso comparisons of the skin among zzso species strongly suggested a similarity between the zzso zzso skin and the zzso fish adult skin and between the zzso adult skin and the adult skin of other zzso zzso Based on these similarities, the zzso significance of zzso skin metamorphosis is zzso Finally, studies are reviewed that reveal the molecular mechanism of zzso metamorphosis in relation to zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest new aspects of the biological significance of zzso and also enable us to envision concerted regulations of the expression of a gene in the frame of the gene network responsible for zzso zzso of zzso zzso The present review will contribute to an understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso skin development of zzso from not only a zzso but also from an zzso point of view, and will provide a new way to understand the biological significance of zzso in zzso
