zzso influence cancer cell replication and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found in the prostate zzso and they are proposed to exert a role in tumor regulation, influencing cancer cell growth, as zzso zzso inhibit cell growth in several systems, including the human prostate cancer cell line zzso In the same cell line, the existence of membrane testosterone receptors was recently reported, which increase, in a zzso manner, the zzso of zzso and modify zzso zzso zzso through the signaling cascade zzso zzso In the present work, we present data supporting that the general zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso (a zzso testosterone zzso induced zzso zzso Furthermore, we report that this zzso affects this zzso testosterone action, by zzso the distribution of the zzso zzso in the cells, zzso the above signaling zzso In addition, after long zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease the number of membrane testosterone zzso and reverse their effect on the signaling zzso In conclusion, our results provide some new insights of a possible action of zzso in prostate cancer control by interfering with the action and the expression of membrane testosterone receptors and zzso
