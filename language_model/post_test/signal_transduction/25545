zzso Mediterranean fever zzso inflammatory attacks are often triggered by zzso or physical zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso cellular responses to zzso danger zzso In this study, we investigated the implication of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso gene expression in zzso cells zzso from healthy individuals, whereas it had no effect on zzso from zzso zzso zzso A significant reduction in zzso levels in zzso from zzso patients after zzso zzso was also zzso zzso levels in control zzso remained zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso status in zzso from zzso patients was reduced, as indicated by the lower zzso ratio and zzso zzso expression zzso However, zzso zzso had similar effects on the induction of zzso in the two zzso The differential zzso expression after zzso stress induction and the impaired zzso zzso suggest a potential role in the triggering of zzso zzso
