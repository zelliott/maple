The plasticity of the central nervous system helps form the basis for the zzso of learning and zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main form of synaptic zzso reflecting the activity level of the synaptic information storage process, and provides a good model to study the underlying mechanisms of learning and zzso The zzso zzso signal zzso plays a key role in the induction and maintenance of zzso and hence the regulation of learning and zzso The progress in the understanding of the zzso receptors and related signal zzso systems in learning and memory research are reviewed in this zzso
