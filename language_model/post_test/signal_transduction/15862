zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso protein and a zzso regulatory zzso required for the stabilization and zzso of zzso zzso The biological significance of zzso was investigated in zzso rod zzso by deleting its regulatory zzso protein and examining its role in zzso structure, function, and protein zzso 

Mice that expressed zzso zzso in rods were bred to mice with a zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso of zzso to generate a conditional deletion of zzso in zzso zzso and structural changes were determined by zzso and zzso analysis, zzso zzso activity was measured in retinal zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso analysis with a zzso zzso 

zzso stress increased zzso activity in retinal zzso and zzso of zzso There was no effect of zzso deletion on retinal zzso However, twin flash zzso revealed a slight delay in recovery zzso in zzso knockout zzso mice compared with zzso zzso The movement of zzso in the zzso zzso mice was slower than that in the zzso mouse zzso at 5 minutes of exposure to zzso At 10 minutes of exposure, the zzso zzso of zzso was almost identical between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The results provide the first direct evidence that rods use zzso zzso for zzso zzso The lack of zzso in zzso zzso rod zzso suggests a redundant role in controlling zzso zzso
