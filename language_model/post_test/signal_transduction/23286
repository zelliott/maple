Although zzso plays a wide-ranging role in controlling cell fate, zzso and development, its zzso roles in clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso are still zzso In the present study, the expression pattern of zzso was examined in zzso zzso and the interaction of zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso 

zzso paired zzso and adjacent zzso zzso samples were analyzed by Western zzso and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of split 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in zzso cell line zzso and the human normal kidney zzso zzso cell line zzso were analyzed by Western zzso and zzso before and after zzso with zzso against zzso or the zzso containing the zzso clone of zzso The effects of zzso signaling zzso on cells zzso zzso invasion, and migration were detected by zzso zzso flow zzso zzso and zzso chamber zzso zzso 

The zzso expression levels were significantly increased in zzso zzso compared with the adjacent zzso zzso samples, while it had no significant association with the zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade was zzso active in human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso signaling resulted in the zzso of zzso invasion, and migration, as well as zzso zzso with decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso had an opposite effect to zzso zzso 

Our findings indicated that zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso and that zzso could regulate zzso expression and the activity of the zzso zzso via zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso These might provide a basis for the designing new therapeutic strategies for zzso
