The zzso of the zzso neural tube into five distinct zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso action of the zzso protein Sonic zzso zzso The prevailing model stipulates that Class I genes are zzso and Class II genes are activated by high levels of zzso signaling and that sharp zzso domain boundaries are established by the mutual repression of complementary pairs of Class I and Class II zzso zzso While core elements of this model are supported by experimental evidence, a number of issues remain zzso Foremost of these is a more thorough understanding of the mechanism by which Class I genes are zzso In this study, we describe the consequences of zzso zzso on Class I and Class II gene expression in the zzso of zzso zzso We observed that an zzso source of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the adjacent zzso by zzso rather than zzso the expression of several Class I genes zzso zzso zzso The zzso dependent zzso of Class I genes was zzso in part, by zzso These results bear significance on the model of zzso neural tube patterning as they suggest a dual role for zzso in the regulation of Class I zzso zzso low levels of zzso signaling initiate Class I gene transcription, while higher levels restrict the zzso of Class I gene expression to intermediate positions of the neural tube through the zzso of Class II zzso zzso
