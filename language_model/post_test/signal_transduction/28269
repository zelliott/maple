zzso human zzso stop dividing after a limited number of cell divisions termed cellular zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be the main factor that causes cellular zzso however, the molecular mechanism of how zzso zzso causes cellular zzso is zzso Here we analyze the relationship between gene expressions and their zzso locations during cellular zzso It appears that the expression of genes located in zzso 4 is zzso altered after zzso Moreover, we identify four zzso zzso in which gene expressions are affected by zzso Finally, we show that there is no preferential zzso of zzso genes during cellular zzso zzso that cellular zzso is not caused by zzso of zzso zzso
