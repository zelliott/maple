zzso plays a role in zzso cancer, however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains to be determined, while signaling pathways provide valuable information for understanding the underlying mechanism of the zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the roles of zzso and signaling pathways in the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, zzso data zzso were downloaded from the Gene zzso zzso database and zzso expressed genes zzso in zzso cancer were identified by zzso Analysis of zzso Gene zzso zzso analysis was performed on the top 500 zzso and 500 zzso genes using zzso The signaling pathways were predicted by the signaling zzso impact analysis zzso with zzso and zzso factors were identified by zzso The zzso zzso interaction network zzso was established by STRING and zzso In total, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified and 41 zzso zzso including zzso and zzso were enriched in cell zzso In addition, 21 zzso such as the cell cycle, zzso signaling zzso and zzso signaling pathway, were zzso zzso and zzso were found to be activated while zzso was suppressed in zzso zzso Eight zzso and 10 zzso genes were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the present study shed new light on the molecular mechanism of zzso cancer and these findings have the potential to be used in zzso cancer zzso
