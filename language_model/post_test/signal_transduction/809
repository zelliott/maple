zzso growth factor I zzso is currently in clinical trials for treatment of zzso lateral sclerosis zzso but little is known about how it promotes the survival of motor zzso In the current study, we examined zzso zzso in an in zzso model of ALS utilizing enriched cultures of embryonic rat spinal zzso motor zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso in motor zzso and activates zzso and the downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling involves zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso which is elevated in the zzso fluid of ALS patients, induced DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso in the spinal zzso motor zzso These effects of zzso were blocked by zzso with zzso However, a delay of zzso treatment for as little as 30 zzso eliminated its zzso zzso Finally, alone, neither the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso nor the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso effect of zzso but both zzso together were effective in this zzso These results suggest that the dose and timing of zzso administration are critical for producing a zzso effect, and also suggest that both the zzso and zzso pathways can promote the survival of motor zzso We discuss our results in terms of novel strategies for ALS zzso
