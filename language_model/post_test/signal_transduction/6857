The human zzso proteins are a family of zzso proteins sharing a zzso zzso zzso The family has four zzso zzso repeat zzso 1 zzso zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso amplified sequences with zzso tandem repeats 1 zzso Previous studies of zzso and zzso have shown that the zzso zzso of complex zzso domain can bind and zzso zzso but the cellular consequences of this activity are still zzso Here, the first zzso characterization of zzso and the impact of zzso binding on zzso complex formation are zzso The results demonstrate that zzso similar to other zzso zzso can bind zzso zzso via its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exists in two distinct cellular complexes associated with heat shock protein 60, and the formation of a low molecular weight pool of zzso is modulated by zzso zzso Finally, loss of zzso enhances zzso toxicity in zzso Taken together, these data point to a central role for the zzso domain of zzso in the regulation of its cellular zzso
