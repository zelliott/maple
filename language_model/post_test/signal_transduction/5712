zzso is a zzso that promotes survival and/or differentiation in many cell types, including rat pancreatic zzso In this work, we studied the mechanism of zzso signal in zzso rats pancreatic zzso isolated by the zzso method and cultured for 3 days in zzso medium without zzso or with 1 zzso of zzso The medium zzso when necessary, specific zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and Western zzso as well as zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso were zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and nuclear zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and protein zzso In addition, zzso lowered zzso and impaired zzso These effects were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso nor by the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso signals through the zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso and protects zzso pancreatic rat zzso from zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may be a potential therapeutic tool against Type 1 and/or Type 2 zzso
