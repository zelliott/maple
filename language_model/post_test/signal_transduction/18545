The zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso has been found to be altered in a variety of human zzso A number of agents targeting these zzso including specific zzso directed against the zzso domain of the zzso and small molecules that inhibit zzso activity are either in clinical trials or are already approved for clinical zzso However, identifying patients that are likely to respond to such treatments has been zzso As a consequence, it still remains important to identify additional zzso of the tumor cell that contribute to the response to zzso zzso While zzso zzso pathways have been well established, there is still a rather limited understanding of how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent degradation of zzso contribute to the determination of sensitivity to zzso targeting agents and are emerging areas of zzso This review primarily focuses on the basic signal zzso pathways zzso through activated membrane bound and/or zzso zzso and emphasizes the need to zzso additional proteins that function either upstream or downstream of zzso to improve cancer zzso
