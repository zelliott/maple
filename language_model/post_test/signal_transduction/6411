zzso activity is highly zzso abundant in rapidly dividing cells and zzso zzso but zzso in most other differentiated zzso Little is known about mechanisms that regulate zzso Here, we used a zzso zzso to screen zzso lines of zzso zzso for zzso that zzso express this zzso in their zzso In one such zzso a previously zzso zzso protein we designate zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso in fully differentiated leaves without stimulating progression through the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso blocks the ability of zzso to induce zzso This result, along with other zzso of the zzso such as the ability of cells to grow in culture without zzso zzso and increased sensitivity of primary root growth to zzso zzso indicates that zzso not only is part of the previously reported link between zzso and zzso expression but also zzso other classic responses to this zzso
