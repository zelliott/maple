zzso growth factors zzso regulate long bone development by affecting the proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso treatment zzso the proliferation of zzso both in zzso and in zzso but the signaling pathways involved have not been clearly zzso In this report we show that both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso C gamma or zzso zzso play a role in zzso growth arrest of zzso Chemical zzso of the zzso or the zzso zzso pathways applied to rat zzso zzso zzso significantly prevented zzso growth zzso The zzso family members zzso and zzso were previously shown to be essential zzso of zzso growth arrest in zzso The zzso of zzso one of the earliest events in zzso growth arrest, was significantly blocked by zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso whereas that of zzso which occurs later, was partially prevented both by the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, by expressing the nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells we show that zzso treatment of the zzso cells caused growth zzso whereas zzso did zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso is accompanied by a strong and sustained zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and a decrease of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso a much more transient zzso of zzso and zzso and increases zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso proliferation by zzso requires both zzso and zzso zzso signaling and also suggest that sustained zzso of these pathways is required to achieve growth zzso
