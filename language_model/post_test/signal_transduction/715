zzso represents the most frequent zzso liver tumor in zzso The zzso zzso zzso is crucial in downstream signaling of multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso importance in zzso Increased zzso signaling zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso have been reported in different childhood zzso The current study was done to analyze the role of zzso signaling in zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso its targets zzso and zzso as well as the cell cycle regulators zzso zzso zzso and zzso were done and the zzso gene was screened for zzso In zzso two zzso cell lines treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso were analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Additionally, simultaneous treatments of zzso with zzso and zzso drugs were carried zzso 

Most tumors strongly expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso carried an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso cell growth being accompanied by reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso leads to a substantial increase in zzso and a decrease in cellular proliferation linked to reduced zzso D1 and increased zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso and zzso drugs resulted in positive zzso 

Our findings imply that zzso signaling plays an essential role in growth control of zzso and might be successfully targeted in zzso therapeutic zzso
