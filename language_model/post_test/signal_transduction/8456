The primary function of zzso binding to its zzso zzso is to mediate fusion and viral zzso However, it has been known that this interaction also triggers a variety of signaling zzso It is likely that the zzso signaling events may facilitate viral infection in various settings where the cellular conditions need to be zzso This has been exemplified recently in our findings that zzso employs zzso interaction to activate a cellular zzso zzso factor, zzso to support viral zzso infection of resting zzso T zzso zzso of zzso promotes the cortical zzso dynamics that are critical for viral zzso migration across the zzso cortical zzso barrier in resting T zzso
