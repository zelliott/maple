zzso zzso zzso in rats induce zzso and zzso associated with a rapid growth of white zzso tissue resulting in massive zzso It has been shown previously that at an early stage after the zzso during the dynamic phase of zzso the white zzso tissue is zzso to zzso In the present work, we show that the effects of insulin on the zzso of the insulin zzso and on its zzso activity towards zzso zzso are similar in intact zzso of control and zzso zzso zzso zzso One week after the zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso evaluated by zzso was similar in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, an important increase in the expression of zzso signal regulated zzso 1 protein was observed in white zzso tissue of zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso No difference in the expression of zzso signal regulated zzso 1 zzso was observed in zzso tissue of control and zzso zzso zzso rats, suggesting that a zzso mechanism is involved in the zzso of zzso signal regulated zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso signal regulated zzso 1 and 2 is also markedly increased in zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to control rats, both in the zzso state and after insulin zzso Six weeks after the zzso zzso zzso this increase in zzso protein zzso expression and activity was still observed in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that an early and sustained increase in the expression and activity of zzso protein zzso may participate in the development of white zzso tissue in zzso zzso zzso zzso
