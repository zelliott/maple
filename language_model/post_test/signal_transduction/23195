zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso contain 10 zzso zzso zzso gene segments enclosed in two concentric protein shells, called outer zzso and zzso These viruses serve as a versatile experimental system for studies of viral replication events at the zzso zzso including engagement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the innate immune response, including zzso cellular signaling zzso zzso also provide a model system for studies of zzso zzso and zzso disease in zzso attach to host cells via the zzso attachment zzso zzso The zzso protein of all zzso zzso engages zzso zzso zzso zzso an integral component of zzso tight zzso The zzso protein also binds to zzso zzso with the type of zzso bound varying by zzso Following attachment to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso most likely via zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is removed by zzso zzso zzso in most cell zzso zzso of zzso results in the exposure of a zzso zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso which pierces the zzso membrane and delivers zzso active zzso core particles into the zzso induce zzso in both cultured cells and infected zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso of zzso zzso or zzso activity abrogates zzso The zzso zzso gene is genetically linked to zzso differences in zzso capacity, suggesting a function for zzso in induction of death zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso factor zzso which zzso zzso signaling in numerous types of zzso zzso of zzso nuclear zzso using either zzso agents or expression of zzso forms of zzso blocks zzso zzso suggesting an essential role for zzso zzso in the death zzso Multiple zzso zzso s downstream of zzso gene expression execute zzso cell zzso This chapter will focus on the mechanisms by which zzso attachment and zzso activate zzso and stimulate the cellular zzso zzso
