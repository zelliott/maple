All known cell types use signal zzso systems to respond to an zzso or zzso zzso The role of these systems can be to adapt to environmental changes or simply to maintain zzso zzso detect and respond to stimuli in a number of zzso Here we review the mechanisms involved in the transmission of a signal from point of detection to site of zzso In particular, a comparison is made between the zzso networks which function in gene zzso in bacterial and zzso zzso zzso of the similarities between the systems found in the two types of cells can provide a better understanding of the function and origin of zzso zzso In addition, the divergence evident can be exploited by molecules that zzso or disrupt the function of differential zzso zzso
