zzso receptors zzso are key components of the innate immune system that detect microbial infection and trigger zzso host zzso To determine the role of zzso in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso challenged by zzso we used zzso specific for zzso to zzso zzso expression in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed by zzso reverse zzso zzso and western zzso zzso and we found that zzso zzso with zzso zzso exhibited a reduced level of zzso when compared with the control cells zzso with empty zzso Then the zzso and control cells were zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso and zzso were measured by real-time zzso We observed that stimulation of control cells with zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso being more zzso than zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso was severely impaired (with a decrease of approximately zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso while zzso production was partially inhibited (with a reduction of 60 and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggested that zzso is a major pattern recognition zzso able to detect zzso zzso in zzso and may play the zzso role through the induction of zzso This may lead to a better understanding of the zzso of cornea zzso infections and immune zzso
