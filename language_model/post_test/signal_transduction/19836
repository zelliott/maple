zzso is a critical structure for the acquisition of zzso zzso place preference zzso which is a usual learning paradigm for assessing drug zzso However, the precise mechanisms remain largely zzso zzso zzso zzso and its downstream targets, including zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical molecules implicated in learning and zzso Here, we tested the role of zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso Our results showed that the acquisition of zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso but not in the nucleus zzso zzso the zzso zzso area zzso or the zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso Likewise, levels of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly enhanced in the zzso following zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso proteins are positively correlated with the acquisition of zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso into the zzso prevented the acquisition of zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso a selective irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso significantly prevented the acquisition of zzso and impaired zzso zzso All these results strongly implied that the zzso signaling zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso plays an important role in acquisition of zzso zzso
