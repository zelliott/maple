zzso enhances many zzso functions, including zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso has been reported to increase the zzso concentration of calcium zzso and zzso protein zzso C activity in zzso zzso but the signal zzso pathways induced by zzso in human cells and their functional significance are poorly zzso Our study examined the hypothesis that an increases in zzso and protein zzso C zzso are required for functional responses to zzso The zzso cell line was used as a model of an zzso responsive zzso zzso caused a rapid and zzso increase in zzso which was partly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced a fourfold increase in the concentration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression by zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso that inhibited an increase in zzso but not by protein zzso C zzso by zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso zzso did not enhance zzso expression and zzso induced the expression of only the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso expression on human zzso cells by a mechanism dependent on, but not limited to, an increase in zzso zzso which is likely due to zzso zzso zzso
