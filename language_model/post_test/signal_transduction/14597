To reveal the biological and pathological roles of zzso zzso in zzso syndrome zzso we examined its effects on nerve growth factor zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, a sympathetic nerve cell zzso The zzso signaling is enhanced by zzso zzso zzso and this phenomenon is regarded as one of the functional aspects of zzso The zzso zzso from patients' zzso inhibited the zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso The degrees of zzso by zzso from patients paralleled their zzso zzso to zzso In addition, the zzso also inhibited the zzso outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rabbit zzso which were zzso by zzso also caused a similar zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso could play roles in zzso in zzso zzso positive zzso through interfering with the zzso action of zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso including zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso of zzso function is one important action of zzso and could be one of the important mechanisms in zzso
