zzso zzso project their zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso bulb, forming an ordered pattern of zzso zzso the zzso sensory zzso A mirror symmetry exists within this map, such that zzso expressing a given zzso typically project to one zzso on the zzso face and one zzso on the lateral face of the zzso The mechanisms underlying an zzso zzso choice to project zzso versus zzso remain largely unknown, zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso growth factor zzso signaling is required for sensory zzso of the lateral zzso zzso zzso that eliminate zzso signaling cause zzso destined for targets in the lateral bulb to shift to zzso sites on the zzso zzso Using primary cultures of zzso and zzso zzso we further show that zzso is a zzso for zzso growth zzso Together these observations reveal a role of zzso signaling in sensory map formation and zzso zzso
