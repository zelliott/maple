zzso of the leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso has been reported to promote zzso and also to support neural stem cell zzso zzso To investigate this paradox, we isolated zzso and generated zzso from embryonic mice either zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and promoted expression of zzso by all cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso also zzso a twofold increase in the number of zzso clones generated from these cultures in comparison with those zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso cultures of zzso knockout cells was reduced in comparison with that of zzso cells grown in zzso and was unaffected by zzso Thus, although zzso signaling is not necessary for zzso zzso it enhances both the zzso and the expression of zzso by these zzso zzso
