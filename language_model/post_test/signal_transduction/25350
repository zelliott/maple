zzso is a zzso zzso protein closely related to zzso It is expressed in various zzso and zzso cells, many of which also express zzso zzso of zzso occurs following engagement of various zzso and zzso receptors and can play positive and negative roles following zzso zzso zzso binds zzso directly, resulting in efficient zzso flux and zzso However, zzso does not contain a zzso motif and only binds zzso zzso possibly via zzso thereby resulting in zzso zzso As zzso can signal more efficiently than zzso competition between the 2 for zzso in the zzso zzso can zzso zzso This competition model requires zzso of zzso however, zzso is repressive, even in cells lacking substantial zzso expression such as zzso and mature B zzso The reported interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggests 1 possible mechanism for zzso zzso by zzso but such a model requires further zzso Given the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso has the ability to zzso signaling in virtually every type of zzso Regardless of its ultimate mode of action, the potent regulatory capability of zzso proves this protein to be a complex zzso that warrants continued, substantial scrutiny by zzso and zzso zzso
