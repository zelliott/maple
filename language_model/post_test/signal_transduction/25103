zzso and zzso regulate inflammatory and immune responses through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso The biological responses to these zzso are determined by integration of various signaling pathways in a zzso and zzso zzso In this study we have characterized the molecular basis for the functional cooperation between zzso and zzso zzso in the induction of the zzso zzso gamma zzso I zzso gamma zzso in zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso DNA binding activity or induce novel zzso complexes to the zzso gamma zzso zzso By using cell systems lacking functional zzso or zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, while zzso did not influence zzso zzso The cooperation required zzso of zzso DNA zzso and the zzso domain of zzso but did not involve zzso zzso of zzso or physical interaction between zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso was not dependent on a consensus zzso response element in the zzso zzso but required the zzso and zzso functions of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso activated the natural zzso gamma zzso promoter zzso and this response required both zzso and the zzso family zzso factor zzso Previously, physical association between zzso and zzso has been shown to enhance zzso and suppress zzso zzso The results shown here demonstrate a zzso indirect mechanism of zzso between zzso and steroid zzso signaling that zzso zzso and zzso pathways with cell zzso zzso zzso factor in the regulation of zzso gamma zzso gene zzso
