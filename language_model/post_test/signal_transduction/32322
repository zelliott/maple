To exist in a wide range of environmental zzso bacteria must sense and respond to a variety of external zzso A primary means by which this occurs is through zzso signal zzso zzso typically composed of a sensor zzso zzso that receives the input stimuli and then zzso a response regulator that effects an appropriate change in cellular zzso zzso zzso and response regulators have an intrinsic zzso that separates signal zzso zzso and output zzso this zzso has allowed bacteria to dramatically expand and diversify their signaling zzso Recent work has begun to reveal the molecular basis by which zzso proteins zzso How and why do zzso signaling proteins zzso How do cells gain new pathways and recognize new zzso What changes are needed to insulate a new zzso from existing zzso What constraints are there on gene zzso and lateral gene zzso Here, we review progress made in answering these questions, highlighting how the integration of zzso sequence data with experimental studies is providing major new zzso
