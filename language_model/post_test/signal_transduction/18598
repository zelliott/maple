zzso green algae have developed a visual system, the zzso apparatus, which allows the cell to zzso To further understand the molecular organization of the zzso apparatus and the zzso movement that is controlled by light and the zzso clock, a detailed understanding of all components of the zzso apparatus is zzso We developed a procedure to purify the zzso apparatus from the green model zzso zzso zzso Its zzso analysis resulted in the identification of 202 different proteins with at least two different peptides zzso in zzso These data provide new insights into structural components of the zzso apparatus, zzso zzso zzso members of putative signaling pathways for zzso and zzso and zzso pathways within an zzso visual zzso In addition, we have performed a functional analysis of one of the identified putative components of the zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is also present in the zzso and thus is a promising candidate for controlling behavioral responses to zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso by zzso interference reduces its level in both zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso of zzso results in severe disturbances in zzso zzso formation, and zzso control of zzso
