Mice deficient for the zzso factor zzso consensus sequence binding protein zzso are zzso and develop zzso zzso Further analyses indicated that zzso is a molecular switch factor directing the differentiation of zzso zzso precursors to the zzso zzso To reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for the deregulation of zzso we examined the signaling of the zzso factor 1 zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso We found that in the absence of zzso zzso signaling is attenuated as seen from an accelerated termination of zzso zzso and reduced cell zzso This finding zzso with an increased zzso zzso and an enhanced zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso known to zzso activated zzso by targeting it to the zzso zzso Our results indicate that upon zzso zzso zzso itself is partly zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso the expression of a major zzso zzso zzso B, is strongly reduced in zzso zzso
