Nuclear zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso and zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso zzso a potential tumor zzso functions as a potent zzso zzso for zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, whereas depletion of zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso target genes in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso is associated with the zzso zzso promoter in the absence of hormone and zzso after zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso interacts with the zzso of zzso zzso activity zzso a protein related to zzso to form zzso and enhance the protein stability of both zzso Interestingly, the zzso activity of zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso (and vice zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso repress zzso only when they are not zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso located in the middle of zzso and zzso are responsible for their zzso stabilization, and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso function in the mouse results in early embryonic zzso whereas mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso exhibit a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso for zzso in zzso and in zzso and that its zzso with zzso acts as a novel mechanism to limit its zzso zzso
