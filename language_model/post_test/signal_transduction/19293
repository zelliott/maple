zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in breast cancer will facilitate the rational design of therapies to disrupt zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is frequently observed in breast cancer, the factors zzso its zzso expression are poorly zzso In particular, the zzso gene is not significantly zzso raising the question as to how zzso zzso is zzso In this study we showed that the zzso zzso factor, amplified at zzso in zzso of breast tumors, regulates zzso zzso Analysis of a panel of human breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso 50) and primary human breast tumors zzso zzso zzso showed a strong positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in human zzso zzso cells induced zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso in breast cancer cells resulted in decreased zzso zzso Although zzso has previously been linked with zzso repression because of its close association with zzso protein zzso zzso complexes, our results show that zzso also activates gene zzso We showed that zzso recruitment to the zzso promoter is zzso and that zzso and zzso have opposite roles in regulating zzso zzso In addition, we identify zzso as one of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso
