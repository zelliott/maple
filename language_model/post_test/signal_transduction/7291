For a decade, the technologies behind DNA sequencing have improved rapidly in cost reduction and zzso zzso in large populations of cancer patients is leading to dramatic advances in our understanding of the cancer zzso The wide variety of cancer types zzso and analyzed using these technologies has revealed many novel fundamental genetic mechanisms driving cancer zzso zzso and zzso We have zzso our understanding of the signaling zzso demonstrating disruption in zzso regulation and zzso of the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies are being zzso for the first zzso The translation of zzso variation into clinically zzso information is still in its zzso zzso insights from sequencing studies have led to the discovery of a variety of novel diagnostic zzso and therapeutic zzso Here, we review recent advances in cancer zzso and discuss what the new findings have taught us about cancer biology and, more importantly, how these new findings guide more effective diagnostic and treatment zzso
