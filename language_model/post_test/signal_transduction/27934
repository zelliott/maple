The zzso zzso zzso displays an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso activity which seems to participate in zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is involved in the activity of several zzso factors that are nuclear zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso In some instances, the zzso factors are zzso upon cell zzso which zzso their interaction with zzso zzso itself is a zzso and can be zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso results in the stimulation of its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso sites are located in the zzso part of the zzso outside of the zzso zzso These sites are required for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso change of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that, in some instances, zzso itself might be a target for signal zzso zzso
