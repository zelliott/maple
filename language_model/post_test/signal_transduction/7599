We have investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso interactions in human zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso is commonly shared by the cancer cells of various zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in both the cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso In zzso we showed that zzso cancer cells are not the major zzso zzso On the other hand, our zzso studies demonstrated that the cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso the zzso being produced, we found that zzso zzso promotes proliferation and migration of zzso cancer cells via the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso in zzso cancer zzso while zzso is found in zzso cells in primary zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso is significantly associated with the zzso grade and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer, further supporting the role of zzso which interacts with zzso in promoting growth and zzso of human zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated that zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso interactions in human zzso cancer by inducing zzso in zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso zzso represent therapeutic targets in zzso zzso
