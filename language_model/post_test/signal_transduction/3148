zzso zzso are the only zzso cells and are critically involved in various zzso diseases, including osteoporosis and zzso zzso zzso of zzso from bone zzso zzso cells zzso is regulated by zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso However, it is unknown how zzso signal stimulates zzso of zzso to initiate the zzso zzso As reported here, we found that OC differentiation and acquisition of bone zzso capacity were suppressed in zzso zzso or zzso zzso but could be restored by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso proliferation of zzso was unaffected by the absence of zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso no longer exhibited the optimal induction of typical OC markers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso K or zzso signals such as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These were restored by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies also indicated that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso with zzso during zzso stimulation in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the recruitment of zzso by zzso were suppressed in zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso zzso the initial zzso signal to the zzso zzso zzso for OC zzso
