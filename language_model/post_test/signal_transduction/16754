zzso proteins serve as zzso proteins in zzso signal zzso The founding member of this family, zzso becomes zzso in response to zzso stimuli such as zzso cell zzso and zzso engagement of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are large zzso molecules that transmit signals as intermediaries through interactions with signaling molecules such as zzso and other zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso After zzso is zzso it acts as a zzso protein for binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso In order to examine the structural basis for a key step in propagation of signals by zzso one of the major zzso sites of zzso has been zzso in complex with the zzso regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions were identified by zzso screening and zzso with multiple rounds of zzso The zzso formed at 295 K in space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, and zzso to zzso A zzso
