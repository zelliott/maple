In zzso the nocturnal rise and fall of zzso zzso zzso activity controls the rhythmic synthesis of zzso the hormone of the zzso zzso This rhythm involves the zzso regulation of the zzso by two zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding zzso and the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso early zzso Most zzso mouse strains do not produce zzso under standard laboratory zzso zzso As zzso mice are often the founders for transgenic animals used for zzso zzso molecular components of neuroendocrine zzso in the zzso zzso as an integral part of clock zzso mechanisms have to be zzso We therefore compared calcium zzso zzso events and zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso mouse and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso were cultured and zzso with zzso or were collected at various times of the zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso calcium zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso protein levels follow similar dynamics in the zzso zzso of both mouse zzso zzso levels are high during the early night and zzso protein shows elevated levels during the late zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a low but significant increase in zzso synthesis could be observed upon zzso zzso and, notably, also when animals were exposed to long zzso We conclude that the commonly used zzso mouse is not completely zzso and that this zzso does not affect molecular details involved in regulating zzso events of zzso zzso
