zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice leads to increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to weight zzso Although zzso has been implicated as a regulator of multiple signals, its function in other zzso responses in zzso is poorly zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso mice are resistant to zzso liver damage and zzso as evident by reduced zzso zzso in zzso versus wild type mice and reduced levels of circulating liver zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was attenuated in zzso from zzso mice following zzso zzso zzso although components of the zzso signaling complex were zzso zzso of zzso regulators, such as the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and the zzso pathway, was elevated in response to zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso Using zzso primary zzso we show that resistance to zzso zzso is cell autonomous and that signals involving the Met, zzso and zzso pathways are required for zzso This study identifies a previously unknown zzso role for zzso in zzso liver damage and points to zzso as a potential therapeutic target against zzso zzso
