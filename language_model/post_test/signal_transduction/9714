zzso import into zzso is an essential process in every zzso zzso While most of the components of the import machinery have been identified and are mechanistically quite well zzso regulation of this process had been a largely neglected area of research in the zzso Recently, we demonstrated for the first time that the zzso of the outer zzso membrane zzso is zzso and regulated by several zzso protein zzso Among these, zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso the assembly of TOM complexes, while protein zzso A zzso controls zzso zzso Here, we outline the current model of protein import regulation, together with additional zzso functions of zzso and zzso We also reflect the data on zzso protein zzso and zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso
