The zzso and growth zzso zzso zzso complex 1 zzso regulates many processes that control growth, including protein zzso zzso and zzso Through unknown mechanisms, zzso promotes the function of zzso a master regulator of zzso and zzso gene zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso by controlling the nuclear entry of zzso 1, a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso 1 promotes nuclear zzso and mediates the effects of zzso on zzso target zzso zzso promoter activity, and nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso in the liver significantly zzso zzso function and makes mice zzso in a zzso zzso fashion, to the zzso zzso and zzso induced by a high-fat and zzso zzso These findings establish zzso 1 as a key component of the zzso zzso
