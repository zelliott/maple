The present study showed that engagement of zzso delivers a survival signal in chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe two groups of zzso showing different zzso of zzso in zzso and distinct ratios between zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed low zzso zzso and zzso ratio and underwent rapid zzso in zzso zzso had high zzso zzso and zzso ratio and were resistant to zzso for several zzso zzso cells, expressing zzso zzso and zzso were detected mainly in zzso zzso Of note, zzso zzso obtained with a specific zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of the nuclear zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso groups, leading to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and increased cell zzso zzso to zzso stable zzso could also deliver an zzso signal in B cells of both zzso and zzso increasing the zzso and zzso protein content, regardless the expression of zzso On the other hand, the addition of the zzso zzso is unable to zzso the target zzso of the zzso zzso prevented these zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso system may play a role also in zzso in maintaining zzso zzso
