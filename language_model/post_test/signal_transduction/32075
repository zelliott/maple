The zzso zzso is under active consideration as a cancer drug target based on its capacity to promote cancer cell invasion and to create a zzso zzso However, the clinical application of zzso zzso remains uncertain as genetic studies show a tumor zzso function of zzso in pancreatic cancer and other zzso zzso Here, we used genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the therapeutic impact of global zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer in relation to tumor stage, genetic profile, and concurrent zzso We found that zzso zzso acted as a key upstream zzso of zzso in evolving pancreatic zzso In addition, zzso or zzso blockade increased tumor cell proliferation and accelerated both early and later disease zzso These effects were dependent on the presence of zzso a central zzso of zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso and zzso act in a common tumor zzso zzso whose zzso zzso promotes pancreatic cancer zzso
