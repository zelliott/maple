zzso roots are formed at regular intervals along the main root by zzso zzso of founder zzso To date, the mechanism by which branching of the root system is controlled and founder cells become specified remains zzso 

Our study reports the identification of the zzso regulatory components and their target zzso zzso which control lateral root founder cell zzso Initially, a zzso of lateral zzso zzso data identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed specifically in zzso pole zzso cells before the first zzso division and is correlated with zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso Also, functional studies revealed that zzso controls lateral root founder cell zzso Finally, we show that an zzso zzso signaling mechanism in the zzso zzso controls zzso zzso 

We have identified the first molecular components that control lateral root founder cell identity in the zzso zzso These include an zzso zzso signaling module in the zzso zzso region that regulates zzso expression and thereby lateral root founder cell zzso and root branching zzso
