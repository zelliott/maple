Upon contact with bacteria, zzso cells activates a slurry of zzso mechanisms via distinct zzso zzso zzso However, some bacteria have evolved strategies to escape or inhibit these host zzso zzso We have recently shown that the bacteria zzso zzso which encodes the zzso outer protein zzso appears to inhibit the zzso of zzso by preventing the zzso of zzso In a subsequent series of experiments it has also been shown that zzso blocks the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here the regulatory function of zzso on zzso signal zzso is zzso
