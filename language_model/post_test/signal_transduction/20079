zzso evidence from pharmacological zzso genetic association studies and schizophrenia research indicates an important influence of the zzso system on zzso gating as measured by zzso zzso zzso of the acoustic startle zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso have been shown to disrupt zzso in humans and zzso In the present study, we investigated the associations of two functional zzso related single zzso zzso zzso and zzso the latter also known as zzso zzso with zzso in two independent healthy human samples zzso zzso Munich zzso London zzso zzso is a prominent marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso and was therefore hypothesized to impact on zzso In line with our hypothesis, we report here reduced zzso levels in individuals with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso as indicated by the zzso zzso zzso across both samples confirmed this zzso In contrast, an association between zzso and zzso found in the Munich sample could not be confirmed in the London zzso Overall, the present study helps to bridge the gap between pharmacological zzso of zzso and molecular zzso of the zzso zzso
