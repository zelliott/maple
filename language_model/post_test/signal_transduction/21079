In this report, we have examined the zzso binding and second zzso zzso characteristics of zzso in the guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso sites in the zzso and cerebral zzso were of similar zzso zzso 34 and 24 zzso zzso zzso and affinities zzso 20 and 55 zzso zzso Analysis of competition for zzso binding in the zzso was compatible with the presence of a zzso In this zzso zzso evoked a zzso zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked in the presence of a zzso oxide zzso consistent with mediation via a zzso The zzso binding profile in the cerebral zzso did not comply with those previously described for zzso zzso and zzso failed to alter significantly zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral cortex, zzso or zzso even in the presence of zzso or a zzso zzso zzso was also without effect on zzso zzso zzso or zzso turnover in the cerebral zzso These results suggest that the guinea-pig zzso expresses a functional zzso coupled to zzso zzso generation, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, the guinea-pig cerebral zzso displays binding sites that exhibit zzso pharmacology but fail to show functional zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
