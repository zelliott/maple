zzso signaling plays a zzso role in regulating the formation of zzso from zzso neural precursors in zzso but whether, as in flies, it also specifies sibling cells for different zzso fates is not zzso zzso spinal zzso precursors called zzso cells produce mostly zzso and zzso but recent zzso experiments reveal that they also make zzso zzso cells and zzso Our own zzso analysis of zzso cells in zzso showed that some produce a primary zzso and zzso zzso at their final zzso We investigated the possibility that zzso signaling regulates a zzso fate decision using a combination of zzso transgenic and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso We show that continuous absence of zzso activity produces excess primary zzso and a deficit of zzso zzso whereas transient zzso preceding zzso results in an excess of both cell zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso signaling at the neural plate stage produces excess zzso zzso and a deficit of primary zzso Furthermore, individual zzso cells produce similar kinds of zzso at their final division in zzso zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso These data provide evidence that, among some zzso daughters of zzso cells, zzso promotes zzso zzso identity and zzso primary zzso fate, raising the possibility that zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso type by zzso similar zzso fate zzso
