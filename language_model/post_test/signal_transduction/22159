The precise molecular zzso of zzso sleep zzso zzso is zzso however recent research indicates that several interconnected zzso pathways and molecular abnormalities are contributors to zzso zzso the genes and pathways associated with zzso can help to expand our understanding of the risk factors for the disease as well as provide new avenues for potential zzso zzso these goals, we have integrated relevant high zzso data from various sources, such as zzso expression data zzso zzso interaction zzso data and results from zzso association studies zzso in order to define zzso elements that connect some of the known pathways related to the disease as well as define novel regulatory zzso related to zzso Two distinct approaches are applied to identify zzso significantly associated with zzso In the first case we used a biased approach based on sixty zzso with known associations with sleep disorders and/or zzso disease to seed a search using commercial software to discover networks associated with disease followed by information zzso zzso zzso scoring of the zzso In the second case we used an unbiased approach and generated an zzso constructed from publicly available gene expression profiles and zzso databases, followed by scoring of the network with zzso from zzso data derived from zzso patients to uncover zzso significant for the disease zzso A comparison of the approaches reveals a number of proteins that have been previously known to be associated with zzso or zzso In addition, our results indicate a novel association of zzso zzso the zzso family of proteins and its related pathways with zzso
