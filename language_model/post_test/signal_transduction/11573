The zzso signaling pathway, renowned for its effects on cell proliferation and survival, is zzso active in various human zzso including zzso We have found that zzso and zzso are required to convert the border cells in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells to zzso invasive zzso The zzso for this pathway, zzso zzso is expressed by two central cells within the migratory cell zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cause defects in migration and a reduction in the number of cells recruited to the zzso zzso expression of either zzso or zzso is sufficient to induce extra zzso cells to zzso Thus, a localized signal activates the zzso zzso in neighboring zzso cells, causing them to become zzso
