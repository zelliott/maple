zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of human zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are produced at high bacterial cell zzso To determine whether zzso sensing plays a role in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso capable of detecting either zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules in spent culture zzso were first zzso While no zzso could be zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by spent zzso zzso zzso culture zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and demonstrated to restore zzso production in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso production in zzso zzso Western zzso using zzso raised against the zzso protein revealed that zzso levels increased throughout growth even though zzso activity was only zzso detected at the zzso phase of growth and disappeared by the onset of stationary zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso coli zzso transformed with zzso suggesting that zzso production is not limited by a lack of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso activities revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced around zzso less zzso and zzso less zzso activity than the parent zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibited a fourfold reduction in zzso zzso However, these reductions in zzso zzso levels were insufficient to zzso the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso
