zzso radiation at clinical dose levels activates both zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso the balance of which determines cell zzso The initiating and amplifying mechanisms involved in the zzso are poorly zzso We demonstrate that one mechanism involves stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of Chinese zzso zzso cells was measured by the zzso zzso zzso conversion zzso zzso zzso a transient zzso of zzso with zzso activity at 5 zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis and genetic manipulation by zzso of wild type or dominant negative zzso zzso identify the zzso zzso as zzso Further evidence that zzso is activated by radiation was the demonstration of zzso zzso formation in cells zzso zzso with the zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a footprint of zzso formation, followed radiation exposure and was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, a zzso response to radiation, was also blocked by zzso zzso zzso These experiments establish zzso signal zzso pathways as being zzso Given the zzso and relatively stable properties of zzso these results also suggest a possible mechanism by which zzso events in one cell may activate signaling processes in adjacent zzso
