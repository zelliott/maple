zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is activated by cell zzso zzso Because zzso stress is also considered a main component of zzso zzso cell zzso it was zzso that zzso could be a downstream target of zzso zzso signaling leading to cardiac zzso To determine a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso we infused zzso II into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II infusion significantly increased heart zzso length ratio, zzso zzso area, and zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso To confirm these results, we analyzed the effect of zzso II in primary cultures of zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso II (1 zzso treatment significantly increased protein synthesis in zzso zzso as measured by zzso incorporation into total cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied with increased zzso of nuclear proteins and depletion of cellular zzso zzso When cells were treated with cell zzso doses of zzso II zzso zzso robust zzso cell death was observed in zzso but not in zzso zzso This type of cell death was blocked by zzso of cellular zzso levels as well as by zzso of the longevity factor zzso zzso indicating that zzso induction and subsequent depletion of zzso levels are the sequence of events causing zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In conclusion, these results demonstrate that zzso is a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso cell signaling contributing to cardiac zzso and suggest that this could be a novel therapeutic target for the management of heart zzso
