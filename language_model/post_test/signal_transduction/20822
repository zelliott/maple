In zzso melanoma active movement of cancer cells is considered to be essential for tissue zzso Various mechanisms, such as the zzso C cascade or zzso processes are considered to play a role in tumor cell zzso The zzso of directional migration, combined with zzso image analysis, was used to evaluate the zzso efficacy of drugs interfering with different steps of signal zzso zzso Treatment with different compounds showed a more or less zzso reduction of migration zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a slight reduction of zzso The effect was more pronounced when the zzso zzso zzso was used or the zzso C zzso zzso tamoxifen and zzso were zzso A marked zzso of zzso was found with the zzso zzso L zzso Thus, our results indicate that different signal zzso pathways are involved in the regulation of directional migration of zzso melanoma zzso
