Loss of zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of heart zzso With fewer zzso the heart is unable to sustain efficient zzso Much attention has been focused on understanding mechanisms of cell death in zzso with the ultimate goal being to reduce the extent of injury and improve function in the failing zzso Both necrosis and zzso contribute to loss of zzso and this loss of cells is a hallmark of cardiac zzso including zzso zzso zzso and heart zzso zzso is a highly regulated process that is activated via death receptors in the plasma membrane or via zzso of the zzso zzso is generally viewed as an uncontrolled process that leads to zzso zzso cell zzso and subsequent zzso However, recent studies have uncovered a signaling zzso that mediates regulated necrosis or zzso zzso play an important role in both zzso and zzso and changes in their zzso can affect the zzso zzso to zzso This review focuses on the various modes of cell death in the zzso and highlights how they contribute to loss of zzso in response to zzso
