From zzso and throughout adult zzso zzso zzso is essential for germ cell differentiation and male zzso The initiation of zzso differentiation and germ cell zzso occurs under the direction of local zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso with the final phase of zzso zzso cell differentiation at zzso Here, we consider the cellular and molecular basis of zzso actions upon zzso cell zzso zzso rat zzso cells were isolated during the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso days zzso and zzso respectively, and cultured with zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso can zzso suppress zzso proliferation by zzso zzso phase progression and entry into the cell zzso zzso zzso was also found to initiate tight junction formation in primary zzso cells, consistent with a zzso zzso This study implicates zzso zzso in the differentiation of both zzso and germ cells in the zzso at zzso
