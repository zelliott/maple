To screen the genes related to zzso zzso seed development at pattern formation and maturation zzso the suppression zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 were constructed with its zzso at 10 days after flowering (10 zzso and 30 days after flowering (30 zzso through suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso The positive clones were screened by zzso and dot zzso zzso and then zzso High quality expressed sequence tags zzso were used for zzso functional zzso with zzso software, as well as analysis and zzso with zzso zzso zzso detection of five genes screened was performed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The insert size ranged from 100 to 900 zzso with an average size of about 500 zzso According to zzso functional zzso database, the zzso expressed genes mainly involved in zzso and zzso acid zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results from zzso detection of the five zzso expressed genes indicated that genes zzso and zzso presented zzso zzso gene zzso expressed in parts of zzso and genes zzso and zzso expressed in all zzso Two genes were found to be involved in seed development, zzso and protein zzso two genes may be involved in signal zzso one gene could not match with the zzso sequences known to date and was likely a new zzso These results are helpful for future gene cloning and their functional zzso
