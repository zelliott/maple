The humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso breast zzso However, many patients responding to treatment often develop zzso zzso between type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso and elevated zzso signaling have been implicated in tumor cell resistance to zzso zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and migration of breast cancer zzso cells in zzso Here, we generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso by engineering zzso and zzso We compared the effects of zzso treatment in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso mouse model with those of zzso and zzso treatment alone or in zzso zzso effectively inhibited proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso cells in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso more effectively inhibited cancer growth in zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso mouse model than zzso and zzso alone or in zzso Mice bearing zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed extensive and sustainable tumor zzso when treated with zzso Our results suggest that zzso has superior zzso activity compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso may be clinically beneficial in minimizing the acquired resistance to zzso zzso
