Recent zzso association studies have identified many promising schizophrenia candidate genes and demonstrated that common zzso variation contributes to schizophrenia zzso However, whether these genes represent zzso to a common but limited set of underlying molecular processes zzso that zzso risk to schizophrenia remains zzso and it is not known whether these genes zzso on common biological pathways zzso or represent different zzso In addition, the theoretical and genetic mechanisms underlying the strong genetic zzso of schizophrenia remain largely zzso Using 4 zzso data sets that contain top schizophrenia zzso genes and applying zzso interaction zzso network analysis, we investigated the interactions among proteins zzso by top schizophrenia zzso zzso We found proteins zzso by top schizophrenia zzso genes formed a highly significant interconnected network, and, compared with random networks, these zzso networks are statistically highly significant for both direct connectivity and indirect zzso We further validated these results using empirical functional data zzso data from a clinical zzso These highly significant findings indicate that top schizophrenia zzso genes zzso proteins that significantly directly zzso and formed a densely interconnected network, suggesting zzso of common underlying molecular processes or pathways that zzso risk to zzso Our findings that schizophrenia zzso genes zzso a highly interconnected protein network may also provide a novel explanation for the observed genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso in any member of this molecular network will lead to same functional consequences that eventually contribute to risk of zzso
