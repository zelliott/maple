The signaling pathways linking zzso to nuclear events are incompletely zzso We have examined zzso signaling by the zzso zzso a zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso of zzso in primary human zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso recruitment of zzso zzso of Ras and stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not cause these zzso While the stimulation of zzso by zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso Ras and zzso the zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso Ras and zzso and by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso by zzso induced zzso from the zzso serum response element and promoted cell cycle progression in response to zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso did not induce these zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso to the control of cell cycle progression zzso by zzso regulates the proliferation of zzso zzso and possibly other cells which are in contact with the basement membrane in zzso
