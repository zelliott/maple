zzso is a major cause of morbidity and zzso zzso zzso zzso as shown by prolonged zzso in the zzso caused by delayed zzso contraction zzso zzso zzso is a common feature of zzso and is associated with a poor zzso Although the zzso zzso is zzso in certain zzso previous studies suggested this zzso was zzso rather than a potential cause of the zzso Using the zzso zzso system and a modified zzso zzso zzso we provide evidence that increased zzso signaling in mice can result in a lethal zzso associated with a wide zzso complex zzso zzso expression of zzso in adult mice resulted in a zzso mortality rate at 16 zzso whereas suppression of zzso expression after 8 zzso protected mice from further mortality and allowed partial improvement in zzso zzso zzso of zzso analysis of over 6,000 genes from hearts expressing zzso are consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also identified known markers of zzso and hundreds of previously unknown potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for this zzso Our system allows zzso to be induced and reversed in adult mice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the role of zzso signaling in causing cardiac zzso
