The molecular zzso of a new zzso patient, originating from Morocco and presenting zzso with large zzso and an absence of zzso zzso zzso has been identified and reproduced in zzso zzso zzso Gene sequencing revealed zzso of a zzso in the domain coding for the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso This zzso causes a zzso frame shift, which creates putative novel zzso and zzso 37 and 125 zzso acids zzso zzso A 34 zzso zzso zzso beta band, instead of the normal 26 zzso zzso was detected by Western zzso in zzso from the patient's zzso and from zzso cells and in zzso of metabolically labeled zzso The abnormal zzso did not associate with zzso alpha and was mainly zzso although a significant fraction could reach the cell zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso complex zzso to a von zzso factor zzso but were unable to change shape, unlike cells expressing the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest a novel role of the zzso beta zzso and its zzso region in zzso zzso in addition to a role in correct assembly and cell surface targeting of the zzso zzso
