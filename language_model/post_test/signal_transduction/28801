zzso are known to prevent zzso ends from being recognized as DNA zzso zzso zzso many DNA damage response zzso including zzso are thought to participate to zzso zzso However, the precise roles of zzso at zzso remain unclear due to its multiple functions in cell checkpoints and zzso To gain more insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso we determined the effects of the zzso zzso zzso in various cell lines lacking functional zzso We zzso by using Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso that zzso induced specific zzso aberrations occurring during or after zzso mainly consisting in sister zzso zzso and also zzso that involved zzso the lagging strand zzso We demonstrate that zzso reduced zzso instability independently of zzso zzso Our results suggest thus that zzso has a direct role in preventing inappropriate DNA repair at zzso which could be related to its possible participation to the formation of protected structures at zzso
