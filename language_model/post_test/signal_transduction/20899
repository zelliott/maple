The exposure of zzso cells to ultraviolet zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso factors, such as zzso and zzso It is zzso that the zzso zzso but not protein zzso C zzso is the major membrane zzso in zzso signal zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso as well as dominant negative zzso zzso markedly blocked zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activity in cells devoid of the zzso zzso zzso is not significantly different from that of the stable zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This was found at all zzso zzso doses and time courses zzso while high levels of zzso zzso activity were observed in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso This evidence strongly suggests that zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
