zzso is zzso in both familial and spontaneous tumors, and acts as a master zzso that activates the zzso polarity zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso This has led to the hypothesis that zzso acts as a tumor zzso because it is required to maintain cell polarity and growth control through zzso and zzso zzso However, the genetic analysis of zzso signaling in zzso has been complicated by the existence of multiple redundant zzso zzso We describe the identification of zzso in the single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso cells lose their polarity and zzso under energetic zzso zzso is required in zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause similar energetic zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso are rescued by a zzso version of zzso Thus, zzso signals through zzso to coordinate zzso polarity and proliferation with cellular energy status, and this might zzso the tumor zzso function of zzso
