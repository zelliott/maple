The zzso zzso zzso factors are important regulators of normal and zzso zzso because they control zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells at different levels of the zzso zzso In transgenic mice we show that the expression of zzso is tightly regulated by zzso Intermediate zzso of zzso induced a zzso increase in the zzso capacity of zzso stem cells zzso after 13 days of in zzso zzso zzso the proliferation induction of zzso by zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso because high levels of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, high levels of zzso blocked zzso and zzso development, demonstrating that tight regulation of zzso is critical for normal development of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects on zzso cells were associated with altered expression of genes that govern stem-cell zzso and lineage commitment zzso zzso leukemia factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, binding sites for zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso activated by zzso These findings reveal novel molecular pathways that act downstream of zzso and identify zzso as a master regulator of zzso zzso zzso
