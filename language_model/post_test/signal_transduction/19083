The zzso cell zzso zzso cell line and an zzso cell line zzso with a zzso zzso were interrogated for zzso cell selectivity in response to zzso zzso compounds representing 56 pharmacological zzso Selective zzso activity was observed for 14 of these compounds dominated by zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso which tended to span a representation of the chemical zzso space of the zzso The zzso zzso induced delayed cell death with features compatible with classical zzso The zzso zzso were largely inactive when tested against a cell line panel consisting of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a zzso DNA zzso analysis, zzso and zzso were found to be significantly increased in zzso cells compared to the other cell zzso The zzso analysis software zzso was subsequently used to extract a list of proteins and small molecules retrieved from zzso abstracts associated with the hit zzso The resulting list consisted of major parts of the zzso zzso A zzso linking to zzso zzso and zzso This molecular network may provide a basis for further exploitation of novel candidate targets for the treatment of zzso cell zzso
