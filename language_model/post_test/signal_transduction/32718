Upon treatment with zzso zzso primary B cells zzso and differentiate into plasma cells with zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso Here we examine the role of the zzso 3' zzso in this process using a zzso zzso reporter gene in transgenic zzso We find that zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso activity as a function of differentiation rather than zzso since proliferation only zzso by zzso of zzso is insufficient to activate the element, whilst differentiation with only limited proliferation zzso + transforming growth zzso does allow zzso to zzso The zzso 3' zzso is also induced by zzso of surface zzso and this signal can zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that distinct zzso pathways are zzso Nevertheless, both of these pathways can be inhibited by zzso of zzso Thus zzso enhancers in the heavy and light chain zzso are zzso regulated in response to zzso
