There is a persuasive body of evidence suggesting that tissue factor zzso is a major zzso of tumor zzso In addition to its zzso function as the zzso of zzso zzso may support tumor progression through signaling mechanisms involving either direct signal zzso through the zzso zzso domain or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Whereas zzso signaling events zzso from zzso may play an important role in tumor dissemination in some zzso zzso zzso generation appears to be the major mechanism linking tumor zzso zzso to zzso At least one mechanism zzso zzso generation to zzso potential involves the most zzso components of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso and factor zzso and leads to a restriction in natural killer zzso zzso of newly formed zzso A detailed understanding of the mechanisms linking zzso and circulating zzso system components to tumor progression may lead to novel therapeutic targets for cancer zzso
