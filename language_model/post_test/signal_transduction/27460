We have investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso with 38 zzso zzso on zzso zzso cell death in zzso cortical zzso The zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso and cultured in a chemically defined medium without serum for 10 days, after which more than zzso of the cells were stained by a specific zzso against zzso a specific marker for zzso The number of viable zzso was identified by the zzso conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso which was detected by the associated change in optical density at zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death was suppressed by zzso at zzso as low as zzso M, and at zzso M zzso suppressed half of the amount of zzso cell death seen in a control situation (no zzso The zzso curve was zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the number of zzso that were protected from damage with a zzso zzso curve suggesting that zzso exerts its zzso effect through the zzso of a zzso signal zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in the media of zzso was zzso by zzso at zzso as low as zzso M, a much higher concentration than the minimal effective dose of zzso required for protection against zzso zzso cell zzso Among the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso exhibited a zzso effect in the zzso zzso cell death at the indicated zzso These data indicate that zzso is one of the more important zzso zzso The kind of zzso signal zzso system involved in the zzso effect of zzso still remains to be zzso
