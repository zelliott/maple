Patients with genetic defects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso inflammatory disease zzso develop zzso zzso of the long zzso The molecular basis of this similarity is zzso zzso is caused by inappropriate zzso activity, which in turn activates the zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso bone zzso are derived from the same zzso zzso cells that form zzso tumors in mice and humans with defects that lead to increased zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso tumor cells showed high zzso activity, and an increase in their zzso signaling led to zzso zzso of zzso Increased zzso led to zzso zzso of zzso via zzso of the zzso (and early zzso zzso zzso In zzso tumor cells, as in cells with defective zzso regulation, increased zzso zzso zzso led to increased zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso like in other states of inappropriate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to a decrease in cell proliferation of both zzso and cells with abnormal zzso These data reveal a previously zzso link between abnormal zzso signaling and defective regulation of the zzso and suggest that zzso and zzso zzso may be therapeutic targets in bone zzso associated with defects of these two zzso
