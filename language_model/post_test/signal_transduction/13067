We compared human zzso cell zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso cause zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso as shown by zzso Both activate DNA binding of zzso zzso shown by zzso mobility shift zzso However, only zzso gamma increases expression of three zzso gene products zzso namely zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and class I major zzso complex zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso Only zzso gamma increases zzso zzso assessed by reporter gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso does not inhibit zzso gamma zzso Interestingly, zzso gamma zzso of zzso is considerably more zzso than that produced by zzso To determine whether duration is functionally zzso we zzso zzso with a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso beta and zzso regions of zzso the signaling zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to prevent binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor to such zzso cells produces zzso zzso that is comparable in magnitude and duration to that caused by zzso zzso but still fails to induce zzso zzso or class I zzso zzso zzso also activates zzso but not zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso mouse zzso gamma zzso failed to complement the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is necessary but not sufficient for induction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, signals provided by zzso gamma other than zzso zzso cannot be provided in trans to complement the response to zzso
