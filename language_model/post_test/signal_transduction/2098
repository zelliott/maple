Cell death by zzso is a tightly regulated process that requires coordinated modification in cellular zzso The zzso zzso family has been shown to play a key role in zzso Here we report that specific and ordered changes in the zzso zzso take place during zzso In this context, we have dissected one of the first hallmarks in cell death, represented by the severing of contacts among neighboring zzso More specifically, we provide demonstration for the mechanism that could contribute to the zzso of zzso organization at zzso zzso In fact, zzso a known regulator of zzso zzso is zzso processed in different cell types after induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso translated zzso into a form which is similar in size to that observed in cells undergoing zzso zzso zzso during zzso in zzso and after zzso treatment in zzso removes the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso The resulting zzso product is unable to bind zzso that is responsible for zzso filament binding and zzso This evidence indicates that connection with zzso filaments organized at zzso contacts could be dismantled during zzso Our observations suggest that zzso orchestrate the specific and sequential changes in the zzso zzso occurring during cell death via zzso of different regulators of the zzso zzso
