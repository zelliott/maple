In zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso depends on the resistance zzso zzso zzso and the zzso locus zzso Resistance also depends on salicylic acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso application of zzso zzso resistance in zzso plants by increasing zzso transcript levels in a zzso zzso Here we report that reduction of zzso acid zzso can also induce zzso gene expression and zzso resistance to zzso However, the zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the levels of zzso via a zzso in the zzso zzso carrier zzso or by zzso application of zzso increased transcript levels of zzso as well as several other R zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso restored zzso levels in zzso zzso plants and zzso a dependence on zzso Resistance to zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso zzso plants was zzso by zzso but not by zzso whereas that in zzso zzso plants was zzso by zzso but not by zzso The low zzso induction of R gene expression was also dependent on zzso but independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not activate this zzso zzso in zzso plants, but instead resulted in the induction of several genes that zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may be specifically targeted during pathogen infection and that altering zzso levels may serve as a unique strategy for promoting disease zzso
