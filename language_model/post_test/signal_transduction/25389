The zzso factor zzso factor 2 zzso is critical for normal trafficking of T zzso but its role in B cells is zzso We report that B zzso zzso zzso leads to decreased expression of the trafficking molecules zzso and zzso yet expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 (which is a critical target of zzso in T zzso was, unexpectedly, minimally zzso zzso zzso deletion led to a drastic reduction in the B1 zzso pool and a substantial increase in transitional and marginal zone zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso B cells showed increased zzso and impaired proliferation after zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analysis indicated that zzso zzso B cells display numerous characteristics shared by normal marginal zone B cells, including reduced expression of several signaling molecules that may contribute to defective zzso of these zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso plays a critical role in dictating normal subset differentiation and functional zzso of mature B zzso
