This study was aimed to investigate the zzso effect of zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso on cell cycle of zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso cell lines were detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso cell cycle was determined by zzso and their relationship was zzso The results showed that the zzso and protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso E in zzso cells and zzso cells increased zzso and the expression of zzso decreased zzso There was positive correlation between the protein expressions of zzso zzso and the protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but there was negative correlation between the protein expressions of zzso zzso and the protein expression of zzso The percentage of cells in zzso phase was decreased and the percentage of cells in S phase was increased, there was significant difference as compared with control zzso It is concluded that increase of the zzso expression and protein activity of zzso and zzso activate the cell zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso of zzso phase, switching cell to S phase through zzso check point quickly and accelerating cell cycle progression and cell zzso and eventually leads to occurrence of zzso
