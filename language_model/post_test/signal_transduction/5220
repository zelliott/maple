We studied the effects of natural essential oil on zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso cells to zzso the mechanism underlying the action of the oils used in zzso zzso outgrowth can be induced by nerve growth factor zzso where zzso and zzso zzso among zzso pathways play important roles in zzso zzso signal zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso the major component of essential oils from oranges, can promote zzso outgrowth in zzso cells, in which zzso outgrowth can be induced by various physical zzso We also examined by which zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso pathway, zzso acts on zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso outgrowth can be induced when the cells are treated with zzso After treatment with zzso we observed that zzso zzso is strongly activated in zzso cells, while zzso is zzso zzso In contrast, zzso shows little zzso A study using an inhibitor of zzso zzso revealed that zzso outgrowth in zzso cells is induced via the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The results thus indicate that zzso may promote neural cell differentiation mainly via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
