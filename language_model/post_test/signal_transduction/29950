We present an analysis of the folding behavior of the zzso major birch zzso zzso zzso v zzso The protein contains a zzso channel running through zzso zzso the protein has a zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso During the folding of the protein from either the zzso zzso or zzso state, zzso v 1 zzso populates a partially folded intermediate zzso This state appears to be zzso since it has to unfold at least partially to fold to the native zzso The zzso intermediate is not, however, a result of the zzso channel in zzso v zzso The intermediate completely disappears in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the channel is still zzso zzso appears to behave as a zzso zzso which zzso efficient zzso The close structural zzso the apple zzso Mal d 1, also folds without any zzso folding zzso However, the position of the transition state on the reaction zzso which is a measure of its overall zzso relative to the zzso and native states, is reduced dramatically from zzso zzso in zzso v 1 to around zzso in Mal d zzso We suggest that this large shift in the transition state structure is partly due to different local zzso zzso Given that individual zzso can have such large effects on zzso one should not a zzso expect structurally zzso proteins to fold by the same zzso
