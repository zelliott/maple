zzso systems zzso are a large family of zzso pathways characterized by the successive transfer of zzso groups between the zzso and zzso zzso of paired zzso zzso and response regulator zzso With the availability of zzso sequences for four zzso of zzso it has become possible to assess the zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes and to characterize features of their organization and evolutionary zzso In this study we have compiled lists of the zzso genes within zzso zzso and characterized their domain architecture, gene organization and evolutionary zzso In order to provide an appropriate context for our conclusions, where possible we have compared zzso zzso with those found in zzso other completely zzso zzso zzso have the largest number of zzso of any zzso An unusually low proportion of zzso genes are paired in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also seem to sense internal signals to an unusual zzso zzso evidence has allowed us to suggest zzso relationships of proteins across the zzso and it appears that zzso zzso evolution has been dominated by zzso gene zzso and changes in sensory domain zzso The systematic zzso of the zzso proteins of the zzso presented here should also provide a framework for future experimental studies on zzso regulation in these zzso
