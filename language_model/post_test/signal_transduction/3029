zzso signaling between neighboring cells controls many cell fate decisions in zzso both during zzso and in zzso zzso Previously, we uncovered a critical role for zzso zzso signaling in suppressing zzso differentiation in zzso However, the contribution of individual zzso receptors and the downstream signaling mechanism have not been zzso Here we report that removal of zzso but not zzso from the embryonic limb zzso markedly increased zzso bone mass in adolescent zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso a zzso of all zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but not the more mature zzso cells, caused a dramatic zzso zzso characterized by increased zzso numbers, diminished bone zzso zzso zzso pool, and rapid zzso bone zzso Moreover, mice deficient in zzso and zzso two target genes of zzso zzso exhibited high bone zzso Interestingly, zzso bound to and suppressed the zzso promoter, and zzso deletion increased zzso expression in zzso Finally, pharmacological zzso of zzso alleviated the zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling functions in part through zzso zzso of zzso to suppress zzso contributing to bone zzso in zzso
