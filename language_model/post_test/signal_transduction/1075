Genes zzso for receptors of the innate immune system are potential candidates for zzso to inflammatory zzso disease, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were associated with Crohn's zzso zzso two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso resulting in impaired zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding protein gene and the zzso zzso increasing protein gene were evaluated in 102 patients with Crohn's disease, 98 patients with zzso colitis and 145 healthy zzso The zzso and carrier zzso for the zzso zzso in zzso gene were significantly increased in zzso colitis when compared to the controls zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso None of the other five zzso was associated with inflammatory zzso zzso In conclusion, a novel association between a functional zzso in zzso and zzso colitis is zzso This observation underscores the importance of impaired innate immunity in inflammatory zzso zzso
