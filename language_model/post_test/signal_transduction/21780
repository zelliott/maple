zzso stabilization by chemotherapy is a powerful weapon in the war against zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activates a number of signaling zzso with consequences that may protect the cell or lead to its death via zzso zzso the first zzso stabilizing drug to be identified, has been zzso successfully in the treatment of solid tumors for two zzso Several features, however, make this drug less than ideal, and the search for next generation stabilizing drugs with increased efficacy has been intense and zzso zzso stabilizing agents zzso including the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso form an important and expanding family of zzso zzso A strong understanding of their molecular signaling consequences is essential to their value, particularly in regard to their potential for zzso chemotherapy - the use of multiple agents to enhance the efficacy of cancer zzso Here we present a critical review of research on the signaling mechanisms induced by zzso their relevance to zzso and their potential for exploitation by zzso zzso
