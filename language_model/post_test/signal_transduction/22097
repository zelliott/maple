zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of inflammatory zzso promotes their generation and release, and zzso initial inflammatory zzso This results in the release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso As a zzso and zzso physical therapy regimen, zzso wave treatment has been successfully used for the treatment of zzso In this study, zzso were derived from the zzso of knee zzso of zzso male zzso rats and were mechanically zzso by zzso type II treatment for further culture in zzso The zzso zzso were stained with zzso blue and treated with a zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso for various zzso zzso activity was measured by zzso zzso and the zzso rate of the zzso was determined with zzso zzso zzso to identify effective treatment zzso and zzso and to establish an zzso model for the zzso in response to zzso Using this model, the zzso were randomly divided to receive zzso wave treatment for various zzso The zzso rate of the zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso and the protein expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso structure was examined by transmission electronic zzso The zzso rates were significantly lower at 4 and 8 h of treatment than at 0 and 2 zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also significantly lower at 4 and 8 h than at 0 and 2 zzso whereas that of zzso was significantly higher at 4 and 8 h than at 0 and 2 zzso zzso we can conclude that zzso wave treatment can inhibit the zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso
