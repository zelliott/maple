zzso infections with zzso B and C viruses zzso and zzso are zzso linked to zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both viruses may induce zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso in zzso that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and zzso zzso zzso analysis of proteins associated with zzso signaling complexes in both zzso zzso tumor and zzso zzso may disclose possible common mechanisms in zzso By functional zzso we analyzed proteins associated with zzso complexes in zzso human zzso tumor and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso patients, respectively, and in zzso tissue with dual viral zzso The quantity of zzso proteins was zzso measured by protein spot intensity on the gels of two-dimensional zzso gel zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso zzso protein in tumor part was detected in the majority of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that enhanced expression of zzso zzso protein might be a mechanism of zzso common to zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso protein could be potential targets for designing highly effective therapeutic agents in treating zzso and for zzso of zzso
