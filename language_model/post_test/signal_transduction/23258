zzso zzso alpha zzso plays an important role in breast cancer initiation and progression and represents a major target in cancer zzso The expression and activity of zzso is regulated by multiple mechanisms at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways with zzso function has been zzso We previously performed a zzso small interfering zzso zzso screen to identify novel protein zzso involved in the regulation of zzso zzso activity in human breast cancer zzso Our screening analysis identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential positive regulators of zzso 

In this study, we demonstrate zzso zzso B4 zzso a member of zzso zzso family, a positive regulator of zzso in human breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference technology zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in breast cancer zzso zzso activity of zzso after zzso zzso is the consequence of diminished zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso is reduced following zzso zzso 

Our data suggests zzso as an upstream regulator of zzso in human breast cancer cells by modulating zzso zzso The results also suggest zzso as a relevant downstream signaling zzso in this novel zzso zzso
