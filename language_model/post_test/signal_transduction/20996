We show that the zzso signal zzso system of zzso coli, zzso controls the expression of genes zzso cell envelope proteins involved in protein folding and zzso These findings are based on three lines of zzso First, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the synthesis of zzso required for zzso bond formation, and zzso a major zzso zzso Second, using zzso mobility shift and zzso I protection zzso we have shown that zzso zzso binds to elements upstream of the zzso start sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter coding for a zzso zzso zzso Third, we have demonstrated increased in zzso zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso and zzso when the zzso zzso is zzso We have identified a putative zzso consensus binding site that is found upstream of a number of other zzso coli zzso These findings suggest a potentially extensive zzso zzso including genes transcribed by zzso and zzso which zzso factors involved in protein folding as well as other cellular zzso
