zzso and protein for zzso hormone zzso zzso were demonstrated in abdominal zzso tissue of female zzso There was no expression of the zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was zzso zzso zzso correlations indicted that changes in abdominal fat zzso content were most directly correlated with zzso zzso zzso and the latter was directly correlated with tissue zzso zzso These relationships were consistent with zzso inducing zzso zzso expression and with the finding that zzso influenced the zzso of zzso in zzso a novel role for the zzso Chicken zzso responded zzso to doubling zzso of zzso in zzso zzso expression and quantities of zzso and zzso without zzso effect on zzso zzso exposed to zzso more rapidly acquired zzso zzso Treatment of young chickens with chicken zzso (4 zzso zzso days zzso did not significantly decrease live weight but increased zzso weight by zzso zzso as a percentage of live weight by zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso by zzso (2 h after zzso In cells zzso by zzso genes related to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed zzso compared with no zzso Several pathways of retinal and fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression in abdominal zzso tissue of zzso Several genes involved in fatty acid and retinal metabolism and the zzso signaling zzso mediate this novel function of zzso
