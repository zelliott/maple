We have recently shown that stimulation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso component of zzso by a complex of human soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulates the ex zzso expansion as well as zzso of human zzso cells in the presence of stem cell factor zzso Here we show that zzso zzso enhanced the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso cells in zzso suspension culture supplemented with zzso and zzso The zzso complex also zzso acted with zzso and zzso zzso on the generation of zzso from zzso cells, whereas the zzso of zzso alone with zzso was barely zzso zzso the addition of zzso to the combination of zzso + zzso also supported a substantial number of zzso colonies from zzso cells in zzso zzso culture, whereas zzso + zzso in the absence of zzso rarely induced zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso against zzso to the suspension and zzso cultures completely zzso the zzso induced by zzso in the presence of zzso whereas an zzso zzso did not, indicating that the observed zzso by zzso is a response to zzso signaling and independent of zzso Furthermore, human zzso cells were zzso into two populations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cells produced a number of zzso as well as zzso colonies in cultures supplemented with zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells generated much less zzso and lacked zzso colony forming activity under the same zzso zzso the present results indicate that most of the human zzso zzso do not express zzso and that zzso zzso the responsiveness of human zzso zzso to zzso Together with the presence of functional zzso in human serum and relative zzso of human zzso zzso to zzso in zzso current results suggest that the role of zzso may be mainly zzso by zzso and that the zzso signaling initiated by the zzso zzso complex is involved in human zzso in zzso
