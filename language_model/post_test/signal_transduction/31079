zzso stimulates contraction of airway smooth muscle, but the mechanism is widely considered zzso depending on release of zzso zzso from mast cells and zzso The goal was to determine whether zzso by itself, directly regulates calcium signaling in human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso cultures of zzso from normal subjects were loaded with zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso were determined zzso by imaging single zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso transient increases in zzso In contrast, there were no calcium responses to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso selective zzso at zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso toxin zzso In other experiments, zzso zzso calcium zzso in the absence of zzso zzso but not when cells were zzso in zzso acid or zzso to empty zzso calcium zzso zzso responses were attenuated by zzso C and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso It was concluded that stimulation of zzso zzso receptors on zzso rapidly zzso zzso calcium stores by a mechanism dependent on zzso G zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that, in addition to its well-established indirect effects on zzso zzso also has direct effects on zzso signaling zzso
