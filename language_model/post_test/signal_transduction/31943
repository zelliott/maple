During the early stages of seed development many genes are under dynamic regulation to ensure the proper differentiation and establishment of the tissue that will constitute the mature zzso To investigate how zzso regulation contributes to this process in zzso a combination of small zzso and zzso zzso analyses were used to identify zzso and their zzso 

Our analysis identified 84 known zzso and 7 new zzso together with 96 putative zzso target genes regulated through a slicing mechanism in grain zzso during the first zzso post zzso We also identified many potential zzso including several belonging to known zzso zzso Our data gave us evidence for an increase in zzso regulation during the transition between zzso and storage zzso Potential zzso targets were found in various zzso pathways including components of four zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response to powdery zzso zzso Among the putative zzso targets we identified were two essential genes controlling the zzso response, a zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso the last step of zzso zzso We found that two zzso genes are potentially zzso zzso establishing a direct link between zzso and the R gene zzso 

Our zzso provides a useful source of information on zzso regulation during the early development of cereal grains and our analysis suggests that zzso contribute to the control of development of the cereal zzso notably through the regulation of zzso response zzso
