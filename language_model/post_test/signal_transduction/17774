The classical zzso model of zzso zzso induction and more recent modifications together propose that an zzso signaling activity is zzso distributed across the vegetal half of the zzso zzso and that this activity contributes to zzso zzso In support of this, we have previously shown that the zzso element zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso activated across the vegetal half of zzso zzso Here, we further examine the nature of this activity by measuring DE zzso by zzso signals over zzso We find that the zzso pattern of DE zzso is much more dynamic than was previously appreciated and also conclude that zzso activity reflects zzso zzso signaling in the zzso Using both the zzso construct and zzso zzso and zzso expression as zzso for zzso activity, and the zzso version of zzso zzso to regionally suppress zzso zzso activity, we demonstrate that zzso signals act zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells are unable to rescue either reporter gene zzso or target gene expression in distant zzso cells, suggesting that zzso function at short range in this zzso Finally, we show that DE zzso by zzso signals occurs in the absence of zzso zzso zzso but that the timing of zzso initiation is zzso We conclude that zzso signals in zzso zzso function cell autonomously at short ranges and that the zzso pattern of this signaling along the zzso axis is regulated by maternal zzso zzso
