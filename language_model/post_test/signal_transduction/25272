The zzso nuclear pore complex zzso harbors an approximately zzso diameter diffusion channel that is large enough to admit zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso properties of the zzso zzso nuclear envelope zzso using import zzso and export zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso Compared with zzso passive export rates of a classical zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were significantly faster in zzso and zzso zzso Similar results were obtained using two other zzso reporters, containing either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso import, but had no effect on the import of zzso Thus, the role of zzso in zzso import may be zzso or targeting zzso zzso zzso limits for the diffusion channel were assessed in zzso using zzso reporters of zzso zzso and were found to be greater than zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso are involved in establishing the functional resting diameter of the zzso central transport zzso
