zzso of zzso zzso to its zzso on zzso cells activates the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso and regulates expression of zzso and zzso zzso However, it remains unknown whether these two pathways cooperate in the generation of zzso responses or function zzso and whether zzso zzso distinct downstream signals in response to zzso or zzso growth factor zzso zzso Our data show that in response to zzso treatment, zzso functions selectively as a zzso protein for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not the zzso domain of zzso which is engaged during zzso zzso In studies with zzso human zzso cells and zzso mouse zzso cells, which are zzso we found that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso does not require the function of the zzso Furthermore, zzso cells are responsive to the protective effect of zzso against zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso cells were resistant to the growth zzso effect of zzso but this effect was not zzso by expression of zzso or zzso alone in zzso zzso Taken altogether these data show that: zzso The zzso zzso common and distinct signals in response to zzso or zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso operates separately from the zzso and its function is not essential for the generation of the zzso effect of zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso alone are sufficient to mediate the zzso effects of zzso in zzso cells, and additional signaling elements are zzso
