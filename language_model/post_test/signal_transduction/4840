zzso zzso relaxation plays an important role in the regulation of vascular zzso zzso vascular relaxation is reduced in various disease states and zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso is impaired in zzso hypertension due to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso relaxation was determined in small zzso arteries from zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso To exclude zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso relaxation responses were determined in the presence of zzso and zzso NO zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation was reduced in arteries from zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso did not abolish the difference in zzso relaxation between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation was similar between the zzso The zzso of zzso channels zzso plus zzso or zzso channels zzso reduced zzso relaxation only in zzso rats and abolished the relaxation differences between the zzso The expression of zzso channel was decreased in zzso zzso The expression of zzso channel zzso zzso was increased whereas the expression of zzso channel zzso zzso was decreased in zzso zzso The expression of zzso for activated C zzso 1 zzso which is a binding protein for zzso channel and zzso zzso its activity, was increased in zzso zzso These results suggest that the impairment of zzso relaxation in zzso zzso arteries may be attributable to altered zzso and/or zzso channels activities rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity may be due to the imbalance between its zzso expressions and zzso zzso
