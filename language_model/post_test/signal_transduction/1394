One of the hallmarks of the aging process is the zzso of oxidized zzso zzso the zzso of oxidized proteins is one of the key factors in the aging zzso zzso proteins are normally repaired or zzso by the zzso zzso This system is the most important zzso protein degradation machinery, responsible for the degradation of oxidized zzso For unknown reasons the removal of oxidized proteins is disturbed in aged zzso This leads to the zzso of zzso zzso Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the changes in the zzso system and the interference with these zzso
