A new model was developed to study zzso regulation and zzso in whole blood ex zzso The model is characterized by stable zzso counts and high zzso viability throughout the experimental zzso zzso consumption per time decreased slowly, whereas carbon dioxide partial pressure increased accordingly throughout the zzso In this model, the zzso effects of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso were examined and compared by measuring their ability to inhibit the release and zzso levels of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the release of zzso zzso and zzso in a potent and zzso manner, but did not influence the zzso levels of these zzso in zzso zzso Also, zzso and zzso inhibited the release of zzso and zzso in a potent and zzso manner, however, stronger zzso zzso of zzso zzso than of zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso seemed to have both zzso and zzso effects on plasma values of zzso The effects of 10 zzso zzso showed to be zzso through the zzso zzso since blood treated with a zzso zzso zzso did not produce any zzso The whole blood model described in this study is in our opinion a useful tool for investigating zzso effects on a mixed white blood cell zzso
