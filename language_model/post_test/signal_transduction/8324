A significant proportion of hearing loss and deafness is caused by defects in the structure or function of cells within the organ of zzso Identification of the molecular factors that regulate the development of this structure should provide valuable insights regarding inner ear formation and the signaling pathways that zzso zzso auditory zzso In addition, targeted zzso of these same factors could be developed as therapies for hair cell zzso 

zzso from experiments using transgenic and zzso mice, as well as zzso techniques, have identified genes and signaling pathways that are required to either specify unique auditory cell types, such as hair cells or supporting cells, or to generate the highly ordered cellular pattern that is characteristic for the organ of zzso In particular, the zzso and zzso growth factor signaling pathways zzso the formation of the zzso cells that will give rise to the organ of zzso zzso containing gene 2, a zzso factor that is required for the formation of the cochlear zzso cell population, has paradoxically been shown to also act as an inhibitor of hair cell zzso Finally, the motor protein zzso II regulates extension of the organ of zzso and the alignment of hair cells and supporting cells into ordered zzso 

A better understanding of the signaling pathways that direct different aspects of cochlear development, such as specific of cell fates or cellular zzso offers the potential to identify new pathways or molecules that could be targeted for therapeutic zzso
