We tested the hypothesis that female and male mice differ in terms of cardiac zzso after zzso zzso zzso hypertension zzso and zzso saline in drinking water) and focused on zzso zzso We excluded zzso effects of blood pressure zzso or sex-related blood pressure differences by treating zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso in drinking zzso We found that directly measured mean zzso blood pressure was lowered to control values with zzso and zzso this finding in separate mouse groups with zzso Male mice were more responsive to zzso zzso They developed more left zzso zzso and more zzso zzso after 6 weeks of zzso compared with female zzso In hearts, transcripts for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso interacting protein 1 were zzso in male but not in female zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso as indicated by diminished zzso of zzso in male mice, accounted for this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses were also zzso in male mice, as shown by higher transcript levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso Our results support zzso regulation of the zzso zzso in response to largely blood zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso determines the zzso cardiac and zzso zzso responses and accompanying organ injury in male zzso
