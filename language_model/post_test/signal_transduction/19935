zzso zzso has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in zzso zzso and repair zzso We report a zzso zzso survey of zzso changes after ultraviolet zzso identifying numerous zzso and zzso zzso sites on known components of zzso zzso as well as on proteins not previously implicated in this zzso Our results uncover a critical role for zzso factor zzso zzso zzso during DNA zzso During zzso S phase, zzso zzso is modified by double zzso of zzso 15 and 24 zzso through zzso zzso zzso blocks trigger zzso zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso bypass of zzso zzso by allowing recruitment of zzso DNA synthesis zzso zzso to zzso zzso at stalled zzso Our findings demonstrate widespread involvement of zzso zzso in zzso responses and identify a critical function for dynamic zzso zzso in safeguarding zzso integrity when DNA replication is zzso
