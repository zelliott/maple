The zzso between zzso signaling and zzso is emerging as a powerful and highly regulated way to gauge cellular energy and zzso zzso The aim of the current study was to determine the mechanism by which exercise training reverses zzso insulin resistance and the role of zzso signaling axis in zzso this response in skeletal zzso Our results showed that high-fat feeding resulted in decreased zzso zzso which was associated with decreased zzso expression and increased intramuscular zzso deposition in the skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso in zzso metabolism were accompanied by increased total protein and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso Exercise training reversed these zzso resulting in improved serum zzso profiles and zzso zzso zzso zzso were exposed to zzso resulting in an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with a significant increase in the level of zzso of zzso on zzso All these changes were reversed by zzso of zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso by compound C induced an enhanced zzso of both zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso showed no effect on zzso zzso in both the absence and presence of zzso cultured zzso In addition, compound C led to an elevated zzso zzso but was blocked by zzso zzso In zzso exercise training zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into the mechanism by which zzso signaling axis mediates the zzso process of zzso insulin zzso
