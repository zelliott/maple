The basis of gender differences in the prevalence and clinical progression of multiple sclerosis zzso is not zzso Here, we identify zzso responses in steroid synthesis and signaling in the brains of zzso patients as possible contributors to these zzso We investigated gene expression changes in these pathways and of inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso and zzso white matter zzso of male and female patients zzso and control zzso zzso using quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso and 14 control zzso and zzso zzso sections per zzso In zzso zzso in zzso there was local zzso of zzso (an zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso whereas in zzso there was local zzso of zzso a zzso synthetic zzso and of zzso zzso zzso in the rim and center of zzso zzso were found to be the primary source of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were positively correlated with that of zzso in primary cultures of human zzso and zzso zzso caused increased zzso suggesting that inflammatory signals stimulate zzso signaling in this cell zzso Together, these findings suggest that there are gender differences in the zzso of zzso patients that may affect zzso zzso that is, in zzso zzso synthesis and signaling are zzso whereas in zzso zzso synthesis and signaling are zzso These differences may represent contributing factors to gender differences in the prevalence and course of zzso
