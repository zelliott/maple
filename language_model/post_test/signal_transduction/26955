B cells obtain help from T cells in the zzso response by acting as zzso zzso presenting zzso A direct signal through binding of zzso to membrane zzso can enhance B cell zzso presentation and zzso B cell zzso but is not required for a productive interaction between a small resting B cell and a differentiated helper T zzso As a result of helper T cell recognition of zzso on the B cell surface, the T cell becomes activated and in turn activates the B zzso T cell help has two zzso zzso which act as growth and differentiation factors for B cells, and additional signals which require cell contact and enable B cells to respond to zzso zzso help activity is regulated like zzso synthesis and zzso Because contact help activity is retained by zzso activated helper T cells and plasma zzso prepared from activated T cells, contact help is likely to be zzso to new proteins expressed as zzso zzso or zzso zzso on helper T zzso Once zzso contact help can be delivered to B cells independently of recognition of zzso II zzso A newly identified zzso zzso of helper T cells, a zzso for the B cell differentiation zzso zzso is a key component of contact zzso The roles of other T and B cell membrane molecules in contact help are zzso
