We used the zzso technique to study the effect of zzso acid zzso on zzso Na channels zzso in the rat cortical collecting duct zzso Application of 10 zzso AA decreased the zzso activity defined by zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso curve of the AA effect on zzso shows that 2 zzso AA inhibited the zzso activity by zzso The effect of AA on zzso is specific because neither zzso acid zzso a zzso analogue of zzso nor zzso acid zzso the zzso effect of AA on zzso Moreover, zzso of either zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso failed to abolish the effect of AA on zzso In contrast, the zzso effect of AA on zzso was absent in the presence of zzso zzso an agent that zzso zzso zzso The notion that the zzso effect of AA is zzso by zzso zzso is also supported by the observation that application of 200 zzso zzso acid zzso inhibited zzso in the zzso In contrast, addition of zzso zzso or zzso failed to decrease zzso zzso Also, application of zzso can still reduce zzso activity in the presence of zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, gas zzso mass zzso analysis detected the presence of zzso in the zzso and zzso is expressed in the principal cells of the zzso We conclude that AA zzso zzso activity in the zzso and that the effect of AA is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
