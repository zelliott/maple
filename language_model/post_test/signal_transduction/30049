Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been shown by zzso analysis of zzso to mediate zzso signaling in zzso zzso Here we report zzso detection of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells enabling assessment of the cellular content of the zzso We obtain 9 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules per cell in zzso cells of the zzso strain 495, a higher value than that for functional zzso cellular content estimated previously from zzso zzso and retinal extraction zzso zzso our ability to control the zzso ratio by transformation with zzso zzso zzso we report analysis of the zzso and zzso roles in the zzso response of the zzso by action zzso with automated cell zzso zzso The results show that zzso and zzso each mediate the zzso swimming response, a second known zzso zzso behavior in zzso zzso Due to the different light zzso and spectral properties of the two zzso zzso is zzso responsible for zzso responses, which appear at high light zzso
