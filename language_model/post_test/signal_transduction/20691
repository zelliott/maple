In guinea-pig gallbladder zzso zzso converts zzso zzso zzso into an zzso zzso The effects of blood side zzso (5 zzso on zzso transport were investigated in zzso using zzso and zzso clamp techniques to determine zzso zzso of zzso and zzso electrical zzso zzso not zzso addition of zzso elevated zzso current zzso zzso potential difference, and tissue zzso it inhibited the zzso zzso flux while leaving the zzso flux zzso The zzso effect of zzso was inhibited or prevented by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso appeared to release a neurotransmitter that gives rise to zzso synthesis sufficient to turn part of zzso zzso zzso zzso In a search for the involved zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso largely and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso entirely failed to antagonize the zzso effect of zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to mimic the action of zzso and zzso effects of zzso were small and zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso completely transformed zzso zzso into an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed and reduced the zzso responses to zzso and zzso As guinea-pig gallbladder zzso cells possess zzso zzso receptors close to zzso zzso zzso is likely to act by releasing zzso from neural zzso
