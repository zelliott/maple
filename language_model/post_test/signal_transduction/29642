zzso zzso are zzso that zzso modify proteins by attaching zzso groups (from zzso to zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso In so doing, the functional properties of the protein zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso signals from the cell membrane into the interior of the zzso Such signals include not only those arising from zzso interactions but also environmental zzso such as when the membrane zzso mechanical deformation zzso cell stretch or zzso zzso Ultimately, the zzso of signaling pathways that use protein zzso often culminates in the zzso of gene expression through the direct regulation of zzso factors or through the regulation of zzso stability or protein zzso zzso zzso regulate most aspects of normal cellular zzso The zzso dysfunction of protein zzso signaling pathways zzso the molecular basis of many zzso and of several manifestations of cardiovascular disease, such as zzso and other types of left zzso zzso zzso injury, zzso and zzso Given their roles in such a wide variety of disease states, protein zzso are rapidly becoming extremely attractive targets for drug discovery, probably second only to zzso G zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso Here, we will review the reasons for this explosion in interest in zzso of protein zzso and will describe the process of identifying novel drugs directed against zzso We will specifically focus on disease states for which drug development has proceeded to the point of clinical or advanced zzso zzso
