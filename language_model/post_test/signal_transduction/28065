zzso oxide has emerged as a ubiquitous signaling zzso zzso diverse zzso zzso including cardiovascular zzso and its zzso in zzso Recent insights into molecular mechanisms regulating zzso oxide generation and the rich diversity of mechanisms by which it zzso signals reveal the role of this simple gas as a principle zzso of systems integration of oxygen zzso 

The molecular lexicon by which zzso oxide zzso signals encompasses the elements of zzso modification of proteins by zzso zzso of transition metal centers and free zzso zzso and zzso precision and specificity of signal zzso amplification, and propagation are orchestrated by dynamic assembly of zzso complexes zzso zzso oxide production to upstream and downstream components in specific zzso zzso The concept of local zzso signaling by zzso oxide over zzso distances for short zzso has expanded to include zzso effects over zzso spatial and zzso zzso From these insights emerges a role for zzso oxide in zzso system responses controlling oxygen supply and demand to defend cell integrity in the face of zzso zzso In this context, zzso oxide coordinates the respiratory cycle to acquire and deliver oxygen to target zzso by regulating zzso function and vascular smooth muscle zzso and matches energy supply and demand by zzso zzso functions while shifting metabolism to zzso energy zzso 

zzso into mechanisms regulating zzso oxide production and signaling and their integration into responses zzso zzso place into specific relief the role of those processes in zzso Indeed, zzso dysfunction associated with altered production of zzso oxide regulating tissue integrity contributes to the zzso underlying zzso Moreover, this central role in zzso identifies zzso oxide signaling as a key target for novel therapeutic interventions to minimize irreversible tissue damage associated with zzso cardiovascular zzso
