P zzso zzso occurs via the highly zzso zzso pathway, and assembly is monitored by the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consist of an zzso extension followed by an incomplete zzso fold that is missing a zzso seventh beta zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso fold of each zzso is completed by the zzso extension of its zzso zzso that do not get incorporated into the zzso fiber are driven zzso In this study, we found that zzso was the only zzso zzso P zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure by zzso zzso within the zzso or swapping its zzso extension with that of other zzso altered the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso properties of the new zzso were dictated by the specific zzso extension provided and were consistent with the order of the zzso in the zzso zzso However, these zzso properties did not directly correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso instead correlated with the presence or absence of an zzso extension in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extension of zzso was sufficient to abolish zzso zzso Replacement of an zzso extension at either the zzso or zzso zzso restored zzso zzso Thus, the data presented in this study argue that zzso has features inherent in its structure or during its folding that act as specific zzso of zzso signal zzso
