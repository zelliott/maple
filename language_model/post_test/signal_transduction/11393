zzso zzso exposure occurs frequently as a result of clinical use or drug zzso Research using different zzso cell lines, and animal models in the past three decades has zzso some correlation between the zzso events and behavioral changes resulting from zzso zzso dependence and zzso For the most part, zzso tolerance and dependence are associated with zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and by the altered zzso of zzso receptors to zzso G zzso zzso changes in signal zzso following prolonged zzso exposure are zzso by protein zzso systems, such as protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Intermediate steps between zzso zzso zzso and the second- or zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso trafficking, as well as interactions with zzso zzso acid receptors and regulation of zzso oxide zzso Thus, prolonged occupancy by zzso zzso zzso can have differential effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso which contribute to the development of zzso tolerance and zzso We discuss the role of various protein zzso in the signaling mechanisms underlying these zzso zzso understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso tolerance and dependence will help in the treatment of patients suffering from acute and chronic pain, or drug dependence and zzso
