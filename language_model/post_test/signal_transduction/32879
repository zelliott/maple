The pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso proliferation in zzso breast cancer zzso However, the interactions of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling have not been zzso Here, we studied the effects of zzso zzso on zzso signal zzso in zzso breast cancer cells and in zzso clones zzso either the zzso or its 2 major zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso and zzso growth in all studied cells in a zzso manner; however, the clones with the greatest zzso zzso were clearly least sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso we found that the zzso reduced zzso expression and zzso zzso in several cell lines in the presence or absence of zzso Moreover, in zzso cells, zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on zzso protein expression were not zzso however, the drug suppressed zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression and zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso binding were not influenced by zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso may represent one of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso the growth of breast cancer zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in breast tumors could contribute to the development of zzso zzso
