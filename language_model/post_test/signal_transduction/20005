Cold zzso increases plant tolerance to a zzso chilling and in this process an zzso of zzso in plants is often zzso To examine the role of zzso in cold zzso in plants, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso state, gas exchange and zzso zzso were analyzed after cold zzso at zzso and during the subsequent chilling at zzso in tomato zzso zzso zzso Cold zzso modestly elevated the levels of zzso the gene expression of respiratory burst zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso activity, leading to the zzso of the expression and activity of zzso zzso In zzso plants chilling caused a continuous rise in the zzso content, an increase in the zzso zzso content and in the oxidized zzso state of zzso followed by reductions in the zzso zzso rate and the maximum quantum yield of zzso II zzso However, in zzso plants zzso zzso membrane zzso and reductions in the zzso zzso rate were significantly zzso Furthermore, a treatment with an zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso scavenger before the plants subjected to the cold zzso abolished the cold zzso beneficial effects on photosynthesis and zzso zzso leading to a loss of the cold zzso tolerance against zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso generated by zzso zzso in the zzso of plant cells plays a crucial role in cold zzso chilling zzso
