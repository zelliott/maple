To investigate the mechanism how zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human primary zzso cells zzso Human zzso and zzso isolated from zzso and zzso of zzso zzso patients were cultured with zzso fetal bovine serum media or serum free media before treatment with zzso zzso or zzso tissue growth factor zzso The expression of zzso was detected using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess the activity of zzso zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso in zzso This induction can be zzso by zzso and was observed to persist for at least 48 zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso expression through multiple zzso First of all, zzso was able to inhibit zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso the zzso was also indirectly due to zzso zzso Finally, zzso was able to induce zzso and in turn zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could prevent zzso from progression with the anabolic ability to induce zzso production to maintain zzso zzso zzso integrity and to down regulate zzso zzso and the zzso ability to induce zzso zzso of zzso zzso production to inhibit zzso leading to avoid zzso zzso Because zzso zzso expressed in zzso might play a significantly important role in early phase of zzso zzso repression by zzso zzso or other agents might be an ideal therapeutic target to prevent zzso from zzso
