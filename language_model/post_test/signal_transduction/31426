The signaling state of the zzso zzso yellow protein is the zzso intermediate zzso The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the transient zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The formation of zzso from zzso is accompanied by a major zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso and of the zzso were measured by transient zzso zzso from pH zzso to zzso zzso value decomposition zzso analysis of the data at pH 7 showed the presence of three zzso distinguishable zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their zzso were determined using the zzso difference zzso zzso and zzso have electronic zzso zzso with zzso at 370 zzso 5 and 350 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso of the signaling state is thus associated with a change in the environment of the zzso zzso The time courses of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined from the zzso transient zzso changes at each zzso assuming that their zzso are zzso After the formation of zzso ( approximately 2 zzso these three zzso are in equilibrium and zzso together to the initial dark zzso The equilibrium between zzso and zzso is pH dependent with a zzso of zzso and with zzso the main species above this zzso zzso of the pH dependence of the zzso zzso with a second flash of zzso zzso at a delay of 20 zzso confirm this zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso with reversal times of approximately 55 zzso and several hundred zzso zzso The corresponding signal zzso are pH dependent with a zzso of approximately zzso zzso from zzso dominates above the zzso The transient zzso of zzso the active state of zzso yellow zzso is thus controlled by the zzso zzso The rate constant zzso for the recovery to the initial dark state also has a zzso of approximately zzso This equality of the equilibrium and kinetic zzso values is not accidental and suggests that zzso is zzso to zzso
