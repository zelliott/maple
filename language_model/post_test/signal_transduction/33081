zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins that direct patterning at multiple stages in both zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso by the cells of the zzso compartment of each zzso zzso activates zzso of wingless zzso zzso zzso and patched zzso in the cells immediately adjacent to zzso zzso zzso signaling is thought to involve the segment polarity gene zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger protein of the zzso family of zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso expressing zzso Here we demonstrate zzso activity is both necessary and sufficient to drive expression of zzso genes in the zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso DNA binding protein that drives zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter are necessary for this zzso zzso These data taken together provide strong evidence that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
