zzso cortical zzso zzso is a rare, sporadic disorder which is a zzso cause of chronic zzso It is proposed to result from zzso zzso migration and differentiation and has characteristic zzso features which include disturbed cortical zzso large abnormal zzso and the presence of large balloon cells with glassy zzso zzso and zzso eccentric zzso These latter express both zzso and zzso markers indicative of abnormal zzso zzso In this paper we review the current literature on the zzso of zzso and discuss potential zzso We focus on growth factors, zzso pathways and candidate genes with known roles in zzso and zzso brain development that could be responsible for the zzso brain changes seen in zzso At issue are the factors that influence cell fate and differentiation and which regulate neural zzso Some of the molecular zzso such as those involving the zzso and the zzso pathways have particularly important roles in zzso differentiation in zzso and these are proposed as potential zzso
