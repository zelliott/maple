zzso zzso factor zzso an zzso family zzso is zzso in response to different types of retinal stress and has zzso activity through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and sustained zzso of zzso in both the zzso and retinal pigmented zzso zzso Here, we tested whether zzso zzso zzso within the zzso can zzso zzso the central zzso in the visual cycle that provides the zzso zzso to zzso in zzso We generated conditional zzso mice to specifically delete zzso or zzso in zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso After zzso injection of zzso we analyzed the expression levels of visual cycle genes and zzso zzso activity of zzso levels of zzso zzso and the rates of dark adaptation and zzso zzso We found that zzso protein levels and zzso activity were reduced and recovery of zzso zzso was delayed in zzso zzso In mice with functional zzso signaling in the zzso zzso protein was also reduced by zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso required a functional zzso cascade intrinsic to zzso Our data demonstrate that a single zzso zzso can simultaneously and independently affect both zzso and zzso through the same signaling cascade to reduce the generation and zzso of zzso
