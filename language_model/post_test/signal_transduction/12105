In the present study, we isolated zzso from zzso zzso and investigated the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and phase 2 zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1, in a cultured cell line from normal rat liver, zzso 9 zzso Exposure of zzso 9 cells to zzso resulted in the significant induction of zzso and phase 2 zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso studies using a zzso reporter construct demonstrated that the induction of zzso and phase 2 zzso by zzso was caused through the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso response zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso accelerated the zzso of a potentially toxic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso was a novel zzso of zzso and phase 2 zzso and zzso might exhibit zzso zzso
