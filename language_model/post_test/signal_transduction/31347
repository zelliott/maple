zzso zzso coli zzso zzso is responsible for causing outbreaks of bloody zzso and zzso syndrome throughout the zzso The locus of zzso zzso zzso consists of five major zzso and is required for the formation of attaching and zzso zzso that disrupt zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported that expression of zzso LEE genes is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene in zzso affects the production of zzso 3 zzso which activates the zzso zzso and zzso also activate the LEE in a manner similar to that of zzso Previous studies of zzso regulation of LEE zzso have thus far been restricted to using reporter systems in an zzso coli K-12 zzso Here, we examined the zzso of LEE gene transcription, protein zzso and function of the LEE type III zzso apparatus in zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that the zzso zzso had diminished zzso from the LEE promoters during the zzso growth zzso decreased protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso and reduced zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso also caused a delay in the formation of attaching and zzso zzso on cultured zzso cells compared to the wild zzso zzso enhanced LEE expression in both the zzso and the zzso zzso but the zzso still exhibited greater LEE zzso The results suggest a possible synergistic relationship between zzso and zzso The combined effects of these two signaling molecules may lead to greater LEE expression and a more efficient zzso
