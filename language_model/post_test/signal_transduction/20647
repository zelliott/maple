zzso cancer is a rare zzso for which current pharmacological therapies are still zzso We tested the effect of a novel zzso zzso - zzso target of zzso dual inhibitor zzso on proliferation of the zzso zzso cancer cell line in zzso and grown as zzso in zzso zzso zzso was able to significantly inhibit zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein in zzso cells and to significantly reduce their proliferation in zzso and zzso growth in zzso The drug also induced zzso of zzso zzso which could be inhibited by simultaneous treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso This latter drug zzso with zzso in the zzso of zzso proliferation in zzso Our data suggest that dual zzso zzso may represent a useful pharmacological tool in the therapy of advanced zzso cancer and that simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso - zzso pathways may be required to obtain a higher zzso effect in this type of zzso
