zzso protein belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso whose members are usually regulated by growth factors to form a negative feedback zzso zzso fluctuations of zzso zzso in response to single growth factors have been zzso In this report, we investigate zzso protein levels and show that in zzso cell lung zzso cells, the expression levels are unaffected by the serum content in the cellular zzso Although cells harboring zzso zzso express insignificant higher zzso levels, zzso expression of zzso active Ras in normal human lung zzso fails to augment zzso protein zzso Furthermore, serum zzso for zzso has no influence on zzso expression and addition of serum or of singular growth factors leaves zzso protein levels zzso Cell cycle analysis reveals that zzso levels remain constant throughout the whole cell zzso These data demonstrate that zzso expression is not connected with zzso signaling and cell zzso
