zzso advances have been made recently in our understanding of the signaling pathways that control cellular growth, zzso and zzso These processes are regulated by zzso stimuli such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which trigger a series of zzso events culminating in the zzso of specific zzso zzso are a highly zzso group of zzso factors that are activated by various pathways and regulate many of the genes controlling cellular zzso zzso are activated by zzso zzso and modulated by zzso zzso placing them at a convergence point for numerous zzso signaling zzso Given the importance of zzso in the control of normal zzso zzso it is not surprising that inappropriate zzso of these proteins has been found in human zzso A number of distinct mechanisms have been zzso by which zzso are activated zzso including zzso or zzso stimulation of normal receptors and increased activity of zzso zzso through enhanced zzso zzso or the presence of zzso zzso Furthermore, inappropriate zzso zzso zzso has been found in several tumors as zzso The increased understanding of signaling pathways in tumors can be translated into therapeutic strategies that have the potential to be more selective and less toxic than current zzso zzso zzso which may be effective include the development of zzso of receptors that can trigger zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso that zzso and activate zzso agents that decrease zzso levels or inhibit their recruitment to zzso and molecules that can prevent the binding of zzso to target DNA zzso Thus, zzso of cellular and zzso processes in tumors has enhanced our understanding of the zzso of zzso and may provide the basis for significant advances in zzso
