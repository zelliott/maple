A hypothesis of the mechanisms by which the protein zzso agents trigger zzso of zzso cells and proliferation of other cell types is zzso It is assumed that both effects are triggered by zzso of receptors on cell surface, which results from their zzso This idea is substantiated by the example of one of these agents, zzso zzso As in the case of zzso agents, such as, zzso and growth factors, the zzso of receptors induced by radiation activates zzso protein zzso zzso from which the signal is zzso to genes through protein zzso zzso The hypothesis is consistent with the relationship between these effects and the zzso signal zzso zzso and its zzso after zzso
