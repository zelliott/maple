zzso smoking decreases body weight, whereas molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been zzso In this report, we investigated regulation of zzso by cigarette smoke and involvement of zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that cigarette smoke extract zzso inhibited differentiation of zzso into zzso dose zzso It was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso blunted expression of zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso and sustained expression of a zzso marker zzso zzso markedly induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reproduced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Furthermore, knockout of the zzso gene or blockade of zzso by a zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso We also found that zzso induced zzso stress in zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso reproduced the zzso effect of zzso on the differentiation of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso did not cause zzso stress, and zzso stress zzso did not activate zzso These results suggested that cigarette smoke has the potential to inhibit zzso differentiation via zzso independent mechanisms, zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso and induction of the unfolded protein zzso
