In addition to the physical barrier of the stratum zzso zzso innate immunity also includes the release of various zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso recruitment and zzso of zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso form an innate zzso chemical zzso which provides a front-line component in innate immunity to inhibit microbial invasion; however, this might be an zzso of the diverse functions of these zzso In fact, apart from exhibiting a broad spectrum of zzso properties, it is increasingly evident that zzso display additional activities that are related to the stimulation and zzso of the zzso immune zzso These diverse functions include zzso and zzso of immune and/or inflammatory cells, the production and release of zzso and zzso acceleration of zzso promotion of wound healing, zzso of harmful microbial products, and bridging of both innate and zzso zzso Thus, better understanding of the functions of zzso in skin and identification of their signaling mechanisms may offer new strategies for the development of potential zzso for the treatment of zzso and/or zzso skin zzso Here, we briefly outline the structure, regulation of zzso and zzso roles of principal zzso zzso
