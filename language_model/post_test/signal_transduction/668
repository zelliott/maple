In the past, zzso acids were considered to be just zzso molecules derived from cholesterol in the zzso They were known to be important for the zzso of cholesterol in the gallbladder and for stimulating the zzso of cholesterol, zzso zzso and lipids from the zzso However, during the last two decades, it has been discovered that zzso acids are regulatory zzso zzso acids have been discovered to activate specific nuclear receptors zzso X zzso zzso X zzso and vitamin D zzso G protein coupled zzso zzso zzso and cell signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso and zzso zzso in cells in the liver and gastrointestinal zzso zzso of nuclear receptors and cell signaling pathways alter the expression of numerous genes zzso zzso involved in the regulation of zzso acid, zzso fatty acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and energy zzso They also play a role in the regulation of serum zzso levels in humans and zzso zzso acids appear to function as zzso signaling molecules primarily during the zzso cycle as there is a flux of these molecules returning from the zzso to the liver following a zzso In this review, we will zzso the current knowledge of how zzso acids regulate zzso zzso and zzso metabolism through the zzso of specific nuclear receptors and cell signaling zzso
