zzso zzso by using zzso zzso pattern information of zzso is currently the only method that can give accurate, detailed zzso of all zzso zzso in the central metabolism of a zzso In essence, it zzso to a constrained zzso problem which zzso a weighted distance between measured and simulated zzso zzso such as existence of multiple local zzso zzso and zzso make this problem a special zzso 

In the present work, we propose an zzso global zzso zzso taking advantage of the convex feature of the zzso solution zzso Based on the characteristics of convex spaces, specialized initial population and evolutionary operators are designed to solve zzso zzso flux zzso problem robustly and zzso The zzso was applied to estimate the central zzso zzso in zzso coli and compared with conventional zzso zzso Experimental results illustrated that our zzso is capable of achieving fast convergence to good zzso and maintaining the robust nature of evolutionary zzso at the same zzso
