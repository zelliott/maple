Nuclear factor zzso B zzso is an essential regulator of gene zzso for hundreds of zzso including many critically involved in zzso zzso complexes containing zzso generally activate zzso zzso while those with zzso activate zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso binding by zzso is zzso elevated in human zzso melanoma cultures relative to normal zzso Here we extended our investigation to zzso analysis of human tissue zzso We found that zzso expression is significantly elevated in zzso of human zzso and zzso relative to normal skin, but expression of its inhibitor zzso is significantly lower in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso specific for the nuclear zzso signal of zzso also showed significantly increased zzso in zzso melanoma zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso we also found that zzso is zzso at zzso zzso and this activated form accumulates in the zzso of zzso This suggests that increased expression and zzso of zzso occurs at the stage of the benign zzso but zzso is able to zzso zzso in the zzso and regulate zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso against zzso show a progressive increase in zzso from zzso to zzso However, zzso for zzso which primarily zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso was also progressively increased, and zzso expression was predominantly zzso in zzso These results confirm that the altered expression of zzso found in zzso melanoma cells in tissue culture is relevant to human tumors and offer new insights into the deregulation of zzso zzso
