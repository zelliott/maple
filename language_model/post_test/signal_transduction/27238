To zzso the signal zzso zzso from external stimuli to nuclear gene expression in mechanical zzso cardiac zzso we examined the time course of zzso of protein zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso Mechanical stretch rapidly activated zzso and its zzso zzso was observed at 1-2 zzso after zzso The activity of zzso was also increased by stretch, with a peak at 5 zzso after zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were zzso activated at 8 zzso and at zzso zzso after stretch, zzso Next, the relationship between mechanical zzso zzso and the cardiac zzso system was zzso When the zzso culture medium was transferred to the culture dish of zzso cardiac zzso the medium activated zzso activity slightly but significantly, and the zzso was completely blocked by the type 1 zzso II zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso provoked by stretching zzso was only partially suppressed by zzso with zzso These results suggest that mechanical stress activates the protein zzso cascade of zzso in cardiac zzso in the order of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso II, which is zzso from stretched zzso activates a part of these protein zzso
