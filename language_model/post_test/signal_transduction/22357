zzso protein 6 zzso is a zzso of zzso and a key regulator of the zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso is zzso within its zzso zzso zzso These zzso motifs are required to recruit zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso two basic components of the zzso destruction zzso On the basis of a zzso small interfering zzso zzso screen and zzso zzso analysis, we show that several zzso zzso protein zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are sufficient and required for the zzso of zzso motifs of zzso External zzso which control the activity of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso growth factor 2 zzso control the choice of the zzso zzso and regulate the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that cells not only recruit one dedicated zzso zzso but rather select their zzso zzso depending on cell type and the external zzso Moreover, direct zzso of zzso by zzso provides a unique point for convergence between zzso signaling and zzso zzso
