We have previously shown that zzso a regulator of zzso transition, is activated in the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of zzso signaling zzso in the maintenance of breast cancer cells zzso to zzso The breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were used in this study; zzso cells were characterized by increased resistance to zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso factor zzso is activated in hypoxic conditions and the zzso activity is supported by zzso a regulator of zzso zzso The activated zzso regulates the expression of genes of the cell response to zzso and thus, it maintains the growth of breast cancer in the reduced oxygen zzso The coordinated zzso of zzso proteins in cell may be considered as an important factor of tumor resistance to zzso
