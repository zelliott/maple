zzso a unique cell type in cartilage zzso are responsible for the regulation of anabolic and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulting in suppression of type II collagen zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso with a zzso recovery of type II collagen zzso In the current study, we zzso the mechanism underlying this zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso showing that it requires direct interaction between zzso and zzso We further showed that it involves recruitment of zzso the short zzso form of the zzso factor zzso to zzso by zzso The resulting zzso of zzso zzso activity leads to increased expression of type II zzso zzso and zzso actions are zzso both are necessary for the observed zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels through zzso of Indian zzso zzso signaling also is sufficient to activate zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso complex, zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso this study shows that zzso functions as a nuclear factor that recruits the zzso zzso zzso to zzso to inhibit zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso Finally, zzso cartilage showed elevated levels of zzso and decreased levels of zzso and zzso suggesting that decreased levels of zzso and zzso levels contribute to increased zzso zzso activity during zzso cartilage zzso
