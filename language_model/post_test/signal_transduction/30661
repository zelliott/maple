zzso zzso zzso activities are tightly regulated during zzso and require protein interactions for their spatial and zzso zzso The zzso high mobility group protein zzso is associated with zzso active zzso however its role in regulating gene expression is zzso This report reveals a unique strategy in which, zzso acts as a molecular switch regulating HD zzso zzso The switch zzso the zzso signaling zzso and adds to the diverse functions of zzso A zzso zzso interaction with the zzso HD protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso inactive complex is concentrated to specific nuclear regions primed for active zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso to switch it from a zzso to an zzso zzso Without zzso zzso can physically remove zzso from DNA to inhibit its zzso zzso The zzso regulatory complex acts independently of promoter targets and is a general mechanism for the control of HD zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated and its unique role during zzso is revealed by the early embryonic zzso of zzso zzso zzso This mechanism provides a new role for zzso zzso signaling in regulating HD zzso activity during development using zzso as a molecular zzso
