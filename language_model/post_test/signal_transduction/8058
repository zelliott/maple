zzso plays an important role in the signal zzso of DNA damage response, therefore this study was zzso to explore the relationship between zzso focus formation and DNA zzso breaks zzso caused by zzso zzso in human zzso cells zzso After zzso cells were treated with zzso the drug-induced zzso were assessed by zzso gel zzso zzso the gene zzso levels of zzso were evaluated by zzso the nuclear focus formation of zzso protein was examined using zzso technique, the cell cycle in parallel was analyzed by flow zzso The results showed that the percentage of zzso cells with zzso induced by zzso raised from zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso along with increase of zzso zzso No difference of the zzso zzso level in zzso cells following the treatment with 100 zzso zzso at different times was discovered zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was abundantly and zzso distributed in the zzso of zzso zzso cells outside of zzso however, it formed discrete nuclear zzso following zzso zzso The mean value of nuclear zzso increased by 5 to 20 times following the drug dosing zzso zzso zzso An average of 5 nuclear zzso per positive nucleus were observed at a dose of 2 zzso and it was increased to an average of over 14 nuclear zzso per positive nucleus after treating with zzso 20 zzso The percentage of zzso containing zzso nuclear zzso also increased from less than zzso after treatment zzso zzso 2 zzso to over 50% after zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso following treatment with zzso After zzso cells were treated with 100 zzso zzso for 2 hours and fixed at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours, the percentage of zzso with zzso nuclear zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso (the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at 8 hours, with a subsequent decrease in the percentage of nuclear zzso cells by 24 zzso The ratio of zzso zzso cells at 8 hours after being treated with 100 zzso zzso for 2 hours was zzso zzso zzso and that without 100 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the nuclear focus formation of zzso protein may be a response to DNA damage induced by zzso II inhibitor zzso in human zzso cell line zzso
