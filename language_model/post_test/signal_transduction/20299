We previously demonstrated that animals fed a high-fat zzso diet for 10 weeks developed insulin resistance and zzso zzso We zzso that intervention with zzso would diminish the zzso cognitive deficit by improving insulin zzso 

zzso were trained in an zzso matching and zzso to position task zzso Animals received an zzso zzso of zzso as zzso zzso zzso 24), standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or SC + zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso diet for 10 weeks before zzso Body weight and plasma zzso insulin and zzso were zzso zzso zzso from various brain areas were zzso for zzso in zzso zzso or production of synaptic zzso 

zzso animals developed insulin resistance and an impairment in switching task contingency from matching to zzso zzso zzso attenuated the insulin resistance and weight gain associated with zzso zzso but had no effect on performance in either zzso or zzso zzso No major zzso in proteins associated with insulin zzso or synaptic function was detected in response to zzso diet in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso prevented the zzso but not cognitive zzso associated with zzso zzso The zzso diet protocol did not change zzso insulin zzso in the brain, suggesting that the brain did not develop insulin zzso These findings indicate that zzso diet has deleterious effects on zzso function over and above those related to insulin resistance and suggest that weight loss may not be sufficient to reverse some damaging effects of poor zzso
