The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked to zzso disease as well as zzso to zzso Previously we demonstrated that zzso zzso and function are zzso in mice lacking zzso To investigate the molecular basis for these zzso we conducted zzso expression profiling of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso in zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso normally zzso zzso signaling in zzso we generated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso defects in zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso These defects were also abolished in zzso zzso animals, indicating that zzso may regulate zzso zzso Furthermore, the number of zzso was reduced in aged zzso animals, suggesting that negative feedback zzso of zzso signaling by zzso is necessary to prevent zzso and depletion of the stem cell zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is a powerful negative regulator of zzso stimulation in zzso with an essential role in preserving zzso number and zzso The deleterious effects of excessive zzso signaling may explain how zzso abnormalities arise in patients with inflammatory zzso
