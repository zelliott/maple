zzso receptors zzso zzso immune response is crucial for combating pathogens and must be tightly zzso zzso motif zzso proteins are a family of proteins that is involved in a variety of biological and zzso zzso Some members of the zzso family are important in the regulation of innate zzso Although it has been shown that zzso zzso regulates innate zzso the mechanisms by which it does so have not been fully zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso 3 zzso type I zzso signaling by targeting zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso type I zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso has the reverse zzso We further showed that zzso targets zzso a critical zzso protein downstream of zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and domain mapping experiments show that zzso of zzso interacts with the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso This effect could be inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain of zzso is critical for zzso zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso may act as a novel negative regulator for zzso type I zzso signaling by targeting zzso for zzso
