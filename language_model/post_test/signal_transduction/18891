zzso C zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is exclusively expressed in the central nervous zzso We report that the zzso zzso of zzso core protein enhances zzso outgrowth from rat zzso zzso in zzso Both protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso outgrowth in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso promotes zzso outgrowth via zzso and zzso zzso The active sites of zzso for zzso outgrowth existed in the zzso growth factor zzso domain and zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso caused cells to extend zzso one zzso from a zzso whereas the zzso caused several zzso to zzso The zzso also enhanced zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso but the zzso did zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso have distinct functions in terms of zzso From these findings, zzso can be considered to be involved in zzso in the developing central nervous zzso
