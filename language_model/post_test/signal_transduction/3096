The gut zzso is a complex zzso that has zzso with host zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice with a zzso promotes increased vessel density in the small zzso but little is known about the mechanisms zzso zzso factor zzso is the membrane zzso that zzso the zzso zzso pathway, and it promotes zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that the gut zzso promotes zzso zzso associated with zzso of zzso on the cell surface, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso domain in the small zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso mice decreased zzso vascular zzso and expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso in the small zzso Mice with a genetic deletion of the zzso zzso domain or with zzso zzso zzso zzso had a decreased zzso vessel zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso activate zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso density and zzso of the zzso domain of zzso were decreased in small zzso from zzso zzso but not zzso zzso mice, and zzso of zzso showed that zzso zzso was upstream of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso zzso loop is a novel zzso that may be modulated to influence vascular zzso in the small zzso
