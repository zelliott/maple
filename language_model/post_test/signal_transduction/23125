zzso virus zzso zzso small, zzso zzso zzso known as zzso are the most abundantly expressed viral transcripts in zzso zzso infected zzso We found the specific role of zzso in cell cycle zzso resistance against zzso drug and cellular invasion in gastric cancer cells in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and activate its downstream zzso which is significantly involved in zzso the expression of cell cycle inhibitor genes zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso regulates the zzso of zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso in gastric cancer zzso In addition, administration of zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso reduces zzso and zzso invasion of zzso gastric cancer zzso Our results thus revealed a novel role of zzso in the coordination of zzso signaling zzso to zzso and cellular zzso
