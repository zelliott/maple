zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in tumor invasion and zzso zzso of zzso has been reported in various cancer types including lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast zzso In our investigation of zzso regulation by growth factors, zzso was activated by zzso as shown by zzso in both zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso in zzso activity was due to increased zzso protein and zzso levels, which mainly results from zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso activates multiple signaling pathways in breast cancer cells, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We examined the pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso using chemical zzso that specifically inhibit each of these zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partially blocked zzso zzso whereas zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso at least three signaling pathways are involved in the zzso of zzso by zzso Since zzso is tightly associated with zzso and zzso our studies suggest that blocking zzso zzso of zzso by zzso the related signaling pathways may provide new strategies for zzso of cancer zzso and zzso
