zzso growth factor zzso I zzso circuit is a major zzso loop for Ewing's zzso zzso cells and appears to be particularly important in the zzso of this zzso In this study, we analyzed the contribution of the 2 major pathways of the zzso zzso signaling cascade to the overall effects zzso by zzso in zzso Both the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways appeared to be zzso activated in zzso likely due to the presence of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that both zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso profoundly impaired zzso cell growth in zzso and soft zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso cell cycle progression by inducing zzso zzso whereas only zzso significantly affected the survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso completely reverted zzso growth zzso by zzso zzso and zzso effects of the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso could not rescue cells from growth zzso induced by zzso zzso blockade also significantly reduced the migratory ability of zzso cells, both in zzso and zzso conditions, and increased zzso to zzso a leader drug in the treatment of zzso zzso Our findings therefore identify zzso zzso as a promising target for zzso intervention in zzso
