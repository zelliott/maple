zzso a member of the Ras zzso regulates zzso changes in lower zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso stem cells causes expansion of zzso zzso followed by a zzso disorder mimicking chronic zzso zzso Moreover, these mice develop a zzso zzso disorder resembling chronic zzso zzso Here, we used zzso zzso cells as a tool to examine the molecular effects of zzso We observed that a zzso active zzso zzso localized predominantly in the zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was also detected upon zzso zzso A potential consequence of nuclear zzso of zzso is the regulation of gene zzso We used a high zzso zzso approach to identify gene products potentially modulated by zzso Out of 1000 proteins zzso 64 proteins were zzso and 66 proteins were zzso The zzso expressed gene products belong to zzso regulator zzso signaling zzso zzso factors, viability regulators, and protein zzso This analysis provides the first fingerprint of gene product expression regulated by zzso and may contribute to our understanding of zzso transformation mechanisms regulated by this small zzso
