We have recently isolated the zzso cell line, zzso that zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and stem cell factor zzso but zzso terminal differentiation in the presence of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso related zzso factor zzso in these cells resulted in the establishment of the zzso cell line zzso that zzso in the presence of zzso In this study, we zzso these two cell lines to examine the signal zzso pathways that are activated in response to zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso activates the zzso zzso in zzso cells while zzso does zzso However, both zzso and zzso are capable of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, enforced expression of zzso in zzso cells by means of infection with the zzso Focus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independent growth, which is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is readily detected in zzso expressing cells in response to both zzso and zzso and is associated with a block in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is capable of switching zzso differentiation to zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso factor regulated genes whose products zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso
