zzso between the zzso and zzso pathways play a significant role in the determination of cell zzso In benign cells these pathways are interrelated through the zzso regulation of zzso by zzso which is required for zzso zzso zzso exerts its effects by decreasing the zzso zzso zzso thereby diminishing zzso zzso However, the link between these pathways in cancer is not zzso In this study, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is identified as an zzso involved in upper zzso tract zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in both pathways are rare in primary tumors, suggesting that amplification of zzso and zzso of zzso are mutually exclusive events and either event is able to promote a zzso zzso Moreover, the negative effect of zzso induction on cell survival involves the zzso zzso of zzso that is independent of zzso activity, as zzso is not expressed in the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in resistance to zzso zzso in zzso deficient zzso Thus, zzso regulates cell survival by zzso the zzso zzso signal independent of zzso in zzso zzso This zzso is required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
