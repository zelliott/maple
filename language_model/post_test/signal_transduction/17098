To study the gene expression patterns in zzso of infant rats after zzso zzso exposure during pregnancy and explore the important gene and signaling pathways in the toxic mechanism of zzso 

zzso pregnant zzso rats were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle control zzso zzso and treatment groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in corn zzso zzso solutions were given by gastric infusion from the 3rd to the 17th day of zzso After delivery the zzso liver were taken to detect the gene expression by zzso gene zzso The stability of gene chip was tested by repeated zzso 

After prenatal zzso exposure zzso genes with different expression variations in zzso of zzso were zzso Three expression patterns of genes related to the dose of prenatal zzso exposure were identified with significant difference zzso zzso zzso As the dose of prenatal zzso exposure increased, the gene expression patterns were zzso zzso and zzso Twenty-six signaling pathways with differently expressed genes mainly focused on: growth and development, zzso metabolism and inflammation zzso zzso zzso The data from gene network analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the key genes in the gene zzso 

Gene expression patterns of zzso zzso were influenced by prenatal zzso zzso Some key genes and signal pathways were also zzso The study provides an important clue for the toxicity and mechanisms of the prenatal zzso exposure on the growth and development of zzso
