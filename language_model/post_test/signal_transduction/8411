zzso in zzso zzso zzso primarily genes zzso patched zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso In a phase 1 clinical trial, we assessed the safety and zzso of zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso and responses of zzso or locally advanced zzso zzso to the zzso 

We selected 33 patients with zzso or locally advanced zzso zzso to receive oral zzso at one of three zzso 17 patients received 150 zzso per day, 15 patients received zzso zzso per day, and 1 patient received 540 zzso per zzso We assessed tumor responses with the use of Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso physical examination, or zzso zzso aspects of the tumors were zzso 

The median duration of the study treatment was zzso zzso Of the 33 patients, 18 had an objective response to zzso according to assessment on imaging (7 zzso physical examination (10 zzso or both (1 zzso Of the patients who had a response, 2 had a complete response and 16 had a partial zzso The other 15 patients had either stable disease (11 zzso or progressive disease (4 zzso Eight grade 3 adverse events that were deemed to be possibly related to the study drug were reported in six patients, including four with fatigue, two with zzso one with muscle spasm, and one with zzso zzso One grade 4 event, zzso zzso was judged to be unrelated to zzso One patient withdrew from the study because of adverse zzso We found evidence of zzso signaling in tumors that responded to the zzso 

zzso an orally active small zzso that targets the zzso pathway, appears to have zzso activity in locally advanced or zzso zzso zzso zzso number, zzso
