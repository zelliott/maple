zzso is a dual regulator of cell proliferation and cell viability zzso in most human zzso Although strategies to lower zzso levels have been pursued for rational cancer therapy, the molecular zzso controlling zzso expression in tumors have not been completely zzso Here, we show that stimulation with zzso growth zzso zzso results in increased zzso expression in prostate cancer zzso This response is independent of de zzso gene transcription, changes in zzso expression or modifications of zzso protein zzso Instead, IGF-1 induced persistence and translation of a pool of zzso zzso in a reaction abolished by the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso target zzso reproduced the increase in zzso expression in prostate cancer cells, whereas acute zzso of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso protein levels, and decreased viability of prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells via rapid changes in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso may be beneficial to lower an zzso threshold maintained by zzso in prostate zzso
