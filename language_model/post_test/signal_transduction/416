To investigate the relationship between zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso vascular zzso response of superior zzso arteries zzso in zzso shock zzso 

Third to fifth passage culture of vascular zzso cells zzso and zzso from zzso rats were used as study subject, the changes in zzso response of zzso and zzso against zzso were zzso The expression of zzso in zzso were blocked by zzso zzso then the effect of zzso on zzso response of hypoxic zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso 

The zzso responses of zzso and zzso after zzso were first increased, then zzso zzso induced calcium overload in zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal control group, zzso zzso zzso in zzso group at 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso group at 2 zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso and zzso response of zzso towards zzso while that of zzso zzso showed opposite zzso 

zzso can regulate the zzso zzso vascular zzso response through zzso of zzso after zzso zzso
