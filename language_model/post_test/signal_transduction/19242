The zzso zzso is constantly exposed to zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso are normally maintained at nontoxic levels, but zzso of zzso is involved in zzso inflammatory zzso In this article, we report that zzso zzso 1 zzso is a key regulator of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene deletion in the mouse zzso zzso caused tissue damage involving zzso zzso disruption of tight zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is a major zzso damage zzso rescued the inflammatory conditions but not zzso or disruption of tight junctions in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not a primary zzso of the damage noted in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso resulted in reduced expression of several zzso genes and reduced the protein level of a key zzso zzso factor zzso factor 2, which resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso and disruption of tight junctions in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling regulates zzso through zzso factor zzso factor 2, which is important for zzso zzso zzso
