The zzso zzso zzso components of zzso zzso complexes, interact with nuclear receptors and many other zzso zzso zzso is a target for the zzso expressed protein zzso zzso which is known to zzso a wide variety of zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso plays a regulatory role in many cellular events, particularly, in zzso However, little is known about the precise mode of action zzso Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a zzso zzso protein zzso in complex with zzso zzso as determined by solution zzso zzso of the zzso site on zzso significantly increased affinity for zzso We also confirmed the significance of zzso zzso by reporter zzso and propose a mechanism involving the process of zzso acting zzso molecular zzso Finally, we propose that zzso domain functions as a zzso binding zzso
