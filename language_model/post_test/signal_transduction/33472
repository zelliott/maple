zzso receptors are zzso of cell fate zzso To define the role of zzso in the adult zzso we created transgenic mice zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso under the control of the type I collagen zzso zzso zzso were small and zzso Bone zzso revealed that zzso caused a decrease in bone volume, secondary to a reduction in zzso number; zzso and zzso number were zzso Low fertility of founder mice and zzso of young zzso did not allow the complete establishment of transgenic zzso To characterize the effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was induced in zzso and zzso cells from zzso mice, in which a STOP cassette flanked by zzso sites is upstream of zzso by zzso with an zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso impaired zzso and inhibited zzso zzso To determine the effects of zzso deletion in zzso mice in which zzso was flanked by zzso sequences zzso were zzso with mice expressing zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had no obvious skeletal zzso possibly because of rescue by zzso however, zzso females exhibited a modest increase in zzso surface and eroded zzso zzso from zzso mice, zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso small interfering zzso displayed increased alkaline zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling in zzso causes zzso and zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso
