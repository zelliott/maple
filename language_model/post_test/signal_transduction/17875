Cellular zzso at its basic level, is simply the passing of genetic information from a single parent cell into two daughter zzso As the cellular zzso encodes all the information that defines a cell, it is crucial that the zzso be accurately zzso Furthermore, the duplicated zzso must be properly zzso so that each daughter cell contains the exact same information as the parent zzso The processes by which this occurs is known as the cell zzso The failure of either zzso or segregation of the zzso can have disastrous consequences for an zzso including cancer and zzso This article discusses what is known about zzso the surveillance mechanisms that monitor both the zzso and accuracy of DNA replication and zzso Specifically, we will focus on the zzso checkpoint that is responsible for ensuring proper segregation of the duplicated zzso into the daughter cells and how this checkpoint functions to arrest entry into zzso in response to DNA zzso
