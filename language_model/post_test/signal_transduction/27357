The aim of this article is to review the findings of current research on the synaptic transmission of the auditory zzso tract from hair cells to zzso auditory zzso The zzso of inner hair cells by the zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso the entry of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso This zzso influx triggers the zzso zzso The zzso is likely zzso and it generates zzso at the zzso terminal and elicits action zzso The intensity and the zzso information of sounds are processed separately by specific auditory tracts and coded as zzso and zzso behaviors of action zzso Recent studies using the zzso zzso technique revealed several zzso and chemically gated zzso zzso these channels characterize the intensity coding and the zzso functions of auditory zzso
