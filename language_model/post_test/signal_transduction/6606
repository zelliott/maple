zzso in either the zzso or zzso gene cause zzso cells to arrest in zzso of the cell cycle at the same point as treatment with mating zzso We demonstrate here that strains harboring zzso zzso in zzso or zzso activate expression of the zzso gene zzso when shifted to zzso zzso We show further that zzso arrest and induction of zzso are dependent on known components of the mating factor response pathway, the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso results from zzso of the mating factor response zzso The zzso and zzso gene products behave formally as negative elements in the response zzso they are required to block response in the absence of zzso zzso analysis of zzso defective in zzso or zzso and different zzso genes demonstrates that zzso requires the response zzso G protein and suggests that zzso and zzso products may control synthesis or function of the G alpha zzso
