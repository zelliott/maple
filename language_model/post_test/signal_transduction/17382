Limited success has been achieved in extending the survival of patients with zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso There is a strong need for novel agents in the treatment and prevention of zzso In the present study, the zzso mechanism of action of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso pathways was investigated in the zzso prostate zzso cells zzso and zzso We showed that these compounds induced zzso through the intrinsic zzso but not through the zzso zzso We showed that synthetic zzso induced an zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso Even if both zzso induced zzso in zzso cells, a dominant effect of zzso treatment was observed resulting in a disruption of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso Furthermore, in regard to our results, it is clear that the simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso zzso can significantly contribute to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso was correlated with the reduction of zzso expression and induction of zzso Our results clearly indicate for the first time that zzso and zzso exert their potent zzso and zzso effects through the zzso of zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso prostate cancer cells with a dominant effect for zzso
