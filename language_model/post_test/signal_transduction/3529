The zzso molecules are zzso zzso that regulate zzso guidance at the zzso of both zzso and zzso In zzso there are three zzso zzso but only zzso has been studied in any detail with regard to zzso brain zzso zzso Here, we sought to understand the relative contributions that zzso proteins make to the formation of the largest brain zzso the corpus zzso zzso zzso bind zzso zzso and previous studies have shown that zzso mice have defects in corpus zzso zzso However, whether the zzso genes signal exclusively through zzso during zzso formation is zzso To investigate this, we compared the development of the corpus zzso in both zzso and zzso mice using diffusion magnetic resonance zzso This analysis demonstrated similarities in the zzso of these mice, but zzso also highlighted subtle differences, particularly with regard to the guidance of zzso zzso Analysis of single zzso in zzso family members revealed corpus zzso defects (but not complete zzso in zzso of zzso mice and zzso of zzso mice, whereas zzso of zzso zzso mice displayed complete zzso of the corpus zzso These results revealed a role for zzso in corpus zzso development, and demonstrated that zzso was necessary but not sufficient for zzso crossing in zzso However, zzso experiments zzso zzso tissue versus zzso expressing cell blocks demonstrated that zzso was sufficient for the guidance activity zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso This suggested that zzso and zzso might also be involved in regulating other mechanisms that allow the corpus zzso to form, such as the establishment of zzso zzso zzso Investigation of this revealed defects in the development and zzso positioning of the zzso zzso zzso in multiple zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso regulate zzso development via both classical zzso mechanisms, and via a novel role in zzso the correct positioning of zzso zzso zzso Finally, our data also indicate that some of the roles of zzso proteins at the zzso may be independent of zzso zzso suggestive of additional receptors regulating zzso zzso during zzso
