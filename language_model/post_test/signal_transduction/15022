zzso gene and zzso aberrations have been detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso where they are thought to contribute to zzso zzso zzso To further investigate this, we have performed extensive zzso transcript sequencing and functional analysis in zzso with demonstrated resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso instead of showing zzso zzso per se, B cells from zzso zzso zzso and zzso normal zzso and novel alternatively spliced zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso were predicted, by sequencing, to zzso zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso However, their zzso by zzso in zzso cells did not interfere with zzso zzso death zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did not show zzso in zzso zzso elements and zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso This, in conjunction with treatment by the protein synthesis zzso zzso could zzso a subset of zzso to zzso zzso In normal and zzso B cells, this correlated to increased zzso membrane zzso enhanced zzso activity and engagement of the zzso death zzso via Bid zzso although the latter occurred less efficiently in zzso Thus, immune zzso of zzso zzso and alternative zzso combined with enhanced engagement of zzso death zzso offer potential for restoration of zzso zzso sensitivity in zzso
