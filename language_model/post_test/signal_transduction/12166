Whereas the zzso zzso zzso receives zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso receptors has been shown to zzso the activities of the principal zzso and promote the intrinsic zzso in the zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso transmission in this brain region have not been zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso synaptic transmission in the superficial layers of the zzso Application of zzso zzso increased the frequency and zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso recorded from the principal zzso in layer zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly reduced the frequency but had no effects on the zzso of miniature zzso recorded in the presence of zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso evoked by zzso field stimulation and by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso connected zzso and zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso generated membrane zzso and increased action potential firing frequency but reduced the zzso of action zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso of background zzso channels and independent of zzso C, zzso zzso release, and protein zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso receptors exerts diverse effects on zzso transmission in the zzso
