zzso pain may accompany zzso disorders with an elevated level of serum zzso immune complex zzso but the underlying mechanisms are zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso directly excited a zzso of zzso root zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso I zzso This might be a mechanism linking zzso to pain and zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the signaling pathways and zzso channels activated downstream of zzso and zzso In zzso recordings, zzso induced a zzso zzso current zzso in the rat zzso zzso carried by zzso and zzso The zzso was zzso or attenuated by, respectively, lowering or increasing the zzso zzso zzso capacity, suggesting that this current was regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that transient zzso potential zzso 3 zzso zzso was always zzso with zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso Moreover, zzso red (a general zzso channel zzso zzso (a general zzso channel zzso and zzso (a selective zzso zzso each zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso attenuated the zzso zzso response and the zzso Additionally, the zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso and either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso These results indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso triggers zzso channels through the zzso zzso and that zzso is a key molecular target for the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso
