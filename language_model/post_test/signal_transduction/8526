zzso plays a critical role in the regulation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso determines zzso availability and zzso The zzso system and zzso activity have been described as being altered in chronic zzso zzso such as inflammatory zzso zzso has also been shown to be involved in a variety of zzso functions and to play a central role in the regulation of inflammatory responses of injured zzso Since the zzso of zzso by zzso in the zzso remains unknown, the aim of the present work was to study the effect of zzso on zzso activity and expression and to determine the molecular mechanism zzso The study has been carried out using human zzso zzso cells which zzso express zzso The results show that zzso diminishes zzso activity in both the zzso and zzso zzso by acting in the intrinsic zzso with no zzso of either zzso zzso or protein zzso The effect of zzso appears to be zzso by zzso receptors and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect did not seem to involve the zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso effects are reached at high zzso which suggests that zzso zzso of zzso may be significant under conditions of inflammation and tissue zzso
