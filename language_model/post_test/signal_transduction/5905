zzso evidence indicates the zzso action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can reverse zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and maintain zzso zzso zzso zzso a key step in the development of liver fibrosis, is coupled with the zzso of zzso and the dramatic zzso of zzso The present study is aimed to assess the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression in primary cultured rat zzso and investigate the related mechanisms by using Western zzso analysis, real-time zzso transient zzso approach, and cell growth zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso gene expression at zzso level, protein level and zzso gene promoter activity level in zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso gene expression contributes to cell growth of activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways mediate the zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso In zzso these findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso gene expression through zzso of zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso in primary cultured rat zzso Our results might provide novel insights into the mechanisms for the zzso action of zzso in zzso
