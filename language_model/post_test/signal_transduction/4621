The genetic mechanisms underlying zzso tumor development are still largely zzso We used high-resolution single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect copy number zzso zzso and zzso losses of zzso zzso in 15 zzso zzso zzso with matched blood zzso We focused on zzso aiming to discover new candidate genes involved in early zzso and/or autonomous cortisol zzso We identified zzso zzso with a median of 18 zzso per zzso Half of them involved zzso regions, zzso were less than 100 zzso and zzso were found in at least two zzso The most frequently gained regions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso most of them being identified in the same three zzso These regions contained among others genes like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso losses were less common and smaller than gains, being mostly localized at zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso signaling was the most frequently zzso We identified 46 zzso zzso that each affected a single gene zzso gains and 15 losses), including genes involved in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, 20 small zzso in four cases affecting 15 known genes were zzso Our findings provide the first high-resolution zzso view of zzso changes in zzso zzso and identify novel candidate zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, they zzso that the zzso signaling zzso might be involved in the molecular zzso of zzso zzso
