It is generally believed that zzso activities drive random cell migration, whereas signal zzso events initiated by receptors regulate the zzso to guide zzso However, we find that the zzso network, involving zzso zzso 2/3 and zzso zzso is capable of generating only rapid zzso and zzso of the cell zzso The signal zzso network, zzso multiple pathways that include Ras zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required to generate the sustained zzso of zzso zzso The signal zzso network is zzso exhibiting wave zzso zzso and zzso response to zzso zzso even in the absence of the zzso We suggest that cell zzso results from zzso of zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso networks, and various guidance cues that zzso the threshold for triggering signal zzso events are integrated to control the mode and direction of zzso
