The natural killer zzso cell zzso response towards infected cells or zzso cells is guided by the integration of zzso and zzso signals sensed by zzso cell surface zzso Major zzso complex class I specific zzso receptors expressed by zzso cells have two distinct roles: while allowing self zzso they are also needed for the acquisition of zzso cell functional zzso a process termed zzso In the context of zzso zzso cell zzso arising from the expression on donor zzso cells of zzso killer zzso receptors zzso that do not recognize human zzso zzso from the patient, has shown clinical benefit for zzso zzso Based on these genetic studies, a blocking zzso directed against zzso as well as zzso zzso cell infusions are now tested in clinical trials in various zzso zzso They offer promising zzso approaches for the treatment of cancer zzso
