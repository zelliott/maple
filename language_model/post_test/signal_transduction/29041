Although mouse zzso and zzso zzso are unable to zzso zzso as a zzso fuel, they have a specific requirement for a short exposure to zzso prior to zzso The reason for this requirement has been zzso In this study we confirm that zzso exposure to zzso is required for zzso formation and show that the absence of zzso between zzso h after zzso causes an irreversible decrease in cellular proliferation and an increase in zzso More importantly, this zzso signals to activate expression of zzso transcript and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso associated with zzso competence and increased zzso zzso used to fuel zzso zzso zzso could substitute for zzso in these roles, suggesting that zzso zzso may be a zzso mechanism involved in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in this pathway, zzso zzso zzso inhibited expression of the zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso a zzso that enters this zzso downstream of zzso was able to overcome this zzso and support zzso zzso These data suggest that early zzso rely on zzso zzso as a zzso zzso to initiate zzso zzso
