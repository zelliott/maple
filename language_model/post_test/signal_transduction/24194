To examine the mechanism of collagen induction by zzso tissue growth factor zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the skin of patients with systemic sclerosis zzso 

zzso zzso from 7 zzso patients and 7 matched healthy adult donors were zzso with zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso supplement, zzso zzso zzso of collagen protein was analyzed by a zzso incorporation zzso To identify the signaling pathways zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso were used, including zzso a protein zzso C delta zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels in both zzso and normal zzso were increased after treatment with transforming growth factor beta in zzso zzso whereas no stimulation was observed following addition of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso however, zzso was not zzso in the majority of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso ITS alone induced collagen levels in normal zzso to the levels observed in zzso skin zzso thereby diminishing the hallmark difference in zzso collagen levels in these cell zzso zzso was the ITS component responsible for promoting the zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso delta zzso zzso collagen synthesis in normal and zzso zzso cultured in zzso and inhibited the zzso effects of zzso in cooperation with insulin or of insulin zzso zzso zzso 

Increased responsiveness of zzso zzso to zzso collagen synthesis requires the zzso zzso of insulin signaling pathways to induce zzso zzso zzso of this effect via zzso may suggest that zzso delta is a downstream signaling zzso necessary for zzso stimulation of collagen zzso
