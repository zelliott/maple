The zzso family proteins are typically associated with zzso that are found in the plasma membrane of numerous zzso These zzso are referred to zzso zzso zzso are small proteins zzso zzso that have a hairpin loop zzso with both the N and C zzso exposed to the zzso Apart from having a structural function within zzso these proteins have the capacity to bind cholesterol as well as a variety of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso which are involved in signal zzso zzso zzso data allow the assumption to be made that the majority of the interactions with signaling molecules hold them in an inactive or zzso zzso The activity of zzso seems to be dependent on its specific zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso fulfill a role in the zzso of cellular signaling zzso
