zzso a small zzso that is responsible for the typical smell and most of the functions of garlic, possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities and is considered to have therapeutic potential in many zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential protective effect of zzso in an in zzso model of traumatic brain injury zzso using primary cultured rat cortical zzso We found that zzso treatment significantly reduced mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso release and inhibited zzso zzso death in a zzso zzso These protective effects were observed even if zzso treatment was delayed to zzso after zzso zzso significantly decreased the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protection in cortical zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and was partly reversed by blocking zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso and further enhanced the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the zzso increase in zzso expression and zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso had opposite effects on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso or zzso partly prevented or further enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for traumatic zzso injury and that the potential underlying mechanism involves zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso
