The zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and is found on the surface of all zzso natural killer zzso cells as well as T cells displaying zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso is an zzso zzso because zzso of this zzso results in increased zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso However, it was recently shown that the gene for zzso encodes two different products that arise by alternative zzso These gene products differ solely in their zzso zzso One form has a zzso tail of 150 zzso acids zzso and the other has a tail of 93 zzso acids zzso To determine the function of each zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso into the rat zzso cell line zzso Interestingly, the two forms of zzso had opposing zzso zzso was able to mediate redirected zzso of zzso tumor targets, suggesting that this form represents an zzso zzso However, zzso expression led to an zzso of redirected zzso of zzso targets when the zzso zzso zzso for rat zzso was zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and removal of zzso containing these zzso abrogates its zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso
