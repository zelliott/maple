Recent years have seen the development of various zzso methods for the analysis of zzso gene expression zzso These approaches have the potential to bring biological insights into zzso zzso A variety of methods have been proposed to construct networks using gene expression zzso Because individual pathways do not act in isolation, it is important to understand how different pathways coordinate to perform cellular zzso However, there are no published methods describing how to build zzso clusters that are closely related to traits of zzso 

We propose to build zzso clusters from zzso zzso zzso The proposed methods allow researchers to identify clusters of pathways sharing similar zzso These pathways may or may not share zzso As an zzso our approach is applied to three human breast cancer zzso data zzso We found that our methods yielded consistent and zzso results for these three data zzso We further investigated one of the zzso clusters found using zzso We found that zzso genes in the zzso clusters do have more publications with zzso like zzso zzso compared with zzso genes in other top zzso In addition, using the shortest path analysis in zzso zzso and Human zzso zzso zzso we were able to identify the links which connect the pathways without shared genes within the zzso zzso 

Our proposed zzso zzso methods allow zzso and biologists to investigate how zzso genes within pathways are related to each other and understand possible zzso between pathways in a zzso zzso building zzso clusters may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms affecting a trait of interest, and help generate further biological hypotheses from gene expression zzso
