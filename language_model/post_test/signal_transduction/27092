zzso stimulation of zzso T cells in an immune response requires not only signals zzso via the zzso complex but also zzso signals delivered as a consequence of interactions between zzso zzso zzso R and their zzso on zzso zzso plays a crucial role as a dominant zzso R during the induction of zzso zzso proliferation by interacting with zzso B7 on zzso to sustain zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso has been zzso to result in zzso zzso or zzso The zzso effects of zzso can be generated with its natural zzso B7 or zzso directed at zzso Using soluble C gamma 1 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso we have recently shown that B7 zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso T cells more efficiently than that of resting zzso zzso T zzso In contrast, proliferation of resting zzso T cells can be efficiently zzso by either zzso or zzso via interactions with their R zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of resting zzso T cells with zzso can induce increased responsiveness to B7 zzso In this study, we show that prior zzso zzso of resting zzso T cells with zzso induced increased responsiveness to B7 zzso zzso also zzso with B7 to bring about zzso proliferation of zzso T zzso In addition, zzso of resting T cells with zzso significantly increased not only surface expression of zzso but also zzso zzso of zzso free zzso Similar zzso of T cells with zzso also resulted in increased B7 zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso to B7 zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso Thus, zzso may play an important zzso role during the zzso of resting T cells and, by zzso responsiveness to zzso facilitate optimal development of zzso memory in addition to various regulatory and zzso zzso
