zzso proteins zzso are highly zzso ubiquitous zzso binding proteins that are involved in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso play a role in Ras signaling and bind zzso zzso the zzso bind to zzso We report here the zzso characterization of the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso data, including the steady state zzso zzso zzso experiments, indicate that the first 50 zzso zzso are zzso and that this highly flexible zzso zzso is followed by a stable, folded core starting at zzso zzso The zzso structure of the folded core is an zzso bundle composed of six zzso zzso in a stark contrast to the recently determined zzso zzso domain structure, which is solely built by zzso
