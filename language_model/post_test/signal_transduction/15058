We aimed to determine whether zzso zzso in systemic concentration of testosterone, growth hormone zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso protein synthesis zzso and zzso of zzso proteins important in regulating zzso zzso Eight young men (20 zzso zzso years, zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso completed two exercise protocols designed to maintain zzso hormone zzso zzso hormone, zzso or elicit increases in zzso hormones zzso hormone, zzso In the zzso zzso participants performed a bout of unilateral resistance exercise with the elbow zzso The zzso protocol consisted of the same elbow zzso exercise with the zzso arm followed immediately by high-volume leg resistance zzso Participants consumed 25 g of protein after arm exercise to maximize zzso Muscle zzso and blood samples were taken as zzso There were no changes in serum testosterone, zzso or IGF-1 after the zzso zzso whereas there were marked zzso after zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso IGF-1, P zzso zzso Exercise zzso a rise in zzso in the biceps zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with no effect of elevated hormones zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 70 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso with no differences between zzso We conclude that the transient increases in zzso purportedly anabolic hormones do not enhance zzso anabolic zzso or zzso following resistance zzso Local mechanisms are likely to be of zzso importance for the zzso increase in zzso
