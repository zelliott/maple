zzso zzso are remarkably efficient zzso of zzso zzso This renders brain functions highly sensitive to small changes in pH which are generated zzso via mechanisms that regulate the zzso status of the whole zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and de zzso generation of zzso zzso The effects of pH changes on zzso zzso are zzso by diverse, largely zzso mechanisms operating at the level of zzso and zzso zzso channels and gap zzso In general, alkaline shifts induce an increase in zzso which is often intense enough to trigger zzso activity, while zzso has the opposite zzso Brain pH changes show a wide zzso in their zzso properties, ranging from long-lasting global shifts to fast and highly localized zzso that take place in zzso zzso Thirteen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified, zzso 11 are expressed in the zzso zzso CA zzso which have their zzso sites within brain cells and the zzso fluid exert a remarkably strong influence on the dynamics of pH shifts and, consequently, on zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss the various roles of zzso as an zzso and zzso signaling factor in the brain, focusing on the effects zzso by zzso Special attention is paid on the zzso expression patterns and actions of the zzso zzso CA zzso Studies on the various functions of zzso will shed light on fundamental mechanisms underlying zzso development, signaling and zzso on zzso mechanisms associated with zzso and related diseases; and on the modes of action of CA zzso used as zzso zzso
