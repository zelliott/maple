Bone zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in initiating the cascade of zzso However, high doses of zzso zzso coupled with diffusion away from the intended site cause adverse zzso An alternative is to use zzso zzso zzso zzso grafted with peptides of the active zzso of zzso zzso present a zzso form of the zzso for stronger interaction with cell surface zzso leading to a stronger zzso of zzso zzso zzso The objective of this work was to compare zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso grafted to zzso zzso with that of zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso and grafted to zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The calcium content of bone zzso zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso medium supplemented with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was slightly higher than other zzso groups, but all zzso groups showed similar levels of zzso after 21 zzso The expression pattern of master zzso factors zzso and zzso indicated that zzso protein induced faster zzso zzso than the zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso groups was significantly higher than those of zzso zzso and zzso groups, which may be due to a more effective presentation of the zzso to cell surface zzso thus leading to a stronger interaction of the zzso with clustered cell surface zzso
