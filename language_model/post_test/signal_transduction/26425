zzso cancer, one of the zzso zzso zzso is often associated with extensive zzso zzso when initially zzso The mechanism of the formation of zzso zzso from zzso cancer is still zzso It has been reported that zzso of zzso growth factors and/or receptors may zzso the prognosis of zzso In the previous paper, we had established the human zzso zzso zzso cell lines from those with no zzso of zzso dissemination zzso to high zzso zzso however, the mechanism of its zzso change remains zzso In this paper, we compared these two cell lines for growth potential and the expression of growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso zzso on cell growth was zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis found the promotion of the expression of zzso precursor and zzso in zzso zzso of the number of growing cells over time revealed a statistically significant increase in the number of cells in zzso compared with zzso In a study using the addition of zzso zzso no changes were observed in zzso while statistically significant cell growth was noted in zzso In a growth zzso study, statistically significant cell growth zzso was achieved with the addition of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results of this study suggested that zzso may play an important role in the increased growth potential of zzso dissemination of zzso zzso In particular, zzso receptors that can act as a starting point to trigger zzso signaling pathways are strongly involved in the progression of zzso zzso molecular target drug therapies blocking the zzso zzso are promising candidates for zzso cancer treatment in the zzso
