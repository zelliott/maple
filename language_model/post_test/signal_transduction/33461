Communication between bacteria, belonging to the same species or to different species, is zzso through different chemical signals that are zzso and zzso by zzso These signals can either be zzso related zzso or be produced by bacteria at different stages of growth, and they allow bacteria to monitor their environment and alter gene expression to derive a competitive zzso The properties of these signals and the response zzso by them are important in ensuring bacterial survival and propagation in natural environments zzso human oral zzso where hundreds of bacterial species zzso First, the interaction between a signal and its zzso is very specific, which zzso zzso communication and zzso zzso Second, when multiple signals are zzso by the same zzso the signaling circuits zzso by the different signals are zzso regulated with distinct overall circuit architecture so as to maximize the overall zzso Third, the recognition of a universal communication signal zzso by different bacterial species zzso zzso as well that of signals produced by zzso cells zzso zzso is also integral to the formation of zzso zzso communities that are important in infection and zzso The focus of this review is on the principles underlying zzso bacterial communication, with specific emphasis on the potential for using them in two zzso of synthetic biology zzso and zzso and the control of zzso formation and zzso
