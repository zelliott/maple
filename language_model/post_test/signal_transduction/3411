zzso zzso occurs as an adaptation to hypertension but a sustained zzso response can ultimately lead to heart zzso zzso zzso zzso is released following zzso overload and stimulates a cardiac zzso zzso zzso also increases expression of the regulatory zzso transforming growth zzso zzso which is also implicated in the cardiac zzso response and can stimulate zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso 1 zzso signaling zzso To better understand the downstream signaling events in cardiac zzso we therefore investigated zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways in response to zzso II and zzso using primary zzso rat zzso to model cardiac zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2/3 or zzso protein or addition of the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate the role of downstream zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso Our data revealed that zzso stimulation leads to zzso zzso zzso that were indistinguishable from those occurring in response to zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso type zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso response was also prevented following zzso zzso of zzso zzso but was unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso occurs in a zzso but zzso zzso
