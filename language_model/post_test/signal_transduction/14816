The retinal network increases its sensitivity in zzso conditions to detect small visual zzso and decreases its sensitivity in zzso conditions to prevent zzso However, the cellular mechanisms that adjust visual signaling in the retinal network are not zzso Here, we show that zzso sodium channels in bipolar cells zzso control retinal light zzso In dim conditions, sodium channels amplified zzso synaptic responses zzso by cone zzso zzso in bright conditions, sodium channels were zzso by zzso released from zzso cells, and they did not amplify synaptic zzso minimizing signal zzso Our findings demonstrate that bipolar cell sodium channels mediate light adaptation by controlling retinal signaling zzso
