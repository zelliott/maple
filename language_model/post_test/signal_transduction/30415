To what extent can modes of gene regulation be explained by zzso properties of zzso zzso Prior studies on zzso of zzso genes have mainly focused on zzso features of zzso networks and demonstrated a decreasing level of zzso with increasing network distance, a zzso but widely used, zzso zzso Others have suggested that zzso graph representations can poorly capture dynamic functional associations, zzso in the form of dependence of zzso zzso across genes in the zzso Here, we systematically tested the relative importance of zzso flux zzso and network position on gene zzso using a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso After zzso the zzso method with empirical data on flux zzso we confirm that genes coupled by their zzso zzso not only show similar expression patterns, but also share zzso regulators and frequently reside in the same zzso In contrast, we demonstrate that network distance per zzso has relatively minor influence on gene zzso Moreover, the type of flux zzso can explain refined properties of the regulatory network that are ignored by simple zzso zzso Our results underline the importance of studying functional states of cellular networks to define zzso relevant associations between genes and should stimulate future developments of novel functional zzso zzso
