In living cells, the perception of environmental stress and the subsequent zzso of stress signals are primary events in the zzso to changes in the zzso Some molecular sensors and zzso of environmental stress cannot be identified by traditional and conventional zzso Based on zzso information, a systematic approach has been applied to the solution of this problem in zzso involving zzso of potential sensors and signal zzso in combination with DNA zzso analyses for the zzso expression of zzso zzso genes for the zzso zzso zzso 12 genes for zzso protein zzso zzso 42 genes for response regulators zzso seven genes for zzso zzso zzso factors, and nearly 70 genes for zzso factors have been successfully zzso by targeted zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso libraries by zzso DNA zzso analysis under various stress and zzso conditions has allowed identification of proteins that perceive and zzso signals of environmental zzso Here we zzso recent progress in the identification of sensory and regulatory systems, including zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso factors, and the role of zzso DNA zzso in the regulation of the responses of zzso cells to various types of zzso
