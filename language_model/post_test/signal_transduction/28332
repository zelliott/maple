The neural crest is a population of cells that originates at the interface between the neural plate and zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the role that zzso and the zzso zzso play in the zzso of the neural zzso We show that zzso zzso and the zzso target gene zzso are all expressed in the neural crest territory, whereas the zzso zzso Delta 1 and zzso are expressed in the cells that surround the prospective crest zzso We have used zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso signaling components and zzso to analyze the role of these factors in neural crest zzso without interfering with zzso or neural plate zzso zzso of zzso or zzso signaling led to an enlargement of the neural crest territory, whereas blocking their activity inhibited the expression of neural crest zzso It is known that zzso are involved in the induction of the neural crest and, thus, we assessed whether these two elements might influence the expression of zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso signaling zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso during neural crest zzso These results, in conjunction with data from rescue experiments, allow us to propose a model wherein zzso lies upstream of the cascade regulating Delta 1 zzso At the early zzso stage, the coordinated action of zzso as a positive regulator, and zzso as a zzso restricts the expression of Delta 1 at the border of the neural crest zzso At the late zzso stage, Delta 1 interacts with zzso to activate zzso in the region of the neural zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso of zzso transcription, ensuring that levels of zzso optimal for the zzso of the neural plate border are attained in this zzso Finally, the activity of additional signals zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this newly defined domain zzso the production of neural crest zzso These data also highlight the different roles played by zzso in neural crest zzso in chick and zzso or zzso zzso
