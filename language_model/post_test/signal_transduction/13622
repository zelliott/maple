zzso has a role in airway zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso cells cleave zzso into zzso a zzso with zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on zzso production by human zzso cells was investigated in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the medium of zzso cells were increased by incubation with zzso zzso zzso for 24 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to changes in the levels of zzso zzso at 4 zzso The effects of zzso were attenuated by zzso (1 zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner sensitive to zzso zzso by zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso production was increased in cells zzso with basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso in a manner associated with increases in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso a component of the putative zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso and zzso attenuated zzso conversion into zzso and zzso zzso production by zzso zzso Moreover, a role for zzso zzso in airway inflammation was demonstrated in zzso zzso mice in which zzso increases in inflammatory cell number and zzso levels in the zzso zzso fluid were reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso zzso production in a manner regulated by zzso zzso Our study shows for the first time that targeting zzso zzso signaling may provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of airway inflammation in diseases such as chronic zzso
