Communication based on zzso 2 zzso is widespread among zzso and zzso bacteria, and the zzso zzso can control the expression of genes involved in a variety of zzso pathways and zzso zzso In the present study, we identified zzso a gene responsible for the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso a major component of the dental plaque zzso zzso zzso zzso medium induced zzso in an zzso reporter strain of zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was unaffected in growth and in its ability to form zzso on polystyrene zzso In contrast, the zzso strain failed to induce zzso in zzso zzso and was unable to form a mixed species zzso with a zzso strain of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso restored normal zzso formation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cell surface expression of zzso and zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso produces an zzso signaling zzso that regulates aspects of zzso metabolism in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso communication is essential for zzso formation between zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
