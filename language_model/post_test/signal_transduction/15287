To zzso the possible zzso between zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance zzso especially in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with NASH and 11 with simple fatty liver disease zzso were enrolled in this study and underwent zzso zzso The measures of zzso zzso and zzso employed were zzso vessels, zzso cells, and zzso model assessment of zzso zzso zzso The correlations of these factors with NASH were zzso 

zzso development of zzso zzso was observed only in zzso whereas almost no zzso could be observed in FL and healthy zzso The degree of zzso was almost parallel to liver zzso development, and both parameters were positively zzso Similarly, zzso expression and zzso were significantly increased in NASH as compared with FL and healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were also positively correlated with the degree of zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso may play an important role in the onset and progression of zzso
