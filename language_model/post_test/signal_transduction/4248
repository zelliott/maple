zzso of the C4 plant zzso have two major types of zzso zzso a ring of five large bundle sheath cells zzso surrounds each vascular bundle and smaller zzso cells zzso lie between the zzso of bundle sheath zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is not present in zzso but is abundant in adjacent zzso of green zzso As reported zzso the separate regions of zzso which are required for stimulating zzso of the gene in zzso and for suppressing expression of reporter genes in zzso were identified by an in zzso expression zzso expression was not suppressed in zzso until after leaves of zzso zzso had been illuminated for 24 zzso Now we have found that transient expression of zzso reporter genes is zzso in zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso system but that blue light is required for suppressing zzso reporter gene expression in zzso Blue light is also required for the suppression system to develop in zzso Thus, the zzso gene zzso contains certain sequences that are responsive to a zzso zzso and signal zzso system and other regions that respond to a zzso light zzso and signal zzso zzso Various models of zzso of plant zzso have been zzso these observations show the basis for one type of zzso
