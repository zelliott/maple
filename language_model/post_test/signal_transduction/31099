The zzso of 26 zzso in the coding region of the zzso binding zzso zzso transcript to generate a mature active zzso factor is a part of the unfolded protein response to zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is promptly induced in the rat brain including the zzso by both inescapable electric foot shock zzso and zzso manipulated zzso of zzso release in a zzso zzso By administering zzso a zzso 2A zzso however, we could only partially block the increased zzso by IS and observed that the zzso was not influenced by zzso zzso zzso Although it is still unclear whether the enhanced unfolded protein response functions zzso by modulating the rate of general translation and increasing zzso proteins or whether it eventually zzso cellular damage by triggering zzso the present results indicate the possible existence of a new zzso zzso signaling zzso in the brain that responds to environmentally challenged behavioral stress zzso
