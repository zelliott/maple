zzso stress is a major zzso event occurring in several liver disorders ranging from zzso to zzso ones, and is a major cause of liver damage due to zzso zzso during liver zzso The main sources of zzso are represented by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso by zzso cells and by zzso zzso are provided with efficient molecular strategies to strictly control the zzso zzso level and to maintain the balance between zzso and zzso zzso A cellular zzso stress condition is determined by an imbalance between the generation of zzso and the zzso defense capacity of the cell and can affect major cellular components including zzso proteins and zzso zzso are very important zzso of cellular zzso status and through their zzso zzso zzso can also influence gene expression profile by affecting zzso signal zzso zzso While several zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and non zzso (such as zzso decrease of zzso vitamin zzso vitamin C, zzso markers of chronic zzso stress in liver are well known, early protein targets of zzso injury are yet not well zzso Identification of these markers will enable early detection of liver diseases and will allow monitoring the degree of liver damage, the response to pharmacological therapies and the development of new therapeutic zzso In the new era of molecular medicine, new zzso zzso promise to establish a relationship between pathological hallmarks of disease and protein structural and functional abnormalities in liver disease, thus allowing a better understanding and a more rational therapy on these zzso
