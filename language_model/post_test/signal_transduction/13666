The transforming growth zzso 1 zzso and zzso pathways are important regulators of zzso zzso inflammatory responses and zzso Previous studies have shown extensive zzso between these pathways that is cell type and context dependent, but this has not been zzso in zzso zzso Here we show that in primary mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter activity that is dependent on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso 1 zzso and genetic deletion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of the zzso type I zzso with zzso or genetic deletion of zzso blocked zzso induction of zzso zzso rapidly induced zzso zzso but did not cause a zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels or nuclear zzso of zzso zzso although zzso showed rapid zzso nuclear binding activity that could be blocked by zzso zzso zzso a well characterized zzso target gene was also induced by zzso and this was blocked in zzso and zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso To test the effects of the zzso zzso on a biologically relevant zzso of zzso we exposed mice and primary zzso in culture to zzso zzso In primary zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in levels of zzso zzso that was dependent on zzso but no significant increase in zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso signaling in primary zzso with zzso or genetic deletion of zzso or zzso suppressed zzso induction of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso induction of zzso zzso was blocked in skin of zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that intact zzso signaling is required for zzso gene expression in mouse zzso and skin and suggest that a convergence of these pathways in the nucleus rather than the zzso may be critical for regulation of inflammatory pathways in skin by zzso
