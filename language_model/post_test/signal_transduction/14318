zzso precursor protein zzso is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease zzso but its zzso function is largely zzso zzso has been found to regulate retrograde transport of nerve growth factor zzso which plays a crucial role in zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso we reveal the mechanism underlying zzso zzso trafficking, by demonstrating a direct interaction between zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso leads to reduced cell surface levels of zzso and increased zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso cells manifest defects in zzso outgrowth and are more susceptible to zzso zzso death at zzso levels of zzso However, zzso cells show better responses to zzso differentiation and survival than control zzso This may be attributed to increased zzso zzso and enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso upon zzso stimulation in zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso mediates zzso of zzso receptors through direct interaction, thereby regulating zzso of zzso and zzso downstream signaling pathways for zzso survival and zzso
