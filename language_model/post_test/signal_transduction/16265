zzso are the most abundant zzso and have a short zzso dying by zzso approximately five days after leaving the bone zzso Their zzso can be delayed at sites of inflammation to extend their functional zzso but inappropriate zzso of zzso contributes to chronic inflammatory zzso zzso of the zzso iron zzso zzso are raised at sites of inflammation and we have shown previously that zzso zzso inhibited human zzso zzso but the mechanisms involved were not zzso Here we report that the zzso effect of zzso is dependent upon its iron zzso status as zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso We also show that the effect of zzso is zzso at an early stage in zzso as it inhibited zzso of zzso generation of zzso zzso of zzso 8 and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso induced by zzso zzso supporting the proposal that it acts upstream of zzso zzso We therefore conclude that raised zzso levels are likely to contribute to chronic inflammation by delaying zzso zzso and that this is achieved by zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
