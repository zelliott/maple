zzso hormones reduce zzso tolerance in humans and zzso This effect is related to a decrease of zzso insulin zzso following a reduction of pancreatic beta cell mass due to beta cell zzso The aim of this study was to analyze in zzso the mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso zzso on the cell viability and cell cycle caused by changes of cell death or proliferation rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to increasing zzso zzso up to 500 zzso resulted in a significant viability zzso This zzso toxicity was caused by an increased zzso cell death rate, which was accompanied by a decreased proliferation zzso zzso effects of zzso on zzso insulin zzso were already seen after 24 h of zzso indicating that the deleterious effects of zzso were zzso changing from specific cellular zzso to a severe and extended zzso of the cellular survival zzso Only zzso zzso higher than 250 zzso were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of zzso and to reduce zzso insulin zzso These zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than the concentration range of zzso zzso zzso indicating that other zzso mechanisms beyond the zzso level must be responsible for the observed toxic effects of zzso in zzso
