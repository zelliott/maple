To offer a comprehensive review on the roles that zzso zzso or engulfed by zzso or zzso proteins in these cells, play in the development and progression of zzso zzso 

zzso abundant within the plaque have the capacity to zzso zzso zzso signaling and to induce cell zzso These activities may contribute to formation of the complex zzso expansion of the zzso core, and to plaque zzso On the contrary, several zzso zzso generated by cholesterol zzso act as zzso of liver X zzso stimulate zzso cholesterol zzso repress zzso zzso and promote zzso survival, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins represent a family of zzso and zzso sensors that may contribute to the regulatory impact of these zzso lipids on processes relevant in the context of zzso 

The generation and deposition of zzso within the developing plaque is envisioned to zzso zzso zzso zzso to affect the delicate balance of zzso and zzso zzso and to impact cell fate decisions, thus, determining whether the zzso remains benign or whether it develops into a zzso vulnerable zzso
