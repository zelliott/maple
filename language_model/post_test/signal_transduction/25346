zzso vascular disease is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process, and zzso has been shown to be a component of the inflammatory zzso Additionally, recent studies indicate that zzso contributes to an zzso zzso We hypothesized that this may be the result of a direct effect of zzso on zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso Human carotid zzso plaques were obtained from patients by zzso The zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso was detected in these zzso plaques by quantitative real-time zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Analysis at the protein level using zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso was abundantly present in zzso near the zzso core and shoulder regions of the zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso is present in zzso of the zzso plaque at sites of most prominent zzso We therefore propose that zzso zzso signaling contributes to the local inflammatory response within the zzso plaque and thus to zzso
