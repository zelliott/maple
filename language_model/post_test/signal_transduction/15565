Both zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso bind and activate zzso zzso zzso however, only zzso binds zzso To understand the biological differences between zzso and zzso in zzso we established transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice showed a significant increase in mature blood zzso However, zzso transgenic mice exhibited severe inflammation and zzso with increased zzso as well as zzso and zzso vessel zzso zzso transgenic mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed decreases in zzso and inflammation with less recruitment of zzso cells, suggesting an involvement of zzso in these adverse zzso zzso might be more useful than zzso for zzso zzso
