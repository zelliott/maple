The zzso marginal zone of the zzso zzso contains zzso zzso cells that continue to zzso and add new zzso and zzso peripherally during the embryonic stages - even after the formation of a functional zzso To understand the molecular mechanism that controls the prolonged zzso cell proliferation in the zzso marginal zone, we employed a candidate zzso approach, focusing on zzso (formerly know as zzso which is expressed in the marginal most tip of the zzso zzso 4 and 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in the peripheral and central part of the zzso zzso zzso a downstream zzso signaling zzso was expressed at high levels in the zzso marginal zone with expression gradually decreasing towards the central zzso The zzso region, which is where zzso signaling is supposedly zzso expressed a set of molecular markers that are characteristic of the zzso cells in the zzso marginal zzso zzso of zzso by use of in zzso zzso in the central zzso inhibited zzso differentiation and induced the zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso downstream signaling zzso by a zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of the cells in the marginal area, which resulted in their premature zzso zzso The zzso cells in the zzso marginal zone differentiated into all the zzso and zzso cell types when cultured in zzso and they proliferated for a longer period than did centrally located zzso cells that underwent a limited number of cell zzso In addition, the proliferation of these zzso cells was promoted in the presence of zzso These results suggest that zzso functions to maintain zzso zzso cells in the zzso marginal zone, and thus serves as a putative stem cell factor in the zzso
