zzso zzso stem cells in bone zzso differentiate into zzso zzso and other zzso Balanced zzso of stem cells is essential for the formation and maintenance of bone zzso however, the mechanisms that control this balance remain largely zzso Whereas zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso regulatory zzso between zzso and zzso signals might occur during zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso function of zzso is suppressed by zzso and zzso and that this suppression is zzso through zzso activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso a downstream cascade associated with zzso and zzso zzso Unlike suppression of the zzso zzso function by zzso protein zzso growth factor zzso through zzso of the zzso domain, zzso blocks zzso binding to DNA by forming a complex with zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that expression of zzso and zzso in bone zzso may alter the fate of zzso zzso stem cells, directing cellular differentiation towards zzso rather than zzso by suppressing zzso function through zzso activated by the zzso zzso
