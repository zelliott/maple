While it is clear that cancer arises from the zzso of genetic zzso that zzso the zzso cell with the properties of uncontrolled growth and zzso the precise combinations of zzso that program human tumor cell growth remain zzso The study of the transforming proteins derived from DNA tumor viruses in experimental models of transformation has provided fundamental insights into the process of cell zzso We recently reported that zzso of the zzso virus 40 zzso early region zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of the zzso gene in normal human zzso kidney zzso and zzso zzso cells converted these cells to a zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso contributes to zzso transformation in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso three zzso pathways through the actions of the zzso large T zzso zzso and the zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso simultaneously zzso the zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso however, complete transformation of human cells requires the additional zzso of protein zzso 2A by zzso zzso of ST in this setting stimulates cell zzso permits zzso growth, and zzso increased resistance to zzso zzso Taken together, these observations define the elements of the zzso zzso required for the transformation of human cells and begin to delineate a set of zzso pathways whose zzso in aggregate, appears to be necessary to generate zzso human zzso
