Debate exists regarding the role of zzso in the zzso of insulin zzso The aim of this study was to directly assess the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and metabolism in skeletal muscle cells and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of zzso 

We used zzso rat skeletal muscle cells and examined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso We assessed zzso metabolism by measuring the incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso and zzso production, as well as the zzso level and total protein content of insulin zzso zzso including insulin zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso rat skeletal muscle cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso content at the cell surface, with no zzso in the production of zzso or zzso zzso also decreased zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso via the zzso cycle was reduced by zzso whereas zzso production was zzso Although insulin zzso protein level and zzso were zzso by zzso production of zzso but not zzso was zzso and a decreased zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso was observed, while total zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso production was zzso 

Our data show that zzso regulates the function of zzso and zzso and decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso Selective decreases in zzso zzso metabolism via zzso and conversion to zzso were also induced by zzso These observations highlight the potential role of zzso in the zzso of type 2 diabetes in zzso
