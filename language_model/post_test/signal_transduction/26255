The nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso is implicated in various zzso zzso zzso signals zzso by forming a complex with the receptors zzso and zzso however, it can also induce zzso growth, proposed to be zzso by the zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso The way in which these dual effects occur in adult zzso is zzso We investigated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso sensory zzso isolated from adult mouse zzso root zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso requiring zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth rarely occurred in zzso zzso but was commonly observed in zzso zzso zzso that associated closely with zzso zzso zzso was unable to induce local zzso effects at growth cones where zzso zzso was zzso We propose that in adult sensory zzso the zzso response to zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso may participate in zzso and zzso dependent zzso of zzso The potential ability of local zzso cells to provide a targeted supply of zzso may provide an important way to promote zzso (rather than zzso outcomes under conditions where zzso or zzso is zzso
