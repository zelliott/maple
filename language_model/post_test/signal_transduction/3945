zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and is composed of a heavy and a light zzso Although the heavy zzso is zzso active alone, the light zzso plays an important regulatory role by making the zzso function more zzso In the current study we examined whether conditions which are known to influence gene expression of the heavy zzso also influence that of the light zzso and the mechanisms zzso Treatment of cultured rat zzso with hormones such as insulin and zzso or zzso zzso under low cell density increased the zzso zzso level of the heavy zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the steady state zzso level and gene zzso rates of both zzso These treatments share in common their ability to induce zzso stress and activate nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had no influence on the zzso zzso B and zzso zzso zzso levels, but blocked the zzso of zzso B by zzso zzso and zzso and the increase in zzso heavy zzso zzso level by zzso and zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso level was unaffected by zzso and zzso Thus only the heavy zzso is zzso regulated and growth sensitive, whereas both zzso are regulated by zzso zzso zzso through zzso B is involved only in the zzso changes in the heavy zzso gene zzso
