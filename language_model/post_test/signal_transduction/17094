The zzso factor zzso is a family of proteins involved in signaling pathways essential for normal cellular functions and zzso zzso of various components of this zzso resulted with abnormal skeletal zzso Research in the last decade has established that zzso signaling mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso it was shown that zzso of zzso was an effective approach to inhibit zzso formation and bone zzso zzso Identification of the molecular machinery underlying zzso zzso permitted zzso deletion of the major components of this zzso As a result, it was clear that deletion of members of the zzso zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso and downstream regulators affected skeletal zzso These studies provided several targets of therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso zzso activity has been also described as the centerpiece of inflammatory responses and is considered a potent zzso of inflammatory zzso Indeed, inflammatory insults exacerbate zzso zzso zzso signals leading to exaggerated responses and to inflammatory zzso These superimposed zzso activities appear to zzso several bone zzso This review will describe the individual roles of zzso molecules in bone zzso and inflammatory zzso
