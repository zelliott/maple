zzso models of signal zzso have emerged as valuable tools for untangling complex signaling networks and gaining detailed insight into zzso zzso The natural extension of these tools is for the design of therapeutic zzso We have generated a novel zzso model of zzso zzso signaling in the context of zzso production in inflammatory zzso Using experimental measurement of protein levels and zzso time courses, populations of model parameters were zzso With a collection of zzso sets, reflecting virtual diversity, we step through analysis of the zzso signaling zzso model to answer specific drug discovery questions regarding target zzso inhibitor zzso model zzso and zzso We demonstrate that target selection cannot be assessed independently from inhibitor mechanism of action and is also linked with zzso to cellular zzso Finally, we assert that in the face of zzso uncertainty one can still uncover consistent findings that can guide drug discovery zzso
