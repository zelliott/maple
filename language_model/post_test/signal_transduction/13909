The zzso hormone zzso acts in the brain to zzso the central driver of zzso the zzso releasing hormone zzso zzso zzso This effect is zzso as zzso zzso do not express zzso receptors zzso Here we test whether zzso or zzso zzso provide the intermediate zzso between the site of zzso action and the zzso zzso zzso receptors were deleted from zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso and the downstream effects on zzso onset and reproduction were zzso Both mouse lines displayed the expected increase in body weight and zzso loss of zzso signaling in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso females and males showed significantly delayed zzso zzso Adult fertility observations revealed that these zzso animals have decreased zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso mice displayed normal zzso Assessment of the zzso zzso axis regulation in females showed that zzso action on zzso zzso is not necessary for zzso suppression of zzso zzso hormone zzso (an indirect measure of zzso zzso zzso but is required for regulation of a full zzso zzso hormone zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling in zzso (but not zzso zzso plays a critical role in the timing of zzso onset and is involved in fertility regulation throughout adulthood in both zzso These results form an important step in explaining the role of central zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso cells will enable future research to focus on a few specific types of zzso
