In zzso zzso cells, zzso mediates signaling between zzso and zzso zzso by zzso binding its gamma zzso zzso For the termination of signaling zzso zzso by the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso is zzso This reaction can be accelerated by zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso Recently we identified a second retinal GAP that interacts with zzso zzso Here we compare the GAP function of zzso and zzso Both proteins zzso single turnover zzso of zzso however, zzso was more effective than zzso When added together, zzso competitively inhibited the zzso zzso In addition, the interaction of zzso in its zzso form zzso the transition state zzso and the zzso form zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, was measured by surface zzso zzso zzso displayed highest affinity for zzso weaker affinity for zzso and weakest affinity for zzso zzso exhibited only a comparable high affinity for zzso We conclude that the observed competition between zzso and zzso for zzso occurs when the zzso of zzso is zzso By competing with zzso and removing it from zzso as well as increasing zzso release, zzso apparently zzso signal termination and zzso zzso
