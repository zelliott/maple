Health risks from exposure to low doses of zzso radiation zzso are becoming a concern due to the rapidly growing medical applications of zzso Using zzso techniques, this study aims for a better understanding of whole blood response to low and high doses of zzso 

zzso of peripheral blood samples were zzso with 0, zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso was isolated and prepared for zzso gene expression zzso zzso approaches, zzso zzso statistics and Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso were used for analyzing the data zzso Seven zzso expressed genes were selected for further confirmation using quantitative real-time zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of genes zzso expressed at zzso zzso showed the enrichment of zzso and zzso zzso However, responsive genes to 1 zzso were mainly involved in tumor zzso protein 53 zzso zzso In a second approach, zzso showed a higher statistical ranking of inflammatory and zzso gene sets that are involved in both responding and/or zzso of growth factors, zzso and zzso This indicates the zzso of the immune zzso zzso gene sets enriched at 1 zzso were zzso radiation pathways like zzso zzso zzso DNA damage and zzso Comparative zzso studies showed the significant induction of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and DNA damage and repair genes at 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

This study moves a step forward in understanding the different cellular responses to low and high doses of zzso In addition to that, and in a broader context, it addresses the need for more attention to the risk assessment of health effects resulting from the exposure to low doses of zzso
