zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso activates zzso pathways that promote zzso zzso and decrease zzso in zzso In the present study, we show that zzso transport and zzso are zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso are increased in the heart of zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transport proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso transport protein as well as activity of zzso zzso 1, the zzso zzso for zzso fat zzso were significantly lower in the heart of zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso was decreased significantly in the heart of zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso factor controlling genes of zzso zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and the association of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso were significantly higher under both zzso and zzso conditions in zzso zzso This increased insulin sensitivity translated to a zzso greater zzso zzso and zzso higher rate of zzso zzso in the zzso compared with zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso causes a shift in cardiac zzso zzso from zzso to zzso by zzso insulin zzso decreasing zzso zzso and reducing expression of zzso zzso genes in the zzso This increase in cardiac insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso due to zzso zzso could prove therapeutic in pathological conditions such as obesity that are characterized by skewed cardiac zzso zzso
