zzso like other complex zzso organisms, possess highly evolved systems for the delivery of zzso to all the cells of the zzso These systems are regulated since excessive levels of zzso are zzso In animals zzso causes an increase in the zzso levels of specific zzso including those zzso for vascular zzso growth factor and zzso At the zzso level, the hypoxic response is zzso by zzso factor zzso an zzso zzso zzso is zzso present, but zzso levels are regulated by zzso Under hypoxic conditions, levels of zzso rise, allowing its zzso with zzso and enabling zzso zzso Under zzso conditions both the level of zzso and its ability to enable zzso are directly controlled by its zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso at either of two zzso zzso zzso enables its recognition by the von zzso zzso zzso protein which targets it for zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso directly prevents its interaction with the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by members of the iron zzso and zzso dependent zzso zzso In humans, three zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso domain zzso and an zzso zzso zzso for factor zzso zzso have been zzso Recent studies have identified additional zzso modifications of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso hypoxic response is of potential use in a wide range of disease states including cardiovascular disease and zzso Here we review current knowledge of the zzso zzso focusing on its regulation by zzso and discussion of potential targets and challenges in attempts to zzso the zzso for medicinal zzso
