We examined if a combination of proliferation markers and zzso zzso zzso activity could predict early versus late relapses in zzso breast cancer and inform the choice and length of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso profiles from zzso patients who received no systemic therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen for 5 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 58 patients treated with zzso zzso for 3 months zzso available at zzso 14 and 90 zzso were zzso A proliferation score based on the expression of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso score zzso adopted from zzso zzso were zzso The same analysis was performed using the zzso Grade Index as proliferation marker and the zzso gene score from the zzso zzso as measure of zzso zzso Median values were used to define low and high marker groups and four combinations were zzso zzso were grouped into time zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the overall 10 years period, the zzso hazards assumption was violated for several zzso groups indicating zzso zzso In zzso patients zzso zzso had continuously increasing risk of zzso that was higher after 5 years than zzso zzso zzso to 10 year, zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso had low risk of early zzso zzso years zzso zzso p zzso zzso but high risk of late zzso which was higher than in the zzso group zzso 5 years zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso subset had most of the early relapses zzso to zzso years, zzso zzso p zzso zzso especially in zzso negative tumors and showed minimal response to zzso zzso These findings were zzso confirmed in a smaller independent cohort of zzso zzso Using different zzso provided similar zzso 

Early relapses are highest in highly zzso zzso in particular in zzso negative zzso zzso occurring after 5 years of zzso tamoxifen are highest among the zzso tumors although their risk of recurrence is modest in the first 5 years on zzso These tumors could be the best candidates for extended zzso zzso
