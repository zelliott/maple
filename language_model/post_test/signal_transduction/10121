Many bacterial pathogens use the type III zzso system to inject zzso proteins into host zzso Here, we report the identification of a 24 member zzso protein family found in pathogens including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Members of this family zzso host cell function by mimicking the signaling properties of zzso zzso The zzso zzso stimulates cellular responses analogous to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso function as the active forms of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso do not bind zzso zzso or have sequences corresponding the zzso zzso domain, suggesting that they are functional but not structural zzso However, several of these zzso harbor zzso targeting sequences that contribute to their signaling zzso The activities of zzso zzso and zzso are dependent on an zzso zzso motif found in numerous zzso leading to the speculation that they all function by a similar molecular zzso
