We have previously shown that the binding of zzso with zzso zzso component zzso zzso can improve the ability of zzso zzso cells zzso in resisting zzso injury by zzso the activity of zzso and increasing the content of zzso However, the molecular mechanism or its signaling zzso of this protection is still zzso In order to examine the zzso signaling mechanism activated by zzso binding reaction, the present study investigated the zzso expression of zzso in primary cultured rabbit zzso using zzso based on a zzso model made with ozone zzso The product bands of target gene zzso were checked with Southern zzso and zzso probe zzso The results showed that zzso (10 zzso promoted the zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was abolished either by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These results indicate that the promotion of zzso activity induced by zzso reaction is partly due to the zzso of zzso zzso transcription, and that its zzso are possibly relevant to zzso zzso or zzso zzso
