zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is induced on zzso and zzso T cells upon engagement of the T cell zzso zzso zzso complex with the zzso bound to zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso signal during T cell zzso However, zzso signal zzso pathways have remained zzso We conducted the zzso zzso screening to identify zzso signaling molecules that associate with zzso A novel zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso named zzso was found to specifically interact with the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso activity was induced by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso regulates the zzso signaling zzso which result in the zzso of zzso and zzso
