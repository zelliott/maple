zzso cell zzso involves the elevated expression of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These expression profiles may be regulated by zzso cell signaling zzso In the current study, an zzso zzso triple zzso zzso zzso derived from type I collagen zzso zzso was examined for induction of human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso composed of a mixture of the zzso zzso and a second, zzso zzso incorporating the zzso cell zzso region of zzso zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso was studied for induction of zzso zzso Following zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso vascular and zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso whereas that of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso whereas zzso protein expression zzso zzso of the zzso zzso initiated a zzso response similar to that of tumor necrosis zzso zzso but was not sufficient to induce an inflammatory zzso zzso of the zzso region had only a slight effect on zzso zzso Other zzso zzso interactions appear to be required to elicit an inflammatory zzso The zzso zzso specific triple zzso zzso zzso described zzso represents a more general in zzso model system by which gene expression and protein production profiles induced by binding to a single cellular zzso type can be zzso
