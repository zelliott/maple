Type III zzso system zzso plays an important role in zzso or zzso of many zzso or symbiotic bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts like a tunnel between a zzso and its host through which the zzso zzso zzso proteins into the latter zzso zzso 2006; zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and temporally modify the host zzso pathways zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso Cell Host zzso zzso In spite its crucial role in zzso interaction, the study of zzso and the associated zzso has been limited to a few bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso Nat Rev zzso zzso 2008; zzso zzso zzso zzso Before one set out to perform systematic experimental studies on an unknown set of bacteria it would be beneficial to identify the potential candidates by developing an in zzso screening zzso A system level study would also be advantageous over traditional laboratory methods to extract an overriding theme for zzso interaction, if any, from the vast resources of data generated by sequencing multiple bacterial zzso 

We have developed an in zzso protocol in which the most zzso set of zzso proteins was used as the query against the entire bacterial database with increasingly stringent search zzso It enabled us to identify several zzso zzso positive zzso We adopted a similar strategy to predict the presence of the already known zzso in the newly identified zzso positive zzso The huge resources of zzso data zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso Cell Host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso enabled us to search for the common theme in zzso zzso zzso We identified few cellular zzso networks in the host, which are manipulated by most of the zzso containing zzso We went on to look for zzso if any, between the biological zzso of a particular class of bacteria with the zzso they zzso We could pin point few zzso which were enriched in certain classes of zzso 

The current study would open up new avenues to explore many zzso zzso positive zzso The experimental validation of the predictions from this study will unravel a generalized mechanism for zzso positive bacterial infection into host zzso
