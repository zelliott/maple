zzso of early steps in the insulin signaling cascade in human skeletal muscle was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso clamp in seven healthy young men 3 h after zzso zzso zzso insulin stimulation zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of thigh zzso zzso muscle insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the rested zzso Twenty minutes after zzso of insulin infusion, the level of these parameters returned toward zzso A twofold higher zzso zzso clearance in the exercised compared with the rested thigh was accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and by a decreased zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso zzso Prior exercise caused significantly faster zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso clearance compared with those in the rested zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human skeletal zzso However, increased insulin action after exercise is not caused by zzso of these steps in the insulin signaling zzso In contrast, at steady state, paradoxically decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in exercised zzso Thus, the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may not always be tightly coupled during insulin stimulation in human zzso
