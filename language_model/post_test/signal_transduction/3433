The use of methamphetamine zzso has increased in recent years, and is a major health concern throughout the zzso The use of MA has been associated with an increased risk of acquiring zzso along with an increased probability of the acquisition of various sexually transmitted zzso In order to determine the potential effects of MA exposure in the context of an infectious agent, zzso zzso were exposed to various combinations of MA and bacterial zzso zzso Treatment with MA alone caused significant increases in the levels of zzso while treatment with both MA and zzso resulted in significant increases in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The increases in zzso or zzso levels seen when cells were treated with both zzso and MA were generally greater than those increases observed when cells were treated with only zzso Treatment with chemical zzso demonstrated that the signal zzso pathways including zzso zzso and zzso were involved in zzso the increased inflammatory zzso As discussed in the paper, these pathways appear to be zzso by both MA and zzso in the induction of these inflammatory zzso Since these pathways are involved in the induction of inflammation in response to other zzso this suggests that zzso inflammation may be a common feature of infectious disease in MA zzso
