zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso interact with the zzso protein zzso through an zzso segment termed the zzso zzso In zzso which regulates its own transcription, the zzso box is preceded by an zzso extension that interacts with the zzso protein zzso Here, zzso spin labeling was used to examine the structural basis for zzso signaling and zzso box regulation in zzso zzso zzso indicates that regions of the zzso domain are in zzso exchange, consistent with its role as a protein binding zzso however, the local fold and dynamics of the domain are not altered by zzso or zzso zzso restraints derived from pulse zzso were used to generate models for the position of the extension in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso state, this domain is positioned at the zzso surface of zzso where it interacts with the zzso box and blocks access of the zzso box to the zzso zzso addition zzso the zzso domain and exposes the zzso box, leading to a disorder transition in the zzso box that may facilitate interactions with zzso When a soluble zzso of zzso is bound to zzso the zzso domain is displaced to one edge of the barrel, consistent with a proposed zzso exchange zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso zzso the zzso further into the zzso This result suggests that the intact zzso system mediates both signaling and transport by unfolding portions of the zzso
