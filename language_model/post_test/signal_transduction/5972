When resources are zzso zzso zzso larvae arrest as zzso zzso under the control of zzso and zzso signaling zzso However, critical questions remain regarding the regulation of this zzso zzso How do three dozen zzso proteins regulate one zzso zzso zzso to control complex events in zzso metabolism and zzso How are signals from the zzso and zzso pathways zzso What gene expression programs do these pathways zzso and how do they control complex downstream events? 

We have identified genes that show different levels of expression in a comparison of zzso zzso or zzso larvae zzso to zzso zzso at similar zzso stages undergoing zzso zzso Many zzso zzso and other known zzso regulatory genes have changes in expression that suggest strong positive feedback by the zzso zzso In addition, many zzso zzso and novel genes with similarity to the zzso domain of zzso receptors have altered zzso We have identified a large group of regulated genes with putative binding sites for the zzso zzso factor, zzso Genes with zzso sites upstream of the zzso start site tend to be zzso whereas genes with zzso sites downstream of the coding region tend to be zzso Finally, we also see strong regulation of many novel zzso and zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and other regulatory zzso 

The feedback regulation of zzso zzso and other zzso genes that we observe would be predicted to amplify signals from the zzso zzso this amplification may serve to ensure a decisive choice between zzso and zzso even if environmental cues are zzso Up and down regulation of zzso zzso and novel genes with similarity to the zzso domain of zzso receptors suggests opposing roles for several members of these large gene zzso Unlike in adults, most genes with putative zzso binding sites are zzso during zzso entry, suggesting that zzso has different activity in zzso versus adult metabolism and zzso However, our observation that the position of putative zzso binding sites is correlated with the direction of regulation suggests a novel method of achieving zzso regulation from a single zzso We see evidence of zzso regulation of several other classes of regulatory zzso and we discuss possible functions of these genes in zzso zzso
