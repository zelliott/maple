Although the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known zzso of zzso signals after B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso with the low affinity zzso zzso it is not known whether zzso functions to inhibit signals after stimulation through the zzso zzso Here, we show using zzso mice that zzso is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso B cell zzso and B cell zzso We demonstrate a critical role for zzso in termination of zzso zzso zzso signals that follow zzso zzso zzso with enhanced zzso zzso we find that zzso B cells from zzso mice display enhanced sensitivity to zzso induction of the zzso markers zzso and zzso We further demonstrate that zzso regulates the rate of B cell development in the bone zzso and zzso as B cell precursors from zzso mice progress more rapidly through the immature and transitional zzso zzso Finally, we observe that zzso B cells have increased resistance to zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate a central role for zzso in regulation of zzso signaling and B cell biology, from signal driven development in the bone zzso and zzso to zzso and death in the zzso
