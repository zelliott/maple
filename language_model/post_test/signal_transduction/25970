Most zzso signal through zzso zzso complexes consisting of two or more different zzso zzso Fusion proteins of the zzso parts of zzso zzso turned out to be promising zzso zzso useful in zzso therapy and zzso zzso 

We constructed zzso fusion proteins zzso consisting of the zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso connected by a flexible zzso as potential zzso zzso zzso is a shared zzso zzso that is also used by other zzso such as zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso In this study we compare four types of zzso that contain either zzso zzso or zzso D2-D3 of zzso and are arranged in two zzso zzso D1 of zzso turned out to be zzso for zzso However, the arrangement of the two zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso We found zzso induced zzso zzso to be suppressed only when the zzso zzso was fused in front of the zzso zzso 

zzso consisting of zzso of zzso and D2-D3 of zzso is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of zzso Since zzso is zzso by a single gene it offers numerous possibilities for specific zzso zzso in gene delivery approaches based on viral zzso transgenic animals and finally gene zzso
