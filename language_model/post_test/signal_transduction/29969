Host defense against microbes requires the development of an efficient immune response aimed to eradicate the source of zzso Through the expression of a battery of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso receptors and zzso zzso the innate immune system, which is a prerequisite to the zzso immune response, detects microbial motifs and zzso zzso zzso Current research into innate immune function focuses on the nature of the zzso detected by this system, the cell signaling that occurs downstream of zzso zzso and finally, how these signals culminate into a tailored zzso immune response directed to eradicate a specific zzso
