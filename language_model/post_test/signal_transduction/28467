Defending cellular integrity against disturbances in zzso zzso of zzso zzso is predicated on zzso the selection of zzso and their flux through zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso transfer from sites of production to zzso zzso zzso and the regulation of processes consuming energy zzso zzso Whereas NO and its zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso are emerging as key zzso zzso zzso supply and demand, mechanisms zzso this zzso with zzso and energetic signaling remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso sensor whose responsiveness to NO is regulated by zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso predicting zzso zzso of NO signaling in cells maintaining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by interacting with a regulatory site that prefers zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso in zzso by zzso and zzso clamping or zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulate NO signaling by zzso Thus, zzso serves as a zzso zzso for NO signaling by zzso At zzso zzso NO zzso of zzso is zzso whereas insults that reduce zzso zzso zzso and amplify responses to zzso zzso zzso forms a key zzso zzso zzso energetic, and cell zzso wherein zzso is the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and regulated zzso of zzso the zzso
