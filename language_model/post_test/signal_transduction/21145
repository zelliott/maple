The zzso protein zzso acts as a zzso zzso for zzso signals controlling cell fate choices in zzso and zzso zzso and molecular evidence indicates that, during zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso of zzso zzso zzso the signal of N zzso by its zzso Delta zzso zzso plays a direct role in the immediate response of the zzso to N signaling by zzso the zzso of the zzso of split Complex zzso zzso These findings suggest that the N zzso zzso can be described as a simple, linear cascade of molecular zzso At the molecular level, the mechanism of zzso zzso is yet zzso Two zzso models have been zzso In the first one, zzso binds to inactive N at the zzso The binding of D1 to N in the zzso space somehow interferes with the zzso zzso retention of zzso resulting in the nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso In the second model, zzso zzso is proposed to be zzso in the nucleus by the direct binding of a processed form of zzso acting as a zzso zzso This nuclear N protein would be generated by the zzso zzso zzso of the N zzso zzso
