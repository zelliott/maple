To investigate the relationship between zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso long term zzso zzso induced by nicotine in area CA zzso 

zzso recording of population spike zzso was performed within the zzso cell layer of zzso area zzso in zzso Western zzso analysis was employed to detect the active zzso state and the total protein expression of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso attenuated the induction of zzso induced by nicotine 10 zzso both zzso and zzso zzso were activated with their total protein expression increasing in zzso zzso in response to zzso induced by zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso induced by zzso
