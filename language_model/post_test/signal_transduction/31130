In this study, we determined conditions leading to the development of colitis in mice with zzso binding zzso domain 2 zzso zzso a zzso factor in Crohn's zzso We found that zzso zzso cells zzso produced increased amounts of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso coli that express zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso zzso heightened zzso zzso responses from zzso zzso zzso T zzso We then demonstrated that zzso mice zzso transferred zzso zzso T cells and that administered zzso zzso developed colitis associated with the expansion of zzso zzso T cells producing zzso zzso this colitis was highly dependent on zzso zzso 2 zzso function since it was suppressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso mice become susceptible to colitis as a result of increased zzso responses when they have the capacity to respond to an zzso expressed by zzso zzso
