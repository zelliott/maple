The zzso zzso is a zzso protein that plays a critical role in several aspects of zzso development through interaction with its unique zzso zzso A key mechanism that controls zzso responsiveness to zzso signals during zzso growth is zzso zzso Since we previously reported that zzso regulates zzso development without affecting the other zzso we asked whether this could correlate with a zzso trafficking of zzso We thus studied zzso behavior upon zzso exposure in rat zzso slices and in zzso zzso zzso A massive zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was observed in zzso whereas no modification was evidenced in zzso Our data suggest that zzso trafficking may play a role in zzso selective effects of zzso on distinct zzso membrane zzso
