zzso receptors zzso play a crucial role in many biological processes and represent a major class of drug zzso However, zzso of zzso for zzso study is difficult and current methods of studying zzso interactions involve in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that uses zzso expressed in zzso zzso to detect bacteria and environmental compounds, making this an ideal system for studying in zzso zzso zzso We sought to test this by functionally expressing two medically important zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso 5 zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso allow zzso zzso to specifically detect and respond to zzso and zzso respectively in a robust avoidance zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can signal via different zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso depending on which cells it is expressed zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso transgenic animals to its zzso leads to zzso zzso and zzso adaptation to subsequent zzso exposure, providing further evidence of integration of the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso In zzso studies using a panel of zzso zzso we identified key zzso involved in the interaction of zzso with zzso 

Our results illustrate a remarkable evolutionary plasticity in interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso machinery, spanning 800 million years of zzso This in zzso system, which zzso novel avoidance zzso on zzso zzso thus provides a simple means of studying and screening interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso
