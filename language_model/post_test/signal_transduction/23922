We have previously shown that different zzso stimuli require signaling through the zzso cascade to induce LDL zzso zzso The present studies were designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso LDL zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, a modified zzso cell line in which the zzso cascade can be specifically activated by zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Using these cells, we show that: a) LDL zzso induction was reduced in reporter zzso containing zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso sites, whereas zzso of both sites abolished the zzso b) zzso which zzso zzso binding protein zzso a common zzso of zzso binding protein and zzso strongly zzso the zzso c) zzso zzso of the 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade reduced LDL zzso zzso zzso highly selective protein zzso C zzso zzso effectively zzso the induction without affecting zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso beta significantly induced LDL zzso promoter zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso and zzso beta are downstream zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso are part of the zzso complex resulting in induction of LDL zzso expression in response to zzso of the zzso zzso These findings identify for the first time a role for zzso beta in determining the specificity of zzso signaling by participating with zzso in regulating gene zzso
