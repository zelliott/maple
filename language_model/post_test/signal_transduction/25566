zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, is associated with cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is also required for the maintenance of zzso cohesion, the maturation of zzso the formation of bipolar zzso and the completion of zzso Here we identified that zzso zzso with itself to form zzso in cells, whereas zzso the zzso zzso failed to form zzso zzso was zzso and the main functions of zzso such as zzso activity, zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso signal zzso were dependent on its zzso Furthermore, the in zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso at zzso By zzso we created zzso zzso and zzso zzso which mimic the zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso The zzso zzso could not form zzso and be zzso by the wild type zzso and finally lost the zzso zzso Further functional research revealed that zzso failed to repress the zzso of zzso zzso and enhance the cell zzso Overall, our data indicated that zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso might affect zzso signaling zzso
