zzso restriction zzso remains the most robust environmental intervention for altering aging processes and increasing zzso and zzso Emerging from progress made in many nonhuman models, current research has expanded to zzso controlled human studies of zzso Since long-term zzso requires a major commitment of will power and long-term negative consequences remain to be determined, the concept of a calorie restriction zzso zzso has become a new area of investigation within zzso We have proposed that a zzso is a compound that mimics zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso activates stress response pathways observed in zzso and enhances stress protection, produces zzso effects on zzso reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful function, all without significantly reducing food zzso Over 12 years ago, we introduced the concept of zzso zzso as a strategy for developing zzso of zzso We have argued that zzso energy zzso as far upstream as possible might offer a broader range of zzso effects as opposed to targeting a singular molecular target zzso As the first candidate zzso zzso a known zzso provided a remarkable zzso of zzso but turned out to produce zzso in zzso Since the introduction of zzso as a candidate zzso many different targets for development have now been proposed at more downstream sites, including insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso This review discusses these various strategies to assess their current status and future potential for this emerging research zzso
