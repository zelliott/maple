The work group identified a number of research areas where they felt there were significant data gaps where additional research was critical to better under standing of the origins of birth defects and to developing ways for their zzso These zzso zzso Studies designed to determine the role of growth and differentiation factors during zzso and zzso stages of zzso These investigations could include descriptive studies involving the zzso and timing of genes expressed and their products, but must also emphasize and include studies involving the function of these molecules and their interactions in normal and abnormal zzso zzso Studies designed to develop and zzso models for investigating normal and abnormal zzso These approaches could include in zzso and in zzso techniques, such as creation of genetically defined systems and cell, organ, and whole zzso zzso These technologies should emphasize ways to study the functions of growth and differentiation factors and the effects of environmental zzso zzso Studies designed to identify environmental agents and their targets in zzso zzso and maternal zzso that may play a role in producing zzso abnormalities through zzso of growth and differentiation zzso zzso Studies designed to determine cellular and molecular mechanisms for protection and recovery from environmental zzso
