We present a hypothetical zzso model that combines a set of neural circuits at the zzso zzso and system levels and accounts for several zzso and behavioral processes leading to nicotine zzso We propose that combining changes in the zzso zzso response, expressed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso learning in zzso zzso zzso to capture the acquisition of nicotine zzso We show that an opponent process enhanced by persistent zzso renders zzso rigid and habitual by zzso the learning process, resulting in long-term zzso in the absence of the zzso The model implies distinct thresholds on the dosage and duration for the acquisition and persistence of nicotine zzso Our hypothesis unites a number of prevalent ideas on nicotine action into a coherent formal network for further understanding of compulsive drug zzso
