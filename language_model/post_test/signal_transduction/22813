zzso of tumor growth by zzso zzso has been associated with its ability to inhibit zzso The zzso activity of zzso as defined by cornea pocket zzso was previously mapped to the zzso portion of the protein within the zzso region and the type 1 zzso 

We evaluated the specificity and efficacy of different regions of zzso using zzso fragments of the protein on zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso cell proliferation zzso In both zzso fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the zzso region inhibited zzso and zzso cell zzso To further define the sequences responsible for the zzso effect of zzso we used synthetic zzso The zzso zzso defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed zzso The zzso end of the type 1 repeats showed higher potency for zzso zzso driven by basic zzso growth factor zzso whereas the second region equally blocked zzso driven by either zzso or vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso of the active peptides revealed the specific zzso acids required for the zzso zzso One sequence included the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso end of the second and third type 1 repeats, and the other involved the zzso acids that follow the zzso sequence in the zzso of these zzso Both zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso of breast tumor zzso growth in nude mice were independent of the zzso sequence located in the second type 1 zzso 

These results indicate that the type 1 repeats of zzso contain 2 zzso that may independently inhibit zzso They also identify 2 independent pathways by which zzso can block zzso and zzso zzso signals on zzso zzso
