zzso zzso signaling in zzso controls not only the zzso of zzso as fuel for other zzso but is also a driver of brown zzso zzso and energy zzso As the appearance of these zzso zzso active cells in 'white' zzso zzso is correlated with resistance to zzso and zzso zzso the molecular basis of their genesis and zzso activity needs to be zzso zzso receptors regulate the zzso machinery for zzso and fuel zzso They also zzso stimulate the zzso of genes that support the specific functions of white and brown zzso They accomplish this through the zzso of a network of signaling pathways that include zzso protein zzso and members of the zzso protein zzso zzso In brown zzso these zzso control the zzso of nuclear factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as other molecules discovered to respond to zzso signals, to increase zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is also important to understand the mechanisms that may actively repress these zzso zzso Toward that end, we provide evidence for an important role for the nuclear zzso zzso as a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice have increased expression of most zzso of brown zzso increased zzso mass and zzso zzso These studies reveal potential new targets and directions for controlling the relative levels of white versus brown zzso as a means of zzso fuel zzso in the struggle against obesity and related zzso zzso
