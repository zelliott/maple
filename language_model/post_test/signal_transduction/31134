Type I zzso zzso are a family of zzso specialized to coordinate immunity to viruses and other zzso zzso In the past several years, many of the receptors and signaling pathways that link pathogen detection to induction of type I zzso have been identified and zzso An integrated picture has emerged in which type I zzso have essential functions in several seemingly disparate zzso they restrict viral spread by engaging machinery that ultimately zzso and kills infected cells, yet they are also positively linked to the zzso and expansion of zzso that are important for control of zzso zzso These advances highlight the zzso actions of type I zzso and clarify the multiple points at which they are integrated into both innate and zzso zzso
