The nervous and zzso systems zzso the immune system functions through releasing zzso zzso and zzso hormones as they regulate the other zzso zzso The immune system in turn communicates with the nervous and zzso systems through zzso zzso zzso In this report we review our concepts and evidence concerning the zzso role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso role comprises two aspects, the zzso of immune functions by zzso and the effect of the immune system on nervous system zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the central nervous system zzso caused the enhancement of the zzso immune response of rats to sheep red blood cells zzso by contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso activity in the zzso resulted in the suppression of the immune zzso It seems that zzso in the brain plays an zzso zzso The role can be blocked by zzso a zzso zzso but not by zzso a zzso zzso During the zzso immune response zzso 3-6 after zzso zzso activity of zzso in the zzso and zzso was zzso zzso It is suggested that a functional connection is present in the zzso of the brain and the immune zzso In zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso dose range significantly strengthened the zzso cell proliferation induced by zzso zzso zzso The action of zzso only occurred either before or just after T zzso were activated through zzso zzso zzso In zzso the depletion of zzso zzso or only zzso in the zzso caused the impairment of the zzso response of zzso During the zzso of days zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso emerged in the zzso and the zzso zzso of rats, which mainly exhibited that in the peak periods of the zzso response, the metabolism of the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso was markedly increased, but zzso content in the zzso and zzso was significantly zzso These results provide evidence for the zzso information exchange network between the zzso zzso and the immune zzso Exposure to zzso (at zzso zzso concentration zzso in zzso was shown to inhibit the Con zzso proliferation of the rat zzso zzso This effect of zzso was related to the early events involved in the initiation of T cell proliferation and was zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso The evidence that altering zzso level in the central or peripheral nervous systems through various ways of administering the drugs to regulate zzso zzso led to the variations of the zzso response, and that zzso an zzso of zzso zzso can block the action of zzso show that zzso may exert an zzso effect, which appears to be zzso via the peripheral mechanism to relate to the zzso zzso However, the zzso response can cause changes in zzso metabolism in the zzso The possible reasons for these results are zzso zzso the zzso response zzso the zzso variations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the central and peripheral nervous systems and then, these zzso can in turn influence immune function through neurotransmitter relevant receptors present on the zzso The purpose of this interaction is most likely to maintain the zzso of the immune and other zzso zzso
