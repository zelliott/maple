zzso proteins such as zzso play a central role in the formation of signaling complexes through their association with multiple protein binding zzso These interactions are zzso by specialized zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso technology, we have identified a novel adapter zzso expressed predominantly in T zzso that associates with the activated form of the zzso zzso zzso The protein is a member of the zzso family of adapter proteins and contains an zzso domain zzso A unique zzso domain (insert zzso of unknown function is situated between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We term this protein zzso for zzso protein with insert zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso cell zzso following zzso of zzso Using zzso of zzso and zzso we demonstrate that interaction between the proteins is dependent on zzso of zzso at zzso 173 and integrity of the zzso zzso domain, although there are also subsidiary stabilizing contacts between the zzso motifs of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso interacts with a number of other T cell signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso zzso and zzso zzso for activated protein zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso functions as an adapter protein in the zzso zzso zzso in T zzso
