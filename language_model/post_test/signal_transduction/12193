Increased sensitivity of the zzso zzso of the gastrointestinal tract reportedly zzso symptoms of discomfort and pain in functional zzso zzso The present investigation aimed to examine whether the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of small zzso zzso in normal mice and in a zzso model of zzso gut zzso zzso zzso nerve activity was recorded in a mouse zzso preparation maintained in zzso As has been shown zzso ramp zzso of the zzso segment evoked zzso zzso zzso reflecting zzso of low and high threshold zzso The average zzso response curve in mice deficient in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of the zzso control preparations zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso (30 zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso an zzso selective for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the averaged zzso response curve in zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, the magnitude of zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso was greater at day 21 and day 56 zzso compared with the sham control preparations demonstrating the development of zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect upon mechanically evoked zzso discharge rates in sham treated preparations zzso zzso zzso but significantly inhibited zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso in preparations from mice at day 21 zzso zzso 6) and day 56 zzso zzso 7) zzso These results suggest that zzso mechanisms play no role in zzso zzso in the normal small zzso but contribute significantly to zzso zzso
