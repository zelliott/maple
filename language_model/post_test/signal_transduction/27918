zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso leads to rapid zzso of protein zzso zzso which in turn zzso downstream zzso and adapter zzso Some adapter zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso positively regulate zzso signal zzso whereas others, such as zzso play an zzso zzso SLAP zzso adapter zzso an adapter protein containing a zzso zzso 3 and a zzso zzso 2 domain, was isolated from a zzso interacting screen by using zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso interacts with SLAP in zzso and in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We observed that SLAP is expressed in T cells, and upon zzso zzso SLAP interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain in zzso T zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, SLAP forms separate complexes with zzso zzso and zzso through its zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of a zzso SLAP zzso zzso nuclear factor of activated T zzso zzso We have evidence that SLAP forms zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the C zzso of SLAP demonstrate that there is a correlation between the loss of zzso and the zzso of nuclear factor of activated T zzso zzso The in zzso association of SLAP with key signaling molecules and its zzso of T cell zzso suggests that SLAP plays an important role in zzso signal zzso
