We have investigated the effects of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on gene expression in rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso that block initial zzso of zzso to zzso induced the expression of genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso That induction was a direct consequence of interaction with the zzso was shown by the zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso to several other membrane zzso receptors had no effect on zzso gene zzso Less than 2 h of treatment of the zzso with zzso in solution was sufficient to trigger the change in gene zzso and induction was blocked by zzso Unlike other zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and growth factors, addition of the zzso in solution to cells adherent to zzso zzso proteins or collagen produced no zzso change in cell shape or zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso fragments of zzso were ineffective unless zzso or immobilized on the zzso zzso of zzso to native zzso did not induce zzso However, zzso to zzso immobilized peptides containing the zzso sequence that were derived from zzso varying in size from zzso up to 120 zzso induced zzso and zzso gene zzso This suggests that degradation products of zzso are the natural zzso zzso for the zzso These data demonstrate that signals leading to changes in gene expression are zzso by the zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The signaling of changes in gene expression by the zzso is distinct from signaling involving cell shape and zzso zzso At least two distinct signals are zzso the binding of zzso fragments and zzso zzso to the zzso triggers events different from those triggered by binding of the native zzso zzso Because the genes regulated by this zzso are for zzso that degrade the zzso zzso these results suggest that information zzso by the binding of various zzso to zzso may orchestrate the expression of genes regulating cell behavior in the zzso zzso
