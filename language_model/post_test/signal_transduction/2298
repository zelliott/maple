Signaling by zzso proteins zzso occurs when they are charged with zzso while zzso of the bound zzso turns the signaling zzso Despite a wealth of zzso and structural information, the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso remains zzso We have employed zzso zzso as a novel approach to study zzso by zzso In these studies, we have used zzso a unique zzso analog bearing the functional groups that are missing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso found in various human tumors, fails to zzso zzso for an extended zzso In contrast, the zzso analog is zzso by this zzso and by the zzso zzso at the same zzso On the other hand, modification of zzso zzso by zzso zzso which zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso decreased the rates of zzso of both zzso and its analog by zzso These results attest to the specificity of the zzso analog as a unique zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and to the essential role of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the finding that the zzso analog was zzso at the same rate as zzso by the zzso zzso favors a model in which formation of a zzso transition state zzso presumably stabilized by the zzso zzso is not the zzso step of the zzso zzso
