While many large-scale risk factors for zzso zzso valve disease zzso have been identified, the molecular zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso have yet to be fully zzso Specifically, it is unclear what biological phenomena zzso the significantly higher occurrence of zzso in the male zzso We hypothesized the existence of zzso zzso differences between male and female zzso zzso cells zzso that contribute to male sex being a risk factor for zzso zzso in gene expression profiles between healthy male and female zzso zzso were investigated via zzso zzso Mean expression values of each probe set in the male samples were compared to the female samples, and biological processes were analyzed for overrepresentation using Gene zzso term enrichment zzso There were 183 genes identified as significantly zzso zzso zzso different in male versus female zzso valve zzso Within this significant gene list there were zzso overrepresented biological zzso several of which are relevant to pathways identified in zzso zzso In particular, zzso analysis indicated that cellular zzso zzso migration, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reorganization were all significantly represented in the data zzso These gene expression findings also translated into functional differences in zzso behavior in the in zzso environment, as sex-related differences in proliferation and zzso were confirmed in zzso populations cultured in zzso These data suggest that a sex-related propensity for zzso exists on the cellular level in healthy subjects, a phenomenon that could have significant clinical zzso These findings also strongly support zzso the use of zzso zzso cultures, thereby changing the current standard in the zzso
