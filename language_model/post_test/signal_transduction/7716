zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso is coupled to increased cell proliferation in prostate cancer zzso zzso of the DNA replication licensing pathway, a critical step in growth control downstream of zzso zzso zzso is associated with development of zzso In this study we have investigated linkages between the zzso zzso and DNA replication licensing during prostate zzso The effects of increased zzso zzso on the expression of replication licensing factors zzso and zzso and the proliferation marker zzso were studied in an zzso system expressing a zzso activated zzso of zzso in zzso cells and in stable zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso expression of these zzso in zzso biopsy specimens zzso was studied and compared to zzso zzso In both in zzso systems induction of zzso expression resulted in increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso specimens average zzso expression was greater than zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), consistent with their differential expression according to growth status zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were significantly associated with zzso grade zzso zzso zzso however there was no link with T or M zzso There was a significant relationship between increasing zzso expression and increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso trends seen with increasing zzso zzso There were significant associations between zzso grade and the number of cells zzso zzso phase zzso zzso with high zzso levels associated with both an increase in replication licensed but zzso cells zzso zzso and accelerated cell cycle progression zzso zzso zzso all indicative of a shift towards increasing zzso zzso While zzso and zzso were both zzso factors on zzso analysis, only zzso remained an independent zzso marker on zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that induction of zzso zzso is linked to zzso of the DNA replication licensing zzso in zzso and that the strong zzso value of zzso proteins may result from their function as relay stations zzso growth regulatory pathways to zzso zzso
