zzso is a 48 zzso zzso predominantly expressed on B cells in both mouse and man, which interacts with a zzso zzso expressed on activated zzso T zzso zzso interactions are now known to be essential for the initiation of zzso responses to zzso zzso In this review we discuss the zzso of zzso with a special emphasis on our own studies in the zzso These have focused on signal zzso via zzso the role of zzso (both T zzso and B zzso in zzso B cell zzso and the role of zzso in protecting B cells from zzso cell zzso The available data indicate clearly that this protein is a pivotal zzso on B cells, both for the delivery of zzso signals and for promoting B cell zzso
