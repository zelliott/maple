The zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso are essential regulators of skeletal muscle lineage determination in zzso zzso into the signaling and response systems regulating zzso and zzso gene expression in muscle zzso cells have led to the identification of molecular signals and DNA regulatory regions that control expression of these muscle regulatory zzso Here we discuss recent advances in these areas, with emphasis on in zzso analyses of zzso zzso
