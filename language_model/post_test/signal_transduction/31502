The zzso zzso zzso is a class C G zzso zzso zzso that functions as an zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso In this study, we generated and zzso characterized zzso active zzso zzso as novel tools to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso A single zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding domain results in zzso signaling when this zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso in the putative G zzso domain of zzso is sufficient to zzso moderate zzso activity when this zzso is expressed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can be markedly enhanced with zzso of zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso leads to a further increase in zzso zzso zzso of the full zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso are increased at the zzso active versus the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso provided a sensitive probe enabling detection of inverse or partial zzso activity of molecules previously considered neutral zzso Our studies using zzso active zzso provide independent support for a model of zzso function that takes into account 1) zzso binding by zzso 2) signal zzso by zzso and 3) zzso of zzso function by zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that certain hallmark features of zzso activity as originally established with class A zzso zzso enhanced zzso potency and zzso are more generally zzso as suggested by our finding with a class C zzso zzso
