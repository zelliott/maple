zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a major barrier to zzso zzso in the central nervous system zzso but the structural diversity of their zzso has hampered efforts to dissect the zzso relationships underlying their zzso zzso By taking advantage of our ability to chemically zzso specific zzso we demonstrate that a sugar zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif significantly zzso the zzso activity of zzso on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso functions as a protein recognition element to engage receptors including the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso thereby triggering downstream pathways that inhibit zzso zzso Finally, masking the zzso motif using a zzso zzso reversed the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso These results demonstrate that a specific sugar zzso within zzso zzso zzso can direct important zzso processes and provide new therapeutic strategies to zzso zzso after zzso zzso
