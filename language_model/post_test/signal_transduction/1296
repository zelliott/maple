zzso exposure of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso key zzso zzso of zzso tissue in the zzso syndrome induced by these zzso Our goal was to identify the zzso in the insulin signal zzso cascade leading to zzso insulin zzso 

zzso differentiated zzso zzso were exposed to 30 zzso zzso zzso for 18 zzso after which the amount, the zzso and the zzso of key proteins in the insulin zzso cascade were zzso 

zzso interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso proteins was normal in cells treated with zzso as was zzso zzso zzso zzso Yet zzso zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 was significantly zzso This could not be attributed to increased protein zzso 2A activity or to increased expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, insulin failed to induce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso to plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso 

We therefore conclude that zzso zzso a zzso in the insulin zzso cascade downstream of the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso itself by impaired zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso to the plasma zzso
