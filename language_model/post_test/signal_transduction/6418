zzso zzso have evolved an efficient mechanism to gain entry into zzso cells, hence challenging their hosts by the establishment of infection in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the invasive stage of most zzso allowing them to migrate across zzso and actively invade and zzso host zzso In the late 1960s, detailed zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso share an elaborate architecture zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since 1993, the development of technologies for transient and stable zzso have provided powerful tools with which to identify gene products associated with these structures and zzso as well as to understand their zzso In combination with access to several zzso zzso it is now possible to compare and contrast the strategies and molecular machines that have been selectively designed by distinct life stages within a species, or by different zzso species, to zzso zzso
