zzso has recently been reported to participate in cell membrane repair in muscle and other cells through zzso zzso Given that zzso fusion is a crucial mechanism that leads to membrane raft zzso the present study attempted to determine whether zzso is involved in this process and its related zzso and explores the mechanism underlying zzso zzso fusion in bovine coronary zzso zzso cells zzso We found that zzso is clustered in membrane raft zzso after zzso zzso zzso stimulation as detected by zzso zzso and membrane fraction zzso zzso zzso targeted to zzso prevented membrane raft zzso Furthermore, the zzso of acid zzso zzso to membrane raft zzso zzso local zzso zzso and zzso zzso important step that mediates membrane raft zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene reversed zzso impairment of zzso zzso in isolated small coronary zzso By monitoring zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso gene was found to almost completely block zzso fusion to plasma membrane upon zzso zzso Further studies to block zzso binding and zzso of zzso (a zzso zzso domain binding zzso showed that the zzso zzso domain is required for zzso zzso fusion to the cell zzso zzso zzso and membrane raft zzso We conclude that zzso determines zzso fusion to the plasma membrane through its zzso domain and it is therefore implicated in zzso signaling and regulation of zzso function in coronary zzso
