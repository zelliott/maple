A number of heavy metals are known to be essential for life, but most of these can also be toxic to cells under certain circumstances, or at elevated zzso Metals can directly induce gene expression through the actions of zzso zzso zzso However, metals can also influence the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso respond to zzso signals through a variety of different, but often zzso signal zzso zzso Metals can alter cell zzso by interacting with zzso factors and zzso zzso many of which are dependent on metals zzso zzso for their zzso In addition, metals can affect cells in more zzso ways, for example, by inducing a generalized stress response or by zzso cell surface zzso zzso The prominent role of zinc in signal zzso combined with low zzso free zinc levels has lead to the speculation that cellular signaling and gene expression may be zzso in part, by zinc zzso Experimental modification of the levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in altered responsiveness to zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso is capable of influencing gene zzso perhaps by regulating the level of zzso free zzso
