zzso zzso affects most, if not all, cellular activities in zzso and is essential for cell proliferation and zzso An estimated zzso of cellular proteins are zzso representing the zzso and zzso can alter a zzso function, activity, zzso and zzso Recent studies for large-scale identification of zzso using mass zzso are revealing the components of the zzso The development of new tools, such as zzso zzso using modified zzso or protein zzso enables rapid zzso zzso zzso The dynamics of specific zzso events can now be monitored using mass zzso zzso analysis of flow zzso or fluorescent zzso Together, these techniques are beginning to zzso cellular processes and pathways regulated by zzso in addition to global regulatory zzso
