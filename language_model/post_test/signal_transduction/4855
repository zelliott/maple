To investigate the effects of zzso acid B zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso activated by transforming growth zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso were isolated from male zzso rats by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were directly added to the zzso medium of zzso Total and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso and type I collagen were zzso by Western zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso with or without zzso was inhibited by zzso however, zzso of zzso in zzso with or without zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso with zzso was inhibited by zzso Combination of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso can effectively inhibit the expression of zzso zzso also inhibited zzso of type I collagen in zzso with or without zzso 

The action point of zzso zzso zzso signaling induced by zzso in zzso is the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso reduces the increase of expression of zzso and protein zzso of type I collagen induced by zzso by means of zzso zzso signaling in activated zzso of zzso
