Polar zzso movement is a primary regulator of programmed and plastic plant zzso zzso transport is highly regulated at the cellular level and is zzso by coordinated transport activity of plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity of these zzso has been extensively analyzed using a combination of pharmacological zzso synthetic zzso and zzso zzso in zzso However, efforts to analyze zzso growth in other species that are less zzso to genetic manipulation require more selective zzso than are currently zzso In this report, we characterize the zzso activity of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso acid and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso acid, finding that the zzso and zzso derivatives act as potent zzso of zzso action in zzso These zzso zzso inhibit polar zzso transport and zzso responses associated with zzso zzso distribution in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso inhibit zzso transport zzso by zzso zzso and zzso proteins expressed in zzso However, these zzso did not inhibit or activate zzso zzso signaling and had no effect on the zzso trafficking of zzso zzso Together these results indicate that zzso are inactive zzso zzso for zzso zzso but are recognized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso zzso are powerful new tools for analyses of zzso zzso
