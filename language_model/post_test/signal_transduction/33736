zzso integrate zzso activity into commands for skeletal muscle contraction and relaxation to perform motor zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in essential motor functions such as breathing, zzso swallowing and zzso We have investigated the role of the gaseous zzso zzso oxide zzso in the regulation of the zzso activity of zzso in order to further understand how neural activity is transformed into motor zzso In adult rats, we observed zzso fibers and zzso structures in close proximity to zzso which normally lack the molecular machinery to zzso zzso In addition, zzso studies demonstrated that zzso of animals with a NO donor resulted in an increase in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which express the soluble zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso applied while performing zzso zzso recordings in the adult zzso zzso Application of a NO zzso inhibitor or a zzso inhibitor induced a statistically significant reduction in the zzso activity of zzso However, zzso effects were observed by ejection of a NO donor or a zzso analogue of zzso In slice zzso application to the bath of a NO donor evoked membrane zzso and a decrease in zzso which were prevented by zzso to the bath of a zzso zzso These effects were not prevented by reduction of the spontaneous synaptic zzso We conclude that NO from zzso fibers zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso by a zzso mechanism in zzso zzso
