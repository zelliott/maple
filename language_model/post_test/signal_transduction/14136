zzso zzso can regulate cancer cell proliferation and zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso in zzso tumor zzso compared to primary tumors, and that that zzso can inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, as well as restrain cell migration and zzso zzso is confirmed as a direct target of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso migration and invasion through the zzso zzso zzso zzso of proliferation and invasion can be rescued by zzso Overall, this study demonstrates that zzso affects the zzso zzso by zzso zzso This newly identified function of zzso provides novel insights into zzso and may foster therapeutic zzso
