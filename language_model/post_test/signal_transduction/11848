The plasma membrane of living cells is an interface of material transfers and an antenna for outer zzso This chapter provides a guide on how to zzso zzso capsules for illuminating zzso signaling and cargo protein zzso The capsule consists of four zzso which are, in consecutive order: a zzso zzso zzso a host zzso body zzso a guest protein or zzso zzso and a membrane zzso signal zzso Any guest zzso including a zzso or a fluorescent zzso may be sandwiched between the host zzso body and zzso and may be deliverable to the plasma membrane zzso where the capsule waits for outer signals and to quickly release the embedded zzso in response to a specific zzso The present strategy provides an efficient molecular vehicle for cargo proteins and imaging of zzso molecular events in living cells without zzso demerits of zzso
