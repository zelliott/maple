Novel drug targets can be identified by differential analysis of zzso transcripts isolated from cancer cell lines and zzso We have extended this approach by analyzing differences in gene expression resulting from the drug treatment of transformed and zzso zzso A mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso which zzso expresses the zzso zzso was left zzso or treated with zzso acid in the presence or absence of zzso zzso The experiment was performed in zzso and zzso extracted from the four samples was analyzed by zzso to over 12,000 unique zzso probe zzso zzso zzso in gene expression that occurred in response to zzso acid, zzso or zzso acid plus zzso relative to zzso cells were zzso Greater attention was given to genes zzso cell surface zzso that were selectively zzso by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso These genes included the tumor necrosis factor family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Administration of zzso acid to mice bearing tumors driven by zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso in the tumors but not in normal zzso In principal, the therapeutic index of zzso directed against these zzso should be enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso
