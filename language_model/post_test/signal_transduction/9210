zzso cells underlying the definitive zzso in zzso animals play a vital role in zzso and respiratory zzso Although several signaling pathways are implicated in zzso patterning and zzso and despite the clinical importance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in humans, understanding of molecular mechanisms that allow a single tube to separate correctly into the trachea and esophagus is zzso The zzso gene zzso is highly expressed in prospective stomach zzso and required to specify this zzso We observed lower zzso expression extending zzso from the zzso stomach domain, along the zzso anterior zzso zzso and in zzso cells between the nascent esophagus and zzso This expression pattern exactly mirrors the decline in zzso signaling activity in late development of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso mouse zzso is zzso zzso and the point of zzso separation shows marked zzso zzso resulting in a common zzso tube that is similar to human zzso zzso zzso and explains zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso esophagus displays molecular and zzso features of respiratory zzso zzso abnormalities observed in mouse zzso with activated zzso The zone of zzso zzso signaling is zzso prolonged and expanded in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, as in the developing stomach, but distinct from the zzso zzso control of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is tightly associated with zzso of adjacent zzso zzso zzso
