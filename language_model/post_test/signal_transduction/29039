The formation of blood vessels within the vascular system zzso a variety of cellular zzso including zzso migration and zzso In many cases, these diverse processes need to be finely coordinated among zzso zzso cells in order to establish a functional vascular zzso For instance, during zzso zzso specialized zzso tip cells follow guidance cues and migrate extensively into avascular zzso while trailing stalk cells must stay connected to the patent blood zzso The vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso pathways have emerged as the major players in governing these different cellular zzso In particular, recent work indicates an important role for zzso zzso in determining how an zzso cell responds to zzso In this review, we provide an overview of these zzso distinct pathways and discuss how they may interact during zzso cell differentiation and zzso
