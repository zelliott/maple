Members of the classic type of transient zzso potential channels zzso represent important molecules involved in hormonal signal zzso zzso channels are of particular interest as they are components of zzso C driven zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso stimulation of zzso C results in breakdown of zzso leading to increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activates protein zzso C, but more interestingly zzso directly activates zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and characterization of zzso channels enabled zzso of traditional zzso of zzso calcium entry such as zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso and several members of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, several zzso zzso have also been identified as zzso channel blockers, such as zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso Finally, the naturally occurring secondary plant compound zzso has been identified as zzso drug, providing an exciting proof of concept that it is possible to generate zzso channel zzso The description of zzso as the first zzso inhibitor shows that not only nature but also man is able to generate zzso zzso The review summarizes the data on pharmacological modification of zzso zzso lights on the current knowledge and historical development of pharmacological zzso of zzso Our analysis indicates that zzso and zzso provide promising core structures for the development of new, zzso and more potent zzso of zzso zzso
