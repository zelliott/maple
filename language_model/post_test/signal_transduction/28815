zzso is considered a promising target in the treatment of zzso Most of the zzso zzso in late-stage clinical testing or approved for the treatment of cancer act indirectly on zzso zzso They either neutralize zzso growth factors from the circulation or block the signaling pathways activated by these growth zzso Another group of zzso zzso are the direct zzso zzso These agents have a direct effect on the zzso affecting cellular regulatory zzso independently of the tumor zzso The reason that this category of agents is lagging behind regarding their translation to the clinic may be the lack of sufficient knowledge on the mechanism of action of these zzso The zzso factor zzso has been recently connected with multiple aspects of zzso In addition, several recent studies report that zzso zzso is associated to zzso zzso This is of special interest since in tumor cells zzso zzso has been associated to zzso of zzso and currently novel treatment strategies are being developed based on zzso of zzso The paradigm that systemic zzso zzso can serve as an zzso strategy, therefore, might need to be zzso Based on recent data, it might be speculated that zzso zzso when performed specifically in zzso cells, could be an efficient strategy for the treatment of zzso
