At the onset of zzso most adherent cells undergo cell zzso zzso by the zzso of focal zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso takes place in rounded cells, and the two daughter cells spread again after zzso Because of the well-documented ability of the small zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso we assessed its role during zzso We show that zzso activity is regulated during this zzso Changes in zzso activity play an essential role in regulating cell zzso and zzso respectively, before and after zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso is inhibited at the onset of zzso conversely, zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso focal zzso and of the zzso zzso leading to delayed zzso and to zzso zzso zzso activity slowly increases after zzso ends; zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso prevents the rounded cells from spreading after zzso For the first time, we provide evidence for the direct regulation of zzso processes during zzso via the activity of the zzso zzso
