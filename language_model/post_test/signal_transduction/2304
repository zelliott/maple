During the development of allergic inflammation of zzso zzso zzso are likely to interact with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and inflammatory zzso such as zzso To determine whether zzso and zzso can interact to modify zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, peripheral blood zzso were incubated in either zzso human zzso or buffer zzso zzso plates in the presence or absence of 100 zzso zzso zzso and zzso acted zzso to stimulate zzso generation which was significantly inhibited by either zzso a zzso zzso zzso or zzso a protein zzso C zzso These results indicate that interaction between zzso and zzso can stimulate zzso function and its eventual contribution to the allergic inflammation zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate the involvement of zzso zzso and protein zzso C in this specific zzso zzso
