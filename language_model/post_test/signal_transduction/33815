In mating systems that involve competing males and zzso zzso males are expected to advertise their genetic quality to discriminating zzso Most examples have focused on visual or acoustic signals, such as zzso or song; yet arguably, zzso communication may be more important to the majority of zzso with the possible exception of zzso Fortunately, attention has begun to shift to the role of zzso in mate choice, with most of that attention being directed at the major zzso complex or more recently at the major urinary zzso The study of male zzso zzso presented by zzso and colleagues in this issue adds a new dimension to investigations of the influence of genes on mate choice via zzso zzso By comparing genetic zzso to the production of zzso in the zzso scent zzso they provide a link between genetic composition and zzso zzso as a potential advertisement of male zzso
