zzso tissue is a primary target of insulin, but knowledge about insulin zzso in human zzso is zzso We developed an zzso technique for zzso of primary human zzso with a zzso efficiency of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso Human zzso were zzso with a zzso of zzso (all four potential zzso binding motifs zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso was zzso from cell zzso with zzso zzso resolved with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso We found that zzso blocked insulin stimulation of zzso zzso and in further analyses also zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso Our results demonstrate the critical importance of zzso for zzso as well as zzso zzso by zzso This method for zzso of primary human zzso will be useful for studying insulin zzso in human zzso with molecular biological zzso
