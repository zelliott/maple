zzso induce zzso responses and act to regulate zzso genes including positive feedback of the zzso 2 zzso gene involved in zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso we used a fusion genetic strategy in which the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso reporters were expressed under control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns of reporter expression were determined initially, and revealed that zzso expression from the zzso promoter required de zzso protein zzso zzso activity was also induced by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso and antagonized by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and progeny analyses identified three zzso zzso that zzso the zzso reporter, designated zzso 2 and 3, as well as two zzso zzso designated zzso and 2, that zzso the zzso zzso analysis indicated that reporter zzso in the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso responded to zzso with increased zzso zzso while zzso responded with decreased root growth zzso In addition, reporter induction and zzso zzso expression by zzso was absent in zzso
