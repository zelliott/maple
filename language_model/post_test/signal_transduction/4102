The zzso zzso was shown to specifically stimulate zzso zzso This zzso which presents a zzso highly similar to a sequence of the zzso external zzso interacts with zzso and is able to inhibit in zzso zzso zzso Since zzso binds also zzso its zzso specificity cannot exclusively be attributed to its interaction with zzso We therefore hypothesized that the zzso could trigger signals specifically associated with zzso Here we show that zzso triggers zzso gene zzso only in zzso zzso In zzso we show that numerous proteins are zzso zzso in this cell subset while only a restricted number of them are zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso zzso zzso which is associated with both zzso and zzso is activated only in zzso zzso making this zzso a good model for the study of cell signaling triggered in this restricted zzso
