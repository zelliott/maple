zzso is a complex inflammatory process characterized by the zzso between excessive inflammation and zzso zzso In the past few years, compelling evidence suggests that statins can decrease vascular inflammation and zzso the development of zzso through their so-called zzso zzso These zzso effects are predominantly due to their ability to inhibit zzso zzso In particular, zzso of zzso synthesis leads to zzso of zzso and its downstream target, zzso zzso Thus, one of the beneficial effects of zzso therapy could be due to zzso effects on zzso ROCK is involved in zzso diverse cellular functions such as smooth muscle contraction, cell migration and zzso While increased ROCK activity is associated with zzso dysfunction, cerebral zzso coronary zzso and zzso syndrome, the zzso of ROCK by statins or selective ROCK zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso decreased vascular zzso and reduced zzso plaque zzso This review will focus on the impact of ROCK in cardiovascular disease and its zzso role to vascular inflammation and the zzso
