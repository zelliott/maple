In zzso zzso removal of any number of existing branches zzso to a zzso root stimulates development of zzso buds further along the stem such that the complement of branches zzso to a zzso root remains zzso This study aimed to assess possible mechanisms by which existing branches zzso inhibit the outgrowth of zzso buds zzso to zzso zzso were applied to zzso branches to evaluate the roles of three zzso zzso zzso zzso the transport of a zzso zzso feedback signal from branches into the main zzso zzso the polar flow of zzso from branches into the main stem acting to limit further branch zzso or zzso the zzso branches functioning as sinks for a net zzso zzso signal zzso zzso showed that transport of zzso or of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso branches did not influence regulation of zzso zzso and were consistent with the possibility that the zzso distribution of zzso could be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso buds by zzso zzso This study supports existing evidence that regulation of branching in zzso zzso is dominated by a zzso zzso zzso initially distributed via the zzso the characterization of which will progress the generic understanding of branching zzso
