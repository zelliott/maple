zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso proliferation and zzso bone formation during zzso However, it is not known if the zzso signaling zzso is important for zzso bone zzso To examine this, we have characterized a novel skeletal zzso in zzso mice in which we find a significant increase in bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and other parameters of bone zzso The data show that zzso derived from zzso mice have decreased expression of cell cycle inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso 3, a known negative regulator of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso showed increased expression of zzso in zzso and increased responsiveness to zzso in zzso These results suggest a mechanism for the regulation of the zzso in which zzso functions not only to directly regulate the cell cycle but also to modify the repertoire of zzso zzso expression from a potentially zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso
