Although zzso is well characterized as a zzso gene in the zzso the precise mechanism of this suppression remains to be zzso Using a novel zzso zzso transgenic line in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso we, show that loss of zzso acutely activates zzso signaling through the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso it zzso zzso migration, zzso and zzso such that zzso cells maintain a zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time we confirm a series of zzso target molecules in an in zzso setting and also identify a series of new candidate targets within the same zzso
