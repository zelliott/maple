Pulmonary inflammation is the key pathological presentation of mechanical zzso lung injury zzso and synthetic zzso zzso has been suggested to zzso pulmonary zzso The present study aimed to determine whether zzso zzso has protective effects on zzso zzso received 4 hours of high tidal volume mechanical ventilation with or without zzso with zzso zzso that were kept on spontaneous zzso served as zzso At the end of 4 hours, rats that received 4 hours of mechanical ventilation exhibited serious pulmonary pathological changes, more zzso and zzso zzso zzso more tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso production, higher total protein contents in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and more lung zzso of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso inhibitor zzso and increased zzso zzso binding activity than did the control zzso Administration of zzso zzso tended to significantly inhibit all these changes induced by mechanical zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso might improve zzso in rats by attenuating inflammatory cascade related to zzso zzso and zzso
