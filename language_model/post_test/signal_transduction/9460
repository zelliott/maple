zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso promotes the differentiation and migration of zzso zzso precursors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These functions are dependent on the zzso zzso zzso but independent of its two known zzso zzso partners zzso and zzso Here we show that soluble zzso is also able to promote differentiation and migration of zzso zzso zzso These activities require zzso production of zzso Although zzso responsiveness is abolished in zzso zzso it can be restored upon addition of soluble zzso a result that is only compatible with the existence of a previously unknown zzso signaling partner for the zzso complex in zzso zzso The roles of two candidate zzso receptors previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso growth factor zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce the zzso of either zzso nor did zzso of zzso or zzso impair zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso or zzso per zzso promoted zzso differentiation and migration and enhanced the activity of zzso on zzso zzso These effects were dependent on zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso activity in the zzso In agreement with this, Met zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced responses to zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso increased zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso expression of zzso and zzso overlapped in the zzso and a zzso zzso in Met increased zzso expression in this zzso Together, these observations demonstrate the existence of a novel zzso zzso partner for the zzso complex and uncover an unexpected interplay between zzso and zzso signaling in the early diversification of cortical zzso zzso zzso
