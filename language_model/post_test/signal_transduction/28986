zzso signaling affects a variety of zzso stem cells, but there has been limited evidence that a specific zzso zzso regulates adult stem zzso Recently, it was reported that the reduced zzso signaling initiated at the embryonic stage results in a gradual hair graying zzso after zzso Here we demonstrate that the oral administration of a zzso inhibitor zzso to zzso adult zzso mice led to a gradual increase in gray spots, which remained unchanged for at least 20 weeks after zzso the zzso In zzso mice, there was a severe decrease in zzso zzso in the zzso region where zzso stem cells are zzso While we confirmed that zzso double zzso mice with a zzso background were born with a normal hair color zzso and gradually turned gray after the second hair cycle, in the zzso zzso zzso background, zzso and zzso mice had larger white spots on the first appearance of hair than did the zzso mice, which did not change throughout zzso zzso mice had white hair virtually all over the body at the first appearance of hair and the zzso continued to progress zzso Using a neural crest organ culture system, zzso blocked the generation of pigmented zzso when added to the culture during the period of zzso zzso but not during the period of zzso These observations imply roles of zzso signaling in both development of zzso during zzso and maintenance of zzso stem cells in adulthood, while the degree of requirement is distinct in these zzso the latter is more sensitive than the former to the reduced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso with zzso signaling during zzso and they cooperate with each other to regulate zzso zzso after zzso
