zzso has been implicated in zzso because of its altered post seizure expression and the role of zzso signaling in zzso To determine zzso role in seizure zzso we injected zzso zzso in zzso cerebral zzso and zzso knockout zzso We then analyzed the zzso number, and duration of four zzso of seizure zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso generalized zzso seizures, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso to both death and Phase IV were significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso mice also spent significantly more time in zzso III and IV and showed significantly less time in the zzso state zzso zzso zzso and gold zzso zzso indicated that the knockout mice had zzso zzso lacked a corpus zzso and were missing zzso zzso This suggests that dysfunction of zzso signaling pathways in mice leads to cortical zzso and increased seizure zzso
