The inactive zzso of zzso zzso complex is activated by stimuli including zzso zzso zzso growth factors and zzso zzso The release of zzso zzso its zzso to the nucleus, where it promotes cell survival by initiating zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and associated regulatory factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in zzso and solid zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in cell proliferation control, zzso control, zzso promotion and possibly regulation of diffusion of zzso There are several reports that zzso of zzso as a therapeutic target may have a role in zzso cell death or growth zzso 

We review data about zzso of zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso syndromes zzso We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso deregulation in these zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in the nucleus has been reported in some varieties of zzso The in zzso and in zzso results of zzso zzso in zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso selective zzso drugs may be useful, either as single agents or associated with conventional zzso
