zzso studies in plant zzso biology require monitoring and measuring the changes in cells and zzso as growth gives rise to intricate zzso The success of these studies has been amplified by the combined strengths of two complementary techniques, namely live imaging and zzso image zzso Live imaging records zzso images showing the zzso progress of tissue growth with cells dividing and changing shape under controlled laboratory zzso Image processing and analysis make sense of these data by providing zzso ways to extract and interpret quantitative zzso information present in the acquired zzso Manual labeling and qualitative interpretation of images are limited as they don't scale well to large data sets and cannot provide field zzso to feed into mathematical and zzso models of growth and zzso zzso analysis, when it can be made sufficiently accurate, is more efficient, complete, zzso and less zzso In this chapter, we present some guidelines for the acquisition and processing of images of zzso and the shoot zzso zzso of zzso zzso to serve as a basis for zzso We discuss fluorescent markers and imaging using zzso laser scanning zzso as well as present protocols for doing zzso live imaging and zzso imaging of living zzso Image zzso and tracking are zzso zzso are presented and demonstrated together with low-level image processing methods that have proven to be essential in the detection of cell zzso We illustrate the application of these procedures in investigations aiming to unravel the mechanical and zzso signaling mechanisms responsible for the coordinated growth and patterning in zzso
