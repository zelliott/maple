During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost zzso However, the zzso and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly zzso This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and zzso modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to zzso growth factor zzso in isolated zzso The experimental data show transient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by zzso zzso responses exhibit pronounced zzso reached within zzso s of zzso stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low zzso zzso In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the zzso observed zzso can be accounted for without requiring zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso following zzso zzso The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions zzso patterns are transient or zzso zzso signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many zzso rate zzso within the range of zzso measured zzso On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic zzso rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the zzso observed zzso of signal zzso zzso of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and zzso
