Giant Cell zzso of bone zzso is an aggressively zzso and zzso bone zzso Previous work in our lab has shown that zzso zzso zzso is the principal zzso expressed by the zzso zzso cells of zzso The zzso zzso factor is known to have a binding site in the zzso promoter region, and we have previously found this zzso factor to be zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the role of zzso in zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso Following in zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells with incremental zzso of zzso zzso or zzso the level of zzso zzso expression increased dramatically over zzso with a zzso increase in zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways inhibited the zzso of zzso in these zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and this effect was amplified following zzso zzso Our study provides the first evidence that zzso may play a crucial role in zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
