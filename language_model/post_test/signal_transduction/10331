To segregate the many contributions that B cell zzso zzso signals make to immune responses, we have analyzed here B cells deficient in the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso of zzso B cells failed to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or to zzso cell survival proteins and instead induced zzso zzso of zzso B cell zzso induced zzso centers and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells early, but both cellular compartments decreased by day zzso zzso of zzso B cells induced by zzso zzso in zzso was impaired as a result of zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, enforced expression of the zzso factor zzso prevented the collapse of zzso B cell zzso zzso These results show zzso differences in B cell survival during zzso center initiation and zzso zzso signaling is sufficient for the former, whereas the latter requires signaling from the zzso
