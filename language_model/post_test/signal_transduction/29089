The ability of the human zzso virus, type 1 zzso protein zzso to induce zzso changes in infected host cells is a key event in viral zzso In zzso zzso we found that zzso induced loss of stress fibers and increased zzso pathological changes leading to zzso in zzso zzso These zzso changes were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified a new interaction between zzso and zzso interacting protein zzso a recently described regulator of zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso 3 binding domain of zzso and the zzso zzso motif were required for this zzso zzso also interacts with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso both interact directly with zzso in a competitive zzso zzso interacts with zzso and intact zzso was required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso also interacts with zzso and although zzso enhanced baseline zzso of zzso it was not required for zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by using a dominant negative of either zzso or zzso or zzso for zzso or zzso restored zzso activity and stress fiber formation in zzso zzso whereas zzso for zzso reduced zzso activity and formation of zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso zzso through the recruitment of zzso and zzso to zzso complex, activates zzso and zzso zzso zzso
