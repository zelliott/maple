We have combined zzso expression cloning with random zzso to identify two zzso point zzso in the common zzso zzso zzso beta c) of the receptors for human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso by virtue of their ability to zzso factor independence on the zzso cell line, zzso One zzso zzso is located within the zzso domain and, by zzso with a similar zzso in the zzso zzso may act by inducing zzso of h beta zzso The other zzso zzso lies in the zzso zzso portion of h beta zzso Neither of these zzso nor a previously described zzso of h beta c zzso zzso which has a small zzso in the zzso zzso was capable of inducing factor independence in zzso cells, while only zzso could induce factor independence in zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso and zzso zzso act by different zzso Furthermore, they imply that the zzso and hence also zzso h beta zzso interact with cell zzso zzso zzso Models are presented which illustrate how these zzso may act and predict some of the characteristics of the putative zzso zzso zzso
