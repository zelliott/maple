zzso of the zzso group gene zzso promotes cell proliferation and zzso zzso through repression of zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso leads to zzso defects and severe progressive neurological abnormalities in which zzso of the zzso locus is critically zzso Here, we show that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso precursor cells in mice and zzso Using zzso mice we demonstrate a crucial role for zzso in zzso expansion of zzso cell precursors both in zzso and in zzso zzso proliferation of these zzso cells, by zzso of the sonic zzso zzso pathway, leads to zzso zzso We also demonstrate linked zzso of zzso and patched zzso suggestive of zzso zzso zzso in a substantial fraction of primary human zzso Together with the rapid induction of zzso expression on addition of zzso or on zzso of the zzso target zzso in zzso zzso cell cultures, these findings zzso zzso zzso as an alternative or additive mechanism in the zzso of zzso and highlight a role for zzso zzso complexes in proliferation of zzso precursor zzso
