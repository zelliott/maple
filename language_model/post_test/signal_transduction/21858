The underlying basis of major zzso complex zzso restriction is zzso Nevertheless, current data suggest that a common zzso signature dictates zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso To evaluate whether this zzso signature defines zzso zzso we have examined the zzso basis of a highly characterized zzso zzso interacting with its zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we observed this interaction to be governed by favorable zzso and zzso forces, which is in contrast to the prevailing zzso zzso zzso driven interactions combined with markedly zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso molecular factors, such as zzso zzso zzso adjustments involved in zzso zzso or constraints dictated by zzso arrangement of zzso zzso might play a greater role in guiding zzso restriction than appreciated zzso
