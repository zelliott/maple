During zzso of barley zzso DNA fragmentation was observed in the zzso The appearance of DNA fragmentation in the zzso layer, observed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso started near the zzso and extended to the zzso cells far from the zzso in a time dependent zzso The same spatial zzso activities of zzso zzso such as zzso were observed in zzso DNA fragmentation could also be seen in zzso under zzso stress, in isolated zzso During zzso zzso isolation, a very enhanced and strong DNA fragmentation occurred which was not seen in zzso preparations of tobacco zzso zzso was found to inhibit DNA fragmentation occurring in barley zzso under zzso stress condition and during zzso isolation, while the plant growth regulator zzso acid zzso the effect of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso had no significant effect on DNA fragmentation in these zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso signal zzso leading to control of DNA fragmentation zzso the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso acid and of zzso oxide on zzso were zzso We zzso that the regulation of DNA fragmentation in zzso plays a very important role in spatial and zzso control of zzso activities during zzso The possible signal zzso zzso of zzso leading to the regulation of DNA fragmentation is zzso
