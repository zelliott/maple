The zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by its zzso zzso zzso several cellular responses, including zzso Nonetheless, the zzso zzso is zzso in stress conditions by zzso within its zzso region, generating a zzso fragment, zzso zzso with zzso zzso Here, we established that this zzso splits the zzso at the zzso zzso site, causing the zzso generation of zzso zzso corresponding to the entire zzso region of the zzso zzso still spanning the zzso This zzso is able to bind zzso and to prevent zzso signaling downstream of full zzso demonstrating its function as a decoy zzso
