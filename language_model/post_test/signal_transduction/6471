zzso zzso proteins are general zzso factors and can function through binding to zzso zzso enhancers zzso zzso proteins and several other zzso zzso factors contain an zzso zzso domain required to promote zzso We have recently found that the zzso bound zzso domain functions by zzso the zzso Here, we perform zzso zzso experiments to show that the zzso is zzso contacted first in complex E by the zzso domain of the essential zzso factor zzso and then in the zzso by the zzso bound zzso zzso Although the zzso bound zzso domain can promote formation of the zzso at least one additional zzso protein is required for complete zzso zzso We show that the zzso domain of this additional zzso protein contacts the zzso zzso site specifically in the mature zzso We propose that direct contact with zzso signals is a general mechanism by which zzso zzso promote zzso
