zzso cells acquire zzso polarity with a leading edge and a trailing tail for directional zzso The zzso exchange factor zzso zzso in polarized cell migration with the zzso complex of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso However, it remains largely unknown how zzso is regulated and contributes to the establishment of polarity in zzso zzso We show here that zzso interacts directly with zzso which binds and activates zzso to mediate their zzso zzso accumulated at zzso in a manner dependent on zzso and the zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso and the zzso complex were required for zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and migration toward zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acted with zzso to regulate zzso zzso Thus, we propose that zzso with the zzso complex, binds to zzso through zzso and, together with the zzso complex, thereby regulates zzso activity and zzso turnover for polarized zzso
