zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins accelerate zzso zzso by zzso zzso alpha zzso and thus inhibit signaling by many G zzso zzso Several zzso proteins have a zzso architecture that adds further complexity to their roles in cell signaling in addition to their zzso zzso zzso contains a tandem repeat of zzso zzso but, to date, the role of this protein in zzso signal zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso associates with the nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso and zzso their coordinated signaling to prolonged zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso outgrowth of zzso cells, but not outgrowth zzso by basic zzso growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression also zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso cultures of primary zzso root zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may play a critical, and zzso role in zzso zzso signals that are required for promoting and/or maintaining zzso zzso
