The zzso are large DNA viruses and represent the largest zzso of the zzso with closely related members of man and animal, including zzso zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus, bovine zzso 1, and many zzso The viral envelope proteins of zzso are remarkably diverse and are incorporated in the zzso zzso and plasma membrane of infected zzso The zzso domain of many of these envelope proteins contain specific zzso zzso zzso During recent years, accumulating evidence indicates that these zzso motifs serve different important functions during the virus life cycle, and are implicated in zzso zzso zzso trafficking, zzso and zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso The current zzso will discuss the functions associated with these zzso motifs in zzso envelope zzso
