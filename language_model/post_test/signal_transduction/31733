B cell responses are required for resistance to zzso zzso however, the events that lead to production of zzso zzso during zzso zzso infection have not been zzso Indeed, mice challenged with the zzso exhibited an expansion of T zzso helper cells and zzso center B cells in the zzso zzso this was not associated with zzso center formation and was instead accompanied by profound changes in zzso zzso This phenomenon was transient and was correlated with a decrease in expression of zzso proteins that contribute to zzso organization, including zzso zzso and zzso The importance of zzso was confirmed, as the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso results in partial restoration of zzso zzso zzso mice were used to test the zzso contribution to the zzso response during zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso mice revealed delayed zzso in the production of zzso zzso but the mice did eventually develop normal levels of zzso zzso Together, these studies provide a better understanding of how infection with zzso zzso impacts the customized structures required for the optimal zzso responses to the zzso and the role of zzso in these zzso
