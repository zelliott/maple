The relationship between chronic zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso is a risk factor for zzso zzso is found within the vicinity of zzso and both share many similar genetic zzso However, it has been long thought that zzso arises only from duct zzso However, we have recently found that excessive activity within the Ras signaling zzso can lead to zzso cell death or zzso and is associated with the development of zzso resembling zzso and the development of zzso from zzso cells through the full complement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is time to zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso We proposed a new model in which Ras activity is the direct link between these 2 zzso Here we will briefly review the shared properties between zzso and zzso and describe the new zzso
