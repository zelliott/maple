zzso kidney disease and related syndromes involve zzso of cell proliferation in conjunction with zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and cell cycle is enigmatic, but it may involve regulation by the zzso of zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso is important for zzso function and cell cycle in zzso We now show that zzso zzso to an important regulatory site at the zzso end of zzso in both zzso and a mouse kidney cell zzso zzso also is associated with the zzso end of zzso Its zzso is dynamic during the cell cycle, following a similar pattern in both cell zzso The cell cycle function of zzso is zzso independent, whereas its zzso function is zzso zzso Mice with zzso in zzso or zzso have zzso zzso therefore, our discovery that a member of this zzso group of zzso proteins is localized to the same sites in zzso and kidney zzso cells suggests that zzso play zzso roles in the coordination of zzso and cell cycle zzso
