We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso signaling is independent of zzso zzso and zzso Instead, zzso zzso and zzso are recruited to zzso on zzso zzso zzso are then zzso to the zzso where zzso is zzso and zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The present study addressed two important questions: zzso How are zzso zzso and zzso recruited to zzso zzso Are zzso zzso and zzso also required for zzso zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adapter inducing zzso zzso was shown to play a critical role in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We found that zzso recruits zzso via adapter zzso through a zzso sequence in zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of this zzso sequence abolished the interaction of zzso with zzso but not with zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso site of zzso only abolished its ability to activate zzso but not zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso might zzso at zzso In support of this finding, we showed that zzso and zzso blocked zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso zzso zzso is completely abolished zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso recruits zzso to zzso through its zzso site, which is required for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso diverge at zzso
