zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso is a promising novel zzso agent that selectively zzso zzso in zzso cells and the activity of which can be enhanced by combined treatment with zzso or zzso For therapeutic purposes, the use of full-length TRAIL may be zzso to zzso TRAIL based on its increased zzso cell killing potential, and the delivery of TRAIL at the zzso site by zzso zzso may provide an approach to overcome the short zzso of zzso TRAIL and zzso toxicity in zzso Here, we constructed an zzso zzso expressing full-length TRAIL zzso and studied the potential of zzso and zzso in enhancing zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso cells and normal cells and, in addition, investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso effectively killed zzso cells, which we previously showed to have a zzso in zzso zzso by downstream zzso of zzso rather than zzso Further analyses revealed that zzso zzso death zzso and zzso zzso that could be partially suppressed by zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and radiation strongly enhanced zzso zzso in a synergistic zzso zzso was accompanied by the zzso of Bid and an increase in zzso processing that was abolished by zzso zzso indicating that the zzso amplification loop is functional in zzso zzso Moreover, combination treatment did not alter the zzso selectivity of zzso since normal human zzso zzso remained resistant under these zzso These findings further indicate that the combined use of zzso and zzso full-length TRAIL may provide a valuable treatment option for zzso
