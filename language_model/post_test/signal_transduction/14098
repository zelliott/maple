zzso zzso zzso zzso signals play important roles in cell death and zzso However, the role of zzso in the repair process after injury remains to be defined in the zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso in proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso cells, and proliferation of zzso cells following zzso zzso injury in the mouse zzso Mice were subjected to zzso of zzso zzso Some mice were administered with zzso a specific upstream inhibitor of zzso daily during the recovery phase, beginning at zzso after zzso until zzso zzso caused severe zzso cell damage and functional loss in the zzso Nine days after zzso the kidney was restored functionally with a partial restoration of damaged zzso and expansion of zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso and the activated zzso was sustained for zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and lengthening of primary zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas it enhanced the proliferation of zzso cells and zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso elevated the expression of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase of zzso which is a crucial component of zzso complex and an important factor in zzso and zzso zzso also enhanced the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso of zzso is required for both the restoration of damaged zzso zzso cells and the zzso of zzso progression following zzso
