zzso syndrome zzso is an inherited zzso deafness condition in humans caused by zzso deficiencies in the inner ear and zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso is known to produce zzso type zzso whereas zzso of either zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso B zzso produce zzso type zzso However, a link between zzso zzso and zzso signaling has not yet been zzso Here we demonstrate zzso connections between zzso and zzso and their functional importance in zzso zzso of zzso to cultured human zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in an zzso manner, which was completely abolished by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso transcripts was markedly zzso after incubation with zzso and was followed by increased expression of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was found to be zzso via both the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression itself was seen to be dependent on zzso The functional importance of these connections is illustrated by the ability of zzso to stimulate expression of zzso pigmentation and proliferation markers in an zzso zzso zzso these data provide zzso and zzso links between zzso and zzso critical zzso survival factors and zzso zzso
