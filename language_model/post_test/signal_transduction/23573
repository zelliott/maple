zzso zzso plays a central role in cell zzso Although powerful tools exist to zzso the spatial and zzso dynamics of proteins in living cells, our ability to control these dynamics has been much more zzso We previously used the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso system to recruit proteins to the plasma zzso enabling us to control the zzso of zzso signals in zzso zzso Here we extend this approach to achieve zzso zzso and zzso control of protein zzso for eight different zzso in budding zzso By tagging genes at the zzso zzso we can recruit proteins to or away from their normal sites of zzso This system provides a general strategy for zzso zzso or zzso proteins of interest by controlling their zzso and therefore their availability to binding partners and zzso as we demonstrate for zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso and spatial precision of the system make it possible to identify when and where a given zzso activity is necessary for function, as we demonstrate for the zzso zzso zzso in nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso zzso system represents a powerful approach for achieving a better understanding of complex biological zzso
