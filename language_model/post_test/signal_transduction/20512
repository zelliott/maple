zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso has been shown to act as a negative feedback regulator of growth hormone zzso gene zzso however, the mechanism of this negative feedback is poorly zzso zzso and regulation of zzso gene expression require the binding of the zzso factor zzso to the zzso promoter along with zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso binding protein zzso We investigate the role of zzso as a target of IGF-1 zzso regulation using the zzso zzso cell zzso IGF-1 significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso levels but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate zzso of zzso binding to the zzso promoter after IGF-1 zzso We hypothesized that IGF-1 zzso zzso signaling zzso the zzso complex to inhibit gene zzso In support, the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks a critical zzso site, leads to the loss of IGF-1 zzso The studies of zzso zzso zzso mice show elevated serum zzso levels, a greater response to zzso releasing hormone zzso stimulation along with lower weight gain, and decreased body zzso Our data confirm the zzso effects of IGF-1 on zzso expression at the level of the promoter and provide evidence of zzso role as a target of zzso zzso
