A novel zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso type 1 zzso was identified in human zzso zzso In this zzso zzso portions of the second and third zzso zzso zzso are zzso To determine whether zzso was functional, full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors were zzso zzso into rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones expressed respective proteins and bound zzso zzso with zzso values of 99 pm zzso and 26 pm zzso zzso and zzso zzso efficiently with zzso for binding to zzso and zzso whereas zzso was less zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso protein zzso zzso activity, increased zzso zzso zzso levels, and zzso proliferation through either zzso whereas zzso was without zzso zzso expressing clones exhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso protein that links zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso was not evident with zzso In addition, zzso zzso was not zzso zzso via activated zzso These findings indicate that zzso binds zzso and zzso with high affinity and is capable of zzso zzso but may activate zzso to occur via zzso signaling zzso
