zzso disorder is a complex psychiatric condition that has been shown to carry a great degree of genetic zzso This review addresses current research in the zzso of treatment response in bipolar disorder, with a focus on findings that have shaped our understanding of the changing direction of this field in light of recent technological zzso 

The recent publications in bipolar disorder treatment response have helped consolidate or improve upon knowledge of zzso zzso and genes in the zzso There seems to be an increasing trend toward functionally assessing the role played by putative candidate genes and molecular factors modulating expression in bipolar disorder, as well as a movement toward more zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and molecular research to date in bipolar disorder treatment response has not completely answered all the lingering questions in the field, but has contributed to the development of a more zzso understanding of zzso In order to apply these findings at a clinical level, more comprehensive treatment response studies are zzso combining recent advances in zzso zzso with functional molecular zzso
