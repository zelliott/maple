zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso and Swiss zzso zzso zzso cells, and the effects of zzso zzso on cell proliferation and zzso signaling were zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on cell growth in zzso zzso cells but inhibited DNA zzso zzso and colony formation when the cells were grown in fetal bovine serum zzso In contrast, zzso zzso DNA synthesis in zzso Swiss zzso cells and had no effect when the cells were grown in zzso These differences in growth responses were not due to differences in the level of zzso zzso as similar numbers of receptors were present in both cell zzso To determine whether the different growth effects were due to differences in zzso zzso to common second zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on several known zzso zzso In both cell types, zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso with similar zzso and zzso zzso also zzso zzso release from both cell types, although the potency was higher in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation was observed at high zzso zzso in both cell types and was much greater in cells with higher zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso had opposite effects on growth parameters in zzso and Swiss zzso cells, but only minor differences were observed in the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso to specific second zzso in the two cell zzso Thus cellular context is a principal zzso of the biological effects of zzso zzso zzso and differences in biological responses may occur independently of major differences in zzso zzso
