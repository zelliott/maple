We investigated the membrane zzso of zzso in type I and type II cells, which differ in their ability to recruit and activate zzso We found that zzso was zzso located in zzso zzso of type I cells, while it was present both in raft and zzso plasma membrane zzso of type II zzso After zzso zzso located in zzso plasma membrane was recruited to zzso zzso in both types of zzso Similarly, zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso which was prevented by a death zzso zzso zzso zzso was then rapid in type I and delayed in type II cells and showed a substantial correlation with the zzso of zzso death domain zzso zzso recruitment to zzso zzso Finally, electron zzso analysis showed that after zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso in large clusters that were zzso in zzso zzso where zzso underwent massive zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling complex formation and zzso in type I and type II cells occur in zzso zzso which are a major site of zzso zzso
