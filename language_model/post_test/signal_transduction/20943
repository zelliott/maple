We have recently zzso on young adult rat zzso rings, that zzso peptides induce a dose and zzso zzso zzso by the 67 zzso zzso of the high affinity zzso zzso and, at least in part, by zzso zzso Here we have studied the effects of zzso peptides at circulating zzso and below, on zzso rat zzso rings, as a function of zzso First, we have observed that, unlike 2-month-old zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rat zzso rings, zzso zzso rat zzso rings were unable to maintain their contraction in long lasting zzso zzso zzso peptides at zzso circulating zzso zzso zzso induce a zzso zzso on zzso zzso By contrast, only higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were effective on zzso rings, whereas rings from both younger zzso and older animals zzso did not respond to zzso zzso Finally, using zzso and zzso as zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso rings is zzso by the 67 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These experiments suggest that the functional availability of the 67 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso changes with zzso It could be hypothesized that in young animals zzso the reusable shuttle role recently demonstrated for the 67 zzso zzso zzso during elastic fiber formation leads to a major decrease in its availability for signal zzso On the contrary, in adult zzso zzso when zzso zzso is completed, this zzso is essential for zzso signal zzso zzso of this zzso in old animals zzso can be attributed to its zzso from its zzso pathway, as previously shown on human zzso Finally, the zzso variations of circulating zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso peptides are two independent parameters which could influence the vascular tension zzso
