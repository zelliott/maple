The mechanism by which chronic treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a deterioration of zzso metabolism appears to involve insulin resistance, and may also involve impaired insulin zzso Here we investigated the long-term effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso insulin zzso from beta cells and explored whether altered insulin zzso might be related to altered insulin zzso zzso cells were incubated for 48 h with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with 20 zzso zzso and insulin determined in the zzso To evaluate insulin zzso cells were zzso with 100 zzso insulin for 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 h with zzso zzso and zzso resulted in impaired zzso insulin zzso at zzso 5 and 5 zzso respectively, whereas zzso or zzso had no effects even at 20 and 100 zzso zzso The impaired insulin zzso by zzso zzso and zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso and, for zzso and zzso with decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso No such effects on signaling were observed with zzso or zzso In conclusion, certain zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso not only induce peripheral insulin resistance, but also impair zzso insulin zzso from beta zzso With respect to the long-term effect on zzso function there appear to be differences between the zzso zzso that may be clinically zzso Finally, these effects on insulin zzso after a 48 h incubation with zzso inhibitor were associated with a reduction of the zzso zzso of insulin signaling zzso particularly zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso in the insulin signaling zzso may contribute to the impaired zzso zzso
