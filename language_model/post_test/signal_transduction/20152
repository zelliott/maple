Signaling pathways lie at the heart of cellular responses to environmental zzso The ability to reconstruct specific signaling zzso ex zzso allows us to study their inherent properties in an isolated environment, which in turn enables us to zzso fundamental design principles for such zzso This synthetic biology approach for analyzing natural, zzso signaling zzso will help to bridge the gap between studies on isolated zzso zzso can provide great zzso detail but do not capture the complexity of zzso signaling zzso those on entire networks of protein zzso offer a zzso view of signal zzso but obscure the mechanisms that zzso signal transmission and zzso Additionally, minimal signaling zzso can be zzso engineered to predictably alter cellular responses, opening up possibilities for creating zzso and zzso useful cellular zzso
