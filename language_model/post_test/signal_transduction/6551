zzso zzso involves the switching of the cell zzso to one that no longer zzso zzso zzso found in normal cartilage and occurs frequently during zzso expansion in zzso It is also characterized by the differential expression of receptors and zzso proteins that are involved in signal zzso zzso including those associated with cell shape and zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to examine the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso We observed differential arrangement of zzso organization in zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso When cultivated on 300 zzso zzso zzso at day 19, zzso had lost zzso markers characteristic of the differentiated zzso including type II collagen and protein zzso C zzso On these surfaces, zzso also expressed focal zzso and signaling proteins indicative of cell attachment, zzso and zzso zzso including zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso The switch to a zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso receptors coincided with zzso zzso suggesting that binding via these receptors could play a role in maintaining the differentiated zzso on such zzso These effects can be similar to those of compounds that interfere in zzso signaling pathways and can be zzso to engineer cellular zzso
