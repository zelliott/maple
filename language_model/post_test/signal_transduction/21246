zzso zzso activity in a human zzso cell zzso cell line, zzso is enhanced by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso suppress this zzso To investigate the involvement of Ras in the signal zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to the expression of zzso zzso we introduced zzso into zzso zzso In a zzso state, the percent zzso bound to Ras in zzso cells increased about zzso compared with control cells, suggesting that zzso introduced into the zzso cancer cells is in an active form without zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells was higher than in control zzso The zzso activity was affected neither by zzso nor by zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas it was enhanced by zzso and reduced by zzso in control zzso Our observations suggest that Ras mediates the regulation zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso
