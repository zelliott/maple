zzso the production of mature zzso and zzso zzso to favorable nutritional conditions improves zzso zzso In zzso the proliferation of female zzso stem cells is regulated by nutritional zzso However, in zzso the number of female zzso stem cells is set early in development, with zzso progressing through zzso later in zzso zzso that couple later steps of zzso to environmental conditions remain largely zzso We show that, in the presence of food, the zzso zzso zzso signals through the zzso zzso to drive zzso zzso I progression and zzso in the absence of food, the zzso zzso of zzso signaling leads to zzso of the zzso pathway, and zzso is zzso Thus, the zzso signaling zzso couples zzso sensing to zzso I progression and zzso production in zzso ensuring that zzso are only produced under conditions favorable for the survival of the resulting zzso
