We evaluated the role of the G zzso zzso zzso of zzso G proteins in the insulin signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso We inhibited zzso zzso function by single cell zzso of zzso zzso or zzso protein (a GAP protein for zzso followed by zzso to assess zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by 60 or zzso respectively, indicating that activated zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso We then assessed the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso by using an zzso expression zzso In the zzso state, zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso insulin zzso This effect of zzso was inhibited by zzso suggesting that it is zzso zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso stimulates zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso by 3- and zzso respectively, whereas insulin stimulates this activity mostly in zzso by zzso Nevertheless, only zzso of zzso (and not zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effects induced by zzso are dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso appears to play a necessary role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso action in the insulin signaling zzso is upstream of and dependent upon zzso and zzso zzso can transmit signals from the insulin zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso which leads to zzso zzso
