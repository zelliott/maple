zzso specific for zzso fragments are found in the zzso of persons afflicted with zzso syndrome zzso However, the mechanism for zzso degradation remains zzso The following experiments zzso Par zzso cells to examine the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso particularly in the zzso and release of zzso an apparent SS zzso Five zzso zzso stimulation induced zzso cell death with a sustained zzso influx, which was zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso releasing zzso fragments through membrane zzso However, both zzso cell death and zzso zzso were inhibited in the presence of 300 zzso zzso zzso an irreversible blocker of zzso or in zzso zzso We concluded that zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso degradation in zzso zzso cells, providing an important clue zzso the presence of zzso fragments in SS zzso
