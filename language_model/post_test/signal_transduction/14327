Shift work or zzso travel can zzso the body's zzso rhythms from local zzso zzso The zzso zzso nucleus zzso generates and zzso daily rhythms in physiology and zzso Paradoxically, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso implicated in zzso among zzso cells, can also zzso zzso The degree and duration of zzso among zzso zzso depended on both the phase and the dose of zzso A model of the zzso consisting of coupled zzso cells predicted both the zzso and the zzso response to zzso and that the transient phase zzso or zzso zzso could arise from zzso zzso noise in small populations of key molecules zzso Period zzso near its daily zzso The model also predicted that phase tumbling following brief zzso treatment would accelerate zzso to shifted environmental zzso We tested this using a zzso of zzso during the day before a shift in either a light cycle in zzso or a temperature cycle in zzso Although zzso during the day does not shift zzso zzso the zzso zzso approximately zzso the time required for mice to zzso to an zzso shifted light schedule and for zzso cultures to zzso to a zzso shifted temperature zzso We conclude that zzso below 100 zzso zzso zzso cells and above 100 zzso reduces zzso in the zzso We show that exploiting these mechanisms that zzso reduce cellular zzso before a large shift in the schedule of daily environmental cues has the potential to reduce jet zzso
