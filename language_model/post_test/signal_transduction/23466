Human zzso has recently been found as a processing zzso sensor of zzso viral zzso acids and triggers signaling for type I zzso zzso Here zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso 463 zzso zzso The putative zzso contains a zzso domain and two zzso zzso zzso The zzso has high identity at the zzso acid level to those of zzso human and mouse zzso and is transcribed in different zzso of zzso In zzso or zzso cells, zzso was localized in the zzso as zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso cells enhanced activities of zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso transcription, and zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso indicating that zzso is a potential signal zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso We also found that zzso zzso promoter activity was zzso by zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus infection in zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso expressed in virtually all zzso more research is needed to explore its role in initial phase of viral infections of pigs and its relationship with zzso in sensing zzso for type I zzso zzso
