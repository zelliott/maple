To determine whether zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors interact by determining their effect on zzso release, zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso from male zzso rats were divided into pieces or zzso with zzso to form zzso With the use of an imaging system, zzso was measured in zzso loaded with zzso zzso zzso zzso release was determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso our index for protein zzso was measured zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso release from pieces in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso increase in zzso but not in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso increase in zzso but not zzso zzso The increase in zzso caused by zzso and zzso used simultaneously or zzso was zzso as was the increase in zzso zzso The zzso of protein zzso C zzso or calcium zzso zzso II did not alter the zzso increase in zzso 

The authors conclude that zzso of zzso releases zzso which zzso zzso receptors to increase zzso but not to stimulate protein zzso zzso receptors in turn activate zzso to increase zzso but not to stimulate protein zzso Furthermore, zzso compared with zzso receptors use different cellular mechanisms to increase zzso and cause protein zzso
