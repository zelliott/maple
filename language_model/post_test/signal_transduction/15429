zzso zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis zzso and an increasing number of promising molecular targets for zzso therapies have been described zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso is well known to be the principal factor that leads to tissue zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate the ability of zzso a novel small compound that zzso zzso signaling through the zzso of nuclear zzso of zzso binding protein 1, to prevent tissue zzso in zzso or in mouse models of zzso 

Human zzso zzso were exposed to zzso at various zzso in the presence of zzso and levels of collagen or zzso expression were zzso zzso (15 zzso for 14 zzso was administered orally to tight skin mice and to mice with zzso pulmonary zzso Improvement of tissue zzso was evaluated by zzso or zzso examination in each zzso 

zzso with zzso prevented zzso promoter zzso in a zzso manner; however, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso collagen or zzso expression were also confirmed in zzso zzso administered zzso significantly reduced zzso thickness and zzso content in tight skin mice, and markedly decreased the zzso score and zzso content in the lungs of zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso is a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso resulting in the improvement of skin and pulmonary zzso zzso available zzso might therefore be useful in the treatment of zzso
