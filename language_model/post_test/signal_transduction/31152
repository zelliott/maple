zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso is a key member of the zzso factor network regulating zzso differentiation and zzso zzso of the zzso gene involves physical interaction between a distant zzso and the zzso promoter region, bound by distinct sets of zzso zzso Here we report that, upon zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in human zzso zzso This effect is zzso by the loss of zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso II to the zzso zzso promoter was zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso from the zzso regulatory regions, and the zzso complex was zzso Interestingly, the extent of zzso zzso did not decrease at either regulatory region, and zzso and zzso as well as components of the zzso remained associated with the zzso promoter during the zzso zzso The results point to an absolute requirement of zzso communication for maintaining the active state of the zzso gene and provide evidence for a molecular zzso zzso which may contribute to the prevention of permanent zzso of the locus during the zzso zzso
