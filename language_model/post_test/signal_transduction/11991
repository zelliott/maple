The role of zzso and their zzso which regulate trafficking and zzso of zzso to inflamed zzso in human or zzso zzso zzso has not yet been zzso in detail, zzso the role of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso was studied in zzso inflammation of the peripheral nervous zzso 

zzso and/or zzso interactions were specifically inhibited by the compounds zzso or zzso respectively, in experimental zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso 

Disease activity was significantly suppressed by blocking zzso while zzso of zzso enhanced disease zzso zzso disease activity was accompanied by significantly increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in regional zzso zzso and zzso as well as by increased serum levels of zzso Furthermore, by blocking zzso expression of the cell zzso molecules zzso and zzso was zzso on vascular zzso cells of the zzso zzso which coincided with significantly increased zzso of the zzso nerve by zzso T cells and zzso zzso combined zzso of both zzso and zzso significantly suppressed disease zzso This was accompanied by increased zzso of activated and highly zzso zzso zzso T cells in regional zzso zzso and zzso however, these cells were unable to zzso the zzso zzso 

These data suggest differential and zzso ordered roles for zzso zzso effects during zzso zzso interaction is a gatekeeper for zzso cells, regardless of their zzso state of zzso
