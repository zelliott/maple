zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso is essential for peripheral nerve zzso zzso zzso receptors for zzso zzso cooperate with other receptors to transmit signals that coordinate cell cycle progression and initiation of zzso including zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex with focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso To study the assembly of this signaling complex in zzso cells zzso we induced zzso zzso zzso on suspended cells using an immobilized zzso and recovered a complex containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In adherent zzso cells, the proteins zzso to zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso We assessed the role of zzso in the process of zzso complex assembly by introducing zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso into the zzso Although zzso caused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to zzso with zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso and small focal contacts remained zzso We conclude that zzso do not require active zzso to recruit signaling and structural proteins to zzso zzso clustered at the plasma zzso zzso is required to establish large focal zzso and to spread and stabilize plasma membrane zzso
