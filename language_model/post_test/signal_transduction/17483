The effects of zzso growth factor zzso on zzso D zzso activity and zzso acid zzso synthesis in rat zzso zzso cells have been zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso results in enhanced zzso production and the zzso zzso formation in the presence of ethanol, indicating the zzso of zzso acting on zzso zzso The zzso curve for zzso generation and DNA synthesis were zzso In addition, the effects of zzso on both zzso formation and zzso incorporation into zzso material was blocked by the potent protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso a relatively weak inhibitor of zzso suggesting that zzso plays an important role as a positive regulator of zzso cell growth via a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso which depends largely on the zzso of zzso
