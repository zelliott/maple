To assess the effects of zzso on cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso rat heart zzso were incubated with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso for different zzso The zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities showed an increase at 10 zzso and a decrease at 30 zzso of incubation with X plus zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso also produced zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso The density of zzso was decreased when cardiac zzso were treated with X plus zzso for 10 and 30 zzso whereas the affinity of zzso was increased after 10 zzso and reduced after 30 zzso of zzso The zzso were not modified at 10 zzso whereas incubation of cardiac zzso with X plus zzso for 30 zzso increased the affinity and decreased the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso in cardiac zzso were increased at 10 zzso and decreased at 30 zzso of incubation with X plus zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso were not affected on treatment of zzso with X plus zzso zzso of zzso zzso plus zzso in the incubation medium prevented the X plus zzso zzso in zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and changes in the characteristics of zzso except the increased affinity of zzso at 10 zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso due to X plus zzso are zzso in nature and these changes may likely be due to the formation of zzso
