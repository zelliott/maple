zzso between stem cells and zzso are important in establishing the stem cell zzso However, very little is known about the regulation of any zzso stem cell niche as pure zzso of stem cells and their adjacent zzso are not readily zzso The prostate offers a unique model to study signals between stem cells and their adjacent zzso as in the embryonic prostate stem cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso is easily separated from the zzso stem zzso Here we investigate the distinctive molecular signals of these two stem cell compartments in a zzso zzso 

We isolated fetal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and determined their zzso expressed zzso To distinguish transcripts that are shared by other developing zzso compartments from those that pertain to the prostate stem cell zzso we also determined the global gene expression of zzso and zzso of the same zzso Our analysis indicates that several of the key zzso components that are predicted to be active in the embryonic prostate stem cell niche regulate processes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso and cell migration zzso zzso and zzso Several of the enriched promoter binding motifs are shared between the prostate zzso compartments and their zzso counterparts, indicating their likely relevance in zzso signaling in primitive cellular zzso Based on differential gene expression we also defined zzso interactions that may be part of the molecular interplay of the embryonic prostate stem cell zzso 

We provide a comprehensive description of the zzso program of the major regulators that are likely to control the cellular interactions in the embryonic zzso stem cell zzso many of which may be common to zzso niches in zzso This study provides a comprehensive source for further studies of zzso interactions in the prostate stem cell zzso The zzso of pathways in the normal primitive niche may provide greater insight into mechanisms zzso during abnormal zzso and zzso zzso zzso these events may result in the development of specific targeted therapies for zzso diseases such as benign zzso zzso and zzso
