zzso of signaling receptors zzso zzso in particular, starting at the plasma membrane and finishing in zzso zzso implies zzso multiple interactions with zzso zzso and zzso of other origin zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso size zzso In addition, the characteristics of zzso zzso is zzso zzso from cell periphery to zzso zzso Thus, zzso as a highly dynamic process develops in time and zzso Obviously one of the most productive approach is light zzso zzso that allows of zzso zzso dynamics at the level of one or several zzso Different impacts influencing zzso regulator components are inevitably reflected on dynamics of zzso size and zzso its zzso This provide possibility to uncover the both crucial and secondary components of regulatory zzso However, visual zzso of such effects is often too zzso and does not allow getting statistically reliable zzso zzso of different experiments even in the case of the same series is also zzso In this work we use such parameters as apparent zzso size zzso area or zzso and zzso number per cell to provide quantitative zzso of fusion zzso as well as the zzso reflecting zzso zzso in zzso region as a measure of their zzso along zzso toward nucleus zzso and present these parameters application using zzso zzso zzso as an zzso
