zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso zzso that mediates immune responses against viral infections through zzso zzso In an attempt to identify novel tools that zzso zzso production, we used zzso technology to screen zzso zzso that specifically target zzso zzso Most of the selected zzso zzso contained zzso motifs in the second half regions that played critical roles in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Unlike other known zzso zzso zzso bound and activated zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso domain of zzso were used for zzso zzso but intact zzso protein was required to exert zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, replication of zzso zzso and influenza virus in infected host cells was efficiently blocked by zzso or zzso with zzso zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso zzso has strong potential to be an zzso agent that specifically boosts the zzso signaling zzso
