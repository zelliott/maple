We have used a sensitive zzso for zzso zzso activity to investigate the role of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in early zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso activity is low during zzso stages and increases significantly during zzso The zzso profile of this activity zzso well with the expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is lowest in animal pole tissue and higher in vegetal pole cells and the marginal zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso signaling is active in all three germ layers of the early zzso This activity is necessary for normal expression of zzso a zzso marker, in the zzso as well as in the zzso indicating that zzso zzso plays a functional role in patterning of both of these germ zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso during zzso also suggest a role for zzso signaling in this zzso In addition, we find that embryonic wounding during dissection results in significant stimulation of this pathway, providing a possible explanation for earlier observations of effects of surgical manipulation on cell fate in early zzso
