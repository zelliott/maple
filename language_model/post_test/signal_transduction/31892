zzso muscle growth and zzso rely on zzso zzso and satellite cells, the stem cells of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signals during mouse development results in premature differentiation of zzso zzso and formation of very small muscle zzso Here we show that this drastic effect is rescued by zzso of the muscle differentiation factor zzso However, rescued zzso zzso do not zzso satellite cell position and contribute poorly to zzso zzso The disrupted zzso is due to a deficit in zzso zzso assembly around emerging satellite cells and to their impaired zzso to zzso On a molecular level, emerging satellite cells zzso the expression of zzso zzso components and zzso molecules like zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso signals control zzso of satellite cells, stimulating them zzso to their own zzso and to adhere to zzso
