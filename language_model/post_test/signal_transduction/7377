We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso caused elevated vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso and enhanced zzso zzso resulting in zzso tumor zzso and reduced tumor growth in adult zzso However, direct evidence demonstrating that zzso zzso regulate zzso specifically through zzso zzso is still zzso In addition, whether the lack of zzso causes abnormal zzso during embryonic development remains zzso 

A novel strain of zzso zzso mice that are zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso at different zzso stages showed that deletion of zzso caused defective embryonic zzso and retarded zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso using isolated primary zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated that zzso reduction in zzso cells was sufficient to restore normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso network zzso These findings were zzso by in zzso wound healing, inflammatory zzso and tumor zzso zzso in which reduction of zzso was sufficient to rescue abnormal zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

Our results provide the first genetic demonstration that zzso function specifically to zzso zzso by zzso activated zzso zzso and degradation and that genetic reduction of zzso level protects against excessive zzso caused by zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso may be a potential therapeutic target in conditions in which tightly regulated zzso is zzso such as in diabetic wound healing and zzso
