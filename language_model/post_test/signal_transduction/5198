zzso allows for the removal of damaged, aged, and/or excess cells without harm to surrounding zzso To accomplish this, cells undergoing zzso acquire new activities that enable them to zzso the fate and function of nearby zzso We have shown that zzso recognition of zzso versus zzso target cells by viable kidney zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso the activity of several signaling pathways critically involved in regulation of proliferation and zzso Generally, zzso and zzso targets have opposite effects with zzso targets zzso and zzso targets stimulating the activity of these zzso Here we explore the consequences of these signaling zzso We show that recognition of zzso targets zzso a profound decrease in zzso viability through increased zzso cell death and decreased zzso In contrast, zzso targets promote viability through decreased death and increased zzso Both target types mediate their effects through a network of zzso and zzso zzso zzso targets zzso zzso viability in part through a reduction in cellular zzso and decreased zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of viability occurs through zzso of zzso suggesting that death zzso pathways are zzso zzso targets also activate zzso which partially protects zzso from zzso zzso The response of zzso cells varies depending on their tissue zzso Some cell lines, like zzso demonstrate decreased zzso whereas others zzso zzso show increased zzso By acting as sentinels of environmental change, zzso targets allow neighboring cells, especially zzso zzso cells, to monitor and potentially adapt to local zzso
