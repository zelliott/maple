zzso weakness is associated with a poor prognosis in zzso Several data suggest that zzso and muscle wasting may be related through zzso of the zzso zzso associated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso We therefore zzso that this might occur in the zzso of COPD zzso We studied 105 stable COPD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 27 age and gender matched zzso We measured zzso mass, zzso strength and daily physical activity using zzso zzso A zzso biopsy was obtained in which components of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Patients had reduced zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and exhibited zzso weakness zzso zzso zzso voluntary contraction force zzso zzso predicted and zzso zzso predicted for patients and controls respectively, p zzso zzso Physical activity was significantly reduced in the patient zzso in particular mean zzso locomotion time was 101 zzso zzso hours in controls and 48 zzso minutes in patients zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso obtained from these patients, no differences were observed for total or zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the downstream products both zzso and zzso zzso were reduced in COPD patients while zzso was not different from zzso No zzso correlated with zzso data within the patient zzso We conclude that, despite the presence of reduced zzso mass, zzso weakness and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in skeletal muscle of stable zzso with zzso
