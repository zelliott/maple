The molecular mechanisms through which sensory zzso stimulate zzso zzso nerves are poorly zzso The current study was aimed at evaluating the potential contribution of zzso sensory zzso pathways in this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both acted as sensory zzso Large dose zzso zzso to induce zzso of transient zzso potential zzso zzso zzso C fibers greatly reduced, but did not zzso the sensory irritation response to zzso zzso and was without effect on the response to zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts largely on zzso zzso C zzso and zzso acts on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The response to zzso was diminished by zzso with the broad-based zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso providing evidence that zzso stimulates zzso nerves via the A1 zzso The sensory irritation responses to 275 zzso zzso and 110 zzso zzso acid zzso were significantly reduced by zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso signaling pathways in zzso of the sensory zzso response by these zzso If sensory nerves are activated by zzso that are released from injured airway zzso cells, then zzso sensory nerve zzso may be a reflection of zzso zzso in airway cell zzso
