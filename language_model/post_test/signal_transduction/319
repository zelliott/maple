zzso toxin has the potential to induce expression of zzso zzso although the underlying mechanisms are not well zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso an zzso toxin produced by some zzso zzso zzso coli, on the zzso of zzso zzso is known to be a zzso which selectively degrades zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso caused rapid zzso of zzso Following the degradation of zzso transient zzso of zzso was observed with a peak at zzso zzso the zzso subsided within 24 h despite the continuous absence of intact zzso The zzso of zzso was preceded by transient zzso of zzso Treatment of the cells with a selective inhibitor of zzso or an inhibitor of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso is an event upstream of zzso zzso of zzso caused the unfolded protein response zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso triggered the three major branches of the zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso did not zzso zzso of zzso by zzso In contrast, genetic and pharmacological zzso of zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that loss of zzso by zzso leads to transient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso through the zzso branch of the zzso
