Growth factor deprivation is a zzso mechanism to regulate cell zzso We zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso line to identify proteins that interact with Bad upon zzso stimulation or zzso Using the zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins and zzso techniques, we found that Bad interacts with protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Bad is induced by zzso and its zzso zzso with appearance of zzso zzso deprivation zzso Bad zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso zzso A zzso zzso activity, sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso acid, was detected in Bad zzso from zzso cells, increasing after zzso zzso This zzso activity also zzso in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso acid blocks Bad zzso and prevents cell zzso Finally, Ras zzso controls the zzso activity of zzso These results strongly suggest that Bad is an in zzso and in zzso zzso for zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso may operate by regulating Bad zzso through zzso zzso whose zzso activity is regulated by zzso
