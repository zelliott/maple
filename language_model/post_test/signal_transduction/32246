zzso have various essential functions in metabolism and in determining cell fate during zzso In addition, zzso are also important zzso in a number of signaling zzso For example, zzso can zzso signals transmitted by second zzso such as zzso Because zzso are also major sources of zzso oxygen species zzso they can contribute to zzso zzso example, by the production of zzso such as hydrogen zzso that can zzso modify zzso zzso and thus the activity of target zzso zzso zzso production is thought to play a role in zzso signaling by stabilizing the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso New evidence has extended the mechanism of zzso zzso signaling in cellular responses to zzso in interesting and unexpected zzso zzso altered the zzso transport of zzso so that the zzso accumulated in the zzso region, where they increased the zzso concentration of zzso The increased zzso in turn enhanced the expression of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso growth zzso not by zzso zzso a zzso but by zzso DNA sequences in the zzso response element of the zzso zzso This paper and other recent work suggest a new twist on zzso zzso that the zzso of zzso within the cell can be a component of regulatory zzso
