The zzso and identification of human zzso zzso had been delayed, compared with other zzso hormones, until the determination of total zzso acid sequence of zzso in zzso A full-length zzso for the zzso zzso was identified from zzso and breast cancer cell lines in zzso zzso identification of zzso for zzso zzso of several species revealed that molecular size of zzso receptors could be classified into three forms, zzso long, short and zzso according to the length of zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso signal zzso has not been clarified zzso However, protein zzso C may be involved in this zzso Further studies are necessary to investigate the relationship between molecular size of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
