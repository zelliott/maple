The structure and function of the zzso complex containing a zzso of the gamma chain of the high affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso the zzso gamma gene into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso Introduction of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso induced a high expression of the zzso complex on the cell zzso zzso zzso gamma formed a zzso and associated firmly with the zzso alpha beta zzso but only zzso with the zzso gamma delta zzso zzso of both zzso gamma and zzso zzso zzso by zzso against zzso or zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso the zzso response, zzso production, and growth zzso On the other hand, zzso stimulation of zzso expressing zzso gamma as well as zzso zzso induced zzso production, but only the latter exhibited the zzso growth zzso In zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso gamma zzso associates with the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso gamma zzso is able to form a functional zzso complex but that the mode of assembly and the signaling function of zzso zzso zzso including its association with zzso zzso may differ from the zzso complex containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This provides an example which illustrates that different zzso zzso mediate distinct signals and zzso
