zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are negative regulators of signaling zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and are thought to act in a cooperative manner when forming a zzso Here we studied the zzso dynamics of the zzso complex in T zzso We demonstrate that zzso of this complex is necessary for recruitment of zzso to the plasma zzso where it zzso zzso zzso Development of a potent and selective chemical probe of zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso zzso when removed from zzso Our findings may explain the reduced zzso signaling associated with a zzso zzso that zzso increased risk for certain zzso diseases, including type 1 diabetes and zzso arthritis, and results in expression of a zzso zzso that is unable to bind zzso Our compound also represents a starting point for the development of a zzso treatment of zzso
