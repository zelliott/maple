zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso are initiating events in cases of human zzso diffuse gastric cancer zzso indicating that zzso is a tumor zzso Among the zzso zzso identified so far, some are zzso but the pathological relevance of these zzso zzso is still zzso In zzso zzso show that zzso zzso result in full-length zzso molecules that retain some distinct biological activity, but in zzso functional studies in animal models are still zzso Here we verify the potential of a zzso model to in zzso characterize the functional consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to identify signaling pathways affected by these zzso To this end, we have generated transgenic fly strains expressing the zzso zzso gene or its zzso zzso Similar to the fly zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso forms in fly zzso resulted in their zzso to the zzso zzso In addition, we verify a zzso correlation associated to the specific domain affected by the zzso because cells expressing normal or zzso zzso zzso display different migratory and invasive behaviors in fly zzso We show that some of these effects might be zzso through zzso interacting with the zzso fly zzso zzso thus interfering with the zzso signaling zzso zzso the use of this simple in zzso system will contribute to characterize the effects that zzso zzso have on cell behavior in a tissue environment, and might help to understand their significance in gastric cancer zzso
