zzso zzso contraction of zzso circular smooth muscle cells was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In lower zzso zzso zzso cells contraction was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso reduced zzso contraction of zzso but not of LES cells, which suggested that different zzso G proteins are zzso zzso against zzso antagonized contraction of zzso cells and zzso zzso antagonized contraction of LES zzso The zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso contraction of LES but not of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso which inhibit a zzso zzso D zzso pathway, reduced contraction of zzso but not of LES muscle zzso At 1 and 5 zzso after the administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased only in LES muscle, which suggested that contraction results from zzso zzso production in the LES but not in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and depletion of zzso zzso stores by zzso or zzso inhibited zzso contraction of LES but not of zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso contraction depends zzso on zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and production of zzso zzso and is independent of zzso formation and the release of zzso zzso zzso LES contraction is zzso through zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation and the release of zzso zzso
