We zzso assessed rates of cell replication and of zzso during the development and zzso of liver zzso In rats, zzso activity gradually increased from normal liver to putative zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso At all zzso rates of cell replication were higher than of zzso allowing a preferential net gain of zzso zzso As in rats, in human zzso birth and death rates were increased zzso indicating a zzso zzso zzso of the increasing cell turnover were studied in rats using the administration and withdrawal of zzso zzso a liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced cell number in normal liver by zzso while zzso and liver tumors were amplified at least zzso After stopping zzso treatment, cell replication zzso while cell elimination by zzso was increased in normal and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the most pronounced shifts from replication toward zzso As a result, 5 weeks after halting zzso zzso of cells in normal liver, but about zzso of zzso zzso including zzso were zzso The implications of these findings include that zzso zzso can act as survival factors even for zzso zzso Furthermore, tumor cells not only exhibit excessive zzso but also undergo zzso at rates that far exceed those in normal zzso zzso zzso of cell death by the survival activity of zzso zzso results in selective growth of zzso zzso On the other hand, blockade of survival effects leads to excessive zzso in zzso and seems promising as a therapeutic concept for the selective elimination of zzso zzso
