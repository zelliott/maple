zzso zzso is a major constituent of the zzso zzso We now provide evidence for a zzso zzso of zzso that is zzso by T cells upon zzso The zzso zzso has an unusual zzso zzso an additional domain, zzso is produced whereas sequences within another domain, zzso are spliced zzso zzso the binding domain for very late zzso zzso however, is still zzso To study the potential function of zzso zzso its synthesis was zzso by an zzso zzso then proliferation of T cells was induced by zzso zzso zzso was reduced as was expression of zzso Moreover, when T cells were cultured in high density, the synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to zzso inhibited zzso as did zzso to zzso We propose that zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso which by binding to zzso on an adjacent cell, provides a zzso zzso thus sustaining zzso zzso
