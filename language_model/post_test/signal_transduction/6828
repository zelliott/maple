The best-established mechanism of zzso dependence is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso pathway, which was reported to be zzso regulated by hydrogen zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso The present study was, therefore, designed to determine whether zzso is able to zzso the development of zzso dependence via zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that application of sodium zzso zzso and zzso two donors of zzso significantly alleviated zzso robust withdrawal jumping (the most sensitive and reliable index of zzso physical zzso in zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso inhibited the zzso protein expression of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also attenuated zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso 1 and 8, production of zzso and zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso in mice zzso These effects were zzso by the application of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells on treatment with zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso 1/2 zzso with its specific inhibitor attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or stimulation of zzso zzso production also significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso treatment is important in prevention of the development of zzso dependence via suppression of zzso zzso in both animal and cellular zzso 

Our data suggest a potential role of zzso in attenuating the development of zzso zzso and the underlying mechanism is closely related to the zzso of zzso zzso
