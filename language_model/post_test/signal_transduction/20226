How does a cell respond to numerous external stresses with a limited number of internal molecular zzso It has been observed that there are some common responses of zzso to various zzso but most observations were based on zzso profiles and only some part of the common responses were zzso zzso So far there has been no zzso analysis to identify commonly responsive or regulated genes against various zzso In this study, we identified a core regulation module zzso a commonly involved regulation structure in the regulatory networks of zzso which cells zzso in response to an array of environmental zzso We found that regulators in the zzso constitute a zzso backbone of the zzso regulatory network and that the zzso is zzso well zzso stable against genetic variations and crucial for cell zzso All these findings were consistently held up to considerable noise levels that we introduced to address experimental noise and the resulting false zzso of regulatory zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso might be an zzso zzso information processing unit that zzso a cell with enhanced zzso and efficiency in dealing with numerous environmental stresses with a limited number of internal zzso
