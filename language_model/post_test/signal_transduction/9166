zzso electrical stimulation results in development of zzso and a permanent increase in seizure zzso zzso The zzso of kindling suggests that chronic changes in gene expression are zzso zzso at different sites produces specific effects on zzso behaviors such as spatial zzso and anxiety, suggesting that zzso changes in gene expression might be restricted to the zzso zzso We employed focused zzso analysis to characterize changes in gene expression associated with zzso and zzso zzso Male zzso rats received 1 s trains of electrical stimulation to either the zzso or zzso once daily until five generalized zzso had been zzso zzso control rats carried zzso but were not zzso zzso were zzso 14 days after the last seizures, both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso profiles zzso Of the 1,200 rat zzso genes zzso 39 genes exhibited statistically significant expression differences between the zzso and zzso zzso and 106 genes exhibited statistically significant differences between the zzso and zzso zzso In the amygdala, subsequent zzso analyses using the zzso zzso demonstrated significant enrichment in categories related to zzso reorganization and zzso zzso as well as in gene families related to synaptic transmission and zzso In the zzso significant enrichment in gene expression within categories related to zzso reorganization and zzso transport was similarly zzso Furthermore, unique to the zzso enrichment in zzso factor activity and zzso signal zzso was zzso Overall, these data identify specific and unique zzso pathways chronically altered following kindling in the two sites, and provide a platform for defining the molecular basis for the differential behaviors observed in the zzso zzso
