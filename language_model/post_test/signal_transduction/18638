zzso and temporally coordinated changes in gene expression are crucial to orderly progression of zzso We combine mouse zzso with experimental manipulation of zzso to analyze the zzso by which the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso control gene expression in the zzso zzso of mouse limb zzso Although most zzso cells respond rapidly to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of specific zzso target signals in the zzso occurs with differential zzso zzso and in a zzso restricted zzso In particular, the expression of the zzso zzso zzso is always zzso in zzso cells located zzso to the zzso source and acts upstream of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso is, in turn, required to zzso zzso and establish the zzso zzso expression zzso of the zzso zzso jagged 1 zzso and zzso genes in the zzso limb bud zzso Their establishment is significantly delayed in zzso limb buds and cannot be rescued by specific restoration of zzso zzso in zzso limb zzso This shows that zzso feedback zzso is required for regulation of the zzso zzso of the zzso response to zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso signal zzso at distinct time points reveals the differential zzso dependence of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression on zzso zzso In particular, the expression of zzso depends on zzso signal zzso significantly longer than does zzso zzso revealing that the reverse zzso establishment, but not maintenance of their zzso zzso expression zzso depends on zzso zzso
