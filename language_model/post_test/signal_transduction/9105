To establish whether zzso zzso exerts its zzso effect on the zzso release of zzso by interacting with an zzso pathway, normal volunteers were treated with zzso during (2 zzso cigarettes smoking and with zzso zzso significantly increased serum zzso levels about zzso zzso zzso alone did not change zzso rise induced by cigarette zzso The zzso effect of zzso by nicotine was completely blocked by zzso In the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso levels rose zzso fold in response to zzso Since zzso only partially reversed the zzso action of zzso only a partial involvement of zzso peptides in zzso action might be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso might produce this zzso effect on zzso rise in response to cigarette smoking through independent zzso
