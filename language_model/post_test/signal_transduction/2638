The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed by zzso lineage zzso In this study we have investigated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in maintaining cellular zzso Using a series of zzso zzso beta deletion zzso we demonstrate that there are at least two zzso of zzso beta that contribute to viability zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso causes a viability zzso that can be rescued with fetal calf serum zzso zzso of zzso zzso in contrast, causes a further zzso in viability that can be only partially compensated by the addition of zzso zzso beta truncated zzso to zzso acid 517 will not support long-term growth under any zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is contained within the zzso viability domain, to zzso eliminates all zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Cell lines zzso with zzso zzso beta zzso have a viability disadvantage when compared to cell lines containing zzso zzso that is partially rescued by the addition of zzso We studied signal zzso in zzso cell lines in an effort to identify pathways that might participate in the viability zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is intact in zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso is zzso This suggests a potential role for zzso and potentially zzso in a zzso signaling zzso that helps maintain cellular zzso
