We previously demonstrated that zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso osteogenesis and in zzso bone formation by human zzso stem cells zzso To analyze the zzso response of this phenomenon and to translate our findings into a clinical trial, suitable animal models and cell lines are zzso In this report, we assessed whether zzso plays a similar zzso role played by two commonly used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a number of model zzso To this end, we treated zzso cells, mouse zzso zzso mouse zzso and rat zzso with zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso osteogenesis in zzso cell types, evidenced by zzso of zzso markers such as alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen type 1 zzso In support of this, ex zzso mouse zzso exposed to zzso showed a reduction in bone zzso Interestingly, zzso even zzso zzso differentiation in rat zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso osteogenesis in zzso and bone formation ex zzso in zzso models in contrast to our earlier findings in zzso The species zzso in response to various zzso signals is a critical need to be tested in clinically relevant models to translate the fundamental findings in lower species level to clinical zzso
