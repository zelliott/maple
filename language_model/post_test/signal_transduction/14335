The zzso of the small zzso zzso Ras by the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1) is a central feature of many zzso signaling zzso In developing T cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to stimulate cellular proliferation and zzso We showed that in addition to its zzso activity, zzso acted as a scaffold to zzso zzso of the T cell zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso of T zzso in zzso The scaffold function of zzso depended on its ability to bind to the zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso were zzso functions in zzso Whereas the zzso activity of zzso was required for optimal zzso zzso in response to T cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, both of these zzso functions were required for early zzso zzso Whereas transgenic restoration of either the zzso activity or the zzso zzso functions of zzso alone failed to rescue zzso development in zzso mice, simultaneous zzso of these two signals in the same cell restored normal T cell zzso This ability of zzso to act both as a zzso and as a scaffold to zzso zzso zzso zzso may also occur in other zzso zzso such as those activated by growth factor zzso
