zzso bystander effects have been seen in zzso cells from diverse zzso These effects can be transmitted through the medium to cells not present at the time of zzso We have developed an zzso for detecting bystander effects in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso allows zzso exposure of zzso cells to cells that have received electron beam zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso electrons from a zzso electron zzso When survival of the zzso cells decreased to approximately zzso zzso to zzso resistance increased in the zzso bystander zzso Further increase in dose had no additional effect on this zzso In order to detect this response, it was necessary for the zzso zzso cell ratio to be zzso Other cellular zzso such as heat treatment, zzso zzso and zzso exposure, also caused a zzso response in zzso cells grown with the treated zzso We discuss evolutionary implications of these zzso
