zzso sites for the zzso regulatory factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso are present in the promoter regions of many of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso important in inducing acute inflammatory responses associated with critical zzso Because increased zzso of zzso leads to enhanced expression of these zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a central event in the development of multiple organ dysfunction associated with infection, blood loss, and zzso zzso zzso is normally retained in the zzso through its association with the zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso of I zzso allows zzso to zzso to the nucleus and induce transcription, once associated with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso can be regulated at multiple steps, including the amount of I zzso present, zzso zzso zzso and competition for zzso zzso Because of the central role that zzso occupies in modulating zzso responses, further understanding of its regulation will be important in designing future therapies able to prevent or minimize acute inflammatory injury associated with critical zzso
