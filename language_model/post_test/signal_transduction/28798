Whole body insulin resistance and diabetes are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, yet little is known about insulin resistance in the diabetic zzso The aim of this work was to define the insulin response in hearts of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso model of spontaneous type 2 zzso 

We measured zzso zzso before and after insulin zzso plus initial steps of the insulin signaling zzso after insulin infusion via the zzso zzso zzso in hearts from the male zzso and spontaneously diabetic zzso zzso 

Despite normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was 50% zzso lower in zzso rat hearts compared with their zzso zzso Total zzso protein was depleted by zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso We found zzso zzso and 38% zzso decreased protein levels of insulin zzso beta zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso rat hearts with 37% zzso and zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso to the decreased zzso protein levels, zzso rat hearts had a zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso protein association with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso despite normal zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso B was the same in all hearts, as was protein zzso B zzso 

We conclude that decreased insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rat zzso
