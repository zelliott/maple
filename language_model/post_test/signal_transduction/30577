Signal zzso is initiated when a zzso binds to the zzso zzso of its zzso bringing them together and triggering a complicated sequence of events inside the zzso In this issue, zzso et zzso zzso present crystal structures of three signaling complexes of the zzso zzso and zzso with their zzso showing how events taking place outside the cell may affect the specificity of signal zzso
