zzso of the zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso triggers cellular responses implicated in the zzso of diabetic zzso blockade of zzso has been shown to inhibit the development of diabetic zzso To develop a screening system to identify novel zzso of advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso we used an zzso binding system in zzso zzso test compounds were screened using this zzso To construct human zzso cells, mouse zzso cells zzso were zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and selected under 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was analyzed by Western zzso with specific zzso zzso To identify novel zzso of zzso zzso 50 single compounds and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled with Alexa zzso were treated to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was washed and zzso measured by zzso plate reader zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, only treatment with zzso zzso significantly increased zzso intensity in a zzso zzso Of 50 compounds tested, zzso disrupted zzso binding in a zzso zzso This zzso binding system using zzso zzso in zzso cells was suitable for screening of agents that disrupt zzso zzso
