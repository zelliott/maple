zzso zzso is known as an zzso zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso action of zzso has been attributed to its zzso action on zzso zzso Y zzso an appetite stimulant in the zzso This study was aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms behind the zzso effect of zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment decreased food zzso which was correlated with changes of zzso zzso level, but increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso To determine if zzso or zzso was involved in the zzso response of zzso infusions of zzso zzso into the brain were performed at 1 h before daily zzso treatment in freely moving rats, and the results showed that zzso or zzso zzso could block this zzso response and restore zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso or zzso zzso could partially block zzso zzso level that might involve in the zzso of zzso gene zzso It was suggested that zzso signaling might involve in the central regulation of zzso feeding suppression via the zzso of zzso gene zzso
