Recent reports have noted that zzso zzso channels zzso are expressed in vascular smooth muscle and are potential targets of zzso In this study, we examined whether and by what mechanism zzso oxide zzso a key zzso influences this zzso Using zzso zzso and rat cerebral zzso smooth muscle cells, we monitored an inward zzso current that was zzso into a zzso and zzso zzso The latter was abolished by zzso channel blocker and displayed classic zzso properties including faster zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso NO donors zzso zzso zzso along with zzso of protein zzso G zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso did, however, mask zzso zzso channel current zzso by zzso zzso experiments confirmed an zzso effect for NO on the zzso contribution to cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings support the view that zzso zzso channels are a regulatory target of zzso signaling zzso This targeting will influence zzso dynamics and zzso tone development in the cerebral zzso
