Classical research has suggested that early zzso formation develops via zzso zzso and in this study we reveal which signals control this zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sonic zzso zzso zzso mice, which all exhibit zzso zzso we show that zzso is a downstream target of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso regulates the zzso expression of zzso which in turn signals back to the zzso This was confirmed by demonstrating that cell proliferation is decreased not only in the zzso zzso but also in the zzso of zzso zzso These results reveal a new role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso We show that coordinated zzso interactions are essential during the initial stages of zzso development and require an zzso signaling zzso
