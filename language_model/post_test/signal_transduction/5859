Recent studies have shown that major vault protein zzso is involved in zzso zzso cell survival, differentiation and innate immunity and that it is not directly responsible for zzso drug transport in zzso cancer cell zzso Recently, we reported that zzso increases with age both in zzso and in zzso and that age-related zzso of zzso zzso zzso resistance of zzso human zzso zzso zzso based on the interaction with zzso zzso of zzso 

To discuss the role of zzso in cell survival and signaling in the development of resistance to zzso exhibited by zzso zzso 

zzso represents a versatile platform for regulation of cellular signaling and survival and is a potential therapeutic target for zzso of resistance to zzso implicated in aging zzso and cancer zzso
