zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso have zzso effects independent of their capacity to lower zzso zzso plays an important role as an zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we used zzso zzso cells which express zzso to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso induction by zzso zzso or zzso induced a significant increase in zzso protein expression and zzso zzso Both statins zzso activity of a mouse zzso promoter zzso to zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was more pronounced in the short zzso promoter than the full promoter of zzso zzso zzso experiments for zzso and upstream zzso factor zzso zzso activities using zzso or zzso cells showed significant nuclear zzso complexes which were zzso with zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso Point zzso of the zzso zzso promoter zzso to zzso for the zzso which binds zzso or the zzso binding sequences showed a reduction in zzso reporter activity whereas no role of the zzso zzso binding elements located at zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor or the zzso for both factors supported a role of these zzso factors in zzso induction of zzso with a clearer effect for zzso
