Early events in the response of cells to zzso zzso include zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the human zzso zzso 2 zzso mediates zzso of zzso in response to commercial preparations of zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso bacterial zzso Here, we show that expression of zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells enabled zzso zzso in response to zzso a synthetic bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by an in zzso zzso zzso using zzso as zzso and by an zzso measuring zzso of the downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso Thus, zzso initiated the signaling zzso for zzso in response to bacterial zzso
