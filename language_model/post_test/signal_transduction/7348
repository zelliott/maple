zzso zzso are zzso regulatory proteins zzso by zzso and zzso zzso This protein class has been characterized zzso but its biological activities remain relatively zzso Two zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated regulatory proteins zzso and zzso are configured as zzso zzso zzso which initiate a signal zzso system that controls expression of genes for the low light harvesting 4 zzso antenna zzso In zzso zzso and zzso respond to light quality by zzso zzso a property that requires the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso are both required for the expression of the zzso antenna complex under zzso conditions, but zzso requires oxygen for its synthesis by zzso zzso On further investigation, we found that the zzso forms of zzso and zzso are necessary and sufficient to control zzso expression in response to light intensity in conjunction with other signal zzso zzso One possibility is that the system senses a reduced zzso pool generated when light energy is absorbed by zzso The zzso forms of the zzso have the additional property of being able to fine-tune zzso expression in response to light zzso These observations support the concept that some zzso can function with or without a zzso and may be involved in regulating zzso processes not directly related to light zzso
