The human tissue zzso gene family, located at zzso zzso is the largest zzso family of zzso in the human zzso The locus encodes all 15 members of the family, 13 of which have been reported as potential zzso for several zzso and other zzso zzso zzso are expressed by a wide range of zzso and implicated in a number of zzso functions, including skin zzso zzso zzso neural plasticity and the regulation of blood zzso zzso function is regulated at various levels, including transcription, translation and zzso The zzso activity of zzso is believed to be cascade zzso and may zzso with other zzso These zzso are highly regulated through a series of feedback zzso zzso zzso degradation and internal zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso is implicated in a large number of zzso and zzso pathological zzso 

As our understanding of their regulatory and functional mechanisms continues to expand, zzso are expected to become novel targets for the design of new zzso
