zzso form symbiotic zzso on host zzso and fix nitrogen for their hosts in exchange for zzso In order to establish this mutually beneficial relationship, zzso must compete with other soil bacteria in the host zzso zzso to colonize plant roots zzso A zzso zzso screen in zzso zzso a zzso that forms zzso on licorice zzso zzso plants revealed that the expression of zzso which encodes a putative exporter protein belonging to the zzso family of zzso is activated by both zzso zzso and zzso a zzso family zzso zzso Chemical analysis suggests that the zzso signal in zzso is zzso an zzso present in the seeds and zzso of a variety of zzso zzso We show that zzso serves as a zzso exporter that is indispensable for zzso resistance in zzso zzso We also show that the expression of zzso zzso in other zzso species is induced by zzso and is critical for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso resistance is important for root hair adherence as well as for survival in a zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that host zzso may exude specific zzso into their surroundings to zzso the bacterial population in order to have successful symbiotic events with zzso
