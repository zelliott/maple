The adapter protein zzso zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso zzso is an essential zzso of signaling from the zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso also mediates signaling downstream of zzso in T cells and that zzso T cells fail to support zzso to zzso zzso In response to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to surface zzso that zzso with zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso recruitment to the protein named zzso zzso for zzso of T zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso but not downstream of zzso zzso an zzso zzso unable to bind zzso zzso and zzso adapter zzso forms clusters following zzso but not zzso engagement and fails to support zzso zzso to zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso to zzso signaling complexes by a mechanism different from that employed during zzso signaling and that zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso function in T zzso
