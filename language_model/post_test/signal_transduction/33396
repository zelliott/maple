zzso nothing is known about the function of the zzso protein zzso Since zzso shares significant sequence identity with the core zzso zzso of Ras and zzso it may share functional similarities with these two structurally zzso yet functionally zzso small zzso Furthermore, since like zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso that is likely to signal for zzso it may be a target for the zzso zzso that block Ras processing and zzso To compare zzso function with those of Ras and zzso we introduced zzso into zzso that generate zzso active or dominant negative forms of Ras and zzso proteins and were designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso of wild type or zzso zzso did not alter the zzso or growth properties of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso function is distinct from that of Ras and fails to cause cellular zzso Instead, similar to zzso zzso of zzso antagonized zzso Ras transformation and zzso In zzso and in zzso analyses showed that like zzso zzso proteins are zzso and are sensitive to zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso function may be inhibited by zzso zzso treatment and, consequently, may contribute to the ability of these zzso to impair Ras zzso
