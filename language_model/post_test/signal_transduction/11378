The authors have recently shown that zzso of an external response feedback leads to excessive zzso that is not associated with attempts to collect zzso and they have suggested that this may be an analogue to zzso excessive behavior characteristic of obsessive-compulsive zzso The present study shows that repeated administration of zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso or haloperidol, enhances this behavioral zzso On the basis of data regarding the enduring effects of chronic treatment with zzso agents, these results suggest that zzso of zzso D1 receptors zzso enhanced response to signal zzso These results may link the hypothesis that obsessions and zzso result from a deficient response feedback mechanism with findings implicating zzso abnormalities in the production of obsessions and zzso
