We have investigated the ability of collagen to induce zzso and functional responses in suspensions of zzso zzso deficient in the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain, which lack the collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso In the absence of the zzso chain, collagen induced a unique pattern of zzso zzso which was zzso by the zzso analogue zzso zzso studies indicated that neither collagen alone nor the combination of collagen plus zzso induced zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 76 zzso A low level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed, which was increased in the presence of zzso although the degree of zzso remained well below that observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso of the adapter zzso zzso and zzso adapter zzso was substantially zzso by zzso to levels equivalent to those observed in zzso zzso zzso plus zzso also induced significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso signals was highlighted by the ability of zzso and collagen to induce the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso even though neither zzso was effective zzso zzso zzso zzso and the release of zzso were abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by blockade of zzso These results illustrate a novel mechanism of zzso zzso by collagen which is independent of the zzso chain complex, and is facilitated by binding of collagen to zzso zzso
