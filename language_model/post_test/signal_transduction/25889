Light exposure is a potentially powerful stress factor during in zzso optical zzso zzso In zzso the general zzso factor zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in response to zzso However, previous zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso have zzso a variety of discrete exposure settings, which makes it difficult to correlate stress levels and zzso zzso We here investigate how continuous zzso with blue light, corresponding to zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso pattern of zzso in budding zzso The zzso pattern was analyzed using a novel approach that combines zzso decomposition and change point zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso for individual cells exhibit up to three distinct and successive zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso Many cells pass through all states zzso at high light zzso while at lower light zzso most cells only reach states zzso or zzso This zzso strongly indicates that continuous light exposure gradually increases the stress level over time, presumably through continuous zzso of toxic zzso thereby forcing the cell through a zzso region corresponding to zzso zzso We also show that the zzso patterns are dependent on protein zzso A zzso activity, zzso zzso cells with constantly low zzso activity showed a stronger stress zzso In particular, the zzso zzso frequency was found to be significantly higher for cells with low zzso activity for all light zzso
