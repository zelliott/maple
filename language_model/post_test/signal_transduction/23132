Human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a novel cancer therapeutic zzso However, very little is known about its expression and regulation in human zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of zzso in zzso zzso and to identify mechanisms that regulate its zzso 

The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in a related zzso with zzso were determined using tissue panels containing zzso from patients with various types of cancer zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso or zzso and human cell zzso zzso levels of zzso were also determined in 2 colon cancer patients via western zzso zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways and the resulting effects on zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso for colon and lung cancer cell zzso Finally, the effects of a zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of breast, zzso and prostate cell lines were determined using the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso levels were elevated in cancer cell lines compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly increased in breast, zzso and lung cancer samples while zzso zzso levels were increased in just colon zzso The expression of zzso and zzso varied with stage in these zzso Further, zzso protein expression was elevated in colon cancer tissue zzso zzso of the zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso and zzso in both colon and lung cancer cell zzso Further, zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in greater reduction of breast, zzso and prostate cancer cell proliferation than zzso cell zzso 

This is the first report showing that zzso is zzso in breast, zzso and lung zzso and the first evidence that the zzso zzso plays a role in regulating the expression of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso in several zzso and the zzso of cancer cell growth by a zzso inhibitor suggest this zzso may act as an zzso to promote cancer cell zzso
