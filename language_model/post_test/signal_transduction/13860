The zzso is a transient and essential structure that provides both mechanical and signaling cues to the developing zzso zzso In zzso the zzso is composed of a core of large zzso cells and an outer layer of cells that zzso the zzso zzso In this work, we have identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel essential component of the zzso zzso zzso The development of the zzso sheath is impaired in zzso zzso zzso The patterning activity of the zzso is also affected by zzso as revealed by the increase of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso and the decreased zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso the availability of zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso factor zzso in the zzso zzso Overall, this study reveals a new role for an zzso protein and reinforces the concept that structure and function of the zzso are strictly zzso
