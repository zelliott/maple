As the growth of the aging population continues to accelerate globally, increased prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease zzso Parkinson's disease zzso and stroke, has generated substantial public zzso Unfortunately, despite of discoveries of common factors underlying these diseases, few drugs are available to effectively treat these zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is a zzso zzso factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso has been shown to influence the expression or activity of a large number of genes in a variety of signaling networks, including regulation of insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso immune responses, zzso balance, cardiovascular integrity, and cell zzso Recent zzso zzso animal, and clinical studies also show that zzso zzso can lower the zzso of a number of neurological disorders, despite of multiple zzso factors involved in the development of these zzso In this zzso we review current knowledge on mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of zzso in different neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, zzso zzso and stroke, and attempt to analyze common and overlapping features among these zzso Our investigation unveiled information suggesting the ability for zzso to inhibit zzso inflammatory signaling at multiple sites, and conclude that zzso zzso represent a novel class of drugs for treating zzso zzso
