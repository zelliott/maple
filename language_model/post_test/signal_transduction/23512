zzso zzso are the major component of zzso zzso in tumors and exhibit distinct zzso according to the zzso We have recently found that signal regulatory protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells, plays a critical role in controlling innate immune zzso Here, we identify that zzso is zzso on zzso isolated from zzso areas of zzso zzso zzso samples, while its level is moderately recovered in zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso expression is significantly reduced on zzso when zzso with zzso zzso This reduction is partly due to the soluble factors in the tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso and zzso pathways as zzso encounter tumor cells, leading to an increased capacity of zzso for migration, survival, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso are also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer with zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells growth in zzso by zzso the inflammatory zzso and promoting zzso zzso accomplishes this partly through its zzso of the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso functions as an important zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and the reduction of zzso is a novel strategy used by tumor cells to benefit their zzso zzso zzso could be zzso as a potential target for zzso zzso
