It has been widely reported that biological networks are robust against zzso such as zzso On the contrary, it has also been known that biological networks are often fragile against unexpected zzso There is a growing interest in these intriguing observations and the underlying design principle that causes such robust but fragile characteristics of biological zzso For relatively small networks, a feedback loop has been considered as an important motif for realizing the zzso It is still, however, not clear how a number of coupled feedback zzso actually affect the zzso of large complex biological zzso In particular, the relationship between fragility and feedback zzso has not yet been investigated till zzso 

Through extensive zzso experiments, we found that networks with a larger number of positive feedback zzso and a smaller number of negative feedback zzso are likely to be more robust against zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso of a robust network subject to zzso are mostly involved with a smaller number of feedback zzso compared with the other zzso not usually subject to zzso This zzso characteristic eventually makes the robust network fragile against unexpected zzso at the zzso not previously exposed to zzso
