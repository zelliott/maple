zzso oxygen species zzso such as zzso are emerging as important signaling molecules in zzso plasticity but also in peripheral and spinal zzso pain zzso zzso mechanisms and zzso zzso signaling in the brain remain to be zzso zzso in the zzso plays a key role in zzso pain responses and depends on group I zzso zzso receptors zzso and protein zzso Using zzso zzso imaging, and behavioral zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso links group I zzso to protein zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso and pain zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso division of the central nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso effects were inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by an zzso zzso zzso or NO zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited the effects of zzso but not those of a zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso imaging in zzso brain slices directly showed zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso and spinal zzso through a mechanism that required zzso zzso and zzso Combined application of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was necessary to block completely the zzso effects of a zzso donor zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso had no zzso zzso and zzso alone did not affect zzso zzso The results suggest an important role for the novel zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso pain zzso
