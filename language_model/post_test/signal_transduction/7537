zzso B, a member of the zzso family, can act as a zzso signaling inhibitor to regulate the growth of zzso zzso zzso signaling has been shown to inhibit zzso differentiation through zzso and zzso Based on these studies, we hypothesized that zzso B would prevent zzso zzso zzso differentiation through zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were treated with a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso B treatment zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso markers including zzso and its target genes in a zzso zzso zzso B treatment zzso zzso signaling as zzso by reduced zzso of zzso and suppression of zzso target gene expression in zzso The zzso effects of zzso B are significantly blunted in cells with zzso silenced by introducing small interfering zzso Finally, our data show that zzso I, another zzso family member, also zzso zzso differentiation by suppressing zzso zzso Together, our data suggest the possibility of utilizing zzso as a new strategy to treat zzso diseases and zzso zzso as a new target for the development of functional foods and zzso
