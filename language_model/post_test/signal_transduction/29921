zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso proteins that recognize microbial molecules and initiate host zzso To investigate how zzso work together to fight infections, we tested the role of zzso in host defense against the zzso bacterial zzso zzso We show that zzso is critical for early zzso production and killing of bacteria by zzso zzso Interestingly, later on, zzso but not zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso differentiation factor 88, an zzso protein directly downstream of zzso is required for both early and late zzso zzso zzso and zzso differentiation factor 88 are involved in zzso host defense against zzso in zzso which zzso with the defects in host defense observed in zzso We propose a model where the sequential zzso of zzso tailors the immune response to different zzso
