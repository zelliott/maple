To clarify the involvement of signaling of transforming growth factor zzso during the zzso the zzso distribution of related molecules was analyzed in relation with liver cell zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso form zzso during liver tumor promotion by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso using zzso Our study focused on zzso promotion zzso after starting zzso and late-stage promotion zzso after starting zzso With regard to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso - identified as zzso by later zzso analysis - increased in the zzso of zzso zzso while zzso a nuclear zzso of zzso decreased during zzso zzso By late-stage promotion, zzso zzso lacking zzso had increased in accordance with zzso development from zzso to zzso while zzso largely disappeared in most zzso zzso With regard to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso increased during zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso without relation to zzso By late-stage promotion, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with zzso development, as with zzso of zzso in all zzso These results suggest that from the early zzso zzso processes were facilitated by disruption of tumor zzso functions of zzso zzso while zzso zzso of zzso was an zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by promotion with zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not change zzso zzso suggesting an aberration in the zzso signaling zzso for induction of zzso zzso zzso
