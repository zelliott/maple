zzso tract zzso requires the zzso of the zzso bud zzso into the zzso collecting system and zzso two zzso with unique structural and functional zzso In this report we investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate their zzso Fate mapping experiments in the developing chick indicate that the zzso is surrounded by two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the intermediate zzso and zzso zzso which is selectively associated with the domain of the zzso that zzso into the zzso zzso experiments utilizing zzso zzso kidney zzso show that zzso a zzso factor zzso by zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is sufficient to induce zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso normally zzso to differentiate into the zzso collecting zzso zzso these results indicate that the border between the kidney and zzso forms where zzso zzso originating in two different areas of the early zzso zzso These data raise the possibility that the zzso of this junction to zzso defects in humans, such as zzso zzso may be related to the complex zzso movements that are required to integrate cells from these different lineages into a single functional zzso
