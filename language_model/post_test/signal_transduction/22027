A growing number of laboratory and clinical studies over the past 10 years have shown that low-level laser stimulation zzso or 670 zzso at extremely low power zzso (about zzso zzso when administered through a particular zzso mode, is capable of zzso significant biological zzso Studies on cell cultures and animal models as well as clinical trials give support to a novel therapeutic zzso which may be referred to as ultra low level laser therapy zzso In cultured neural cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown to stimulate zzso zzso zzso and to protect cells against zzso zzso In rats, zzso and zzso effects following zzso zzso were zzso Clinical studies have reported beneficial effects (also revealed through zzso in the treatment of musculoskeletal zzso The present paper reviews the existing experimental evidence available on zzso Furthermore, the puzzling issue of the zzso mechanisms that lie at the basis of the method is explored and some hypotheses are zzso Besides presenting the state-of-the-art about this novel zzso therapy, the present paper aims to open up an interdisciplinary discussion and stimulate new research on this zzso
