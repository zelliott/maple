zzso to environmental stimuli are zzso by the zzso and zzso of various zzso zzso However, the zzso dynamics of these events in living animals are not well zzso Here we show real-time imaging of the activity of the key regulator of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso in living zzso zzso and that Ras is zzso activated within a few seconds in zzso zzso in response to increase in the concentration of zzso This fast zzso of Ras is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and Ras zzso zzso protein zzso A negative feedback loop then quickly leads to Ras zzso despite the continued presence of the zzso zzso of Ras zzso suggest this rapid zzso and zzso of Ras is important for regulation of zzso activities and zzso zzso Our results reveal novel zzso and biological implication of transient zzso of Ras in zzso zzso
