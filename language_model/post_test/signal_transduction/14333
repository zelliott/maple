zzso the active components of zzso zzso zzso zzso have attracted the attention of human civilizations for centuries, much earlier than the discovery and characterization of their zzso of action, the zzso system zzso The latter is an ensemble of zzso zzso their receptors zzso particular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates cell zzso differentiation and survival, with different outcomes depending on the molecular targets and cellular context zzso zzso receptors are expressed and functional from the very early zzso zzso when they regulate embryonic and zzso stem cell survival and zzso and thus may affect the formation of zzso adult specialized zzso derived from the three different germ layers zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso nervous system, both zzso and zzso receptors are present in neural zzso cells and control their zzso proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso show opposite patterns of zzso the former increasing and the latter decreasing along zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso signaling has also been shown to regulate proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso stem cells, with a key role in determining the formation of several cell types in peripheral zzso including blood cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we will review these new findings, which unveil the involvement of zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso cell fate in the nervous system and in the zzso The zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso together with their role in zzso cell biology, may have important implications in human health and zzso
