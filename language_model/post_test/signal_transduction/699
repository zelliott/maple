zzso zzso locomotion consists of forward zzso interrupted by episodes of zzso turning and exploratory behavior zzso zzso This behavior can be regulated by visual input as seen by zzso increase in zzso head swinging and direction change as well as reduction of linear speed that characterizes the zzso zzso zzso During 3rd zzso stage, zzso larvae gradually cease to be zzso by light and are zzso by the time they wander in search for a place to undergo zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso can be used to study control of zzso 

We used targeted zzso zzso to assess the role of candidate zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the response to light throughout zzso development, including during the later stages of the 3rd zzso characterized by zzso zzso Increased response to light is characterized by increase in zzso direction change and associated pause, and reduction of linear zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of the activity of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso increases the zzso response observed during 3rd zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not disrupt zzso locomotion or the response to mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling within zzso zzso zzso the results obtained with targeted zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in the zzso nerve zzso zzso does not affect the zzso response to zzso Similarly, disruption of zzso projections that contact the zzso zzso in the brain zzso does not impact the zzso response to zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not of any other zzso zzso zzso causes a significant decrease in the response to light of 3rd zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that activity of zzso and zzso zzso contribute to the control of zzso locomotion by zzso We conclude that this control is carried out by zzso zzso located in the brain zzso but does not appear to occur at the zzso level and may be zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into the function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso behavior as well as into the mechanisms underlying regulation of zzso response to zzso
