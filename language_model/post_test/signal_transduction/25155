zzso zzso zzso zzso is selectively expressed in zzso zzso cells and plays a crucial role in zzso motor zzso Although zzso belongs to an zzso zzso family, little is known about its pharmacological features and downstream signaling zzso To study molecular mechanisms underlying zzso motor learning, we employed zzso zzso screening to isolate zzso molecules and identified zzso zzso zzso zzso is a family member of band zzso zzso zzso zzso and is expressed prominently in zzso Here, we showed by in zzso zzso analysis that the zzso zzso was enriched in mouse zzso and zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso with zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso in cultured cells and in zzso zzso bound to the putative zzso zzso target sequence of zzso and zzso via its zzso zzso zzso of the effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso unexpectedly revealed that zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in its zzso zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso associates directly with zzso and zzso Moreover, our data suggest that zzso plays a role in signaling downstream of the zzso and/or in regulation of their activities through zzso zzso
