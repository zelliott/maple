The zzso zzso zzso has been identified zzso in the zzso However, the expression and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells are still poorly zzso The present study was designed to examine the expression and regulation of the zzso in human zzso cells zzso by zzso and Northern zzso zzso A zzso product corresponding to the expected zzso zzso complementary DNA was obtained from zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of the zzso product revealed an identical sequence to the reported zzso complementary zzso Two zzso transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified in zzso using Northern zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso was zzso by human zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso also attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling following the zzso of the zzso in single zzso was studied using zzso It revealed that, like zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso calcium zzso in a zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and that zzso zzso is regulated by human zzso zzso and zzso The zzso expressed in zzso functional because zzso of the zzso by zzso or zzso resulted in rapid and transient zzso of zzso calcium at the single cell zzso These findings further support a potential role of this neurotransmitter zzso in the human zzso
