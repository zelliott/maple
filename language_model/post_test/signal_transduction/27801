The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acute phase protein expression in zzso human zzso cells and promotes the growth of mouse zzso zzso The signaling zzso leading to these biological functions are only partially zzso We zzso the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso pathways and found that zzso triggered zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso activity was required for biological functions including acute phase protein zzso from zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Using a reporter gene construct containing a 190 zzso promoter zzso of the acute phase protein zzso we found that zzso is involved in zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso but not by zzso Thus, we present evidence for a role of zzso in zzso induced functions and a possible zzso between this zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
