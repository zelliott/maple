Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths in the western zzso Progress in treatment results has been zzso and the prognosis is poor with a zzso survival less than zzso Based on new developments in molecular biology, our knowledge about lung zzso and mechanisms for invasion and zzso has expanded and may in the future lead to more specific targeted therapies and better zzso The zzso complex is critical for zzso zzso and maintenance of normal and zzso tissue zzso zzso expression of this complex in zzso disease is associated with zzso invasion, zzso and zzso zzso 

This review is based on search in the zzso database from 1991 to zzso We have reviewed the relevance of the zzso zzso complex in zzso in general and lung cancer in zzso Furthermore, its role as target for specific therapy is zzso 

Available data indicate that zzso of proteins involved in the zzso complex are early incidents in cancer zzso zzso or altered expression of one or more of the components in this complex is associated with extended invasive and progressive behavior of cancer zzso zzso the zzso complex appears to be increasingly delicate with regard to cancer zzso zzso one of the components of the zzso complex, also plays a significant role in cell signal zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and increased cellular proliferation and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso complex, induced by genetic and zzso events, plays a significant role in zzso zzso and seems to be associated with zzso local invasion, regional zzso and reduced survival in lung zzso
