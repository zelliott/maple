zzso proteins induce zzso zzso through interaction with zzso zzso zzso regulating migration of zzso and zzso cells, including zzso tumor cells, and zzso The role of zzso in vascular zzso however, remains controversial, with reports of both zzso and zzso zzso We report here that cooperation between zzso and zzso regulates a balance between the zzso and zzso functions of zzso While zzso promotes zzso in culture and in zzso as a single agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso stimulates zzso through zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the activities of which are inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso partially zzso vascular assembly and zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso in the context of zzso providing a plausible mechanism for the zzso versus zzso functions of zzso Our results suggest that the complex roles of zzso signaling in zzso involve zzso zzso
