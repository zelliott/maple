The zzso signaling zzso is involved in the regulation of the proliferation of precursors in different zzso of the normal zzso zzso These cells express zzso and may be the target of zzso zzso Many tumor types derived from zzso that contain zzso precursors appear to consistently express zzso indicating their origin and/or the presence of an active zzso zzso zzso zzso in a variety of precursor cells in model organisms leads to tumor formation while zzso of the zzso in human tumor cells leads to a decrease in their zzso In the brain we have documented the expression of zzso in zzso zones, and a variety of brain tumors express zzso including zzso of the zzso and a number of zzso of the cerebral zzso The requirement for zzso signaling in the growth of the mouse brain, together with the ability of inappropriate zzso zzso in the zzso to cause zzso and the zzso of the growth of a number of brain tumors with zzso a zzso signaling zzso underscores the critical role of the zzso zzso in brain growth and tumor zzso Moreover, they highlight the components of this zzso as prime targets for drug development, with special emphasis on the zzso zzso Such zzso would allow a rational therapeutic approach to highly intractable zzso
