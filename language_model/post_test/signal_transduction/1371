zzso development begins with the formation of a primary vascular zzso that is rapidly remodeled by zzso into the interconnected zzso patterns characteristic of mature zzso Several zzso zzso zzso and their zzso have been implicated to control early development of the vascular zzso These include the vascular zzso growth factor receptors zzso and zzso that bind zzso the zzso and zzso receptors that bind the zzso and the zzso zzso that binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso have revealed essential functions for these molecules in vascular zzso In particular, zzso zzso that delete either zzso or zzso from the mouse have been shown to result in early embryonic zzso due to failed zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso expression of zzso has lead to the speculation that the interaction of these two molecules leads to zzso signaling into both the zzso cell and the zzso cell, and that both forward and reverse signals are required for proper development of blood vessels in the zzso Indeed, targeted removal of the zzso zzso zzso tail by another group was shown to zzso vascular development and result in the same early embryonic zzso as the zzso zzso leading the authors to propose that zzso reverse signaling directs early zzso zzso of the primary vascular zzso zzso 104 (2001) zzso However, we show here that the zzso zzso domain of zzso and hence reverse zzso is not required during early vascular development, but it is necessary for zzso survival and functions later in cardiovascular development in the maturation of cardiac valve zzso We further show that zzso reverse signaling is required for the zzso of zzso that form the zzso tract of the anterior zzso Our results thus indicate that zzso functions in the early zzso as a typical zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso forward signaling during zzso zzso and that later in embryonic development zzso functions as a zzso to zzso reverse signals involved in cardiac valve maturation and zzso zzso
