zzso profiling has been widely used as a tool for unveiling the zzso of genes in response to genetic and environmental zzso These zzso have been used, in a few instances, to zzso global zzso regulatory zzso Here, using the large amount of zzso information available for the zzso zzso coli, we seek to understand the design principles determining the regulation of its zzso Combining zzso and signaling data, we develop an evolutionary zzso procedure that allows obtaining alternative zzso zzso regulatory network zzso that still maintains its zzso to dynamic zzso We apply our methodology to an zzso coli zzso and show that it could be zzso to simpler zzso regulatory zzso These zzso zzso still maintain the global zzso response to fluctuating zzso zzso zzso contain zzso fewer regulated zzso Genes with similar functions and coordinated patterns of expression across environments are clustered into longer regulated zzso These synthetic zzso are more sensitive and show a more robust response to challenging zzso This result illustrates that the natural zzso of zzso coli zzso does not necessarily result from selection for zzso to environmental zzso but that evolutionary zzso may have been important as zzso We also discuss the limitations of our methodology in the context of the demand zzso Our procedure will be useful as a novel way to analyze global zzso regulation networks and in synthetic biology for the de zzso design of zzso
