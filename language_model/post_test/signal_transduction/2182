The mechanism of zzso resistance was examined in three long-term cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso exhibiting significant variation in responsiveness to the zzso and zzso effects of type I zzso The zzso components involved in zzso signal zzso were analyzed in zzso After exposure to zzso zzso of the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected at similar levels in both zzso and zzso cell types, indicating that zzso resistance did not result from a zzso in signaling at the level of zzso zzso zzso However, analysis of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that their expression and zzso correlated with cellular zzso zzso The analysis was extended to also include zzso primary zzso three additional zzso melanoma cell lines, and seven cell cultures recently established from melanoma patient zzso It was consistently observed that the most marked difference in zzso was a lack of zzso in the resistant versus the sensitive zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell line to express increased levels of zzso protein partially restored zzso responsiveness in an zzso zzso We conclude that a zzso in the level of zzso and possibly all three zzso components in zzso human melanoma cells may be a general phenomenon responsible for reduced cellular responsiveness of zzso to zzso
