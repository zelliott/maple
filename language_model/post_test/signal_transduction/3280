Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into all human cell types and therefore hold a great therapeutic zzso zzso into the embryonic zzso and its derivatives is of special interest since it can provide a cure for severe widespread clinical conditions such as diabetes and zzso zzso In this work we established a unique experimental outline that enables the study of early human zzso development and can help improve and create new differentiation zzso To this end we started with zzso cells and separated them into early zzso and zzso zzso cells using zzso and zzso cell surface zzso We zzso characterized the different zzso and demonstrated the importance of the zzso zzso in definitive zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells were then zzso creating an zzso differentiation niche that is not affected by other cell zzso We followed the differentiation of these cells at different time points, and demonstrated an up regulation of genes indicative to differentiation into both zzso and zzso Surprisingly, upon continued culture, there was significant down regulation of the zzso gene zzso This down regulation could be rescued with zzso treatment demonstrating its importance in zzso cell zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso zzso zzso cells is crucial for the analysis of their fate, and enables the identification of factors involved in their differentiation and zzso
