zzso zzso alpha zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso have been detected in various human zzso cell zzso zzso which are zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells distribute to many zzso in the zzso however, the zzso is the only organ mainly composed of zzso zzso zzso cells, called zzso SCC is the second most common type of skin zzso zzso zzso expression promotes tumor zzso and its loss greatly enhances tumor progression from benign zzso to zzso zzso during chemical skin zzso in zzso Thus, zzso has emerged as a tumor zzso for zzso Furthermore, zzso deletion of zzso in the zzso of adult mice causes spontaneous skin zzso and zzso indicating that zzso deletion functions as a tumor zzso as well as a tumor zzso This article discusses zzso biological activities and associated molecular events in skin tumor development, which may provide insight into the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human zzso cell zzso zzso in the zzso
