In zzso a colonial marine zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a major role in the zzso of the primary body axis in zzso and in the establishment of the oral pole during zzso Here we report supplementing investigations on head zzso and bud formation in zzso zzso Head and bud formation were accompanied by the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling by blocking zzso affected zzso the patterning of growing zzso and the asexual formation of new zzso in the zzso In the presence of zzso zzso or zzso gastric segments excised from adult zzso showed reversal of tissue polarity as they frequently zzso heads at both zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso of protein zzso C increased this zzso Global zzso of the zzso zzso caused growing zzso to form zzso tentacles and additional heads along their body zzso zzso treatment of colonies evoked the emergence of many and dramatically zzso bud fields along the circumference of the zzso These giant fields fell apart into smaller zzso which gave rise to zzso of zzso zzso We interpret the zzso effects of blocking zzso as reflecting increase in zzso value in terms of zzso information and zzso of zzso target genes in molecular zzso
