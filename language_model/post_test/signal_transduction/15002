In zzso sensing zzso process, bacteria regulate gene expression by utilizing small signaling molecules called zzso in response to a variety of environmental zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso signaling zzso proposed to be involved in zzso communication, is produced by many species of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso coli and zzso zzso the zzso zzso is imported into the cell by a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso there is a zzso transcribed gene zzso zzso which was reported previously to repress the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso Here, we have demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and itself by directly binding to their promoters using gel shift and zzso I zzso zzso The zzso reporter zzso further suggest that two motifs in both the zzso and zzso promoter regions are crucial for the zzso zzso Furthermore, in agreement with the conclusion that zzso zzso can relieve the repression of zzso in previous studies, our data show that zzso renders zzso unable to bind to its own promoter in zzso
