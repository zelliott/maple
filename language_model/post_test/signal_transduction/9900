Stem cells will undergo zzso to produce new stem cells if they are maintained in their zzso The regulatory mechanisms that recruit and maintain stem cells in their niches are not well zzso In zzso zzso a group of 12 zzso zzso cells, called the zzso identifies the stem cell niche by producing the growth factor zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling controls stem cell zzso to the niche through regulating zzso cell zzso Loss of function of a zzso zzso zzso results in loss of both zzso and zzso stem zzso The zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso junctions at the zzso cell zzso which results in the stem cells zzso zzso from the niche and losing stem cell zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso may represent one mechanism that regulates polarized niche formation and stem cell zzso
