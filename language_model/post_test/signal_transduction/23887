zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso and has recently been shown to induce zzso through engagement of the death receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B regulates the expression of genes involved in cancer cell invasion, zzso and resistance to zzso In normal zzso cells, zzso B is maintained in the zzso with its inhibitor protein I zzso B, whereas in cancer cells, zzso B is in the nucleus and zzso activates target zzso To understand the function of zzso B in zzso zzso we have analyzed the specific roles of zzso B zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso protein I zzso B alpha results in zzso of zzso active zzso B, induction of zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso death domain expression and enhancement of TRAIL zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mouse embryonic zzso increases zzso zzso whereas depletion of zzso blocks this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression and enhances expression of zzso and zzso after TRAIL zzso By comparison, zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso after TRAIL zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso acts as a survival factor by zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The dual function of zzso B, as an inhibitor or zzso of zzso depends on the relative levels of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso B activity may play an important role in tumor zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso represents a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
