Our aims were to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and to explore potential target genes zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso in zzso ex zzso and in zzso zzso increased zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso also zzso zzso growth zzso zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso expression of active zzso zzso domain increased zzso protein levels and zzso zzso tube formation, whereas blocking zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso promoter revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso site, and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the binding of zzso complex to this site in response to zzso 

Our data provide the first example of zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso and of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso axis of zzso factors like zzso might be a valuable target for pathological zzso
