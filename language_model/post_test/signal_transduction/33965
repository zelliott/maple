The heart is extensively zzso and its performance is tightly regulated by the zzso nervous zzso To maintain cardiac function, zzso density is zzso controlled, being high in the zzso and the central zzso zzso In diseased hearts, cardiac zzso density varies, which in turn leads to sudden cardiac zzso After zzso zzso sympathetic zzso is followed by zzso within the heart, leading to unbalanced neural zzso and lethal zzso zzso sensory zzso causes silent zzso zzso characterized by loss of pain perception during zzso zzso which is a major cause of sudden cardiac death in diabetes zzso zzso Despite its clinical importance, the molecular mechanism underlying zzso density remains poorly zzso We found that cardiac sympathetic zzso is determined by the balance between neural zzso and zzso both of which occur in the zzso Nerve growth factor zzso which is a potent zzso is zzso abundantly by zzso and is induced by zzso zzso in the zzso In contrast, zzso which is a neural zzso is expressed strongly in the zzso layer in early stage zzso and at a lower level after birth, leading to zzso zzso sympathetic zzso zzso We also found that cardiac zzso zzso is a cause of diabetic zzso and that zzso supplementation zzso silent zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso mice showed sudden death or lethal zzso due to disruption of zzso zzso The present review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms involved in neural development in the heart and their critical roles in cardiac zzso
