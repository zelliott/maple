There are two interrelated zzso zzso zzso systems in zzso zzso These systems, the zzso system and the zzso system, are global regulators of gene zzso We performed a zzso analysis to identify zzso genes and to better understand zzso control of zzso zzso gene zzso We compared gene expression in a zzso signal zzso grown with added signals to gene expression without added signals, and we compared a zzso signal zzso zzso to its zzso In all, we identified 315 zzso and 38 zzso zzso representing about zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes were activated in the stationary phase in zzso zzso but were not activated in the parent zzso The analysis of zzso genes suggests that the signal zzso are on a zzso and that the timing of gene expression is on a zzso zzso genes are induced early in growth, most genes are induced at the transition from the zzso phase to the stationary phase, and some genes are induced during the stationary zzso In general, timing was not related to signal zzso We suggest that the level of the signal zzso zzso is a critical trigger for zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso sensing appears to be a system that allows ordered expression of hundreds of genes during zzso zzso growth in zzso
