Regulators of zzso zzso zzso regulate the functional lifetime of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by serving as zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso can functionally replace the zzso zzso containing zzso gene and inhibit zzso zzso Using zzso strains zzso a zzso zzso reporter zzso we demonstrate that zzso expressed zzso zzso also serves to decrease zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Although this effect was dependent on the expression of a zzso functional zzso zzso the zzso itself was nevertheless not zzso Using the zzso zzso promoter to express zzso we further demonstrate that in addition to serving as a GAP for zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso This effect is specific to zzso since growth is not altered in cells expressing either zzso zzso or zzso We further demonstrate that neither of the two zzso zzso proteins is responsible for zzso this growth zzso effect of zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso can function in both zzso and zzso manners in zzso
