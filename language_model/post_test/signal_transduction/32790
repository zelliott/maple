The zzso of compatible zzso such as zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous mechanism in cellular zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso cells control zzso zzso in part via a zzso zzso export of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of channel proteins most closely related to the bacterial zzso zzso The protein is localized in the plasma zzso The zzso role of zzso appears to be zzso export rather than zzso zzso delta zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso export is required for recovery from a sudden drop in external zzso In zzso cells, the zzso transport rate is decreased by zzso shock and increased by zzso shock on a zzso time zzso This regulation seems to be independent of the known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the unique zzso zzso domain of zzso or certain parts zzso fail to reduce the zzso transport rate after a zzso zzso zzso cells carrying these zzso zzso release zzso and show a dominant zzso but compensate for zzso loss after prolonged incubation by zzso zzso zzso may be an example of a more widespread class of regulators of zzso which control the cellular content and release of compatible zzso
