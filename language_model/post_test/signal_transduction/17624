Recently, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been shown to physically associate with the zzso zzso zzso complex and to undergo rapid zzso in its zzso zzso activity upon stimulation of T zzso with zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso responses, however, has never been directly zzso Using gene transfer approaches, we have achieved markedly elevated levels of zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso line zzso and the helper line zzso zzso and zzso cells that were zzso zzso with expression plasmids zzso either the normal human zzso or a zzso active version of the mouse zzso zzso zzso contained striking zzso in the levels of zzso zzso on several proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells remained dependent on zzso for their growth and survival in culture despite the findings that zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso in the activity of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells without affecting the activities of the other zzso zzso in these cells zzso zzso and that zzso zzso regulation of zzso correlated with zzso proliferation of these T zzso Specifically, no zzso in the proliferation zzso zzso or growth of these T cells was found at any of the zzso of zzso examined zzso zzso relative to zzso and control zzso zzso Furthermore, when cultured in the absence of zzso zzso T cells whose relative levels of zzso activity were elevated by approximately zzso died with the same zzso as control cells and underwent zzso as defined by zzso of zzso blue dye and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that while zzso can zzso the zzso activity of zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso activity are insufficient to stimulate zzso pathways required for zzso growth and zzso These findings thus imply the existence of other zzso zzso besides zzso that physically participate in zzso complexes and that are necessary for initiation of the zzso events ultimately responsible for zzso zzso actions on zzso
