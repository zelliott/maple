The zzso zzso binds to the receptors zzso zzso and zzso on B cells, whereas zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso The signaling properties of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso All forms of zzso bound zzso and zzso and zzso zzso signals in primary B zzso In contrast, signaling through zzso in mature B cells or zzso was only achieved by zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which were also zzso zzso of a zzso reporter signaling zzso These results indicate that, although zzso and zzso can provide B cells with similar signals, only zzso but not zzso can respond to soluble zzso zzso which is the main form of zzso found in zzso zzso zzso an efficient zzso zzso was also detected in plasma of zzso transgenic and zzso mice and was more than zzso more active than zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso supported survival of activated B cells and zzso in zzso providing a rational basis to explain the zzso zzso reported in zzso zzso
