The zzso zzso zzso zzso represents one of the major gene products zzso in spinal muscular zzso models in zzso However, to date, no function has been determined for the zzso We have identified zzso and other novel genes potentially involved in motor zzso zzso by expression profiling of zzso labeled motor zzso in embryonic zzso To enrich the profile for genes involved in differentiation of peripheral motor zzso we inhibited the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso thereby rendering labeled zzso unable to grow out of the spinal zzso zzso labeled cells still exhibited zzso growth and most cells retained markers of motor zzso zzso zzso tests of zzso by zzso and zzso confirm crucial functions of this gene for motor zzso growth in zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso arrest or zzso of motor zzso growth at the horizontal zzso an intermediate target and navigational choice point, and reduced muscle zzso at later zzso zzso This zzso is rescued by zzso zzso suggesting that correct expression levels of zzso are important for interactions of growth cones of motor zzso with the horizontal zzso zzso these results identify upstream regulators and downstream functions of zzso during motor zzso zzso
