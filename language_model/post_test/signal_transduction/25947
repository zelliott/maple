Recent zzso efforts have identified many novel zzso small zzso that are expressed at low levels in certain zzso zzso Whether these small zzso are important for zzso physiology is zzso therefore we explored the function of one such zzso human zzso This small zzso is similar in sequence to zzso a highly zzso zzso that when zzso causes hearing loss in humans and zzso Although the zzso and zzso sequences differ slightly, our in zzso zzso indicate that they have an identical regulatory zzso We have identified zzso zzso from genes including, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which share the same zzso and zzso regulatory zzso Interestingly, human zzso is expressed abundantly in brain zzso where zzso is not highly zzso The zzso zzso precursor contains several sequence differences in the precursor zzso which appear to reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso Our data indicate that although zzso and zzso function zzso in zzso they function to some extent uniquely in zzso Given the expression patterns and nature of the target zzso zzso may have a zzso although zzso role in regulating aspects of neural development or function in zzso
