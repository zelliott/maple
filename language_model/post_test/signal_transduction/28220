zzso zzso induced by von zzso factor zzso binding to the membrane zzso zzso involves multiple signal zzso zzso Among these, recruitment and zzso of the zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso represent independent events equally essential to support a complete zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by calcium and by zzso through zzso zzso In this work, we found that zzso zzso the rapid and sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso but not to zzso zzso was required to support zzso of zzso Neither the blockade of the membrane zzso by a specific zzso zzso or the prevention of zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was prevented by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso totally prevented zzso zzso zzso Moreover, release of zzso acid induced by zzso was strongly impaired by zzso of zzso We also found that zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that this process was prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso These results zzso that zzso is a key element in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso
