Although members of the zzso zzso family are found predominantly at the cell surface, these receptors undergo constant cycling between the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso In the absence of an zzso zzso these receptors are slowly zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso but are quickly zzso The zzso degradation rate of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is slower than other zzso family members and only the zzso appears to alter its trafficking pattern in response to zzso zzso This altered pattern is characterized by accelerated zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso trafficking of the zzso is zzso by a series of motifs distributed through the zzso domain of the zzso that are exposed by a combination of zzso zzso changes and the binding of proteins such as zzso As a consequence of induced zzso most zzso signaling occurs within zzso whereas signaling by the other members of the zzso family appear to be generated predominantly from the cell zzso zzso of zzso family members can disrupt normal zzso trafficking by driving zzso of receptors with disparate trafficking zzso Because different zzso zzso zzso are localized in different cellular zzso disrupted trafficking could be an important factor in the altered signaling patterns observed as a consequence of zzso zzso
