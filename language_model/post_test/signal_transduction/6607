zzso of T cells results in the production of zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso C zzso plays a key role in this zzso It has been shown that this zzso is essential to elicit a response to Con A or specific zzso in zzso T helper type 1 zzso 1) cells that zzso zzso We have now explored the signal zzso zzso that leads to zzso of the zzso gene and proliferation in zzso zzso T helper type 2 zzso 2) zzso Surprisingly, we have found in two independently derived zzso 2 clones that neither cellular proliferation nor zzso zzso production is affected by blocking or depletion of zzso This differential mechanism of signal transmission leading to cellular zzso implies a new distinction between zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso
