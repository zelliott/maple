The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of signal zzso in zzso cells and targeted disruption of zzso in mice leads to a zzso zzso We analyzed the effects of zzso on the human leukemia cell line zzso in which expression of zzso zzso protein is not zzso Restoration of zzso expression in zzso cells with an zzso expression system caused a zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reduction of zzso zzso activity, which was associated with reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without changing the zzso of Bad zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed an increased transit time through the zzso phase of the cell cycle, but zzso did not cause a complete cell cycle arrest or zzso Extension of the zzso phase was associated with an increased stability of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso and reduced zzso of the zzso protein zzso at zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that restoration of zzso activity in a human leukemia cell line, which has lost expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso signaling and leads to an increased transit time through the zzso phase of the cell zzso
