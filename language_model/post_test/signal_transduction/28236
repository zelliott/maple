The zzso zzso zzso are a family of related zzso zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso is rapidly but zzso induced by zzso zzso treatment, suggesting that it contributes to zzso induction of zzso zzso However, zzso treatment of zzso mouse zzso cells stimulates a rapid zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso the action of zzso elements in the zzso These studies suggest that zzso has a role in the fine tuning of zzso zzso production during the initial phase of zzso zzso is found in zzso and zzso a specific zzso zzso in insulin zzso zzso This finding, along with the fact that its expression is raised in the white zzso tissue of mice with type 2 diabetes zzso suggests that zzso might be involved in zzso regulation in zzso zzso Thus, members of the zzso family are emerging as important zzso of key processes such as steroid hormone zzso by the adrenal zzso and insulin signaling in zzso
