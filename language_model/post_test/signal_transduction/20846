The zzso zzso system zzso a zzso cascade zzso by specialized proteins to detect zzso with high sensitivity and zzso The recent identification of zzso zzso components for each step in the zzso cascade suggests that expression of these proteins is zzso controlled by zzso regulatory sequences and zzso zzso zzso We have used molecular genetic methods to characterize sequences zzso zzso zzso sites in the genes for components of the zzso zzso zzso and have identified a putative zzso factor, zzso that functions at these sites to regulate gene zzso
