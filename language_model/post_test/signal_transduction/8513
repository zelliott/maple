zzso juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso is an zzso disease characterized by arthritis and systemic zzso Its zzso is still largely zzso It is characterized zzso by natural killer zzso cell dysfunction and zzso signatures that predominantly feature zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso can drive zzso cell function, we examined how the high plasma levels of this zzso are related to the documented zzso cell failure in these zzso 

The zzso and function of zzso cells from 10 healthy control subjects, 15 patients with zzso zzso and 15 patients with zzso zzso were characterized by zzso and functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso binding was zzso by zzso zzso zzso of several zzso zzso and the zzso zzso beta zzso were zzso by Western zzso 

zzso from the plasma of zzso zzso patients zzso the zzso of zzso cells from healthy controls and bound its zzso zzso However, zzso cells from zzso zzso patients failed to zzso zzso killing zzso such as zzso and zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso did not induce the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso induced zzso cell zzso We observed no additive effect of zzso in combination with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso cells from zzso zzso could not zzso this zzso after zzso zzso 

The mechanism of the impaired zzso cell function in zzso zzso involves a zzso in zzso zzso This observation has major implications for the understanding and, ultimately, the treatment of zzso zzso
