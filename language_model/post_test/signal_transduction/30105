A growing body of evidence has shown that zzso a death zzso mediates zzso biological zzso Here, we report that zzso engagement with zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso expression without induction of zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso however, induced zzso instead of zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso In zzso zzso blood pressure was slightly higher in zzso mice with decreased cell surface zzso expression zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, chronic zzso of zzso oxide synthesis by zzso induced a progressive increase in the levels of blood pressure in zzso mice, whereas no further increase in the levels of blood pressure was observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso caused a lesser zzso relaxation of the strips from zzso mice compared with zzso mice, although the zzso potency of zzso was not different between the two zzso These findings indicate that zzso signaling may have a role in the regulation of zzso function and blood pressure through modulating zzso zzso oxide zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso
