To date a few sequences regulating expression of conifer zzso genes have been zzso To characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso storage protein zzso a zzso DNA sequence containing upstream promoter sequences was isolated by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso promoter revealed the presence of zzso elements zzso and multiple zzso motifs zzso and zzso zzso features characteristic of zzso storage protein genes in zzso When fused to the zzso reporter zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter sequence was sufficient to direct transient expression in both developing zzso zzso and zzso derived zzso zzso Analysis of this promoter construct in transgenic tobacco showed that expression was restricted to zzso and zzso in developing seeds and was not detected in zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that both structural and regulatory elements as well as upstream signaling components controlling the expression of zzso zzso genes are highly zzso during zzso
