The signaling zzso for zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso plays a central role in regulating the differentiation and/or maintenance of stem cell types that can be derived from the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso stem zzso cells resemble the primitive zzso of the zzso which normally gives rise to the zzso and the visceral zzso in zzso but zzso cells do not contribute efficiently to the visceral zzso in zzso zzso We have found that zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso zzso an zzso zzso for zzso display zzso of markers for visceral zzso as well as anterior visceral zzso zzso and can contribute to visceral zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In culture, zzso cells do not express zzso but do express the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and require zzso for zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso is inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso but the response to zzso is zzso suggesting that the activity of zzso is at least partially independent of type I zzso zzso zzso Gene set enrichment analysis of zzso expression signatures generated from zzso cells under these treatment conditions confirmed the differing responses of zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso Our findings define distinct pathways for zzso and zzso in the differentiation of visceral zzso and zzso from zzso cells and provide new insights into the zzso of these cell types in zzso
