Plasma zzso protein zzso concentration is increased in the zzso syndrome, which consists of a cluster of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including insulin zzso It is not known, however, whether zzso is merely a marker of accompanying inflammation or whether it contributes zzso to insulin zzso The objective of this study is to investigate the role that zzso may play in the development of insulin zzso We examined the effect of zzso intravenous administration of zzso human zzso on insulin sensitivity in zzso rats using the zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso was associated with impaired insulin suppression of zzso zzso production with no reduction in peripheral tissue zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso insulin resistance in the liver but not zzso zzso We further assessed components of the insulin signaling zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso Liver zzso derived from zzso rats showed reduced zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association, and zzso zzso consistent with zzso impairment of zzso insulin zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Finally, we observed in primary cultured rat zzso that zzso (a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso corrected zzso impairment of insulin zzso 

zzso plays an active role in inducing zzso insulin resistance in the zzso at least in part by zzso zzso with downstream impairment in the insulin signaling zzso
