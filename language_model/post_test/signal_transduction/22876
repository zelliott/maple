Bone zzso protein zzso is a member of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso and is most similar to zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso zzso signaling zzso during zzso zzso zzso strongly induced alkaline zzso zzso activity in cells of zzso zzso including zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso zzso The profile of binding of zzso to type I and type II receptors was similar to that of zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso strongly bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso (also termed zzso together with type II zzso zzso zzso type II zzso zzso and zzso type II zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso to which zzso also zzso In contrast, binding of zzso to zzso zzso and less efficiently to zzso and zzso together with zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso was further studied using zzso and zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso strongly induced zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and less efficiently those of zzso However, zzso was zzso zzso and no further zzso or nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso These findings indicate that in the process of differentiation to zzso zzso binds to zzso as well as other type I zzso and zzso signals mainly through zzso and possibly through zzso
