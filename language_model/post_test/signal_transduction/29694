zzso zzso zzso play an important role in pulp tissue zzso However, the mechanisms and signal zzso pathways involved in the production of zzso in human pulp cells are not fully zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso activity in human pulp cells zzso with various pharmacological zzso 

Human dental pulp cells were cultured using an zzso technique obtained from impacted third zzso with informed consent of the zzso The effects of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A on the production and zzso of zzso by human pulp cells were determined by gelatin zzso 

The main zzso zzso by human pulp cells migrated at 72 zzso and represented zzso Minor zzso bands were also observed at 92 zzso regions that zzso to zzso After a zzso culture period, zzso zzso and zzso A were found to zzso zzso production zzso The zzso decreased in an order of zzso zzso zzso Human pulp cells, however, treated with various pharmacological agents had no effect on the pattern of zzso produced or zzso in either cell extracts or zzso medium zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso zzso and zzso A can regulate zzso produced by human pulp zzso The signal zzso pathways zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in the production of zzso
