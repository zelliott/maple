Acute zzso leukemia zzso in adult patients is often resistant to current therapy, making the development of novel therapeutic agents zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso a class of signal zzso zzso would be effective in primary human zzso zzso from adult patients with precursor B ALL were cultured on bone zzso zzso and were treated with zzso a second generation zzso zzso cells showed a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in zzso cells, compared to zzso zzso We also assessed the effect of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We treated a total of 68 mice generated from the same patient samples with zzso after establishment of zzso Animals treated with zzso showed a decrease in zzso blasts and in zzso In dramatic contrast, zzso animals continued to show expansion of human zzso We performed zzso to validate the zzso of the zzso signaling intermediate zzso in human zzso finding zzso of this target in zzso human ALL exposed to zzso We conclude that zzso can inhibit the growth of adult human ALL and deserve close examination as therapeutic agents against a disease that is often not zzso with current zzso
