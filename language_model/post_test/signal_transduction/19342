An integral component of zzso in all organisms is zzso to zzso transition zzso a fundamental zzso event through which zzso cells transform into zzso zzso The zzso cells that arise from zzso cells during zzso contribute to various tissue rudiments during subsequent development, including the zzso zzso heart, gut, zzso body wall and lining of the zzso The process of zzso has been the subject of several hundred scientific zzso Despite all that has been written, it is likely that what we currently know about zzso is still considerably less than what remains to be zzso One critical remaining question that we consider here is how does zzso cease at the right place along the body zzso and at the right time? In this commentary, we focus on the molecular mechanism for the zzso of zzso using the chick zzso as a model zzso
