zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso of stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation by zzso was reported in the human zzso cell line zzso Because approximately zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso cases are zzso positive, we evaluated in zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell lines and primary zzso blast zzso At zzso zzso zzso the drug marginally inhibited zzso proliferation of cell lines and most of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso and zzso showed synergistic effect at low zzso Western zzso analysis documented a distinct band of zzso zzso specific for zzso in cell lines and in zzso zzso There was no correlation between the level of the zzso expression evaluated by Western zzso and percentage of zzso blasts as measured by flow zzso Neither in cell lines nor in primary zzso cells, zzso zzso was zzso under standard growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso In a zzso zzso cell line, as well as in zzso samples, zzso zzso was not induced by zzso exposure, suggesting that in these cases, the zzso could not be functionally zzso In conclusion, with the exception of zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso and cell proliferation was not modulated in the presence of zzso We did not detect any zzso zzso zzso in our experimental zzso zzso zzso exerted only a limited zzso effect on the cell zzso
