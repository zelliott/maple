zzso growth factor zzso can mediate zzso responses via zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of lens zzso cells to zzso and zzso contraction contribute to zzso capsule zzso zzso after cataract zzso The primary objective of the study was to determine the importance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso contraction, and zzso signaling by human lens zzso zzso 

The human lens cell line zzso 124 was zzso zzso zzso was achieved by using zzso technology and efficiency tested at the message and protein level by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear distribution after zzso stimulation (10 zzso was determined by zzso Gene expression of zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso (10 zzso was determined with real-time zzso zzso contraction was assessed with a patch contraction zzso zzso zzso array technology was used to determine zzso zzso and zzso levels in response to zzso over a zzso time zzso 

zzso targeted against zzso successfully reduced expression of zzso message and protein after both the initial zzso period and removal of zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by zzso for zzso which showed a significant reduction in nuclear zzso after zzso treatment relative to control zzso in both the presence and absence of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso nuclear zzso which did not differ significantly from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed significant induction of zzso and zzso transcript in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso These zzso were suppressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso 124 cells was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso cells did not exhibit a significant zzso response after 24 hours of culture in the presence or absence of 10 zzso zzso However, zzso cells demonstrated a significant reduction in patch area zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso array analysis showed that zzso significantly increased zzso and zzso levels relative to zzso zzso No significant change was observed with zzso 

zzso is critical for the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in contrast, zzso signaling is not essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso does activate zzso pathways in human lens zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso contraction appears to be zzso by distinct zzso signaling zzso
