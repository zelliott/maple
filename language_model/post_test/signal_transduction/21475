zzso of zzso signals is a promising therapeutic target to prevent zzso zzso In this study, we sought to characterize to what extent zzso engagement contributes to the development of transplantation tolerance under the cover of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso we found that zzso of the primary zzso and induction of zzso zzso by zzso blockade was zzso by zzso zzso In addition, regulatory zzso T cells zzso were confirmed to play a critical role in the induction of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicated that zzso engagement is not required for zzso or zzso function of zzso Instead, in the absence of either zzso signaling or zzso zzso T cell division was zzso whereas the zzso of zzso T cell division by zzso blockade remained largely zzso In zzso the administration of additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso rejection was accompanied by enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso signaling and zzso independently cooperate in the zzso of zzso T cell expansion under zzso zzso
