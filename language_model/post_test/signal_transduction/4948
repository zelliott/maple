Numerous studies report that exposing certain organisms to zzso radiation zzso beneficial effects on zzso zzso and zzso By analyzing survival after bacterial infection and zzso zzso gene expression in zzso flies, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso enhances innate zzso zzso zzso of flies significantly increased resistance against zzso and zzso bacterial infections, as well as expression of several zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso also resulted in a specific increase in expression of key proteins of the Toll signaling zzso and zzso forms of zzso and zzso These results indicate that innate immunity is activated after zzso zzso through Toll signaling zzso in zzso
