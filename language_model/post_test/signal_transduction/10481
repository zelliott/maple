zzso diseases are a group of diseases that lead to erosion of the hard and soft zzso of the zzso which, in severe cases, can result in tooth zzso zzso clinical observations have suggested that poor oral health may be associated with poor systemic zzso however, only recently have appropriate zzso studies been zzso with defined clinical zzso of zzso disease, to address the association of zzso disease with increased risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular zzso Although conflicting reports exist, these zzso studies support this zzso zzso these zzso studies, emerging basic scientific studies also support that infection may represent a risk factor for zzso With zzso zzso as a model zzso in zzso studies support that this zzso can activate host innate immune responses associated with zzso and in zzso studies demonstrate that this zzso can accelerate zzso deposition in animal zzso In this review, we focus primarily on the basic scientific studies performed to date which support that infection with bacteria, most notably zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we attempt to bring together these studies to provide an up-to-date framework of emerging theories into the mechanisms underlying zzso disease and increased risk for zzso as well as identify intervention strategies to reduce the zzso of zzso disease in humans, in an attempt to decrease risk for systemic complications of zzso disease such as zzso cardiovascular zzso
