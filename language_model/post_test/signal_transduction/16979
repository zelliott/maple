Plant nutrition is one of the important areas for improving the yield and quality in crops as well as zzso zzso zzso is an essential plant zzso and is required in abundance for their proper growth and zzso zzso zzso directly affects the plant growth and hence crop yield and zzso Recently, zzso zzso analysis has been performed in the model plant zzso however in zzso and crop plants; such a zzso analysis has not been undertaken till zzso In rice, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso responses has not been investigated in zzso Here, we present a combined zzso and whole zzso zzso study of rice zzso exposed to a brief period of zzso zzso then replenished with zzso Our results reveal that the expressions of a diverse set of genes zzso with many distinct functions were altered under zzso zzso Our findings highlight altered expression patterns of zzso genes zzso involved in zzso zzso stress responses, signaling zzso zzso regulation, and transport of multiple molecules including zzso Interestingly, several genes responsive to zzso conditions show a reversal in expression upon resupply of zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso deprivation leads to zzso of multiple genes and gene networks, which may be acting in concert to sense the external zzso and mediate zzso distribution and ultimately adaptation to low zzso zzso The interplay of both zzso and zzso genes globally in response to zzso deprivation determines how plants cope with the stress of zzso zzso at different zzso as well as zzso stages of zzso
