Although liver zzso occurring after partial zzso zzso is greatly reduced in aged mice, liver zzso induced by zzso zzso was found to be age zzso Here, we investigated the potential utility of zzso in stimulating liver zzso in old mice subjected to zzso zzso Although virtually no zzso entered S phase 48 h after zzso zzso (2 h prior to zzso with zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced an increase of zzso incorporation and enhanced the expression of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso Next, we investigated the potential utility of zzso in the context of donor conditioning prior to zzso zzso Three days after zzso administration to intact young mice, an almost doubling of the liver mass and DNA content zzso the zzso response to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso liver was similar to that of mice subjected to zzso alone, suggesting that an increased liver mass at the time of surgery does not inhibit the zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso zzso is a promising tool in conditions characterized by reduced zzso capacity, such as in the elderly, or when a rapid increase of liver mass is required, such as in zzso zzso
