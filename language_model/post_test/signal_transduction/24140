On human zzso zzso acts as a more potent zzso zzso than zzso although both zzso signal mainly via zzso of the zzso factor zzso In this study we compare zzso and zzso signaling in primary human zzso derived from blood zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or the zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso remains largely zzso Although zzso zzso the feedback inhibitor zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso in zzso zzso of zzso signal zzso by zzso occurs rapidly and does not depend on gene zzso We also found that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso subsequent zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is not affected by zzso with zzso This zzso is dependent on active zzso and might therefore be explained by different sensitivities of zzso and zzso signaling toward the feedback inhibitor zzso which is induced by both zzso In contrast to the zzso signal zzso zzso which has been previously shown to recruit zzso to one of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso does not interact with zzso zzso motifs of the zzso Taken together, different sensitivities of zzso and zzso signaling toward mechanisms that inhibit the zzso zzso zzso define an important mechanism that contributes to the different zzso zzso of these two zzso
