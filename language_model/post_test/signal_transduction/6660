The T cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso surface zzso on T cells which recognizes foreign zzso In addition to the zzso alpha beta or gamma delta zzso zzso recognition element, each zzso has five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains and a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly and surface expression requires the presence of all chains except zzso zzso of partial complexes, however, is determined differently by specific chains with the zzso chain in zzso T cells providing safe transport of assembled zzso from the zzso complex to the cell zzso zzso zzso involves zzso of two zzso zzso zzso C and a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso couple zzso to the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We have evidence that the activated protein zzso zzso may be zzso a member of the zzso zzso While specific zzso roles for all zzso chains are not yet zzso we have implicated the zzso chain as uniquely zzso zzso zzso engagement to zzso zzso zzso perhaps via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
