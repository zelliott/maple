The zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were used as models to investigate zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso cell zzso Although zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso was independent of and unresponsive to zzso zzso including zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells was dependent on zzso growth zzso When these cell lines were cultured in medium without zzso a zzso activated zzso zzso factor was detected in nuclear extracts from both zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso factor was not zzso in zzso zzso cells, but was activated zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso The zzso activated and zzso zzso zzso factor in these three cell lines was identified as zzso by zzso competition gel mobility zzso and by specific zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also was detected in the zzso cell lines, but not in zzso cells without zzso zzso zzso cells express a zzso zzso zzso which may be responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells do not express the zzso zzso but increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso using growth zzso zzso and zzso cells as targets, zzso media from zzso and zzso cells did not show zzso effects on cell zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso growth of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells is triggered by a mechanism other than zzso zzso or the zzso zzso
