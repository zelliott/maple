zzso receptors zzso are sentinels of innate immunity that recognize zzso molecules and trigger inflammatory zzso Because inflammatory zzso are zzso to the host, the zzso response is regulated by feedback zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso have been shown to be potent zzso of zzso activity, and this zzso may provide insight regarding mechanisms of the feedback zzso In the present study, we examined feedback mechanisms that regulate zzso activity in zzso using statins to zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures established from newborn rat brains were exposed to zzso zzso the zzso for zzso The zzso of expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso was determined by real-time zzso zzso of the cells with either zzso or zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso The most profound enhancement of approximately zzso was observed for the zzso zzso The enhancements for the zzso and zzso genes were approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso fully reversed the effects of zzso indicating that these drugs act through the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of protein zzso but not protein zzso zzso the effects of zzso strongly indicating that the enhancement is zzso by the zzso zzso In support of this notion, zzso of cells with toxin B, a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso proteins are involved in the zzso of negative feedback zzso of zzso signaling in zzso
