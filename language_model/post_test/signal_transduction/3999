zzso and zzso hormone are signals which regulate the zzso of milk protein genes in zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which these hormones cooperate in the induction of zzso Both hormones activate zzso zzso factors in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts its effect through binding to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and through zzso zzso This leads to the zzso of a protein zzso zzso zzso which is zzso associated with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso which causes its zzso and nuclear zzso where zzso specifically binds to sequence elements in the promoter regions of milk protein zzso In comparison, the zzso zzso is activated by a zzso steroid zzso in the zzso which causes zzso changes in the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso and the zzso zzso form a molecular complex which zzso in the induction of zzso of the zzso zzso We have defined the DNA sequence requirements for this cooperative mechanism and have zzso the functional zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso that are necessary for the functional zzso We find that the zzso response element zzso within the zzso gene promoter is sufficient to elicit the cooperative action of zzso and the zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso through zzso of zzso zzso is an absolute prerequisite for zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso results in a zzso which cannot mediate zzso by itself but can still cooperate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso DNA binding domain or a DNA binding domain contributed by the zzso zzso are still able to cooperate with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso does not impede cooperation with zzso whereas deletion of the zzso zzso domain does prevent zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso of zzso independently of its DNA binding zzso
