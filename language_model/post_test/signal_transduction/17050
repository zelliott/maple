Lung cancer is the most lethal form of cancer in the world and despite significant therapeutic improvements that have been made, its survival rate still remains zzso The latter is mainly due to the acquisition of resistance to systemic treatment regimens which, in turn, may be due to the presence of cancer stem cells zzso within the primary zzso zzso constitute a zzso of cells that are highly zzso and that exhibit biological properties similar to those of normal tissue stem cells, including an unlimited zzso capacity, an extensive zzso capacity and a capacity to generate differentiated zzso A better understanding of the signaling pathways that regulate lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso could thus lead to the design of improved approaches to lung cancer zzso 

In this review we will discuss the current knowledge on lung zzso their biological properties and their putative clinical zzso By employing currently available data, we will evaluate the zzso value of several lung zzso zzso In addition, we will discuss the release of zzso from tumor tissue into the blood circulation via zzso transition zzso as an important step towards acquiring a zzso zzso Finally, we will provide an outlook into novel zzso approaches for achieving less invasive diagnostic procedures and improving long-term therapeutic zzso 

Lung zzso research has gained considerable momentum to both basic and clinical applications, both aiming to identify a reliable panel of markers for lung zzso and to clarify their function, with the final goal to develop a zzso therapy that will result in the complete elimination of zzso for achieving significantly better long-time survival of lung cancer zzso
