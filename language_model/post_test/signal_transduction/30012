In the last two decades extensive study has been carried out on the isolation, identification and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whose zzso and zzso functions are only starting to be zzso Besides zzso zzso and zzso four further zzso cardiac zzso were isolated and identified so zzso These compounds are found in almost all zzso zzso including blood plasma and zzso but with the highest zzso in the adrenal zzso zzso and zzso De zzso zzso of these zzso occurs in zzso zzso cells of adrenal zzso precursors such as zzso zzso and zzso increase the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these compounds from the zzso cells are controlled by zzso mechanisms, as well as via the zzso zzso The zzso cardiac zzso are transported in blood as complexes bound to specific binding zzso The identified zzso cardiac zzso fulfill all the zzso zzso of the hormones, so they represent a new class of steroid zzso The cardiac zzso influence the active sodium zzso indirectly the zzso free calcium concentration and therefore exert a positive zzso effect on cardiac zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso they can regulate the cell growth and protein synthesis inducing zzso of zzso signal zzso Under pathological conditions, however, when the concentration of these steroids are high, they play a crucial role in the development of different serious illnesses such as essential hypertension as well as zzso heart zzso Further intensive investigations are needed to clarify some contradictory details accumulated during the last few years in this zzso
