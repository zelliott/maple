zzso is a type III zzso zzso from zzso which contributes to zzso but whose action still remains zzso It is an zzso zzso repeats zzso containing protein which zzso to the nucleus of target cells in spite of the fact that it does not contain any classical nuclear zzso signal zzso Using a zzso approach, we observed that the three first zzso zzso and the 32 zzso zzso of zzso zzso act as zzso in zzso Furthermore, by zzso of zzso cells, we observed that zzso could direct large zzso zzso proteins into the nucleus of zzso cells confirming that it contains a zzso Critical zzso for nuclear targeting were identified by zzso zzso in zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso is crucial for the nuclear targeting of an zzso fusion zzso
