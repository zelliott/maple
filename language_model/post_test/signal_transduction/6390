zzso tissue growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso that plays a fundamental role in the development of tissue zzso by zzso many of the zzso effects of zzso We present the novel finding that the zzso pathogen zzso zzso elicits immediate and sustained repression of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen I zzso To address mechanisms underlying this response, the major zzso pathways were zzso We report that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso antagonize zzso induction of zzso in zzso Of the zzso signaling pathways required for zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso interferes with cellular zzso zzso but not zzso zzso While increased stimulation of zzso zzso alone was insufficient to override the zzso repression of zzso stimulation of zzso with increased zzso of zzso which activates both zzso and zzso completely zzso this zzso Together with the finding that zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression requires de zzso host cell protein zzso our data indicate that the unique ability of zzso zzso to interfere with the host zzso response is a complex process requiring input from multiple host cell signaling zzso
