To investigate the zzso of zzso anemia zzso the zzso of zzso cells was zzso with zzso zzso 24 zzso and 48 zzso after incubation with the serum of normal controls zzso zzso 10), patients with non severe AA zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe AA zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the bone zzso of normal donors contained a significantly greater proportion of zzso cells after incubation with serum from zzso patients than that incubated with serum from normal controls and zzso Moreover, the percent zzso of zzso cells after 24 zzso incubation with serum from zzso was slightly higher than that of normal zzso This appears to be related to clinical zzso No significant difference was found in the percent zzso of zzso cells between incubation for 24 zzso and 48 zzso with the same zzso To further explore the mechanism of increased zzso induced by the serum of AA patients, the expression of the zzso zzso was measured after incubation with serum from the normal controls and AA patients using flow zzso After incubation with serum from the AA patients, the zzso zzso was zzso zzso with the increased zzso induced by the same serum from AA zzso In addition, the induction of zzso and zzso expression on zzso cells by serum from the zzso patients was blocked partly by zzso of the serum with zzso zzso zzso These findings suggested that some zzso components of the serum in the AA patients, which was confirmed partly to be zzso can induce zzso zzso zzso through the zzso signaling zzso This may contribute to understanding the decreased number of stem cells characteristic of zzso zzso
