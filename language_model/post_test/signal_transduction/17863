Cell fate zzso is regulated in part by lateral zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso regulated by zzso an intrinsic factor that regulates cellular zzso In this study we have examined the involvement of zzso in retinal development, which has been shown to be influenced by zzso zzso In the developing zzso zzso is zzso distributed towards the zzso and zzso poles of different zzso zzso zzso is evident not only in zzso cells but in zzso zzso cells as well, suggesting that the zzso distribution of zzso may play a role after cells have exited the cell zzso This is supported by the expression of zzso in terminally differentiated zzso in the adult zzso Although zzso is an intrinsic factor, it is observed that its zzso distribution is influenced by zzso cues such that a higher proportion of cells cultured at high density express zzso zzso A correlation is observed between zzso zzso and cellular zzso cells in which zzso is zzso differentiate more readily in culture than those that express zzso zzso We have identified alternative zzso zzso in the developing and adult zzso that zzso to zzso that have been shown to regulate proliferation and zzso The dynamic zzso expression patterns of alternative zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso may influence proliferation and differentiation of retinal zzso during zzso and maturation of zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate the complex role of the distribution of zzso within zzso and zzso zzso
