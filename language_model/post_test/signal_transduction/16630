In experiments designed to determine the consequence of cholesterol depletion on relaxation signaling in the zzso we treated isolated strips of guinea pig zzso in organ baths with zzso zzso zzso to remove cholesterol expecting suppression of spontaneous activity and zzso of zzso specific relaxation as we have shown in vascular muscle zzso Research zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with 15 zzso zzso for 15 zzso led to enhancement of spontaneous activity that was further increased following a second zzso zzso zzso treated zzso developed increased force on top of that already present zzso when zzso by zzso but reached the same maximum as control zzso zzso of OT relaxed control but not zzso zzso zzso When cholesterol depleted zzso were zzso with cholesterol using a zzso preparation, they immediately relaxed to zzso zzso of cholesterol to zzso zzso suppressed spontaneous zzso and diminished responses to zzso These findings suggest that cholesterol selectively zzso relaxation zzso We propose that zzso activity may be altered in women acutely by changes in serum cholesterol and that understanding the distinctions between zzso smooth muscle and other smooth muscles may reveal zzso unknown therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso zzso
