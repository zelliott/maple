Small structural changes in the zzso peptides recognized by zzso can alter the biological properties of those peptides and convert them into weak zzso partial zzso or zzso of these zzso These altered zzso zzso zzso are usually generated by conservative zzso acid zzso at zzso contact zzso Here, we show that zzso with therapeutic properties can also be generated by attachment of zzso acid at the N zzso of the zzso without the need to modify the zzso primary zzso Using zzso pigeon zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to induce T cell zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso More importantly, administration of the zzso zzso mice reduced the responsiveness to the native zzso when tested ex zzso zzso and functional experiments indicated that the action of zzso peptides was due to the conversion of the native zzso into a weak zzso that could then induce T cell zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso peptides is a feasible strategy to generate zzso as it avoids the need to screen multiple zzso acid zzso of each specific zzso to identify those with therapeutic zzso
