The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso signaling system initiated by zzso of the plasma membrane zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso acts as a second zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors and environmental stresses zzso zzso to signal zzso In several cell systems zzso links to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade to signal zzso The engagement of the zzso zzso in signaling zzso is tightly regulated by zzso control mechanisms, and the balance between zzso and zzso systems determines the magnitude of the zzso response in zzso and in zzso This review describes the known elements and molecular ordering of zzso zzso and the zzso mechanisms that regulate its zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling involved in zzso zzso and the modes of their zzso function may yield opportunities for pharmacological interventions with potential for clinical zzso
