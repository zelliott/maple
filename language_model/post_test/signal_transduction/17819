In the past two years, several zzso genes have been shown to zzso putative zzso proteins in zzso These proteins probably function as zzso zzso that repress the promotion of flowering and flower organ identity zzso and thereby maintain zzso zzso As the plant zzso levels of the floral promoters increase despite the continued presence of floral zzso High levels of the floral promoters are somehow able to overcome floral repression and to activate flower zzso Further characterization of zzso that have zzso in either floral promoters or floral zzso revealed that these zzso not only display defects in flowering time but also have altered zzso zzso These findings indicate that these flowering genes also regulate other aspects of shoot development and may be used to study the mechanism of shoot growth zzso
