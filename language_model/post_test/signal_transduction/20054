zzso zzso signaling in the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso plays a critical role in the processing of emotional information and memory zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors within the zzso zzso division of the zzso zzso zzso emotional memory by strongly zzso the zzso of normally zzso emotional memories but blocking the acquisition of zzso emotionally salient fear zzso Previous in zzso studies have shown that zzso of cortical zzso zzso receptors can zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso II zzso a zzso essential for learning and zzso Using an zzso fear conditioning procedure in rats combined with zzso into the zzso we examined the potential role of zzso zzso control of emotional memory zzso through signaling via zzso zzso zzso A zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso blockade prevents the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso fear zzso In contrast, blockade of either zzso or zzso signaling pathways rescued the blockade of zzso fear memory via zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of emotional memory zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso transmission depends upon downstream signaling via zzso zzso and zzso zzso
