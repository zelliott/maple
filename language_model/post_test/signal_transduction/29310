In order to improve our understanding of how Atlantic cod zzso zzso respond to zzso we characterized zzso gene expression in zzso zzso following stimulation with a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso We used zzso suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries and quantitative zzso zzso to identify and zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were generated from zzso libraries enriched for genes responsive to zzso Thirteen zzso genes from the libraries were subjected to zzso Genes confirmed as zzso by zzso included zzso zzso gene 15, a small zzso zzso zzso regulatory factors zzso 7, and 10), zzso class I, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso suggesting that zzso may suppress the acute phase zzso Since the zzso libraries built for this study identified genes involved in the zzso response, they are important resources for studying the responses of Atlantic cod to zzso Evidence is provided for the existence of a zzso zzso zzso viral recognition zzso in Atlantic zzso Taken together, our data show that Atlantic cod can recognize zzso zzso and mount a rapid and potent zzso zzso response that is similar to that observed in other fish species and higher zzso
