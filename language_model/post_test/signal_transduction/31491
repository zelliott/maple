Rapid and long-distance zzso of membrane components is critical for zzso formation in zzso zzso but the mechanisms responsible for polarized trafficking are not well zzso Here, we demonstrate that in zzso zzso the majority of the zzso complex is redistributed to the zzso region during zzso zzso zzso distributed zzso zzso in zzso cells cluster toward the growing tip during zzso formation, remain associated with the zzso portion of the filament during its extension, and are almost absent from the cell zzso This restricted zzso zzso pattern is distinct from other zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which remain distributed throughout the cell body and zzso zzso positioning of the zzso and the maintenance of its structural integrity requires zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso causes a zzso zzso of the zzso into a zzso of finely dispersed zzso with a zzso density no different from that of normal zzso These results demonstrate the existence of a zzso zzso cue for zzso integrity and positioning at the zzso portion of the zzso tip, and suggest that zzso zzso have evolved a novel strategy for polarized zzso involving a zzso of the zzso to the growing zzso
