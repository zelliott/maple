zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was proposed as a zzso of zzso activity, predominantly in conditions of zzso and zzso Given these prior studies, we sought to determine whether zzso plays a major role in modulating zzso insulin zzso To answer this question, we produced mice in which a zzso reporter was knocked into the locus containing the gene zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression analyses demonstrated that the zzso is expressed in liver, zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso skin, small zzso stomach, and zzso but not normal, skeletal zzso zzso mice are essentially identical to their zzso zzso in overall appearance and body zzso zzso analysis of zzso mice did not detect any zzso in serum zzso insulin, or zzso zzso zzso or insulin zzso or energy zzso Studies in zzso zzso revealed normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns, zzso levels, and expressions of key regulatory zzso and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that deletion of zzso has minimal effect on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and, as such, they question any zzso role for zzso in the maintenance of zzso and energy zzso in zzso
