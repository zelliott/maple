zzso muscle zzso and zzso are important zzso responses to both physical activity and pathological zzso Failure to maintain these processes zzso the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with zzso and in zzso Here we show that stable expression of a gene zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso in zzso skeletal muscle cells, or treatment of these cells with zzso IGF-1 or with insulin and zzso results in zzso of differentiated zzso and a switch to zzso zzso Treatment with IGF-1 or insulin and zzso zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the nuclear zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso is suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso A or zzso but not by zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso muscle with a zzso zzso IGF-1 also activates zzso zzso satellite cells and causes a switch to zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso and changes in zzso zzso are zzso by calcium zzso and are critically regulated by the zzso zzso zzso
