zzso gamma zzso zzso growth arrest in normal human zzso zzso cells by establishing a block during zzso corresponding to the time when the zzso protein zzso would normally be zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso within 24 h of zzso zzso levels of the zzso and zzso zzso do not change within this time period, although zzso levels are significantly reduced by 48 zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso protein levels, presumably by a zzso mechanism as no change was observed in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities is accompanied by a zzso or greater increase of zzso in zzso zzso zzso may also have a role in the zzso of zzso zzso activities, as zzso protein associated with these complexes was increase by zzso after zzso In zzso zzso cell lines which are resistant to growth zzso by zzso zzso levels are not induced by zzso nor is zzso zzso activity zzso despite high baseline levels of zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso expression of zzso in these cells zzso growth zzso In addition, zzso zzso protein added to zzso complexes zzso from zzso cells is able to inhibit the zzso activity in a dose dependent zzso Our results suggest that zzso has a role in zzso zzso terminal growth zzso Resistance of zzso zzso to growth zzso by zzso does not appear to involve resistance of zzso complexes to the action of zzso but rather an inability to appropriately regulate the balance of zzso zzso E and zzso zzso
