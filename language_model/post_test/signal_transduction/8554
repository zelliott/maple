zzso related zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein related to zzso zzso zzso which acts in the zzso specifically at the zzso zzso terminating on zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice leads to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso but not zzso In zzso zzso of zzso into deficient animals revealed that zzso zzso zzso at the synaptic zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso crucial for its interaction with zzso acid zzso abolished the ability to prevent zzso As zzso application in zzso induced zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso animals, and zzso of zzso is reduced in zzso zzso we assessed zzso zzso animals, and found that the zzso observed in the zzso mice was fully zzso Thus, we propose zzso as an important player in the zzso control of zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso
