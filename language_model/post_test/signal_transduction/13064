zzso of zzso activity is critical for cell fate decisions and differentiation of skeletal zzso We have employed the skeletal zzso cell line zzso to study zzso regulation of zzso protein levels during zzso Although the major degradation zzso of the activated zzso zzso zzso appears to involve zzso and degradation by the 26 S zzso we provide evidence for an alternative zzso zzso where the zzso zzso form of zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein after treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso but not after treatment with various zzso zzso This finding was supported by the observation that the zzso form of zzso was zzso and specifically zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest a regulatory mechanism zzso zzso protein levels already at the cellular surface, possibly with consequences for zzso signal zzso during terminal differentiation zzso
