Acute zzso leukemia zzso is believed to arise from zzso zzso cells zzso making understanding the biological differences between zzso and normal stem cells zzso or common zzso zzso zzso crucial to understanding zzso zzso To determine if protein expression patterns were different in zzso compared to other zzso and zzso zzso we measured the expression of 121 proteins by zzso Phase zzso zzso zzso in 5 zzso zzso from zzso zzso and blood zzso Bulk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression differed markedly from Bulk zzso zzso cases, zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso 30 cases, zzso zzso with 54 proteins being significantly different zzso higher, 23 zzso in zzso than in either Bulk or zzso zzso zzso proteins differed significantly between zzso and Bulk blasts zzso zzso 69 zzso zzso expression patterns in zzso and zzso differed markedly from normal zzso zzso zzso were distinct from zzso and Bulk cells by principal component and by protein signaling network analysis which confirmed individual protein zzso Potential zzso zzso in zzso included the proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1, 5 and zzso zzso expression and zzso in zzso differs markedly from other blast populations suggesting that studies of zzso biology should be performed in zzso
