zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare, life-threatening lung disease characterized by zzso of proteins and zzso in the zzso zzso The disease is caused by a functional zzso of zzso zzso which require zzso signaling for terminal differentiation and effective degradation of zzso proteins and zzso zzso options are extremely zzso and the zzso underlying the defective protein degradation in zzso zzso zzso remains poorly zzso 

To further zzso the cellular mechanisms underlying zzso and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies, we here investigated the potential of zzso zzso induced zzso stem cell zzso derived zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso were generated from zzso bone zzso cells of a zzso patient with zzso We assessed zzso zzso integrity, and genetic correction of established zzso zzso On zzso zzso genetically corrected or zzso zzso and zzso were investigated in zzso zzso 

Although zzso and zzso differentiated from zzso zzso exhibited distinct defects in zzso functions, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso after zzso exposure and lack of zzso zzso these defects were fully repaired on zzso gene transfer of a zzso zzso 

These data establish zzso zzso and zzso as a valid in zzso disease model of zzso zzso and introduce zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a potential zzso cell source for innovative therapeutic zzso zzso of such cells to patients with zzso could serve as a zzso proof for the potential of zzso cells in clinical gene zzso
