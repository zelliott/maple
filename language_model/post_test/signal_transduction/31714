zzso zzso zzso are plant secondary zzso that are known for their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Considering that several zzso drugs are currently in cancer clinical trials, we have tested two zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso for their zzso zzso We used the mouse zzso zzso as a model for tumor promotion and cellular zzso Key players that are involved in cellular transformation and zzso are the zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore, we assessed how zzso and Sal A zzso their signaling pathways in zzso 

The effects of zzso and Sal A on the growth of normal and zzso zzso and on the tumor zzso zzso were determined using the zzso zzso zzso cell growth transformation zzso were used to evaluate the zzso promoting properties of these zzso molecules in zzso and dual zzso reporter zzso and western zzso analysis were used to investigate their effects on tumor zzso zzso and zzso activities and protein levels of key zzso and zzso target zzso 

zzso and Sal A selectively inhibited tumor zzso cell growth and transformation of zzso at zzso that do not affect zzso primary zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, both molecules reduced zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso activities, zzso regulated zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso activities, and modulated key players of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

These results highlight the zzso promoting properties of zzso and Sal zzso These zzso molecules isolated from two plant species native to the Middle East may provide opportunities for complementary medicine zzso
