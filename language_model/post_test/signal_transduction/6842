zzso zzso of zzso growth factor receptors zzso contributes to breast cancer growth, zzso and therapeutic zzso Because of the complex nature of the zzso zzso and the numerous effects of zzso zzso on tumor cells and the surrounding zzso the specific mechanisms through which zzso zzso activity contributes to breast cancer are not completely zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso and that blocking zzso synthesis decreases zzso migration, and therapeutic zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of the zzso pathway, which regulates expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Using a novel in zzso model of zzso tumor growth, we demonstrate that zzso zzso decreases both zzso tumor growth and zzso levels within the zzso Finally, our results suggest that zzso therapies zzso both zzso activity and zzso synthesis is more effective than targeting either zzso alone and may be a relevant therapeutic approach for breast zzso associated with high levels of zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies indicate a novel zzso mechanism through which zzso zzso in breast cancer cells zzso a zzso zzso
