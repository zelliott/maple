We and others previously demonstrated that human multiple myeloma zzso cells express zzso and have an active zzso regulatory zzso This study characterizes the growth outcome of soluble zzso or zzso zzso human zzso zzso and its relationship with zzso zzso zzso to the moderate zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the plasma zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso fashion by up to zzso By comparison, zzso zzso cells were resistant to zzso zzso which may be attributable to a single base substitution zzso zzso at the 3rd zzso zzso region of zzso zzso similarly reduced myeloma zzso colony zzso formation in patient primary bone zzso cultures by 50% zzso zzso Studies using zzso L cells that zzso expressed zzso showed that zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso respectively), whereas zzso L cells did zzso Growth zzso by zzso or zzso L cells was neutralized by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso activity of zzso cells, as defined by zzso DNA fragmentation and an increased binding to zzso V zzso All three zzso zzso zzso lines expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only zzso cells responded to the growth zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was not affected significantly by zzso treatment, and growth zzso by zzso was additive to zzso (from zzso to zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso growth zzso process but did not significantly alter zzso growth zzso zzso treatment lowered the expression of zzso factors zzso and zzso by 38% and zzso respectively, whereas zzso levels of zzso and 5 levels remained zzso Our observations indicate that the zzso zzso human zzso cell growth and increases its zzso zzso This growth zzso effect zzso to lower levels of zzso zzso signaling zzso and appears independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may lead to zzso to zzso growth zzso in multiple myeloma zzso
