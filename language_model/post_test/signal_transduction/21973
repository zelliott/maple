zzso and cell zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso for the small zzso zzso 1, was identified as a zzso gene for zzso zzso Here, we reported that zzso zzso with zzso in human zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso activity increased zzso promoter zzso The zzso interaction between zzso and zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso and, zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso the dominant negative form of zzso lacking zzso activity, zzso with zzso increased zzso activity of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso To further rule out zzso as an zzso regulator of zzso activity, we employed the zzso active zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso signaling has no effect on zzso zzso promoter zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to the development of zzso injury through serving as a regulator of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso could play an important role in the development and progression of zzso zzso zzso
