Prior work shows that an attenuated West Nile virus zzso the zzso zzso zzso infection in mice induced strong immune responses and protected host from subsequent lethal zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso infection in zzso differentiation factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and found they had enhanced zzso compared to zzso zzso Both groups had lower zzso zzso response and reduced zzso T cell zzso zzso cells zzso also exhibited a reduced maturation and impaired zzso functions compared to zzso zzso Moreover, infection with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso mice provided full and partial protection respectively from subsequent challenge with lethal zzso zzso There were reduced T cell responses in zzso and zzso zzso deficient zzso mice during secondary challenge with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice displayed normal T cell zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso signaling is required for T cell zzso during zzso zzso infection, whereas the zzso zzso signaling pathways are involved in memory T cell development, which may contribute to host protection during secondary challenge with zzso zzso
