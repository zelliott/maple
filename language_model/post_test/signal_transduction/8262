zzso is a zzso zzso protein located in the terminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role as a buffer of the concentration of free zzso in the zzso zzso serving to maintain the driving force for zzso zzso zzso Essentially all of the functional studies on zzso to date have been carried out on zzso zzso or on disrupted muscle preparations such as terminal zzso zzso To obtain information about zzso properties during zzso zzso zzso release, experiments were carried out on zzso cut skeletal muscle zzso using two optical zzso One - the zzso red method - monitored the content of total zzso in the zzso zzso and the other used the low affinity zzso indicator zzso zzso to monitor the concentration of free zzso in the zzso Both methods relied on a large concentration of the zzso buffer zzso (20 zzso in the latter case to greatly reduce the increase in zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso release thereby almost eliminating the zzso component of the zzso zzso By releasing almost all of the zzso zzso these optical signals provided information about zzso versus zzso as zzso varied from its resting level zzso to near zzso Since almost all of the zzso in the zzso is bound to zzso this information closely resembles the binding curve of the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was found to be cooperative zzso Hill zzso zzso zzso and to have a very high capacity (at the start of zzso release, 23 times more zzso was estimated to initiate from zzso as opposed to the pool of free zzso in the zzso The latter result contrasts with an earlier report that only approximately zzso of released zzso comes from zzso and approximately zzso comes from the free zzso The value of zzso was close to the zzso for zzso which has a value near 1 zzso in in zzso zzso Other evidence indicates that zzso is near 1 zzso in cut zzso These results along with the known rapid zzso of the zzso binding reaction indicate that zzso properties are zzso to buffer zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the results do not entirely rule out a more active role in the zzso zzso process, they do indicate that passive zzso of zzso is a very important function of zzso
