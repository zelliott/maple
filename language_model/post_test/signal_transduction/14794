zzso is caused by zzso zzso which although not formally considered an zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso cells in zzso and in zzso The mechanisms used by zzso zzso to adhere to and invade zzso zzso have not been zzso The zzso networks, involving protein zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso activities, can zzso crucial events during zzso zzso In this study, the involvement of zzso has been investigated in zzso zzso adherence and invasion in zzso zzso zzso A significant zzso of the zzso invasion occurred after the zzso of the zzso cells with zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when the fungus was treated, a slight (not zzso zzso of zzso was observed, suggesting that zzso might not be the zzso zzso signal zzso during the invasion process of zzso zzso An intense zzso zzso labeling was observed in the periphery of the zzso zzso infected cells, little zzso labeling was found in both zzso cells and zzso cells, at later infection times (8 and 24 zzso Moreover, when the zzso cells were treated with zzso and infected with zzso zzso no labeling was observed, suggesting the importance of the zzso in the infectious zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso signal during the initial events of the zzso and invasion processes of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
