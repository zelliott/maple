The aim of the present experiments was to clarify the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso where the same zzso zzso forms a zzso with two different partners zzso or zzso For this purpose, four zzso Ala zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated by replacing single, zzso zzso acids particularly important for zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in zzso cells to yield the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso receptors resulted in a selective blockade of zzso responses in the former combination zzso In contrast, of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso only the latter combination failed to respond to zzso The effects of zzso and zzso were determined by measuring zzso currents by the patch clamp technique and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PAGE confirmed the assembly and surface trafficking of the investigated zzso and zzso combinations in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, both zzso and zzso investigations zzso indicate that one zzso of zzso and two zzso of zzso form zzso zzso zzso whereas two zzso of zzso and one zzso of zzso constitute zzso zzso Further, it was shown that already two binding sites of the three possible ones are sufficient to allow these receptors to react with their zzso
