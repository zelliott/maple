Evidence of a novel zzso having affinity for cholesterol in zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso activity zzso as zzso zzso prompted us to explore its role in zzso zzso regulation of zzso specific LDL zzso gene in human zzso The results of this study revealed that LDL dependent zzso of this zzso zzso was essential for the regulation of zzso specific LDL zzso gene zzso Further, by using various zzso of as well as simulating the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso we were able to show that zzso zzso zzso was involved in the zzso zzso regulation of 160 zzso zzso B specific LDL zzso zzso Based upon these results, we conclude that cholesterol derived from zzso zzso within the cell does not have any role in the zzso regulation of zzso B specific LDL zzso zzso
