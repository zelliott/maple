In tumor cells, zzso in cellular zzso may play a key role in their zzso zzso Using small interfering zzso against zzso we found that the expression of zzso and zzso branching were significantly reduced which was particularly accompanied by the arrest in both cell migration and invasion as compared to the negative zzso Moreover, the suppressed zzso expression by zzso technique zzso the signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and activated zzso levels in cells lacking zzso but revealed no impact on zzso zzso All these notions disclose for the first time that zzso and zzso zzso branching mediate the cell migration and invasion in zzso and zzso regulatory zzso
