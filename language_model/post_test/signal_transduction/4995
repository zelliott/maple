zzso is considered a gatekeeper for zzso cancer zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso have altered expression profiles suggesting that the first zzso hit may help set the stage for subsequent zzso zzso we measured transformation efficiency following what we have designated as zzso versus zzso zzso zzso We combined a conditional zzso zzso zzso with a zzso reporter gene and an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso becomes functional by a zzso zzso in single zzso Loss of one zzso zzso zzso had little consequence, whereas simultaneous loss of both zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso expansion zzso zzso consistent with the gatekeeper function of zzso Interestingly, our analyses showed that most of the zzso zzso in zzso mice appeared normal, with zzso zzso including zzso deregulation, occurring in only zzso of such zzso To determine whether transformation efficiency was different following zzso zzso loss, we combined zzso with a zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso Transformation efficiency following zzso zzso loss zzso or zzso was increased zzso and essentially all of the zzso cells were zzso In zzso our data suggest that the gatekeeper function of zzso consists of two roles, zzso expansion and zzso zzso because simultaneous zzso loss frequently leads to zzso zzso expansion without zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso loss more often results in visible zzso Finally, that zzso cells in certain scenarios can retain a normal zzso is unexpected and may have clinical implications for surveillance strategies to prevent zzso
