To restrict infection by zzso zzso mouse zzso require zzso a member of the zzso zzso domain zzso repeat family of pattern recognition zzso which detect zzso microbial zzso We report that mouse zzso restricted zzso zzso replication and initiated a zzso program of cell death when zzso contaminated their zzso Nuclear zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso were triggered by type IV zzso bacteria that zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso signaling but correlated with zzso function and required zzso 1 zzso The zzso zzso type IV zzso system provided only zzso activity because zzso O of zzso zzso could substitute for its zzso zzso zzso appeared to trigger the zzso response from zzso zzso once heated to zzso zzso zzso triggered cell death but native zzso preparations did zzso zzso made zzso zzso vulnerable to innate immune mechanisms because zzso zzso restricted the growth of virulent zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, after zzso zzso of zzso mice, the yield of zzso zzso in the lungs declined, whereas the burden of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respond to zzso zzso by a mechanism that requires zzso and zzso 1 to restrict bacterial replication and release zzso zzso that control zzso zzso zzso
