zzso is a zzso protein containing a zzso domain zzso and a zzso domain zzso A previous study suggests that zzso interacts with zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso However, the functional relevance of the interaction has not been zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso B zzso zzso induced through zzso was inhibited by a zzso form of zzso but not by that of zzso The zzso of zzso physically zzso with zzso as well as with zzso the familial Mediterranean fever gene zzso zzso zzso rescued mouse zzso from zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso disrupted the interaction between zzso and zzso and inhibited both zzso and zzso B zzso induced by zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a zzso of zzso B zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso signaling zzso
