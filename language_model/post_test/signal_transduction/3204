The zzso complex 1 zzso in zzso is regulated by various stress zzso However, the underlying mechanism is poorly zzso In this study, we show that stresses affect zzso function through zzso a member of zzso family zzso Upon zzso by zzso zzso binds directly to zzso a unique component of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso activity and disruption of its membrane zzso The binding also triggers the release and zzso of the zzso zzso a major zzso of zzso that resides on the zzso zzso and caffeine also induce zzso zzso While the two agents inhibit zzso directly, their effects on zzso signaling are largely dependent on zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso acts both upstream and downstream of zzso zzso unveiling a mechanism that zzso stress and zzso signals to coordinate zzso spatial expansion and zzso mass zzso
