zzso T cell zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colon zzso is not sufficient to cure zzso in a therapeutic zzso To determine whether a cellular vaccine that interacts directly with both zzso and T cells in zzso might be superior, we generated zzso zzso cells zzso with the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso either alone zzso or together with zzso zzso which is known to activate zzso Mice injected with zzso cells displayed only a delay in tumor growth, while the zzso tumor zzso in zzso of zzso zzso rejection required zzso zzso zzso T cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso as shown using zzso and knockout zzso zzso zzso mice primed with zzso cells failed to mount a zzso response, and T cells zzso the zzso tumor were zzso negative, suggesting an impairment in zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso Indeed, zzso T zzso mice failed to mount any zzso activity against the zzso zzso while treatment with zzso zzso to zzso which acts on zzso zzso the requirement for zzso T cells and restored zzso zzso zzso cells cured zzso of mice bearing lung zzso whereas zzso or zzso vaccination cured only 28 and zzso of mice, zzso These results indicate the synergistic activity of zzso and zzso in a therapeutic zzso
