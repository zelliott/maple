Controlling zzso is zzso Growth factors and zzso are key regulators but a full understanding remains zzso zzso electrical potential differences exist within and around the zzso both in relation to blood flow and in situations where active zzso occurs, such as wound healing, development and tumor zzso Recent work shows that electrical stimulation zzso significant zzso in zzso through enhanced vascular zzso growth factor zzso production by muscle zzso We report that applied electric fields zzso of small zzso magnitude directly stimulate zzso production by zzso cells in culture without the presence of any other cell zzso zzso as low as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across an zzso zzso directed the zzso zzso and migration of zzso cells in zzso These zzso responses required zzso zzso zzso and were zzso through zzso and zzso signaling zzso resulting in reorganization of the zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso might play a role in zzso in zzso by stimulating the zzso zzso signaling pathway, to induce key zzso zzso In addition, it raises the feasibility of using applied zzso to initiate and guide zzso through direct effects on zzso zzso
