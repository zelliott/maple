zzso protein zzso is crucial for lung development and differentiation of the pulmonary zzso zzso no lung defects have been observed in zzso mice, although zzso zzso pulmonary genes by binding to virtually identical zzso as zzso Thus, the pulmonary zzso of mice lacking zzso could be explained by functional replacement with zzso We investigated whether zzso and zzso have overlapping functions in regulating lung zzso differentiation during zzso zzso differentiation was assessed in mice with a lung zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso ), zzso zzso ), or both genes zzso ; zzso zzso 

Both zzso mice and zzso ; zzso mice demonstrated severe pulmonary zzso compared to zzso zzso while no differences in lung zzso or zzso differentiation were observed in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso mice, zzso ; zzso mice also displayed zzso Clara cells with markedly impaired protein and zzso expression of Clara cell zzso protein zzso compared to zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso cells were observed in the conducting airways of zzso ; zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso play zzso and partly overlapping roles in determining airway zzso zzso with possible implications for tissue zzso in lung zzso and zzso
