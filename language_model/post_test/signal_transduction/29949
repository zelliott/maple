The nature of the zzso transition state at zero zzso zzso and whether there are hidden zzso are the two major zzso problems in defining the folding zzso of zzso In earlier studies, it was shown that zzso has small zzso values throughout the structure of the zzso suggesting that the transition state has either a defined partially folded secondary structure with all side chains significantly exposed or numerous different partially unfolded structures with similar zzso To distinguish the two possibilities, we studied the effect of zzso zzso on the folding rate of zzso to investigate the secondary structure formation in the transition zzso Two zzso in the same region of a zzso decreased the folding rate by zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting that the secondary structures in this region are zzso formed in the zzso transition zzso We also performed zzso hydrogen exchange experiments on zzso at zzso zzso and 25 degrees C and identified a partially unfolded zzso The structure of the intermediate was investigated using protein engineering and zzso The results suggest that the intermediate has an omega loop zzso This intermediate is more folded than the zzso transition state previously characterized at high zzso zzso zzso zzso it exists after zzso in zzso zzso with this conclusion, the intermediate folds with the same rate and zzso dependence as the zzso zzso but unfolds faster with less dependence on the zzso zzso These and other results in the literature suggest that zzso folds through partially unfolded zzso that exist after the zzso zzso Such folding behavior is similar to those of zzso c and zzso zzso Together, we suggest that other small apparently two-state proteins may also fold through hidden zzso
