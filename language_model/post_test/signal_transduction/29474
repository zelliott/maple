Through T cell receptors zzso T cells can detect and respond to very small numbers of foreign peptides among a huge number of zzso presented by major zzso complexes zzso on the surface of zzso cells zzso How T cells achieve such remarkable sensitivity and specificity through zzso binding is an zzso pursued issue in zzso zzso the key question is how zzso binding zzso or zzso a signal from zzso Multiple competing models have been proposed, none of which fully explains the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso What has been omitted from existing theories is that the zzso interaction at the T zzso interface must be under constant mechanical stress, due to the dynamic nature of zzso zzso Taking this condition into consideration, we propose the zzso deformation model of zzso zzso In this model, zzso signaling is initiated by zzso changes of the zzso complex, induced by a pulling force originating from the zzso and transmitted through zzso binding interactions with enough strength to resist zzso By introducing mechanical force into a model of T cell signal zzso the zzso deformation model provides potential zzso solutions to the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso
