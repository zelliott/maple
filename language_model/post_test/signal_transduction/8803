John Nash showed that within a complex system, individuals are best off if they make the best decision that they can, taking into account the decisions of the other zzso Here, we investigate whether similar principles influence the evolution of signaling networks in zzso zzso Specifically, by analyzing a set of zzso species we observed a striking negative correlation of zzso zzso zzso content with biological complexity (as measured by the number of cell types in each zzso We discuss how this observed zzso loss zzso with the expansion of zzso zzso in the evolution of the zzso lineage and how it may relate to the zzso of signaling systems in zzso zzso We propose that this phenomenon illustrates zzso zzso evolution to accommodate beneficial genetic zzso
