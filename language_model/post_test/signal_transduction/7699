Success of zzso therapy for diabetes will largely depend on the establishment of alternative sources of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso stem zzso cell differentiation toward pancreatic zzso cells offers such perspectives, but there are still many challenges to zzso Our previous studies suggested that the limited amount of zzso cells derived from zzso cells is related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To confirm this hypothesis, we report here that exposure of mouse embryonic zzso zzso to soluble factors from zzso bodies zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso and zzso differentiation as evaluated by zzso size and zzso and protein zzso Sonic zzso zzso an established zzso zzso both at early and late zzso zzso was produced and zzso by zzso and participated in the zzso effect by inducing its target zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso rescued the differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso In contrast to pancreatic cells, zzso zzso exposed to zzso medium showed improved differentiation of zzso zzso In a model system of zzso cell differentiation in zzso we found that definitive zzso induction by serum removal or zzso A treatment further increased zzso production and activity in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso marker zzso was recorded in zzso zzso a phenomenon that was prevented by zzso zzso signaling with zzso interacting zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso production in zzso limits pancreatic fate acquisition and forms a major obstacle in the zzso of pancreatic cells from zzso definitive zzso Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this zzso
