zzso zzso the process zzso our digits are differently zzso is a key aspect of limb zzso It depends on the localized expression in zzso limb bud of Sonic zzso zzso and the zzso potential of its zzso zzso By using an inversion of and a large zzso in the mouse zzso zzso we found that a zzso in the early zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in limb buds led to a loss of zzso zzso zzso gene expression triggered abnormal zzso transcription, which in turn induced symmetrical expression of zzso genes in digits, thereby generating double zzso zzso We conclude that early zzso restriction of zzso gene products sets up an zzso zzso which determines the localized zzso of zzso This signal is subsequently translated into zzso zzso asymmetry by promoting the late expression of zzso zzso two zzso processes relying on opposite zzso zzso upstream and downstream zzso zzso
