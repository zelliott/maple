We have previously shown that the danger signal zzso group box 1 zzso promotes zzso when administered to zzso zzso zzso signals through zzso zzso 4 zzso as well as the zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso However, the actions of these receptors in zzso injury and muscle recovery are not zzso We zzso that zzso mediates tissue recovery and zzso in response to zzso 

zzso artery zzso was performed in control, zzso competent zzso and incompetent zzso mice, as well as zzso knockout mice and their zzso control zzso In other experiments, control mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso before zzso artery zzso After 2 weeks, limb zzso was evaluated using laser zzso zzso imaging and reported as the ratio of blood flow in the zzso to zzso zzso Muscle zzso fat replacement, and vascular density in the anterior zzso muscle were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was evaluated in human zzso zzso zzso cells in response to zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso alone and in the presence of zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a signaling zzso critical to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso as well as defective zzso signaling in zzso mice resulted in prominent muscle necrosis 2 weeks after zzso artery zzso Control zzso mice had less necrosis than zzso incompetent zzso mice, but a greater amount of fat zzso In contrast to control zzso mice, control zzso mice demonstrated prominent muscle zzso with very little zzso Muscle zzso was not dependent on zzso While vascular density did not differ between zzso mice with intact zzso and zzso signaling had less blood flow in zzso limbs compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased in response to zzso while zzso antagonism decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso protect against muscle necrosis after zzso zzso However, muscle zzso does not appear to be tied to vascular zzso zzso likely activates zzso behavior in zzso zzso and this zzso may be modulated by zzso The improvement in blood flow seen in mice with absent zzso and zzso signaling may suggest zzso roles for both zzso or zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso inflammatory zzso
