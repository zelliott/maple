The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily known for its efficient zzso machinery that it zzso to decompose cellulosic zzso Nevertheless, the nature and transmission of the signals initiating and modulating this machinery are largely zzso zzso zzso signaling represents one of the best studied signal zzso pathways in zzso 

Analysis of the regulatory targets of the zzso alpha zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed a carbon source and zzso role in signal zzso zzso of zzso led to significantly decreased biomass formation in darkness in zzso culture but had only minor effects on zzso and zzso zzso extension rates on solid zzso zzso gene zzso was abolished in zzso on cellulose in light and enhanced in zzso However, analysis of strains expressing a zzso activated zzso revealed that zzso does not transmit the essential inducing zzso Instead, it relates a modulating signal with zzso significance, since induction still required the presence of an zzso We show that regulation of zzso and activity of zzso involves a carbon zzso feedback zzso zzso we found a function of zzso in zzso regulation as well as effects on zzso and tolerance of zzso and zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso a signal the zzso relevance of which is dependent on both the carbon source as well as the light zzso The widespread consequences of zzso in zzso indicate a broad function of this zzso zzso in appropriation of zzso resources to environmental (especially zzso zzso
