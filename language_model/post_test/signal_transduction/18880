To characterize the mechanism by which zzso zzso interpret the signals coming from various zzso of diverse zzso zzso and partial zzso acting on zzso zzso we used a fluorescent resonance energy zzso approach to study the effects of these partial zzso on the zzso process of both the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso We show that zzso of different zzso switch the zzso into distinct zzso states, which in turn set the speed and extent of the zzso zzso Thus, in cells the efficacy by which a zzso responds to diverse zzso is caused by the ability of the zzso to differentiate between distinct zzso zzso The data provide a new key characteristic underlying the mechanism of partial zzso at zzso zzso
