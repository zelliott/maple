Forward genetic screens have identified numerous proteins with critical roles in zzso One particularly fruitful screening target in zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso which have revealed proteins acutely required in zzso zzso In the present paper, we review recent insights and current questions from one recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso identifies a putative integral zzso of the zzso plasma membrane that is required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification of this zzso adds to a growing body of evidence that zzso zzso locally control specialized zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways with key functions regulating zzso zzso The zzso protein is absolutely required for zzso C zzso in zzso We zzso that zzso might be required to regulate the availability of zzso lipids such as zzso zzso and zzso that may directly modify membrane properties and/or activate zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso
