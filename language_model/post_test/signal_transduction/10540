zzso of the zzso zzso zzso associate with many zzso proteins that substantially broaden its signaling zzso Although much work has been focused on the signaling of zzso zzso little is known about the role of the zzso zzso We set out to zzso the role of the C zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso By introducing a zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso into cultured zzso from zzso mice, we found that the C zzso was essential for zzso zzso downstream zzso and gene zzso but not for global increases in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso can increase zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso both local and long range, requires zzso through the zzso C zzso Two major zzso zzso zzso differ by the presence or absence of a zzso domain, zzso which is determined by alternative zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of these two zzso showed that removal of this domain significantly reduced the efficacy of zzso gene expression without affecting zzso zzso Thus, the zzso C zzso couples to multiple downstream signaling pathways that can be modulated selectively by zzso zzso
