The mouse zzso stem cell zzso is probably the zzso zzso stem cell in higher zzso Recent studies have shown that the highest zzso potential is most likely contained within an zzso small number of deeply dormant bone zzso zzso These stem cells are housed in individual niches that preserve their dormancy via signaling molecules such as zzso zzso and Stem Cell zzso In response to injury cues, dormant zzso are efficiently activated and produce numerous zzso and mature zzso A series of zzso regulatory molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate the processes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and survival, all of which control the behavior of zzso
