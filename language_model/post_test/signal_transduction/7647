zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents tumor growth and zzso via actions on both tumor and zzso zzso In this paper, we show that vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a target of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso inhibited zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells to zzso triggered zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso across zzso zzso In mice, zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso tumor cell zzso and melanoma zzso to lung zzso without affecting primary tumor zzso As pharmacological zzso or zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso does not alter zzso zzso our experiments identify zzso zzso as a key intermediate between zzso and the regulation of zzso barrier function controlling tumor zzso
