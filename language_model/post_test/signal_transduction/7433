zzso cancer is the deadliest of zzso zzso largely due to the development of drug resistance in zzso zzso may have an essential role in the zzso In this study, we show that zzso is decreased in an zzso cancer drug-resistant cell line and in zzso cancer patients with high levels of zzso repair zzso 1, a marker for zzso Our cell cultural model investigation demonstrates zzso has important roles in the development of drug resistance and cancer cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells greatly zzso cell death zzso in zzso cell death in a drug-resistant cell line and zzso cell death in other tested cell zzso In addition, the surviving cells grow at a much lower rate compared with zzso zzso In zzso studies indicate that forced zzso of zzso in drug-resistant cells greatly zzso the growth of tumors and may partially reverse drug zzso Our investigation of the molecular mechanisms suggests that zzso may repress cancer cells and/or contribute to zzso by modulating the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, and thereafter zzso and zzso signaling zzso Thus, we introduce zzso as a potential target for zzso some zzso tumors and have begun to identify their relevant molecular targets in specific signaling zzso
