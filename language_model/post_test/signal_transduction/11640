Here we investigate the roles of the Bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in development of the zzso which is derived from the first zzso arch zzso Both genes are expressed in the zzso during early zzso outgrowth and later in the zzso zzso Mice zzso for either zzso or zzso have only mild zzso zzso however, zzso of the zzso zzso exhibit a range of zzso zzso zzso from normal to zzso A few zzso zzso zzso for both genes survive to late zzso many are zzso though a few have significant zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso expression of both zzso and zzso consistent with results obtained in zzso with zzso zzso Previous work has shown that zzso is a survival factor for cells zzso the zzso zzso We find that excess zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso lacking these zzso zzso often show a strong reduction in zzso expression in the zzso zzso and increased cell death in the zzso zzso We suggest that the variable zzso zzso in double zzso involves increased zzso activity zzso zzso expression in the zzso decreasing cell survival during zzso zzso
