Parkinson disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder after zzso zzso A subset of genetic forms of Parkinson disease has been attributed to zzso a synaptic protein with remarkable zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that has been identified as a partner of zzso zzso zzso Kaminsky, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dawson, zzso zzso Dawson, zzso zzso and Ross, zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso 22, zzso but its function remains totally zzso We show here for the first time that zzso displays an zzso function in the control of cell zzso We have established transient and stable zzso zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso cells, and we show that both cell systems display lower responsiveness to zzso and zzso Thus, zzso reduces zzso zzso and thereby zzso activity and decreases zzso zzso zzso two main indicators of zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we establish that zzso drastically reduces zzso zzso activity and expression and lowers zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is enhanced by zzso and blocked by zzso zzso zzso we show by zzso zzso that zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso in which a consensus zzso target sequence has been zzso resists zzso by cellular and zzso zzso and displays drastically reduced zzso zzso We further show that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was probably responsible for the zzso zzso zzso by the parent zzso zzso Altogether, our study is the first demonstration that zzso harbors a protective function that is controlled by the zzso zzso generated by its zzso by zzso
