Development of progressive muscle zzso resulting from spinal traumatic injury can be zzso by loss of local zzso zzso and/or by an increased sensory zzso drive with resulting exacerbated zzso zzso To identify potential contributions of zzso substances in the development of such zzso state, we employed a zzso spinal zzso zzso rat zzso Signaling molecules were analyzed in the spinal zzso below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding zzso root zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso The results uncovered the involvement of zzso and zzso pathways together with direct zzso zzso by several hub proteins with zzso zzso At 2 and zzso after zzso zzso of several proteins including zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso was observed in the spinal zzso zzso Our results indicate that these signaling molecules and their zzso zzso systems cannot only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of zzso states after spinal zzso The zzso of specific protein changes observed in zzso spinal zzso but not in zzso root zzso indicates that new treatment strategies should primarily target specific spinal segments to prevent or zzso zzso zzso 

Development of progressive muscle zzso and rigidity represents a serious complication associated with spinal zzso or traumatic zzso Signaling zzso including their zzso status, were analyzed in the spinal zzso below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding zzso root zzso cells in a rat model of spinal injury using zzso zzso zzso The results uncovered direct protein interaction zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso which may significantly contribute to the healing process in the damaged zzso zzso we identified several target proteins exclusively observed in the spinal zzso zzso zzso where such proteins may not only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of zzso states after spinal zzso zzso potential new treatment strategies such as gene zzso or drug treatment should primarily target spinal zzso sites at and around the injury epicenter and most likely employ zzso or targeted spinal zzso zzso or drug zzso We believe that this work will stimulate future zzso research, ultimately leading to the improvement of quality of life of patients with spinal traumatic zzso
