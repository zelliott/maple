zzso zzso produces zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and activates focal zzso zzso zzso in other cell zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso activated zzso in zzso and whether zzso was necessary and/or sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso 48 zzso increased zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso ratios and zzso the assembly of newly zzso zzso into zzso zzso also induced the assembly of focal zzso and zzso as evidenced by increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment rapidly increased zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was also activated by zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso 5 zzso zzso with zzso (5 zzso or zzso (10 zzso completely blocked zzso zzso zzso indicating that protein zzso C zzso was upstream of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was not affected by blocking calcium influx via zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to specifically define the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso stimulation failed to increase total zzso or zzso ratios or to stimulate zzso assembly in zzso infected with zzso However, zzso alone did not increase total zzso or zzso ratios and failed to increase the number or size of zzso as evidenced by double zzso labeling for zzso and zzso Thus, although zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso other zzso signals are also required to elicit the zzso zzso
