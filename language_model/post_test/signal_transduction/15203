The aim was to investigate the signaling mechanisms and regulation of zzso zzso inflammation in rat knee zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso rats were zzso with BK zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso measurement of Evans Blue zzso To examine the signaling pathway, B1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested for zzso of zzso zzso The analyses were compared side-by-side with zzso zzso 

BK zzso zzso induced zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was also inhibited by zzso which could be reversed by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was zzso regulated by zzso and was not antagonized by zzso 

zzso zzso is zzso by B2 receptors and may involve zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso There are differences between zzso and zzso inflammation in signaling and zzso
