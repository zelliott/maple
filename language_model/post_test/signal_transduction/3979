zzso is expressed on a variety of zzso zzso Recently, we have reported that blocking zzso interactions in a zzso model of arthritis resulted in a marked improvement of disease zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso the alpha chain of the beta 2 zzso zzso zzso complex zzso expressed on zzso interacts with zzso Using a zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to zzso zzso and peripheral blood cells isolated from mice as well as the zzso zzso cell line, zzso The interactions between mouse zzso and zzso cells were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso A functional consequence was then demonstrated by inducing an zzso of zzso zzso production following zzso incubation with zzso The addition of zzso fragments generated from the zzso zzso zzso impaired this zzso production by zzso Interestingly, a positive zzso loop was identified as zzso was shown to increase zzso binding to zzso These results demonstrate that similar to findings using human cells, zzso zzso binds to the surface zzso zzso zzso and these interactions regulate biological activities of zzso zzso zzso
