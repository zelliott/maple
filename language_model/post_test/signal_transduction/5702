zzso of zzso gene expression is largely unknown despite that it is widely used as a zzso cell zzso In this study, we showed that zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso primary cultures of rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso This resulted from the direct binding of zzso to zzso rather than indirectly affecting through the binding to zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso In this process, the zzso zzso plays a critical role through two routes; one was the direct zzso zzso of zzso and the other was the zzso zzso of the zzso shedding of zzso The zzso zzso then led to the downstream zzso signaling zzso but not the zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the zzso experiment showed that the zzso factor zzso is critical for the zzso zzso expression in rat zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso attenuated the zzso cell zzso indicating that zzso zzso expression and cell proliferation share the same zzso zzso zzso This study also suggested that zzso may play an important role in cell proliferation induced by the zzso zzso zzso
