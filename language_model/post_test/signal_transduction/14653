The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to signal through a zzso pathway, despite the presence of only a single zzso in their zzso zzso In this study, we show that stimulation of zzso in zzso and in two zzso cell lines is dependent on the zzso motif and on proteins that participate in signaling by zzso zzso zzso motif zzso including zzso zzso and zzso family zzso and on zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso blocks signaling by zzso despite the fact that it has only a single zzso zzso Furthermore, signaling by zzso is only partially dependent on the zzso family of adapter proteins in contrast to that of zzso zzso zzso motif zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso motif preceded by the same four zzso acids as for zzso zzso signals like zzso and also requires the two zzso zzso of zzso and is only partially dependent on the zzso family of zzso In marked contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a distinct series of zzso acids preceding a single zzso signals independent of this zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso sequence of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso directly upstream of the zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso signal through a single zzso motif that requires the tandem zzso zzso of zzso but is only partially dependent on the zzso family of zzso
