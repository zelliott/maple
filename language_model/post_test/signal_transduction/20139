zzso a zzso zzso lowering agent, is commonly used to manage type 2 zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso have not been fully identified, but turnover of zzso such as zzso and zzso pathways or zzso of zzso zzso are closely related to the zzso effects of zzso The zzso of zzso have been investigated in healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso has been performed using an indirect response zzso 

The purpose of this investigation was to develop a population zzso model for zzso using a signal zzso model in healthy humans and predict the zzso profile in patients with type 2 zzso The aim was to compare a previous model (a zzso zzso with the signal zzso model, and use a more appropriate model to follow the actions of zzso Additionally, our developed model was appropriate to predict the time course of plasma zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso in patients with type 2 zzso To our knowledge, this is the first published population zzso analysis using the signal zzso model for zzso zzso To develop a population zzso zzso and zzso zzso model for zzso zzso using the signal zzso model in healthy humans and to predict the zzso profile in patients with type 2 zzso 

Following the oral administration of zzso zzso to healthy humans, plasma zzso of zzso were measured using zzso A sequential zzso approach using zzso VI was used to facilitate data zzso zzso Carlo simulation was performed to predict the zzso effect in patients with type 2 zzso 

zzso healthy humans were included in the zzso zzso mean estimates zzso standard error, zzso of apparent zzso apparent volume of distribution and the zzso rate constant were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso , zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso clearance zzso ) significantly influenced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The signal zzso model was applied to describe the zzso effect of zzso The population means for zzso zzso transit time and the Hill zzso were estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The developed model was used to predict the zzso effect in patients with type 2 zzso The predicted plasma zzso concentration value was similar to previous zzso 

The population signal zzso model was developed and evaluated for zzso use in healthy zzso Model evaluation by zzso zzso analysis suggested that the proposed model was robust and zzso values were estimated with good zzso
