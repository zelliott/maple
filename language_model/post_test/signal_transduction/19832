In order to investigate divergence of immune regulation among zzso species, we have engaged in a study of innate immune function in F1 hybrids of zzso zzso and zzso zzso If pathways have zzso between the species such that zzso have arisen between interacting components of the immune network, we expect the hybrids to display zzso of immune zzso We have zzso gene induction in hybrid and parental flies in response to bacterial zzso These results show that although the hybrids do not suffer widespread immune breakdown, they show significantly different regulation of many immune genes relative to the zzso We examine this divergence in terms of zzso and expression differences among zzso observing distinct patterns of zzso among functional groups within the pathways of the innate immune zzso The functional groups most sensitive to zzso in the hybrids are the downstream components of the network, indicative of some propagation of zzso throughout the immune zzso Interestingly, this zzso does not appear to associate with zzso differences in bacterial load after infection in hybrids, possibly highlighting some zzso of function of the innate immune response to zzso like zzso
