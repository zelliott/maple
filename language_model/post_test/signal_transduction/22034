The zzso barrier zzso comprises the zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso which are connected by the zzso zzso zzso Current zzso models focus solely on the zzso zzso cells which constitute a physical barrier by formation of tight junctions zzso while the impact of zzso on barrier regulation is poorly zzso We established a zzso model from primary zzso brain zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso to approach the in zzso zzso This model allows the examination of zzso impact on zzso zzso migration, and zzso activity of the zzso In zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso cells is partly controlled by the zzso which is remodeled by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso which are important not only for zzso zzso but also for zzso zzso In this chapter, current methods to study the interactions of these cell types by zzso signaling as well as zzso zzso are zzso
