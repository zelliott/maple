Little is known about the ability of zzso surfaces to influence cell responses in zzso Many studies have demonstrated that zzso surfaces influence cell responses in zzso zzso which bind specifically short zzso zzso are responsible for these cell zzso In this way, information can be transmitted to the nucleus through several zzso signaling zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate new bone formation in a porous titanium zzso fiber mesh zzso which was coated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso implants were inserted into the zzso of a rabbit and were compared with porous titanium fiber mesh disks without zzso sequence zzso and with an open control zzso zzso and zzso examinations were performed 2, 4, and 8 weeks zzso A significant increase in bone formation, or bone zzso was seen in the zzso group compared with the zzso group after 4 and 8 zzso All control defects stayed open in all three zzso It was concluded that the use of zzso zzso zzso in combination with titanium fiber mesh has a positive effect on bone formation in zzso in a rabbit animal zzso
