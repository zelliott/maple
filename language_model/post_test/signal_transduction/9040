zzso is known to have negative effects on de zzso zzso root zzso However, the regulatory mechanisms of root initiation by both zzso and zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we characterized a rice zzso termed crown zzso zzso which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root zzso The expression of zzso which encodes a member of the large zzso zzso factor family zzso was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso expression without de zzso protein zzso which also required the degradation of zzso zzso A putative zzso response element in the zzso promoter region specifically zzso with a rice zzso demonstrating that zzso may be a direct target of an zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso that also regulates crown root zzso A zzso double zzso displayed an additive zzso indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root zzso In addition, zzso showed a zzso zzso for crown root zzso and also zzso the expression of two negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso in zzso zzso plants that zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso background produced a higher number of crown roots than the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso promotes crown root initiation through repression of zzso signaling by positively regulating zzso zzso zzso
