zzso development proceeds under strict zzso control and an embryonic molecular clock zzso evidenced by zzso gene zzso is operating during zzso formation and limb development, providing zzso information to precursor zzso In zzso precursor cells, zzso gene expression and zzso depends on zzso acid zzso signaling and this zzso is also essential for limb zzso outgrowth and zzso Since the limb zzso gene zzso is zzso expressed along the zzso axis as growth zzso zzso with changes in zzso zzso activity in the zzso we have interrogated the role of zzso signaling on limb zzso expression zzso We describe zzso as a positive regulator of limb zzso zzso zzso supplementation of zzso induced zzso in a short time period, with simultaneous transient zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further found that zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso However, joint treatment with both zzso and zzso induced zzso indicating that zzso is creating a zzso condition for zzso action on zzso most likely by enhancing zzso zzso Finally, we observed an zzso action of zzso on zzso and propose a model zzso zzso shapes limb zzso expression during limb development, by zzso its expression and zzso the zzso action of zzso on zzso Overall, our work reports a novel role for zzso in the regulation of limb clock zzso gene expression and zzso the zzso response of multiple zzso pathways to zzso signaling in limb zzso
