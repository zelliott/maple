Distribution of the zzso channel of zzso type was investigated in the central nervous system zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso were found widely distributed in the zzso present mostly in smaller groups in the different central zzso but not in the visceral zzso zzso fibers were characteristic for not only the zzso of all zzso but also the zzso tissue sheath around the zzso and the zzso wall were richly zzso Western zzso analysis revealed a clear identity with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting an evolutionary zzso structure of this channel zzso Our preliminary results provide a steady basis for further experiments aiming partly at the identification of other zzso channel types and partly the zzso zzso of zzso
