zzso formation along the zzso zzso axis of the developing zzso wing depends on zzso zzso a member of the zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a stripe along the zzso compartment boundary of the wing zzso disc and forms a long-range concentration zzso with zzso properties which generates distinct cell fates along the zzso zzso We have monitored zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso wing zzso discs which develop severe pattern defects specifically along the zzso wing zzso The results show that the size of the zzso expression domain is expanded in zzso wing zzso However, this expansion did not result in a zzso expansion of the functional range of zzso activity but rather its reduction as indicated by the reduced expression domain of the zzso target gene zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso a cellular process necessary for membrane recycling and zzso trafficking, zzso in zzso action during wing zzso zzso interaction studies suggest a link between the zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso does not interfere with the reception of the zzso signal or the zzso processing of the mediation of the signal in the zzso cells, but rather affects the zzso and/or the distribution of zzso in the developing wing zzso
