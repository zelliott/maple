In the central and peripheral nervous systems a zzso group of proteins zzso the zzso zzso provides a cue for zzso zzso They either contain or are devoid of the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso which trigger in zzso their zzso activity have remained zzso In this study, we reconsider the problem of whether sequences present in the zzso type 1 repeats zzso and independent of the well-known zzso site, may activate zzso and account for their zzso zzso zzso is a newly identified member of the zzso zzso which shows a zzso organization with a great number of zzso motifs but no zzso zzso Previous research has implicated zzso derived from zzso zzso in zzso development of various zzso cell zzso In this study, we investigate whether zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso can block these effects in cell line zzso cloned from a zzso of the rat central nervous zzso By two different zzso flow zzso revealing short-term effects and cell cultures revealing long-term effects, we show that: zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso changes in cell size and structure, and zzso zzso activity induced by zzso zzso are inhibited by zzso zzso to zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso directed against various zzso zzso we show that the zzso might be the partner of the zzso in zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate that an original sequence within a zzso motif from zzso promotes zzso outgrowth through an zzso signal driven by zzso independently of an zzso zzso
