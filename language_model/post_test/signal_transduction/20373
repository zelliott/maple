zzso regulation of gene expression contributes to the protein output of a cell, however, methods for measuring zzso regulation in complex in zzso systems are zzso Here, we describe a sensitive method for measuring zzso regulation in defined cell populations from zzso tissue in zzso We adapted the translating zzso affinity zzso zzso methodology to measure the relative occupancy of individual zzso transcripts in translating zzso in the zzso tumor cell population in a genetically engineered mouse model zzso of zzso Global measurement of paired zzso and total cellular zzso populations from tumor cells in zzso identified a broad distribution of relative zzso zzso amongst zzso species that was highly zzso across biological zzso zzso of the translation state of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso cells in normal brain identified global zzso of translation in zzso and specifically of genes involved in cell division and synthetic zzso Furthermore, investigation of zzso in steady state zzso efficiencies upon loss of zzso one of the most frequently zzso and deleted tumor zzso in zzso identified differential translation of proteins involved in cellular zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso and cellular zzso profiles, deregulation of which is known to be associated with tumor zzso Application of the translation efficiency profiling method described here to other biological contexts and conditions would extend our knowledge of the scope and impact of this important mode of gene regulation in complex in zzso zzso
