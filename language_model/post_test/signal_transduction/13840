zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two principal groups of zzso zzso zzso evidence supports that there are zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso However, a molecular mechanism for direct signaling zzso between zzso and zzso was not revealed until zzso Works from three different groups demonstrated that an interaction between zzso and zzso two groups of key zzso regulators from the zzso and zzso signaling zzso respectively, mediates the direct signaling zzso between zzso and zzso in controlling cell zzso in zzso It was shown that zzso proteins not only affect the protein stability but also inhibit the zzso activity of zzso Thus, zzso promote cell zzso at least in part, through releasing zzso zzso of zzso This review aims to introduce these recent advances in our understanding of how zzso and zzso coordinate to regulate plant growth and development at the molecular zzso
