We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso contraction is diminished in the zzso rat heart, in part due to zzso in protein zzso C zzso zzso Since chronic exercise training zzso can exert independent effects on increasing zzso contraction in the adult rat heart, we sought to determine whether age-related defects in zzso contraction could be reversed by chronic zzso We further hypothesized that improved zzso contraction by zzso may be zzso zzso Adult (4 zzso zzso and aged (24 zzso zzso male zzso rats were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at approximately zzso of zzso for 12 weeks or remained sedentary zzso zzso zzso zzso Training status was verified by zzso zzso zzso activity and left zzso zzso zzso responses zzso to zzso stimulation were assessed in zzso hearts using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso greater increases in zzso zzso in hearts isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso abolished zzso effects zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon western zzso zzso zzso directed at zzso zzso revealed greater levels in zzso isolated from zzso versus zzso and zzso ameliorated zzso reductions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were also greater in zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso levels observed in zzso were attenuated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also associated with significant reductions in zzso zzso levels following zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that age-related reductions in zzso contraction can be partially reversed by zzso in the rat zzso These results further suggest that zzso in zzso levels zzso at least in part, zzso improvements in zzso zzso
