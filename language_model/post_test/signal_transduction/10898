The zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso involved in the synthesis and release of zzso zzso and in the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has a zzso effect on zzso zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso cell line as a model to characterize the zzso signaling pathways and to investigate whether this zzso interacts with the zzso zzso We found that IGF-1 activated the zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways were only zzso activated by zzso In contrast, zzso strongly zzso the zzso pathways but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso with IGF-1 and zzso had various effects on these signaling zzso 1) It strongly increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso 2) It had an additive effect on zzso zzso without zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso 3) It strongly reduced IGF-1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle analysis revealed that, in addition to having an additive effect on zzso zzso zzso with IGF-1 and zzso also had an additive effect on cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso by IGF-1 was completely blocked by zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and by a dominant negative form of zzso Finally, we showed that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a marked reduction in Bad zzso and a substantial decrease in the ability of IGF-1 to rescue zzso cells from zzso induced by serum zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that several interactions take place between IGF-1 and zzso receptors in zzso zzso
