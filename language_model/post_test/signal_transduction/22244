zzso zzso zzso zzso are important immune receptors expressed widely in zzso A unique feature of zzso is their ability to bind zzso zzso and transmit signals to immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso form a major zzso of the zzso containing a large, rapidly evolving group of genes that expanded in zzso through an inverse zzso event involving a primordial cluster of zzso genes over 180 million years zzso zzso express a much larger set of zzso than mice and rats, a feature that can be explained by a dramatic loss of zzso genes in zzso Most zzso have immune zzso zzso zzso motifs and signal zzso Interestingly, novel zzso zzso zzso have been identified, such as zzso and zzso which are paired with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The evolution of these zzso receptors may have been driven in part by pathogen exploitation of zzso zzso thereby providing the host with additional pathways by which to combat these zzso zzso zzso seem to play important and varied roles in the regulation of host immune zzso For example, several zzso have been implicated in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso during innate zzso zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso expansion and appears to suppress inflammatory responses to zzso zzso molecular zzso Recent work has also shown that engagement of zzso zzso by certain strains of zzso Group B zzso can suppress killing responses, thereby providing experimental support for pathogen exploitation of host zzso
