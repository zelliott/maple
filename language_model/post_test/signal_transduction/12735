zzso zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso is governed by the activity of a zzso factor zzso zzso factor 4 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso are expressed in zzso and are components of such a zzso However, the relationship among them in the regulation of zzso proliferation remains zzso Here, we investigated the mechanisms zzso zzso mediates the growth zzso effects in zzso through zzso alpha and zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso directly binds to the zzso regulatory region of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling in cultured zzso induced by the synthetic zzso zzso Of particular interest, zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta expression while blocking zzso and zzso signaling induced by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso formation depend largely on zzso zzso signaling without involvement of the zzso zzso signaling zzso These findings provide a novel mechanism for signal suppression and growth zzso effects of zzso in zzso Moreover, the results of this study suggest that zzso is one of the key zzso of zzso actions in zzso
