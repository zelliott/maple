Cell zzso is regulated by zzso cues and by zzso factors that accumulate at sites of contact between cells and the zzso zzso One of these factors, focal zzso zzso zzso regulates the cycle of focal zzso formation and zzso that is required for cell movement to zzso Recently, zzso signaling has also been implicated in the control of cell movement in zzso but the mechanism through which zzso proteins influence zzso is zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for cell movement and zzso regulation during zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C are also zzso The zzso cell zzso zzso is distinct from both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso polarity zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso through regulation of focal zzso
