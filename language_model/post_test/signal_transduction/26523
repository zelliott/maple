zzso zzso promotes the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells in part via the zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso also known as zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed, which indirectly zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human breast cancer cell zzso In this study, we investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso upon this molecular zzso using tumor cells and zzso derived from spontaneous zzso tumors of female zzso transgenic zzso zzso were zzso and cultured as small tumor chunks zzso zzso or were cultured in zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso in tumor zzso but had no effect on primary tumor zzso cells grown in zzso zzso zzso of mouse or human tumor zzso cell lines with zzso restored the zzso zzso response to zzso similar to that observed in mouse tumor zzso The addition of zzso as expected, induced zzso in both the tumor chunk and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was absent when zzso were physically separated from mouse tumor zzso cells using a zzso system, or when zzso were replaced with normal zzso in direct zzso with human or mouse tumor zzso zzso In zzso zzso reduced zzso levels in primary zzso tumors of mice in a zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso play a critical role in bridging the zzso between zzso and zzso in both mouse and human models of breast zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor zzso cells with zzso
