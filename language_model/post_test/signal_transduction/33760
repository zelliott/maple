In the past few years, the investigation of many cell death features, especially ones associated with changes in zzso have gained an important insights with the development of high-resolution zzso zzso With the use of real time real space zzso it was possible to perform dynamic studies not only to investigate the location of the zzso but also to follow changes in transport zzso such as zzso concentration in different zzso zzso In addition, this technique has been used for the simultaneous tracking of zzso location, zzso zzso and zzso which clearly contributed to further understanding mechanisms related to the control of cell zzso This chapter describes the methodology employed to study changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso It also details the new technique developed and employed in our laboratory to measure zzso signaling in brain slices by zzso zzso This method has been applied to investigate real time real space studies in different models of neurodegenerative zzso such as zzso disease and zzso
