A zzso zzso in the heart zzso by zzso or mechanically induced membrane stretch is the slow component of delayed zzso zzso current (I zzso I zzso zzso is recognized as a factor promoting appearance of zzso zzso zzso since zzso zzso of the channel genes have been detected in zzso zzso Mechanical stretch activates zzso II type 1 zzso zzso in the absence of its zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the functional role of zzso zzso in I zzso enhancement in zzso challenged guinea pig zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso exposed to zzso solution with zzso decreased to zzso of the zzso level, I zzso was enhanced by zzso the duration of action potential at zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso and resting membrane potential was zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects on I zzso and zzso were significantly attenuated by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 and 5 zzso zzso of zzso zzso with protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed but the presence of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso stimulation of I zzso The above results zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso I zzso and suggest acute zzso properties of zzso zzso in the settings of zzso zzso zzso
