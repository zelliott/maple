zzso interact with zzso zzso initiating signaling zzso that promote cell growth while zzso the pathways of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that has been shown to regulate zzso zzso signaling and zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and deletion zzso were expressed in cells using a zzso zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso molecules was shown to selectively block zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways and the zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into DNA without a significant effect on the activity of the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the depletion of zzso by zzso interference induced cell zzso In addition, zzso was also required as a downstream zzso of zzso cell zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso selectively blocked the zzso of zzso induced by the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays an essential and selective role in both zzso and zzso cell proliferation and highlight a new function for zzso in zzso zzso
