During early embryonic development, many zzso interactions between zzso depend on signal zzso zzso We began to test the possibility that zzso participate in the signal zzso pathways that mediate neural zzso The expression during zzso development of three G alpha zzso G alpha 0, G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso was zzso The three zzso expressed genes showed different expression patterns during early zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that all three genes were expressed almost exclusively in the zzso zzso and predominantly in the zzso in the zzso zzso In order to investigate the involvement of these proteins in neural zzso we zzso the zzso alpha zzso by injecting the G alpha zzso into zzso zzso zzso of G alpha zzso increased the ability of zzso zzso to become induced to neural tissue approximately zzso zzso of G alpha 0 and G alpha zzso had less pronounced effects on neural zzso and zzso of the G alpha 0 and G alpha zzso proteins by zzso toxin did not change the neural competence of the exposed zzso zzso zzso of the G alpha 0 and G alpha zzso genes did, however, inhibit the normal disappearance of the zzso during zzso suggesting a role for these zzso in regulating this zzso The data also suggest a specific role for the G alpha s zzso in zzso the initial zzso of neural zzso
