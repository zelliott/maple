In zzso zzso cells undergoing zzso a zzso zzso zzso is located on the zzso pole body that enters the daughter cell and activates a signal zzso pathway, zzso to allow zzso zzso zzso zzso must be reversed after zzso exit to reset the cell cycle in zzso We find that daughter cells activate an zzso of zzso zzso zzso in part through induction of the zzso protein that binds directly to zzso and prevents its association with its target zzso zzso Failure of zzso function results in defects of both the zzso assembly and nuclear orientation checkpoints and delays turning off zzso in zzso Thus, zzso is part of a zzso switch that helps cells exit from zzso exit and reset the cell zzso
