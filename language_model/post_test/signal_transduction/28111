zzso underlying the divergent effects of zzso hormones on zzso death induced by zzso were investigated in differentiated zzso cells zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso or a combination of both hormones for zzso h before treatment with zzso zzso zzso to induce cell zzso zzso undergoing zzso were identified by a terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell sorting after 18 zzso Cell death induced by zzso was decreased zzso after E treatment and increased zzso after P treatment compared with cells treated with zzso zzso Treatment with E for 24 h before zzso exposure was required for maximum zzso whereas zzso death was zzso after a zzso P zzso zzso induced a zzso increased activity of zzso zzso zzso 1 in d zzso cells within 20 zzso that could be increased zzso to zzso by P together with zzso A zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso P enhancement of zzso zzso death but had only a minimal effect on cell death by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced death induced by zzso alone but was much less effective for zzso P alone did not activate zzso E increased zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso expression and all but abolished zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso P decreased zzso and zzso expression and doubled zzso zzso These data suggest that P regulates zzso or survival through zzso of zzso signaling and altered zzso zzso whereas E mainly affects the expression of zzso zzso and zzso
