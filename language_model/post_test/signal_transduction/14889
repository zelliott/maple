zzso gene expression in zzso zzso is controlled by regulators such as the accessory gene regulator zzso zzso can be divided into four major zzso groups zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to define the proportion of zzso I, II, and III zzso and to compare the clinical characteristics between group I and zzso I zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains in a Korean zzso care teaching zzso 

A total of 158 clinical zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso length zzso 

The mean age of the patients was zzso zzso zzso years zzso There were 74 zzso 66 zzso 10 zzso 7 zzso and 1 zzso strains in zzso group I, II, III, I + II, and I + III zzso zzso Only ear infections were a statistically significant clinical zzso according to zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso group I is the most prevalent in Korea, and ear infections are correlated with the group I zzso which is a different clinical trend from western zzso It can also be zzso that zzso zzso zzso with zzso group zzso
