Regulators of G protein signaling zzso proteins are a family with more than 30 proteins that all contain an zzso zzso In the past decade, increasing evidence has indicated that zzso proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of G protein zzso receptors zzso G zzso and calcium signaling during cell zzso migration, and differentiation in a variety of zzso In bone, those proteins zzso bone development and zzso by influencing various signaling pathways such as zzso protein zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso This review summarizes the recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of zzso gene zzso as well as the functions and mechanisms of zzso zzso especially in regulating zzso protein zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso signaling and zzso signaling during bone development and zzso This review also highlights the regulation of different zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso The knowledge from the recent advances of zzso study summarized in the review would provide the insights into new therapies for bone zzso
