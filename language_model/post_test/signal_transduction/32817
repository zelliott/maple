The ability of cells to adapt to environmental stresses zzso a progressive reduction during zzso zzso signaling is a major defensive system against various environmental zzso The aim of this study was to find out whether zzso zzso affects the response of the zzso signaling zzso to zzso light in human zzso and zzso zzso The exposure of early passage zzso to zzso light inhibited the proliferation and induced a flat zzso similar to that observed in zzso zzso zzso not exposed to zzso zzso The zzso radiation dose used zzso zzso did not induce zzso in either early or late passage zzso zzso zzso exposure induced a prominent zzso of the zzso signaling zzso both in early and in late passage zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the response to zzso light was significantly attenuated in late passage zzso This zzso was most prominent in DNA binding activities of nuclear zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso was also observed in the DNA binding activities of nuclear zzso and zzso factors after zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed an increase in nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso components of zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the specific zzso complexes contain zzso and zzso protein components but not zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a marked decrease at protein level but an increase in zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso plasmids carrying zzso sites of the zzso promoter were used to analyze the functional activity of the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso exposure induced an increase in zzso zzso expression both in early and in late passage zzso though the response was significantly stronger in early passage zzso Our results show that the induction of zzso signaling by zzso light is highly attenuated in zzso zzso This zzso may reduce the stress resistance during cellular zzso
