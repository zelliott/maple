The zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso a zzso isolated from the bark of zzso zzso were investigated using human zzso cancer zzso zzso 1 exhibited zzso effects in zzso colon cancer cells, accompanied by zzso of the zzso cell signaling zzso This substance was found also to inhibit zzso factor zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and zzso colon cancer zzso Further zzso investigations in human colon cancer cells with zzso activated zzso signaling showed that 1 significantly suppressed the binding of zzso complexes to their specific zzso targets in the nucleus and led to the zzso of zzso target genes such as zzso and zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso model, the zzso administration of 1 (10 or 20 zzso body weight, three zzso for four weeks suppressed tumor growth in zzso nude mice implanted with zzso colon cancer cells significantly, without any apparent zzso In an ex zzso zzso analysis of the tumors, compound 1 was also found to suppress zzso target genes associated with tumor growth including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The suppression of the zzso signaling zzso is a plausible mechanism of action underlying the zzso and zzso activity of 1 in human zzso cancer zzso
