zzso belongs to the family of zzso factor zzso zzso which play an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso locomotor activity, and zzso has an zzso zzso Here, we document the regional and zzso zzso of zzso in the developing rat zzso to compare it with zzso During the first zzso week, zzso zzso zzso within the white matter and zzso cortex, was strongest in zzso zzso I, II, IX, and X, closely followed by zzso IV, zzso and zzso zzso VI and zzso showed the weakest zzso zzso zzso was in the form of zzso that zzso zzso cell zzso By zzso day zzso 12, zzso had increased appreciably in all zzso In zzso cells, labeling was spread throughout their zzso and zzso zzso By zzso 15, labeling in zzso zzso appeared to zzso yet still prevailed in the central and zzso zzso This zzso zzso persisted through to zzso The study shows that zzso and zzso have similar regional distribution profiles during development, suggesting synergistic roles within the zzso The onset of the adult zzso pattern of zzso at the stage when rats are capable of fluent walking patterns further strengthens the correlation between zzso peptides and zzso zzso An important difference between zzso and zzso is the zzso of zzso and not zzso within zzso cells, zzso that zzso probably has an additional role in modulating the signals emanating from the zzso zzso to the deep zzso zzso
