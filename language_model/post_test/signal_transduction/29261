Food zzso and hedonic value play central roles in zzso zzso However, zzso effects can influence food preferences independently of zzso although the zzso bases of such mechanisms remain poorly zzso Of central interest is whether the same brain reward zzso that is responsive to palatable rewards also encodes zzso value independently of taste zzso Here we show that zzso mice, which lack the cellular machinery required for sweet taste zzso can develop a robust preference for zzso solutions based solely on caloric zzso zzso intake induced zzso release in the zzso zzso of these zzso mice, a pattern usually associated with zzso of palatable zzso Furthermore, single zzso in this same zzso zzso region showed increased sensitivity to caloric intake even in the absence of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso nutrients can directly influence brain reward circuits that control food intake independently of zzso or functional taste zzso
