Low temperature zzso the expression of many plant genes through undefined signaling zzso To gain insight into cold signal zzso mechanisms, we isolated zzso zzso that exhibited altered regulation of low zzso gene zzso One such zzso zzso was shown previously to have an enhanced induction of zzso genes by cold, whereas the expression of these genes under zzso stress or the zzso zzso acid zzso treatments was not zzso Here we further define the targets of zzso by examining the regulation of upstream zzso zzso zzso factor zzso It was found that the transcript levels of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso plants than in the wild type under cold treatments, suggesting that zzso may act upstream of zzso The zzso gene was cloned using a zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso is identical to the zzso gene that we had described zzso zzso is a general negative regulator that controls cold, zzso stress, and zzso signal zzso and possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso rendered the zzso zzso protein completely inactive in the cold but did not substantially affect its activity at warm zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso protein is extremely tolerant to zzso This study provides a unique example of a single zzso acid substitution in a critical regulator that can lead to conditional changes in protein functions and distinct plant zzso The results reinforce the notion that zzso are important second zzso in cold signal zzso and shed light on how the diversity of plant tolerance to cold and other zzso stresses may evolve due to variations in a common molecular zzso
