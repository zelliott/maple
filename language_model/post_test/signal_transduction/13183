zzso zzso of Ras zzso is a zzso protein that positively regulates Ras signaling and may function as a scaffold for zzso zzso and zzso However, the precise role of zzso is not well zzso and some observations have suggested that zzso might act in a parallel zzso In zzso zzso zzso is only required for a specific zzso process zzso zzso zzso and is a zzso positive regulator of other zzso zzso zzso We report the existence of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is required for zzso signaling during zzso zzso progression and functions zzso with zzso during development of the zzso system, zzso zzso and male zzso Thus, while the zzso and zzso genes are individually required only for specific zzso zzso together these two genes appear necessary for most aspects of zzso signaling in zzso zzso The finding that zzso zzso double zzso have strong zzso zzso and severely reduced or absent levels of zzso zzso zzso strongly supports models where zzso acts to promote the zzso or maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso
