To understand how the skeletal muscle lineage is induced during zzso zzso we have sought to identify the regulatory molecules that mediate induction of the zzso regulatory factors zzso and zzso In this work, we demonstrate that either signals from the zzso zzso or zzso and Sonic zzso signals can induce zzso expression of the paired box zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso with expression of zzso and prior to that of zzso Moreover, infection of embryonic zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to induce expression of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and lateral plate zzso in the absence of inducing zzso as well as in the neural zzso Together, these findings imply that zzso may mediate zzso of zzso and zzso in response to zzso signals from either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and identify zzso as a key regulator of zzso zzso
