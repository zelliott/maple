Adult beta cells have a diminished ability to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to understand the role of zzso and zzso zzso in the maintenance of beta cells zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model that permitted us to induce zzso deletion by treatment with tamoxifen in mature zzso We evaluated zzso mass and function as well as beta cell proliferation in 3- and zzso mice treated with tamoxifen zzso zzso vs mice treated with vehicle zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in juvenile zzso beta cells significantly induced their proliferation and increased zzso zzso The expansion of zzso mass occurred zzso with the enhanced ability of the zzso mice to maintain zzso in response to zzso zzso In older mice zzso of age), deletion of zzso similarly increased zzso mass and beta cell zzso This novel finding suggests that zzso mechanisms may override the zzso diminished ability of beta cells to respond to zzso zzso We also found that proteins regulating zzso zzso transition, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were altered when zzso was lost, suggesting that they may play a role in zzso beta cell proliferation in adult zzso 

The signals regulated by the zzso zzso are important for zzso maintenance of beta cells and regulation of their proliferation in adult zzso
