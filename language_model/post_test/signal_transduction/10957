Taste zzso are zzso zzso that serve to house and distribute the taste buds and their renewing cell populations in specific locations on the zzso We previously showed that Sonic zzso zzso has a major role in regulating the number and spatial pattern of zzso taste zzso on embryonic rat zzso during a specific period of zzso formation from the zzso zzso Now we have zzso the zzso protein and the zzso zzso protein zzso and have tested potential roles for zzso in formation of the zzso emergence of zzso zzso development of zzso number and size, and maintenance of zzso after zzso is zzso zzso of entire embryonic zzso or tongues from zzso days 12 to 18 zzso or embryonic days zzso were used, in which tongues and zzso develop with native zzso zzso and molecular zzso The zzso signaling zzso was disrupted with addition of zzso zzso or the zzso blocking zzso zzso and zzso proteins are diffuse in zzso tissue and early tongue zzso and are progressively restricted to zzso zzso and then to regions of developing zzso zzso zzso the dense zzso zzso in zzso at various zzso When the zzso signal is disrupted in cultures of zzso zzso tongue formation is completely zzso At later stages of tongue culture zzso zzso signal disruption alters development of tongue shape zzso and results in a zzso zzso zzso distribution that does not respect normally zzso tongue regions zzso Only a few hours of zzso signal disruption can zzso alter number and location of zzso zzso on anterior tongue and elicit zzso formation on the zzso zzso However, once zzso are well formed zzso zzso apparently does not have a clear role in zzso zzso nor does the tongue retain competency to add zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data not only provide evidence for zzso and zzso roles for zzso in tongue and zzso zzso formation, but also suggest that zzso functions to maintain the zzso space and zzso zzso zzso We propose a model for zzso function at high concentration to form and maintain zzso and, at low zzso to activate zzso genes that maintain a zzso zzso
