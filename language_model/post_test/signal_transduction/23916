zzso between zzso zzso cells is a crucial and tightly controlled zzso In the gastrointestinal zzso the integrity of zzso contacts is essential for the regulation of zzso zzso and for the prevention of zzso zzso We recently showed that migration of the gastric zzso cell line zzso is zzso by the zzso form of the hormone zzso Here, we examine the effect on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the concentration of which is increased in the plasma of patients with zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of both tight junction zzso and zzso junction zzso complexes in zzso zzso In zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells, expression of an zzso zzso construct restored membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This restoration was reversed by treatment with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also increased the zzso flux of zzso and induced cell migration of several gastrointestinal cell zzso In addition, zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso activity and induced a spatial zzso of protein zzso C zzso Using zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso we showed that the stimulation of zzso zzso activity was essential for the regulation of zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso involved zzso zzso partly through the formation of a complex with protein zzso C zzso We conclude that separate pathways mediate the disruption of zzso and zzso by zzso Either zzso may contribute to the zzso role of this zzso in zzso zzso
