zzso zzso is a zzso which specifically regulates differentiation and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso both differentiation and growth zzso zzso stimulation of these cells leads to zzso of zzso and/or translation of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso followed by the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that expression and zzso of the zzso zzso regulates zzso gene expression and might play a role in determining a cell lineage in zzso and that zzso and zzso may exert their effects after zzso binds to its zzso It was further found that zzso receptors composed of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 2 or zzso 3 receptors could also induce zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Taking these data together with previous zzso we conclude that interaction of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with other membrane components is essential for transmission of both the zzso differentiation and the growth zzso
