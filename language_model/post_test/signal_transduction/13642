zzso breast cancer zzso is the most lethal form of breast cancer, but the basis for its aggressive properties are not fully zzso In this study, we report that high zzso expression of zzso zzso a functionally undefined membrane zzso zzso shorter survival in patients with zzso zzso depletion decreased zzso cell zzso migration, and invasion in zzso and inhibited tumor growth of zzso cells in zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso by zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso indicating that zzso regulates invasion of zzso cells by supporting the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso with these results, treatment of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso decreased their zzso properties in zzso Finally, zzso expression correlated positively with zzso expression in primary human zzso zzso Our findings establish that zzso positively zzso the zzso properties of zzso by supporting zzso function, advancing understanding of its development and zzso zzso and zzso as promising therapeutic targets in zzso zzso
