zzso oxide zzso production during zzso stimulation in outer hair cells zzso of the guinea pig zzso was investigated using the NO sensitive dye zzso zzso measurement of the cell length and NO production showed rapid zzso cell swelling to zzso NO production in zzso zzso stimulation failed to induce NO production in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso NO zzso inhibitor and zzso a zzso channel blocker inhibited the zzso zzso NO production whereas zzso a zzso zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso a NO donor inhibited the zzso zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso enhanced zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso potential zzso 4 zzso an zzso and zzso channel was expressed in the zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso a zzso synthetic zzso induced NO production in zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulation can induce NO production by the zzso increase, which is presumably zzso by the zzso of zzso in zzso NO zzso zzso the zzso response via the zzso zzso by a feedback zzso
