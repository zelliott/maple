Bone tumors strongly influence normal zzso and stimulate bone cells for the production of zzso supporting proliferation and abnormal survival in cancer zzso We previously reported that the zzso zzso controls the activity of various zzso and growth factors and also zzso zzso and response to zzso agents in zzso cell zzso Here, we show that zzso has a stronger tumor zzso activity in zzso We identify zzso as a target gene zzso by zzso in cells and in zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression in zzso cells depends on zzso a zzso of the tumor progression in zzso zzso zzso alters zzso zzso and zzso pathways that are zzso signals downstream of zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is expressed in human bone tumors and zzso A high expression of zzso was specially found in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso levels in primary tumors were zzso related to the response to zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso and was found to be expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso zzso cells as compared to responsive zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in decreased zzso increased spontaneous zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso and also zzso in responsive and resistant zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso exerts its zzso function through zzso of the zzso signaling and through zzso of zzso a protective factor that contributes to abnormal cell zzso Thus, this study identifies zzso as a new possible therapeutic target in zzso zzso
