zzso growth zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso differentiation and the zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, the combined effects of these regulators on the zzso differentiation of zzso cells remains zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso and/or zzso on the zzso differentiation of human zzso stem cells zzso The zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, a bone zzso zzso line, was markedly enhanced by zzso although zzso alone did not induce zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso differentiation induced by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso completely suppressed the zzso differentiation zzso induced by zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso only partially suppressed this zzso These results suggest that the enhancement of zzso zzso differentiation by zzso zzso signaling depends on zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso positively zzso the zzso zzso differentiation of zzso through synergistic zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
