zzso zzso factor zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, is a zzso zzso that plays important roles in embryonic development and zzso Recent findings show that zzso is zzso after zzso activity however, the link between zzso and zzso remains poorly zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso we employed a zzso system to specifically delete zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso mouse zzso In the kindling model of zzso conditional zzso knockout zzso mice exhibited dramatically accelerated seizure progression and prolonged zzso duration compared with control zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mossy fiber zzso was enhanced in the zzso zzso The degree of zzso of zzso growth factor 14 and zzso zzso factor zzso following zzso zzso status zzso was significantly increased in the zzso of zzso mice compared with control zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso was associated by zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso These findings indicate that zzso functions as an intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso
