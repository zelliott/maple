Many of the cognitive deficits of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired executive zzso involve prefrontal zzso zzso zzso The zzso guides zzso and thought using working memory, which are essential functions in the information zzso Many zzso zzso hold information in working memory through zzso networks that can maintain persistent zzso firing in the absence of external zzso This fragile process is highly dependent on the zzso zzso For example, elevated zzso zzso reduces persistent firing by opening zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal zzso alter the zzso properties of zzso zzso during working memory, as there have been no in zzso recordings, to our knowledge, from zzso zzso of aged zzso Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing a marked loss of zzso persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by restoring an optimal zzso zzso zzso showed an age-related decline in the firing rate of zzso zzso whereas the firing of zzso zzso remained unchanged with zzso The zzso firing of aged zzso zzso was partially restored to more youthful levels by zzso zzso zzso or by blocking zzso or zzso zzso These findings reveal the cellular basis of age-related cognitive decline in zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of zzso zzso
