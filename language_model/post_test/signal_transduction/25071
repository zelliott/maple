The present study deals with the functional interaction of antipsychotic drugs and zzso zzso We show that both the conventional antipsychotic drug zzso and the zzso antipsychotic drug zzso mediate gene expression via zzso regulation of zzso zzso albeit to different zzso Data obtained in primary zzso culture demonstrate that the zzso signal zzso zzso activated by haloperidol, the zzso pathway, leads to zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso treatment is likewise shown to increase zzso zzso in rats in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso which prevents zzso at both sites, zzso zzso gene zzso We conclude that antipsychotic drugs have the ability to zzso zzso zzso function by an zzso signal zzso zzso This zzso of zzso activity is necessary for antipsychotic zzso gene expression and may contribute to the therapeutic benefits as well as side effects of antipsychotic drug zzso
