zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are common in cancer and include deletions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10), zzso of zzso and zzso in two distinct regions of the zzso zzso This suggests drugs targeting zzso and zzso in particular, might be useful in treating zzso zzso zzso of zzso is effective in preventing growth factor zzso and zzso growth, but suitable zzso of zzso have not been available to study the effects of zzso this zzso zzso In the present study we characterize a novel small zzso zzso showing the zzso to be a highly specific and selective zzso zzso Using molecular zzso and zzso studies, we explain the basis of this zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso we show that insulin zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso is attenuated by the additive effects of zzso zzso in all cell lines zzso However, zzso of zzso alone was sufficient to block insulin zzso to zzso in certain cell zzso The responsive cell lines all zzso zzso zzso in zzso and have high levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This may explain the increased sensitivity of these cells to zzso zzso We assessed the zzso of zzso and zzso growth in zzso models and found that zzso derived from two of the responsive cell lines were also responsive to zzso in zzso These results show that zzso of zzso alone has the potential to block growth factor zzso and reduce growth in a subset of zzso
