As described zzso zzso zzso of G zzso receptors may influence zzso trafficking, and regulation in zzso Up to now, most studies aiming at the possible role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and signal zzso are focused on class A zzso In the present work, the zzso behavior of the zzso factor zzso type 1 zzso which belongs to class B of zzso and plays an important role in coordination of the immune response, stress, and learning behavior, was investigated by using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso For this purpose, we generated fusion proteins of zzso zzso at their zzso to a zzso or yellow fluorescent zzso which can be used as a zzso zzso zzso studies verified that the zzso zzso were able to bind their natural zzso in a manner comparable with the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso proved the functionality of the zzso In microscopic studies, a zzso of the zzso was observed, but the addition of either zzso zzso or zzso did not show any zzso increase of the observed zzso zzso indicating that the zzso ratio is not changed on addition of zzso
