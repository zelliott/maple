zzso are widely used to suppress inflammation and treat various zzso zzso Some zzso zzso zzso genes mediate the therapeutic response, whereas others cause debilitating side zzso To discover selective zzso of the zzso response, we developed a zzso zzso system to monitor regulation of 4 promoters zzso An initial screen of zzso natural products and Food and Drug zzso drugs identified zzso that caused zzso to regulate only a subset of its target zzso Some compounds selectively inhibited zzso gene zzso without altering the repression of zzso expression by zzso This approach will facilitate identification of genes and small molecules that augment beneficial effects of zzso and diminish deleterious zzso Our results have important implications for the development of zzso zzso and the identification of zzso pathways that control selective zzso gene zzso
