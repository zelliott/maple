zzso zzso acid zzso zzso receptors mediate the majority of zzso signaling in the zzso and the functional properties and zzso fate of these receptors depend on zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly is thought to occur in the zzso zzso zzso although we are just beginning to understand the underlying zzso Here we examine the trafficking of zzso zzso zzso receptors through the zzso Our data indicate that zzso require signaling by the unfolded protein response zzso to move zzso zzso and zzso zzso out of the zzso and through the zzso zzso In contrast, other zzso zzso proteins do not require zzso signaling for zzso zzso The requirement for the zzso zzso is cell type and age zzso impairment for zzso trafficking increases as animals age and does not occur in all zzso zzso of zzso a component of the zzso pathway, is elevated in zzso during zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling is a critical step in neural function that is needed for zzso zzso assembly and zzso
