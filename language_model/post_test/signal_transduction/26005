zzso zzso has been implicated in prostate zzso in human subjects and mouse models, but its effects on transforming normal zzso cells toward zzso cancer stem cells remain poorly zzso 

We produced zzso mice that zzso zzso protein persistently in adult zzso allowing for zzso of the mechanism during prostate cancer initiation and zzso Various markers were used to characterize and confirm the transformation of normal prostate zzso cells into zzso cancer stem cells under the influence of zzso zzso 

The zzso mice developed zzso zzso zzso zzso that led to invasive and zzso prostate zzso within 90 zzso The prostate cancer was initiated through zzso of zzso zzso cells along with simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso members, suggesting that zzso and zzso cells may serve as zzso cells and progress into zzso prostate cancer stem cells zzso In the zzso zzso and tumors, the progeny of zzso differentiated into cells of zzso and zzso zzso whereas rare zzso neuroendocrine differentiation was zzso Furthermore, in the zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso formed zzso zzso structures, characteristic of the primitive structures during early prostate zzso Besides, zzso zzso zzso expression was detected zzso during tumor zzso The existence of zzso zzso and zzso progeny indicates direct procurement of zzso zzso cancer zzso 

These data support a cancer stem cell scenario in which zzso zzso plays important roles in transforming normal prostate zzso cells into zzso and in the progression of zzso into zzso tumor zzso
