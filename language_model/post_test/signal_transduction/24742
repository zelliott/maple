A number of diverse signaling pathways can be activated by zzso coupled zzso However, the factors involved in selection of a particular zzso zzso by a single zzso are not well zzso We are attempting to address this issue utilizing the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a representative model zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the cellular response zzso by an alpha zzso zzso is zzso and thus depends on its zzso zzso zzso to zzso was determined following stable expression of the rat alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso in three functionally distinct cell types zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells, and the zzso cell line zzso When the zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increases in cellular zzso However, in zzso zzso the same zzso zzso actually increases zzso zzso and zzso the effect of zzso zzso of the zzso effect in zzso cells is insensitive to zzso toxin but is blocked by loading the cells with zzso zzso zzso which zzso changes in zzso by calcium zzso These data and the functional demonstration of a zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso cells, suggests that the zzso effects of zzso are due to zzso zzso to both different zzso and types of zzso
