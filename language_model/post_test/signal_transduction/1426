The proliferation of human peripheral and zzso B cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso suppressed the zzso proliferation of peripheral blood B cells but had no effect on the proliferation of zzso zzso B cells zzso zzso When zzso B cells were separated according to their sizes, the zzso proliferation of small zzso B cells was inhibited by the zzso zzso whereas large zzso B cells were zzso In contrast, zzso proliferation of human B cells was always significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso regardless of cell size and tissue zzso The zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso initial rise in zzso zzso and the zzso cell cycle transition of small zzso B zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso resulted in the resistance to the zzso zzso effect on proliferation of peripheral blood B cells and the majority of zzso B zzso In contrast, B cell proliferation zzso with zzso zzso B cell growth factors were always suppressed by the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that certain zzso signal mechanisms zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell growth factors are different in that B cells zzso with these agents differ in their sensitivity to the zzso zzso Moreover, both the zzso state of human B cells and the nature of zzso signals given determine their response to the zzso signals delivered by the zzso zzso
