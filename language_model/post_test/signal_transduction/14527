We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell nuclear zzso zzso markers of zzso to zzso zzso in an in zzso blood vessel model by zzso zzso zzso In this report, we further examined what role zzso plays and how it is activated during zzso zzso First, in order to confirm that zzso can indeed induce zzso the cells were treated with zzso a zzso zzso during zzso The zzso treatment induced zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in a very short time, which indicated that zzso zzso alone was sufficient to trigger zzso in zzso zzso We then observed zzso changes in zzso signals, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to occur prior to zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso On the other hand, zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso during zzso It was also shown that the amount of zzso protein slightly decreased by either zzso or zzso zzso We then investigated how these two survival signals, zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso by using zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso When zzso zzso were treated with zzso or zzso during zzso the two zzso were able to induce zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in a relatively short zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso but had almost no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso but had very little effect on zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso rather than zzso decrease, is responsible for zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results strongly suggest that zzso zzso is regulated through signal zzso in which zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso which then triggers zzso cascade as an execution mechanism of zzso
