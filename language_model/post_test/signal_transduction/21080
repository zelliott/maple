Using zzso zzso we have previously shown that the response of natural killer zzso cells to zzso zzso is subject to zzso regulation downstream of zzso binding and zzso We have now used the zzso cell line, zzso to study zzso regulation of zzso cells further, and found that zzso cells neither incorporated zzso nor completed the zzso phase transition in medium lacking the zzso compounds, zzso and zzso despite the presence of sufficient zzso zzso deprivation did not alter the induction of DNA zzso activated sequence zzso activity in response to zzso However, the zzso gene product zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso within 24 hours after zzso stimulation in standard zzso but its expression and zzso were reduced in zzso medium in both zzso cells and freshly isolated zzso zzso These reductions were not associated with an increased level of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso agents, zzso reduced zzso or zzso restored both RB zzso and DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso were prematurely increased by zzso zzso This enhancement was associated with zzso zzso and prolonged zzso and could be observed before and beyond zzso zzso The data suggest the possibility that the premature and prolonged enhancement of zzso activity in zzso zzso cells is associated with, and therefore may contribute to, the reduced expression and zzso of zzso and the associated cell cycle zzso
