The zzso (a zzso and zzso comprise a large family of zzso proteins with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso supports cell attachment using zzso as a primary cell surface zzso that subsequently triggers zzso zzso cell zzso stress fiber zzso and focal zzso zzso This process contrasts with cell zzso on zzso which is zzso but zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso signaling leading to cell spreading and stress fiber zzso We demonstrate that zzso when present in significant zzso promotes zzso zzso cell spreading and stress fiber formation in response to zzso A zzso form of zzso deficient in protein zzso C zzso zzso or a different member of the zzso family, zzso was unable to promote cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso completely inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso resulted in the zzso of activated zzso zzso at the cell periphery in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells as revealed by zzso zzso Further, expression of zzso zzso active zzso resulted in zzso zzso cell zzso but additional zzso of zzso was required to induce stress fiber zzso In zzso these data provide novel insights into zzso zzso zzso can promote cell spreading in a zzso zzso fashion through zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso likely function in separate zzso
