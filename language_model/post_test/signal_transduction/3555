During cell migration, local zzso events are regulated by zzso and physical processes that are in turn coordinated with the dynamic properties of zzso zzso zzso In this chapter, we present a modeling approach for zzso the apparent zzso and spatial dependence of signal zzso pathways that promote zzso in tandem with zzso zzso We describe our modeling zzso as well as its zzso zzso and validation against experimental zzso zzso techniques for identifying and evaluating the effects of model zzso on simulation simulation results are zzso and implications of this analysis for understanding cell zzso behavior are zzso
