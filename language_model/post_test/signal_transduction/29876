Signaling by zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates a variety of complex cellular functions and in case of deregulation can contribute to zzso zzso A tight and finely tuned control of zzso activity is therefore critical for the zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso a member of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso signaling is highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso but not that of the closely related zzso On the other hand, suppression of zzso zzso expression increased the zzso state of zzso In addition, zzso was able to interfere with downstream signaling events by zzso the zzso of the zzso protein zzso and reducing zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by the finding that zzso is zzso with zzso in breast cancer cells, we suggest that zzso is an important regulator of zzso activity and thus the first zzso zzso shown to be involved in zzso signal zzso
