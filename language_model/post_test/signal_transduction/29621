The transforming growth zzso zzso zzso controls a plethora of biological responses, and zzso in its zzso zzso are associated with a range of human diseases, including zzso zzso zzso zzso signal through a zzso complex of zzso zzso receptors that zzso the signal to the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso degradation zzso is an evolutionary zzso cascade that tightly regulates zzso zzso zzso Both the size of the zzso pool in zzso cells and zzso protein levels subsequent to the zzso of the zzso are controlled by zzso zzso zzso are components of the zzso complex that specifically recognize targeted proteins and the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso The zzso are of particular importance to zzso zzso as zzso also function as adapters that recruit the zzso to various zzso components including the zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso and thereby regulate the degradation of these zzso zzso Thus, by controlling the level of zzso as well as positive and negative regulators of the pathway, zzso provide for complex and fine control of zzso zzso Finally, growing evidence demonstrates that zzso and zzso degradation is also implicated in the turnover of zzso zzso zzso and may thus contribute to disease zzso
