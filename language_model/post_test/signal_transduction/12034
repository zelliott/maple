To investigate the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the liver of zzso fatty liver disease zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso cells zzso in the development of NASH zzso zzso and understand the zzso mechanism of zzso 

Five zzso mice fed with normal diet were served as controls, while zzso fed with high fat, high zzso high fat combined zzso diet respectively for 16 weeks were as zzso mice zzso The liver inflammation and zzso damage were zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the content of zzso in the liver were also zzso 

zzso intake of high fat and zzso zzso solution caused a significant increase in zzso zzso in animals in comparison to water zzso Liver zzso and zzso were significantly higher in high fat and high fat combined zzso diet fed mice than that in controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso protein were higher in high fat diet treated mice than those in zzso and high fat combined zzso groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were only altered in zzso or high fat combined zzso animals zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

High fat and zzso diet may induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and signal zzso proteins were zzso and they may play key roles in the initiation and progression of zzso
