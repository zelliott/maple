Miniature is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso of zzso wing zzso in zzso Here, we show that Miniature also plays an important role in the zzso wing maturation processes triggered by the zzso zzso Wing expansion and zzso zzso are drastically delayed in miniature zzso zzso and zzso up upon zzso of the protein in zzso Miniature acts upstream from the zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso signal in wing zzso We propose that Miniature interacts with zzso and regulates its diffusion through or stability within the wing zzso
