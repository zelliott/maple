The plant zzso syndrome zzso in many molecular and zzso aspects, plant responses to zzso zzso Both processes have an enormous negative global zzso impact and endanger food security zzso zzso plant zzso is the main cause of losses in grain filling and biomass yield due to leaf zzso and deteriorated photosynthesis, and is also responsible for the losses resulting from the short shelf life of many vegetables and zzso Under zzso stress conditions the yield losses are often even zzso The primary challenge in agricultural sciences today is to develop technologies that will increase food production and zzso of agriculture especially under environmentally limiting zzso In this chapter, some of the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso plant zzso are zzso Recent studies have shown that crop yield and nutritional values can be altered as well as plant stress tolerance through manipulating the timing of zzso It is often difficult to separate the effects of zzso zzso from zzso zzso since both share many zzso processes and ultimately result in plant zzso The focus of this review is on zzso zzso zzso Here, a number of the major approaches that have been developed to zzso some of the effects of zzso zzso plant zzso are considered and zzso Some approaches mimic the mechanisms already used by some plants and soil bacteria whereas others are based on development of new improved transgenic zzso While there may not be one simple strategy that can effectively decrease all losses of crop yield that zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso plant zzso some of the strategies that are discussed already show great zzso
