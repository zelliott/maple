Members of the zzso (a zzso and zzso family are involved in zzso and tissue formation via their zzso function, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed temporally and zzso in the developing chicken spinal cord, but its function remains zzso In the present study, we address this question by zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso into the developing chicken spinal zzso as well as by in zzso cell culture zzso Our results show that zzso of zzso drives precocious differentiation of neural zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, resulting in an increase of zzso in the developing spinal cord, even in the prospective zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso mimics the zzso as found by the zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso experiments on cultured cells demonstrate that zzso of zzso decreases the amount of the zzso zzso part of zzso zzso and its target, and increases the number of zzso cells during neural zzso cell zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso possibly via its zzso effect on the zzso signaling during development of the spinal zzso
