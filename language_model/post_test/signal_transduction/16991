zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso the innate immune response after severe traumatic zzso however, the cellular zzso response to traumatic condition is still largely zzso 

We applied zzso shotgun zzso to perform comparative zzso profiling of human zzso from severe trauma patients and healthy zzso 

A total of 197 out of zzso proteins zzso identified with at least two zzso were observed with significant abundance changes following the zzso The zzso data were further compared with zzso data for the same genes obtained from an independent patient zzso The comparison showed that the protein abundance changes for the majority of proteins were consistent with the zzso abundance changes in terms of directions of zzso Moreover, increased protein zzso was suggested as one of the mechanisms contributing to the observed zzso between protein and zzso abundance zzso zzso analyses of the altered proteins showed that many of these proteins were involved in immune response, protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso stress response, the zzso system, and zzso zzso 

Our data suggest increased zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso in response to zzso The study not only reveals an overall picture of functional zzso response to trauma at the zzso level, but also provides a rich zzso data resource of zzso changes in the zzso that will be valuable for further studies of the functions of individual proteins in zzso
