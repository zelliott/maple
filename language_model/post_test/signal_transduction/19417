Systems biology modeling of signal zzso pathways traditionally employs ordinary differential zzso deterministic models based on the assumptions of spatial zzso However, this can be a poor approximation for certain aspects of signal zzso especially its initial steps: the cell membrane exhibits significant spatial organization, with diffusion rates approximately two orders of magnitude slower than those in the zzso Thus, to unravel the complexities of signaling zzso quantitative models must consider spatial organization as an important feature of cell zzso Furthermore, spatial separation limits the number of molecules that can physically zzso requiring zzso simulation methods that account for individual zzso zzso we discuss the need for mathematical models and experiments that appreciate the importance of spatial organization in the zzso
