The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a number of zzso important proteins during infection, tissue damage, and/or stress, in part through the zzso of the zzso factor zzso Signal zzso is initiated at the cell membrane by complex formation between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso type I zzso and zzso accessory protein zzso The zzso signaling cascade involves recruitment of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the adapter protein zzso events which are dependent on the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso In mouse liver, zzso is expressed as a soluble protein zzso the function of which is zzso We have cloned the human zzso and established by sequence analysis that the human zzso zzso arises from alternative zzso of the zzso gene zzso here to zzso 12 zzso spanning more than 56 zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that human zzso zzso cells express both zzso and zzso and that signal zzso in these cells is zzso through zzso zzso and zzso We show that zzso zzso induce a change in the zzso zzso pattern such that zzso zzso becomes the dominant zzso zzso of a zzso fusion protein of zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso with zzso zzso restores the capacity of the cells to respond to zzso This suggests that zzso may act as an inhibitor of zzso by directly interacting with zzso to abolish its capacity to zzso zzso
