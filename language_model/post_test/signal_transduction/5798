The zzso II zzso type 1 zzso zzso is a zzso G zzso zzso and is involved in regulating the zzso and pathological process of the cardiovascular zzso zzso and locally generated zzso has zzso action on zzso zzso but recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso inherently shows spontaneous activity even in the absence of zzso Furthermore, mechanical stress can activate zzso zzso by inducing zzso switch without the involvement of zzso and induce cardiac zzso in zzso These zzso activities of zzso zzso can be inhibited by inverse zzso but not by neutral zzso zzso attention has been directed to molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of zzso zzso zzso zzso and inverse zzso activity emerges as an important pharmacological zzso for zzso zzso zzso that will improve efficacy and expand therapeutic zzso in cardiovascular zzso
