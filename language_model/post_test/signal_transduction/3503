Despite 35 years of clinical trials, there is little improvement in zzso survival rates for patients with zzso melanoma, and the disease is essentially zzso if not cured zzso The paucity of zzso agents that are effective for treating zzso melanoma indicates a dire need to develop new zzso Here, we found a previously zzso role for zzso and zzso in melanoma zzso We demonstrate that the zzso activities of zzso and zzso are elevated in primary zzso zzso in a subset of benign zzso zzso and in some human melanoma cell zzso Using zzso and pharmacological approaches, we show that zzso zzso is functionally relevant because it is zzso melanoma cell zzso survival and zzso zzso we identify the mechanism by which activated zzso promotes melanoma invasion by showing that it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and using rescue approaches we demonstrate that zzso promotes invasion through a zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we show that zzso and zzso are not merely zzso as active zzso drives invasion in a zzso manner, and zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso Most importantly, zzso and zzso not only promote in zzso processes important for melanoma zzso but also promote zzso in zzso as zzso of zzso zzso activity with the zzso zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso in a mouse zzso Taken together, these data identify zzso and zzso as critical, novel, drug targets in zzso melanoma, and indicate that zzso may be useful in preventing zzso in patients with zzso harboring active zzso and zzso
