zzso transgenic zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso blue light zzso exhibit features that are normally associated only with zzso zzso indicating that the signaling mechanism of zzso zzso is zzso through zzso The zzso properties zzso by zzso are remarkably similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso 1 zzso and its zzso domain zzso zzso strongly with the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was bound to zzso in extracts from both zzso and zzso zzso An interaction also was observed between the zzso domain of zzso zzso B and zzso suggesting that zzso signaling also zzso at least in part, through direct interaction with zzso These findings give new insight into the initial step in light signaling in zzso providing a molecular link between the blue light zzso zzso and zzso a negative regulator of zzso
