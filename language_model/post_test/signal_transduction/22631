zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso have been associated with the inherited cancer syndromes zzso 2A and zzso zzso They have also further been associated with both familial and sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso through the formation of zzso zzso We have recently reported that a zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso originally coding for zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso This zzso is increased with respect to the frequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This finding specifically correlated to the clinic behavior of the corresponding zzso which was characterized by an unusually aggressive progression with both multiple and zzso zzso By examining the possibility that this deletion acts in a manner similar to zzso zzso we have zzso the molecular mechanism by which this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deleted zzso zzso were detected in zzso separated under zzso zzso Like other zzso point zzso this 6 zzso deletion affecting two zzso acid zzso between two adjacent zzso is capable of zzso the transforming ability of zzso by promoting zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso to zzso zzso position or pairing is capable of inducing zzso independent zzso Furthermore, we present data demonstrating that the processing and sorting of the zzso membrane zzso to the cell surface is affected by zzso zzso
