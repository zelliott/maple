zzso is a founding member of a zzso family of 7 proteins and zzso zzso It is involved in cellular resistance to stress, zzso zzso aging, and tumor zzso zzso mice demonstrate embryonic and zzso development zzso We examined zzso and zzso cell differentiation of zzso mouse embryonic stem cells zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formed fewer mature blast cell zzso zzso zzso blast zzso cells demonstrated defective zzso zzso zzso cell production was zzso but there were defects in formation of a primitive vascular network from zzso zzso zzso Development of primitive and definitive zzso derived from zzso zzso were also delayed and/or zzso zzso zzso were associated with delayed capacity to switch off zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and reduced zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso rescued zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fewer primitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso adult zzso had decreased numbers and cycling of zzso zzso effects more apparent at zzso than at zzso oxygen tension, and these zzso survived less well in zzso under conditions of delayed growth factor zzso This suggests a role for zzso in zzso differentiation and mouse zzso
