zzso protein zzso zzso may be associated with the zzso of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to clarify the role of zzso expression and zzso during cerebral zzso and to evaluate the therapeutic effect on cerebral zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sense zzso or scrambled zzso was injected into the rats zzso We used a zzso experimental zzso model to assess zzso in the zzso arteries at 30 minutes, 1 day, and 2 days after zzso by zzso area measurement and other zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were used to zzso zzso expression and zzso In addition, a zzso rat zzso model was used to test the effect of zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso therapy significantly inhibited cerebral zzso when compared with sense zzso or scrambled zzso treatment on day zzso The zzso and Western zzso performed in the zzso artery of rats that received zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on day zzso In zzso treatment study, zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso artery and attenuated cerebral zzso 

zzso zzso but not zzso might be implicated with sustained smooth muscle contraction during cerebral zzso after zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso zzso strategy is an effective treatment against cerebral zzso
