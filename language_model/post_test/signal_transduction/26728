zzso deletion syndrome zzso is the most common zzso syndrome in humans, characterized by cardiovascular defects such as interrupted zzso arch, zzso tract zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso the mouse zzso of the candidate zzso zzso results in mild defects dependent on genetic background, whereas complete zzso results in severe zzso in multiple zzso 

The loss of function of two zzso zzso which zzso feedback zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso many defects associated with zzso in the zzso The zzso reduction of zzso gene dosage resulted in different zzso emerging at specific steps, suggesting that the threshold up to which a given zzso process can tolerate increased zzso signaling is zzso zzso zzso significantly exacerbated the severity of all these zzso which correlated with a substantial increase in zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso functions as an essential component of a mechanism that protects the zzso against zzso in zzso signaling that may lead to zzso defects characteristic of zzso We propose that genetic factors that enhance zzso signaling ought to be considered as potential genetic zzso of this zzso
