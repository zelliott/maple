zzso cell zzso receptors represent a family of zzso proteins expressed on the surface of human zzso zzso zzso of class I zzso by killer cell zzso receptors turns off the zzso machinery of zzso zzso This zzso interaction results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express surface receptors of an unrelated family of type II zzso zzso zzso that have similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso zzso zzso However, zzso functions as an zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso This zzso of function between zzso family members suggested different signaling events upon zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that: 1) in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso following zzso zzso whereas zzso is not; 2) zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso 3) zzso zzso with zzso and zzso following zzso zzso and 4) zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors depends on zzso zzso restricted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data further support the involvement of zzso zzso zzso motifs as crucial sequences regulating zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso
