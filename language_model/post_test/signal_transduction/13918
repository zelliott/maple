The role of zzso in the recovery of spinal zzso injury remains zzso in particular, the mechanism of zzso regulated degradation of zzso proteins has not been discussed to zzso In this study, we investigated the protective role of basic zzso growth factor zzso both in zzso and in zzso and demonstrated that excessive zzso and zzso protein zzso is involved in the rat model of zzso zzso administration improved recovery and increased the survival of zzso in spinal zzso zzso in the rat zzso The protective effect of zzso is related to the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso treatment also enhances clearance of zzso proteins by zzso which also increases the survival of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the downstream signals of the zzso zzso by zzso treatment was detected both in zzso and in zzso Combination therapy including the zzso zzso zzso partially abolished the protective effect of zzso The present study illustrates that the role of zzso in zzso recovery is related to the zzso of excessive zzso and enhancement of zzso protein clearance via the zzso of zzso zzso Overall, our study suggests a new trend for zzso drug development for central nervous system injuries and sheds light on protein signaling involved in zzso zzso
