Members of the zzso family can promote signals in zzso cells and both positively and zzso regulate the production of zzso zzso depending on the target zzso cell zzso Using the zzso hybrid system, we identified zzso protein zzso zzso as a binding partner for zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso associated and zzso with zzso in a mouse zzso cell line and zzso of zzso with zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso also blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso expressions induced by zzso in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso by stable zzso zzso zzso zzso also abolished zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso These findings identify a novel zzso that bridges zzso family zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
