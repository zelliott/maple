A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso zzso putative zzso was obtained by a zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso regions of zzso A zzso protein coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso composed from zzso and zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da and an zzso point of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso overall identities with the zzso from other zzso Among them, zzso from zzso zzso revealed the highest identity to zzso zzso zzso The percentage identities of the entire proteins and the zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso is more zzso related to the zzso of higher zzso than to those of lower zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain transformed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that expression of zzso zzso zzso suppressed the growth zzso caused by the zzso disruption in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain was also suppressed by the expression of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in the zzso from the zzso sensitive zzso zzso strain transformed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an absolute zzso dependence which was similar to zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso M zzso and the zzso activity at 1-2 zzso zzso M zzso
