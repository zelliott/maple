Triple negative breast cancer zzso is a type of aggressive breast cancer lacking the expression of zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso patients account for approximately zzso of total breast cancer patients and are more prevalent among young zzso African-American and Latino women zzso The currently available zzso and zzso therapies are not effective for treating zzso Recent studies have revealed a number of novel features of zzso In the present work, we zzso addressed these features and discussed potential therapeutic approaches based on these features for zzso with particular focus on: 1) the pathological features of zzso breast zzso 2) zzso signaling zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso 4) interactions of zzso with breast cancer 1/2 zzso 5) zzso zzso and related zzso 6) altered zzso signatures and suppression of zzso zzso by zzso 7) altered expression of several zzso and tumor zzso zzso and 8) zzso effects caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso better insights into these molecular pathways in zzso may lead to identification of novel zzso and targets for development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of zzso
