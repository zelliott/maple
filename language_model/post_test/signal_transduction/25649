zzso abnormalities exist in heart failure and contribute to disease zzso zzso of the carotid zzso zzso zzso has been shown to reduce sympathetic zzso and augment zzso zzso zzso This study tested the hypothesis that long-term electric zzso of the zzso improves left zzso zzso function and zzso progressive zzso zzso in dogs with advanced chronic heart zzso 

Studies were performed in 14 dogs with coronary zzso heart failure zzso ejection fraction zzso Eight dogs were chronically zzso for bilateral zzso zzso using the zzso System zzso zzso Minneapolis, zzso and 6 were not and served as zzso All dogs were followed for 3 months, and none received other background zzso During zzso treatment with zzso increased zzso ejection fraction zzso compared with a reduction in control dogs of zzso zzso Similarly, treatment with zzso decreased zzso zzso volume zzso zzso compared with an increase in control dogs of zzso zzso zzso Compared with control, zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso pressure and circulating plasma zzso zzso expression of cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso and reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In dogs with advanced heart failure, zzso zzso improves global zzso function and partially reverses zzso zzso both globally and at cellular and molecular zzso
