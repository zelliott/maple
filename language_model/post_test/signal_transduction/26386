zzso is very common in patients suffering from infections or chronic inflammation and can add substantially to the morbidity of the underlying zzso It is zzso by excessive production of the zzso zzso zzso but the signaling zzso responsible for zzso zzso in the inflammatory context is still not understood zzso In the present study, we show that zzso B has an unexpected but crucial role in the induction of zzso by zzso There is a dramatic induction of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso of mice challenged with zzso slightly preceding an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B also zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells and, zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso an observation confirmed in mouse primary zzso zzso with a bone zzso protein type I zzso inhibitor showed that the effect of zzso B on zzso expression is entirely attributable to its effect on bone zzso protein zzso most likely via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B is therefore a novel and specific target for the treatment of anemia of zzso
