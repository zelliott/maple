zzso a disease caused with gram negative bacteria zzso zzso produces heavy losses in zzso zzso against zzso reduces mortality of Atlantic salmon but fails to eradicate zzso zzso that determine high individual variation of vaccination efficiency remain zzso We used gene expression analyses to search for the zzso of vaccine protection against zzso in Atlantic zzso 

zzso and vaccinated fish were challenged by zzso Fish with symptoms of zzso at the onset of mass mortality zzso - low zzso and survivors zzso - high zzso were zzso zzso gene expression was analyzed with zzso zzso - zzso and real-time zzso zzso of zzso and zzso indicated changes associated with the protection and results obtained with zzso fish were used to find and filter the zzso zzso Genes involved in recruitment and migration of immune cells changed expression in both directions with greater magnitude in zzso zzso of the regulators of immune responses was either equal zzso or greater zzso in zzso zzso levels of zzso components and zzso zzso were higher in zzso while zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species and genes for proteins of iron metabolism suggested cellular and zzso stress in zzso zzso levels of free iron and zzso can be predicted in zzso by gene expression profiles with no protection against zzso The level of complement regulation was greater in HR, which showed zzso of the components of membrane attack complex and the complement proteins that protect the host against the zzso zzso zzso fish was also characterized with zzso of genes for proteins involved in the protection of zzso zzso zzso metabolism and clearance of zzso and zzso toxic zzso A number of genes with marked expression difference between zzso and zzso can be considered as positive and negative zzso of vaccine protection against zzso 

Efficiency of vaccination against zzso depends largely on the ability of host to neutralize the negative impacts of immune responses combined with efficient clearance and prevention of tissue zzso
