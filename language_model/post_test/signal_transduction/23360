zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso is a potent zzso factor that also signals zzso through zzso of its zzso zzso zzso In this capacity, zzso signaling can rescue zzso from the damage induced by stressful stimuli many of which elicit zzso zzso However, the regulatory role that zzso plays in providing zzso remains zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on primary cultures of mature zzso zzso undergoing nutritional zzso We found that zzso cultured under nutritional stress had increased expression of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as enhanced levels of zzso zzso These zzso also showed increased zzso of the zzso pathways for zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and higher levels of the zzso protein zzso all of which were zzso by treatments with zzso zzso and blocked by zzso zzso The blockade of zzso function also zzso a zzso that was accompanied by zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso stress, and a collapse in the zzso membrane potential zzso zzso of zzso by zzso generated a similar pattern of zzso change and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso or zzso zzso from the zzso dysfunction and zzso stress induced by zzso zzso in a timely zzso These findings suggested that zzso or zzso can provide zzso by signaling through an alternate zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest that zzso signaling through zzso plays a critical regulatory role in protecting stressed zzso zzso from the damaging effects of an zzso zzso These findings also zzso zzso or zzso as zzso receptors that mediate zzso when zzso function is zzso
