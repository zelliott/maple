The regulation of zzso of plants zzso in zzso of leaf zzso cells has been well zzso but the roles concerning regulators of zzso such as zzso are poorly zzso This study reports that zzso zzso acts as a versatile regulator to zzso development of zzso and leaf pavement zzso In zzso zzso leaf pavement cells showed shorter zzso in comparison with those in wild zzso In zzso zzso zzso line) the growth of zzso in pavement cells was severely suppressed and the development of zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an essential role in zzso of zzso pavement cells through modulating the zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso or zzso was detected in the leaf pavement cells using zzso zzso zzso negative, not zzso active, zzso could weaken the effect caused by zzso of zzso because the zzso zzso of zzso plants was eliminated in the hybrid line zzso zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso Three zzso zzso zzso in zzso were determined as targeted zzso acids for zzso zzso of zzso not zzso could rescue the abnormal growth zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating the impact of zzso zzso in the development of zzso In zzso these results suggest that zzso regulation in zzso of zzso and leaf pavement cells could be undergone through modulating the zzso zzso pathways and the zzso of zzso by zzso was required for the zzso zzso in zzso
