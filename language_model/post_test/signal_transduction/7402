Although bacteria frequently live as zzso organisms, many spend at least part of their lives in complex communities, and some have adopted truly zzso lifestyles and have abandoned zzso zzso These transitions to zzso have occurred independently several times for various ecological reasons, resulting in a broad range of zzso In this Review, we discuss the strategies that are used by bacteria to form and grow in zzso structures that have hallmark features of zzso including zzso zzso programmed cell death and zzso In addition, we examine the evolutionary and ecological factors that lead to the wide range of coordinated zzso zzso that are observed in zzso
