The zzso bystander effect has been demonstrated in whole organisms as well as in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso culture systems in zzso However, the time course of bystander zzso especially in whole organisms, is not zzso zzso zzso effects in zzso in plants have been demonstrated by our zzso Plant zzso is a useful experimental tool for studying the zzso signaling of zzso In the present study, we developed a root zzso technique with young zzso of zzso zzso in which the bystander signaling communication of zzso could easily be stopped or started at specific times after root zzso Using this methodology, we demonstrated the time course of long-distance signaling in zzso bystander effects at the level of the zzso using the expression level of the zzso gene as a biological end zzso Briefly, an zzso zzso of damage signals in bystander parts after zzso was essential for zzso a bystander zzso The zzso of signal zzso was not related to the transmission speed of signaling molecules in plants and did not result from the delayed initiation of bystander signals in targeted root zzso It was suggested that the bystander effect might be induced jointly by multiple bystander signals initiated at different stages after zzso Moreover, zzso oxygen species zzso were shown to be implicated in the response process of bystander cells to radiation damage signals rather than in the generation of bystander signals in targeted zzso
