It is now zzso that the spatial zzso of proteins at the zzso level is essential in regulating cell zzso On the other hand, research efforts aimed at developing synthetic zzso of zzso signaling processes have usually focused on the affinity and specificity of zzso to their target zzso zzso the zzso of the molecules in zzso Here we show that it is feasible to rapidly and efficiently activate an zzso signaling zzso by placing a synthetic zzso at a specific location within a zzso The zzso activity of the zzso is very weak when it is freely zzso in the zzso This study highlights the importance of controlling the zzso locations of zzso molecules in the design of new synthetic zzso (not only zzso but also zzso of zzso biological zzso
