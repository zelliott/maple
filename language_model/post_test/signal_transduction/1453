zzso of zzso in guinea pig zzso zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso is associated with a removal of zzso groups from the zzso pool and their incorporation into zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is associated with an increased incorporation of zzso into zzso These changes occur during the first zzso s of zzso We can show now that these changes are associated with a significant increase in the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which reaches a maximum during the first 60 s after zzso In zzso experiments with isolated zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso protein zzso and with zzso protein zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso activities in intact zzso zzso cells results from protein zzso The two protein zzso seem to activate the three zzso by zzso the same zzso zzso zzso C was almost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso remained unchanged in the intact cell as well as during incubation with protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be activated by the two protein zzso also in zzso from guinea pig zzso It seems, therefore, that the regulation leading to rapid changes of zzso activities during signal transmission in zzso zzso cells could be operative also in other cell zzso
