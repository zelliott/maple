zzso zzso were constructed in the zzso gene of a virulent type b strain of zzso zzso and the behavior of the resulting zzso was investigated in a number of conditions that zzso distinct steps in the natural infection zzso In zzso zzso synthesis of capsule and zzso zzso and growth in synthetic media were zzso compared to synthesis of capsule and LOS and growth in synthetic media in the zzso zzso zzso type b parent zzso However, the zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso mice was significantly zzso Upon exposure to human blood or serum, the zzso zzso showed markedly reduced survival compared with the survival of its zzso zzso zzso resistance could be fully restored by zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene but not by zzso in zzso with the zzso gene from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso bacteria were markedly different, especially under zzso conditions, zzso the global regulatory role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and classical complement activities in various serum samples pointed to zzso zzso activity as the factor that zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso strain revealed several zzso zzso some of which may be implicated in the serum hypersensitivity zzso
