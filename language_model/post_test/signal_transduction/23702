The direct zzso activities of activated protein C zzso on cells convey zzso relevant, beneficial effects in injury and disease models in zzso and require the zzso protein C zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso 1 zzso zzso also activates zzso but its effects on cells contrast zzso zzso zzso To gain insights into mechanisms for these contrasting cellular effects, zzso activated zzso 3 zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso at zzso whereas zzso zzso at zzso On cells, zzso failed to cleave zzso whereas zzso was still zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso peptides beginning at zzso acid 42, but not those beginning at zzso acid 39, conveyed zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso blunted vascular zzso growth factor zzso vascular zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso by zzso at zzso can initiate distinctive zzso zzso zzso These novel insights help explain the differentiation of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso effects on cells and suggest a unique zzso role for zzso in the complex mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso
