The presence of the Philadelphia zzso in patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso is a negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that target zzso such as zzso have improved treatment of zzso and are generally incorporated into induction zzso This approach has improved clinical responses, but molecular zzso are seen in less than 50% of patients leaving few treatment options in the event of zzso Thus, identification of additional targets for therapeutic intervention has potential to improve outcomes for zzso The human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is expressed in zzso of zzso and numerous small zzso zzso are available to prevent its zzso We analyzed a cohort of 129 ALL patient samples using reverse phase protein array zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and found that activity of zzso was elevated in zzso of zzso as compared to just zzso of zzso In two human zzso cell lines, zzso of zzso zzso activity with zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso of an zzso zzso signaling target zzso zzso (by zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso cells at 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also diminished in both cell lines in a zzso manner (by zzso in both cell lines at 3 zzso zzso treatment increased expression of the zzso protein zzso by as much as zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells, and further produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and increased sensitivity to zzso zzso at clinically relevant zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling is an additional molecular target in zzso and encourage the development of clinical strategies combining zzso and zzso zzso zzso for this subset of ALL zzso
