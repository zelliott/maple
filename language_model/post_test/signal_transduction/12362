The development of limb cartilage involves complex zzso pathways allowing the formation of distinct segments of cartilage that are maintained in the fully developed zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso zzso zzso and its role in cartilage zzso The differential distribution of the zzso zzso family of receptors and their corresponding zzso in developing avian zzso zzso cartilage revealed expression of zzso 1, Delta 1, zzso 1 and zzso 2 in all limb zzso cells at the early stages of cartilage zzso development, which were subsequently restricted to the developing cartilage zzso zzso of both zzso 1 and zzso 1 became increasingly restricted to the surface cartilage once joint cavity formation had zzso Delta 1 and zzso 1 were restricted to a layer of cells underneath the surface cartilage and were also observed in the zzso zzso where zzso 1 expression was evident in stage zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso 3 and zzso 4 were not evident in early stage limbs but were present after zzso although expression was lost in late stage limbs zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso leads to altered zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso From these data it is clear that zzso zzso is a necessary and critical factor in regulating cell fate decisions allowing controlled zzso zzso and subsequent maintenance of limb zzso
