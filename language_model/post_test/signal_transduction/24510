Variation in cell zzso and function is caused by zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso acting through zzso consisting of zzso acid zzso and zzso X zzso zzso plays a crucial zzso The zzso zzso bind to naturally occurring response elements in the promoter regions of target zzso deciding whether the gene is to be transcribed or zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso all trans zzso acid, zzso zzso are associated with the nuclear zzso zzso zzso or the related zzso Here we show, using zzso zzso and Northern zzso techniques, that when the human zzso cell line zzso is allowed to differentiate into zzso cells the expression of zzso is zzso both at the protein and at the zzso zzso To investigate how this affects the zzso activity of zzso acid response element zzso zzso we performed transient zzso experiments in zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso functions not merely as a zzso of zzso transcription, but rather as a zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso of genes controlled by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
