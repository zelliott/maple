zzso receptors and zzso zzso are zzso zzso communication molecules with zzso functions in development, but their expression patterns and functions in many adult zzso are still largely zzso We have detected substantial levels of the zzso and zzso receptors and the zzso zzso in the adult mouse kidney by zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is localized in the zzso of the inner and outer zzso and zzso is in the zzso of the outer zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso was detected in zzso throughout the whole zzso zzso with the overlapping expression of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso and therefore zzso in the zzso In the outer zzso however, zzso signaling may be attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as cell zzso enlargement of focal zzso and prominent stress fibers in primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso signaling through zzso family zzso regulates the zzso and spatial organization of the zzso cells in the adult kidney zzso and, therefore, may affect the zzso ability of the zzso
