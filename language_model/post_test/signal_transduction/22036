zzso zzso zzso was named after its biological zzso namely the binding of zzso and of its inactive precursor zzso that triggers zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso However the gene zzso for zzso is named zzso zzso 6 accessory protein 2) because zzso was initially found as a truncated form zzso with zzso zzso zzso There are now data showing that this interaction is not only physical, but also functional in the kidney and the zzso However, the newest and most fascinating development of zzso is its involvement in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso which are essential for adult and embryonic stem cell biology, embryonic development and disease, including zzso In the zzso pathway, it has been shown that zzso acts as an zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso generated by the zzso in zzso is necessary for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso pathway, zzso binds to zzso and controls its zzso zzso distribution and therefore the polarization of the cells in a plane of a zzso These essential cellular functions of zzso are independent of zzso and open new avenues on the zzso role of zzso The present review will zzso our knowledge of zzso functions of zzso and will discuss the newly recognized functions of zzso related to the zzso and to zzso zzso
