The wear and tear processes that are thought to contribute to human zzso may play an important role in the development of vascular zzso One such process is cellular zzso In zzso cells the zzso zzso can be induced by a number of factors, including zzso damage, zzso stress and sustained zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso cell zzso maybe relevant to vascular zzso In this chapter we examine the causes, mechanisms and regulation of zzso cell zzso as they emerge from studies in cell zzso We also describe the zzso zzso and discuss its zzso zzso We review the evidence for the occurrence of zzso cell zzso in zzso and examine findings in animal models of zzso and human genetic disorders that argue for and against a role of zzso cell zzso in age-related vascular zzso Finally, we address the particular case of zzso zzso cell zzso and discuss the relevance of this phenomenon for zzso and vascular zzso
