Many sensory systems involve multiple steps of signal amplification to produce a significant zzso One such mechanism may be the zzso of zzso zzso In bacterial zzso where a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to the response regulator zzso plays a central role, the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster together with zzso and the zzso zzso at a pole of a zzso zzso This zzso led to a proposal that signal amplification occurs through an interaction between zzso zzso Here, by using in zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined an zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were introduced into zzso one at the zzso interface and the other at the external surface of the zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso (especially a deduced zzso were detected and their abundance depended on zzso and zzso The zzso zzso significantly reduced the amounts of higher zzso but did not affect the polar zzso of zzso Thus, the binding of zzso alters the rate of zzso between zzso zzso in assembled signaling complexes, most likely due to a change in the relative positions or zzso of the zzso These zzso could occur within a zzso predicted by zzso or between such zzso These results are consistent with the proposal that the interaction of zzso zzso is involved in signal zzso
