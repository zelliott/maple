The zzso target of zzso zzso comprises 2 structurally distinct zzso complexes, zzso complexes 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling occurs during and contributes to the severity of zzso damage from zzso heart zzso However, the relative roles of zzso versus zzso in the zzso of zzso damage are zzso 

Combined pharmacological and molecular approaches were used to alter the balance of zzso and zzso signaling in cultured cardiac zzso and in mouse hearts subjected to conditions that mimic zzso heart zzso The importance of zzso signaling in cardiac protection was demonstrated by pharmacological zzso of both zzso and zzso with zzso which led to increased zzso zzso and tissue damage after zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso by suppression of zzso with zzso similarly increased zzso zzso and tissue damage after zzso zzso In comparison, zzso shifting toward zzso signaling by zzso of zzso with zzso led to decreased zzso zzso and tissue damage after zzso zzso 

These results suggest that selectively increasing zzso while zzso zzso zzso signaling is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso heart zzso
