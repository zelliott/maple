During zzso primordial germ cells zzso have the potential to enter either zzso or zzso In a female zzso zzso or in a zzso environment, zzso develop as zzso zzso However, male zzso zzso cells inhibit zzso from entering zzso and direct them to a zzso zzso We have examined the ability of zzso from male and female zzso to respond to the zzso environment of the male zzso zzso defining a zzso window during which zzso retain a zzso zzso To help understand how zzso respond to the male zzso environment, we have identified molecular differences between male zzso that are committed to zzso and zzso female zzso Our results suggest that one way in which zzso respond to this zzso environment is to zzso zzso zzso We show that this zzso zzso can partially zzso female embryonic zzso in culture, probably by inducing female supporting cells to differentiate into zzso zzso In the developing zzso zzso zzso may act as a zzso factor to induce zzso cell zzso Thus part of the response of zzso to the male zzso environment is to generate a zzso feedback loop to ensure male differentiation of the surrounding zzso zzso zzso
