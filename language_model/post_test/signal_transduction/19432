zzso enable plants to sense light information and regulate zzso zzso zzso interact with partner proteins to transmit light signals to downstream components for plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso functions as a zzso switch regulating root development through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso with zzso and activated them in a zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso A enhanced the zzso activity of zzso whereas the zzso form inhibited zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was localized in the zzso and bound to the zzso in darkness but not in zzso zzso loss of function zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed a longer root zzso in the zzso In addition, both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed retarded root zzso and irregular root hair formation, suggesting that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso primary root zzso We propose that zzso and zzso signaling are interconnected through zzso in regulating the root growth and development in zzso
