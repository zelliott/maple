The zzso of innate immune responses by zzso acids is crucial to protective and pathological zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso However, it remains unknown whether a mechanism exists that zzso these zzso zzso Here we show that zzso group box zzso proteins 1, 2 and 3 function as universal sentinels for zzso zzso zzso bind to all zzso zzso acids examined with a correlation between affinity and zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse cells are defective in zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso induction by DNA or zzso targeted to activate the zzso zzso zzso cells in which the expression of all three zzso is suppressed show a more profound zzso accompanied by impaired zzso of the zzso factors zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso and nuclear factor zzso The absence of zzso also severely zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by their zzso zzso zzso Our results therefore indicate a hierarchy in the zzso zzso of immune responses, wherein the selective zzso of zzso receptors is contingent on the more zzso sensing of zzso acids by zzso These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system and for the treatment of zzso zzso
