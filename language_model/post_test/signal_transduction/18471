zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso initially characterized in synaptic zzso zzso trafficking, consist of seven zzso zzso zzso whose zzso arrangement is of unknown zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is needed for proper guidance of embryonic zzso muscles towards zzso attachment sites, with both excessive and reduced zzso activity producing specific zzso in separate muscle zzso These zzso were zzso to analyze the molecular architecture underlying zzso signaling function in zzso Surprisingly, removing zzso 1-3 zzso or deleting zzso binding in zzso 1 or 2 convert zzso to excessive in zzso activity zzso by zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso screening identifies the cell zzso protein zzso zzso type II zzso motif as binding zzso 1, 2 and 7 of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit muscle zzso enhance defects caused by reduced zzso activity and suppress the dominant zzso effect during embryonic muscle zzso We propose that Ed and zzso form a signaling complex, where competition between zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso for Ed binding controls signaling zzso
