As a marker of zzso zzso zzso alpha was measured after stimulation of zzso resident zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso alpha was produced by zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso mouse zzso This zzso zzso alpha production was blocked by zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso suggesting the involvement of a protein zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a 71 zzso protein zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso found in other cell types share common features zzso similar molecular weight, zzso independent zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis using zzso zzso detected the zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso involves an early zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso zzso
