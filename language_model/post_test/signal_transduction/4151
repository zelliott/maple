The functional capacity of the human zzso zzso for the zzso portion of zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso signal zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso alpha R zzso zzso zzso were used as specific zzso to induce release of zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by a secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a significant release of zzso and zzso by human blood zzso cells, indicating requirements for zzso alpha R zzso on the cell surface to transmit zzso Both zzso were released exclusively by adherent cells, identifying zzso as the responding cells within the zzso cell zzso This zzso release could not be due to zzso zzso because it was not abolished by zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso soluble zzso alpha R inhibited the zzso alpha R zzso zzso release from blood zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso were released in a zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso alpha zzso through its capacity to mediate zzso of zzso may play an important role in zzso proliferation and zzso zzso On the other hand, release of zzso following stimulation of zzso alpha R molecules directly implicates these receptors in amplification and regulation of the inflammatory process occurring during zzso host zzso
