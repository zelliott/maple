zzso crest cells zzso zzso zzso and differentiate within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract to give rise to the zzso and zzso cells of the enteric nervous system zzso The zzso zzso is critical in this process and zzso zzso is known to have an essential zzso zzso of this gene cause zzso zzso zzso in zzso but its mechanism of action is poorly zzso We find that zzso of zzso signaling in cultured avian zzso also leads to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso during formation of the avian zzso zzso To answer this question, we created zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso quail zzso into the zzso cavity of chick zzso The quail zzso develop two zzso zzso of differentiated zzso and zzso cells originating entirely from the host neural zzso The presence of excess zzso in the zzso results in a significant increase in zzso cell number, while zzso of zzso zzso zzso leads to severe zzso The zzso zzso is associated with an increase in enteric crest cell zzso Using zzso zzso cultured in collagen zzso we find that zzso also zzso zzso differentiation in the zzso Finally, zzso which is strongly expressed in the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso factor zzso Our results demonstrate multiple roles for zzso signaling during zzso development in the avian zzso where it influences zzso zzso zzso and zzso
