The zzso zzso checkpoint gene named zzso encodes an zzso protein zzso that shares a highly zzso motif with proteins involved in DNA zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso fulfills its function via the regulation of the zzso and zzso protein zzso Here we describe a novel role for zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene alleviated zzso zzso and produced shortened lengths in the zzso repeat zzso zzso analysis revealed that the other checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to the same zzso class with zzso with regard to control of the zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso and zzso have a drastic effect on zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso in zzso zzso carries out its zzso maintenance function in parallel with the checkpoint zzso zzso Furthermore, either a single or double disruption of zzso and zzso caused no obvious changes in the zzso DNA zzso Our results demonstrate a novel role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is independent of zzso and zzso
