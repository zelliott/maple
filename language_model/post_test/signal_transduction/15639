To enhance our understanding of the zzso of zzso proteins zzso we identified and analyzed the functions of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso (here designated zzso The zzso small complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for viability and zzso zzso formation, whereas zzso are not essential for zzso zzso formation or sexual zzso zzso function in reducing the frequency of zzso zzso and in the assembly of large zzso zzso zzso of any of the zzso components eliminates the zzso of all zzso to the zzso pole body zzso whereas deletion of zzso does not affect zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso do not zzso the zzso to the zzso but, rather, the zzso zzso them to the zzso zzso exhibit a hierarchy of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso eliminates zzso zzso to the zzso and deletion of zzso eliminates zzso (but not zzso zzso All zzso zzso normally in a zzso zzso We propose a model for the structure of the zzso complex and its attachment to polar zzso organizing zzso
