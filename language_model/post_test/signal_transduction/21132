In the majority of developing zzso zzso can exert zzso actions, thereby raising zzso zzso zzso zzso can have broad consequences during development, inducing gene zzso altering zzso outgrowth and growth cone zzso zzso zzso zzso and influencing zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso zzso digital imaging to assess the effects of zzso or zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso on zzso activity zzso zzso rises during the early stages of in zzso zzso neural zzso Our experiments stemmed from the finding that stimulation of zzso receptors shown to either activate or inhibit zzso zzso activity caused a rapid decrease in zzso rises zzso by zzso released zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the inhibitor zzso reduced the zzso rise zzso by the synaptic release of zzso Bath application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rises triggered by synaptic zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso rises was observed in some zzso at relatively low zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso rises triggered by the bath application of zzso were only moderately depressed zzso by zzso (1 zzso suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso were largely the result of a zzso zzso The protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused a large reduction zzso in zzso rises triggered by synaptic zzso zzso Unlike the short-term depression zzso by zzso of the zzso signal zzso pathway, zzso depression zzso by zzso zzso persisted for an extended period zzso zzso after zzso inhibitor zzso zzso depression of zzso zzso rises triggered by zzso (in the presence of zzso recovered zzso suggesting that the extended depression observed during synaptic zzso release was largely through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso peptides may be zzso through a parallel zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso activity zzso zzso rises is dependent on ongoing zzso activity that is maintained within a narrow zone for zzso to elicit a zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso changes in the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso or zzso could lead to a substantial decrease in zzso zzso rises during early zzso
