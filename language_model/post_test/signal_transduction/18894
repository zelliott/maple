zzso zzso is highly dynamic and characterized by the addition and zzso of processes and also by their selective zzso zzso and zzso zzso can influence these events via zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affect zzso and differentiation in the developing nervous zzso We report here that the peptides and zzso acted zzso on zzso and branch zzso In stage III zzso zzso zzso increased not only the addition but also the elimination of new zzso and branches by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso When applied alone, the zzso did not influence zzso or branch zzso However, they reduced the elimination of newly formed zzso and branches caused by zzso by preventing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This led to the formation of persistent zzso and zzso Additional zzso studies on the dynamics of zzso zzso showed alternating periods of zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso prolonged the periods of zzso By zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could play an important role in the control of zzso growth and branching during development and in response to zzso zzso
