The zzso zzso and disabled 1 zzso genes both ensure correct zzso positioning during brain zzso We have found that the zzso zzso protein receives a zzso zzso signal from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso function depends on zzso and vice versa, as expected if both genes are in the same zzso zzso is expressed at a higher level, yet zzso at a lower level, in zzso zzso zzso zzso In primary zzso cultures, zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso positioning by stimulating zzso zzso zzso
