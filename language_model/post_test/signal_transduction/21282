zzso within each layer of cerebral zzso express multiple members of the zzso family and their corresponding zzso This zzso could provide functional zzso zzso different zzso may direct distinct aspects of cortical zzso growth and zzso By zzso zzso zzso in zzso slices of developing zzso with zzso zzso bodies zzso we found that zzso and zzso oppose one another in regulating the zzso growth of zzso zzso In layer 4, both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso growth zzso by zzso In contrast, in layer 6 both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso by zzso These zzso actions of zzso zzso and zzso provide a mechanism by which zzso growth and zzso can be zzso regulated during cortical development, and suggest that the multiple zzso expressed in developing zzso represent distinct components of an zzso signaling system for regulating zzso zzso
