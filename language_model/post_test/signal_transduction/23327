The mechanism of the regulatory roles of zzso cell derived zzso zzso motif zzso 4 zzso on cell proliferation and zzso in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso via the protein zzso C zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso zzso pathways have been zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with control or an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed to the AS model were treated with zzso plus zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation was measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by flow zzso zzso protein expression was zzso using Western zzso The proliferation rate in the AS model group was significantly higher than the control group, but lower than the zzso group zzso zzso in the AS model group zzso was significantly higher than the normal control group zzso In addition, the zzso rate in the zzso group was significantly lower than the normal control group zzso however, there was no difference from the zzso zzso zzso protein expression in the zzso group was significantly higher than the AS model zzso group zzso In conclusion, zzso can promote the proliferation of zzso induced by zzso and inhibit cell zzso via the zzso zzso
