The analysis of zzso diseases such as asthma poses a challenging zzso In an effort to provide unbiased insight into disease zzso we took an empirical approach involving transcript expression profiling of lung tissue from mice with experimental zzso zzso responses were found to involve sequential induction of zzso of the tested zzso notably, there was zzso expression of a series of genes not previously implicated in allergic or pulmonary zzso Genes were widely distributed throughout all zzso but zzso included genes involved in zzso development, and zzso When asthma was induced by two independent experimental regimens, unique gene transcript profiles were found depending upon the mode of disease zzso However, the majority of genes were common to both models representing an asthma signature zzso Analysis of zzso mice revealed that an unexpectedly large segment of the asthma genes were zzso zzso this correlated with sustained inflammatory events in these zzso zzso induction of asthma in zzso mice resulted in gene induction not seen in zzso zzso These results raise concern that therapeutic blockade of zzso in the zzso setting may zzso the genetic signature, resulting in alternative lung pathology, which we indeed observed in zzso zzso These results provide unprecedented insight into the complex steps involved in the zzso of allergic airway zzso as such, these results have significant therapeutic and clinical zzso
