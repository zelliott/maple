zzso acid zzso its zzso such as the zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso as well as its precursor zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso are known to function as signals in plant stress responses and zzso More recently, formation of zzso acid zzso and high biological activity of zzso zzso were found to be essential in zzso zzso A breakthrough was the identification of zzso proteins which interact with the zzso protein zzso if zzso is zzso This interaction leads to zzso degradation of zzso being negative regulators of zzso zzso Surprisingly, a distinct zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso is most zzso zzso a bacterial zzso with an identical zzso at the zzso ring, has a similar zzso This was explained by the recent identification of zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso well with molecular modeling zzso Whereas over the last two decades zzso was zzso to describe any zzso dependent process, now we have to take into account a distinct zzso of zzso Until recently a quantitative analysis of zzso was missing zzso due to its zzso to zzso Now such an analysis was zzso These aspects will be discussed based on our new knowledge on zzso perception and zzso
