Recent studies suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso gene zzso We show here that application of ozone increased zzso zzso expression of zzso reporter genes regulated by the promoters of the tobacco class I zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso analysis of the class I zzso promoter revealed that zzso gene regulation is mainly zzso by the zzso zzso region containing the positively acting zzso element zzso In addition, application of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso action, blocked zzso class I zzso promoter zzso zzso activity and zzso depended on the integrity of the zzso boxes, zzso elements present in the zzso of the class I zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso The minimal zzso promoter containing only the zzso with intact zzso boxes, was sufficient to zzso zzso ozone zzso to a zzso zzso while a substitution zzso in the zzso box abolished ozone zzso The zzso region of the class I zzso promoter containing two intact zzso boxes zzso strong ozone zzso to a minimal cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso promoter, whereas two zzso substitution in the zzso boxes resulted in a complete loss of ozone zzso Taken together, these zzso suggest that zzso is zzso zzso expression of class I zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso different regions for ozone and zzso Application of zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso but ozone induction was not zzso This shows that zzso gene expression occurs via at least two different zzso mechanisms and suggests an additional zzso independent zzso zzso for zzso expression of genes involved in zzso zzso
