zzso zzso zzso synaptic efficacy in the nervous system of zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso many behaviors are regulated by zzso levels, which are in turn regulated by the presence or absence of zzso Here, we show that both food and zzso signaling zzso zzso avoidance response of zzso in zzso zzso and that this zzso is both rapid and zzso zzso to zzso is decreased when animals are off food or when zzso levels are zzso conversely, sensitivity is increased when animals are on food or have increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and behavioral experiments reveal that sensory input from different zzso of zzso zzso is selectively used, depending on stimulus strength, feeding status, and zzso zzso zzso directly targets at least one pair of sensory zzso and zzso signaling requires the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling is required for response to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in behavioral response off food but not on zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso activity via G protein signaling zzso behavioral plasticity by rapidly altering the functional zzso of a zzso zzso
