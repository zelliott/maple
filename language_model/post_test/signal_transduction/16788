The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system has largely been studied as a zzso zzso regulatory system not only to dissect structural and functional aspects of signal zzso in bacteria but also to gain knowledge about the versatile devices that have evolved allowing a zzso zzso to adjust to or counteract environmental stressful conditions along its life zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso peptides have been identified as cues that the sensor protein zzso can monitor to zzso zzso gene expression to cope with zzso or zzso challenging zzso In this work, we show for the first time that long chain zzso free fatty acids zzso present in zzso growth medium are signals specifically detected by zzso We demonstrate that zzso inhibit zzso zzso activity, turning off the expression of the zzso zzso We also show that zzso exert their action independently of their cellular zzso and zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso Our findings put forth the complexity of input signals that can zzso to finely tune the activity of the zzso zzso In addition, they provide a new potential zzso platform for the development of zzso strategies to fight against zzso zzso
