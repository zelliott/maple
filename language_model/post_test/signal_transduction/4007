The effect of zzso acid zzso on the growth of eight gastric cancer cell lines was related to their zzso levels of zzso for zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso out of eight gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso for zzso acid receptors zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso cells did not transcribe either zzso or zzso at the zzso level although they appeared to have no zzso at the gene zzso The growth of all of the cell lines except for zzso cells was inhibited by 1 zzso zzso M zzso Cell cycle distribution analysis revealed that zzso arrest was not induced by exposure to zzso in the sensitive zzso and zzso cells or the resistant zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso temporarily increased the amount of the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also reduced the amount of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso followed by reduction in zzso of the product of the zzso tumor zzso gene zzso in the sensitive zzso cells, but not in the resistant zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has a zzso effect on gastric cancer cells that zzso the zzso molecules through cell cycle regulatory zzso
