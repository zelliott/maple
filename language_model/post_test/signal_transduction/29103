Selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso is the therapeutic strategy in patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso Despite significant zzso and zzso responses with zzso mainly due to the zzso in the zzso zzso domain, resistance occurs in patients with advanced zzso In the present study on zzso zzso cells zzso however, no such zzso in the zzso zzso domain were zzso Further studies revealed the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells suggesting the possible involvement of zzso in the development of resistance to zzso So, we sought to examine the effect of zzso a selective zzso zzso on zzso zzso The results clearly indicate that zzso is more effective in zzso cells with a lower zzso value of 10 zzso compared to an zzso value of 40 zzso in zzso zzso This increase in the sensitivity of zzso cells towards zzso suggests that the development of resistance in zzso cells is zzso zzso Further studies revealed zzso of zzso by zzso and a decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells led to release of zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso Also, zzso at 1 zzso concentration induced zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso by reducing the zzso value of zzso from 10 to 6 zzso In conclusion, the present study indicates zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso a zzso specific zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression through zzso signaling zzso
