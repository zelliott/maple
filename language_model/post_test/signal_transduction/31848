The classical view on zzso gene expression proposes the scheme of a forward flow for which fluctuations in zzso levels upon a stimulus contribute to determine variations in zzso availability for zzso Here we address this issue by simultaneously profiling with zzso the total zzso (the zzso and the zzso zzso (the zzso after zzso treatment of human cells, and extending the analysis to other 19 different zzso comparisons in zzso cells following different stimuli or undergoing cell zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso results in an early induction of zzso and zzso changes, but zzso of the significant variation is limited to the zzso and the degree of zzso changes is less than zzso The survey of other 19 different zzso comparisons shows that extensive zzso is a general rule, in terms of both zzso movements and zzso cell activities, with a strong tendency of zzso genes to be controlled purely at the zzso zzso By different statistical approaches, we finally provide evidence of the lack of dependence between changes at the zzso and zzso zzso 

We propose a model of diffused zzso between variation in transcript zzso and variation in their engagement on zzso which implies the existence of specific mechanisms to couple these two ways of regulating gene zzso
