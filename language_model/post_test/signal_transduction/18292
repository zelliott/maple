zzso zzso can be formed by zzso degradation of zzso They have only recently attracted attention, and their zzso function is still zzso In this study, we have searched for zzso functions of the natural zzso and zzso zzso their zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso and zzso zzso served as the control zzso Each of the zzso ring zzso zzso tested induced rapid zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells when applied zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins had molecular masses of approximately 35 zzso approximately 45 zzso zzso zzso and approximately 120 zzso The zzso ring zzso zzso had a similar effect, but at an external concentration of zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso The zzso zzso zzso also induced rapid zzso zzso in zzso cells of approximately zzso approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso Further experiments indicated that the zzso zzso partition rapidly into the cell zzso where they activate zzso including zzso protein zzso When their zzso level increases, zzso presumably takes zzso This pattern may account for the zzso profile of zzso zzso and suggests that they may take part in processes associated with cell zzso
