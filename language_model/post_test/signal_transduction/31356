zzso zzso make an important contribution to the zzso of zzso with blood, which enhances the subsequent ejection of blood from the zzso The dependence of cardiac function on the contribution of zzso becomes increasingly important with age and zzso We know much less about the calcium signals that link electrical zzso to contraction within zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso Nevertheless, recent work has shed new light on calcium zzso in zzso zzso At an zzso level, zzso and zzso zzso have many zzso However, a few key structural differences, in particular the lack of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso make these two cell types display vastly different calcium patterns in response to zzso The lack of zzso in zzso zzso means that zzso provokes calcium signals that largely originate around the periphery of the zzso To engage the zzso machinery, the calcium signal must zzso zzso deeper into the zzso This inward movement of calcium is ultimately controlled by hormones that can promote or decrease calcium release within the zzso zzso zzso movement of calcium in zzso zzso leads to increased contraction and a more substantial contribution to blood zzso The calcium zzso paradigm within zzso cells applies to other cardiac cell types that also do not express zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells that aid in the spread of electrical zzso Furthermore, during heart failure zzso zzso progressively lose their regular zzso zzso and their pattern of response resembles that of zzso zzso
