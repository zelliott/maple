In zzso cells, zzso plays several roles in membrane zzso including organization of zzso zzso zzso trafficking of cholesterol, and zzso of signaling zzso Events in zzso zzso and zzso require similar cellular functions, suggesting a possible role for zzso in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was indeed present in developing mouse male germ cells and both mouse and guinea pig zzso In mature zzso zzso was enriched in a zzso zzso membrane zzso as well as in membrane zzso zzso by means of their light buoyant zzso through zzso density zzso zzso These data indicated the presence of membrane zzso enriched in zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso in the regions of the zzso and zzso in zzso of both zzso zzso zzso analysis of developing mouse male germ cells demonstrated partial zzso with a marker for the zzso Furthermore, zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso was present in both raft and zzso zzso in mature zzso Together, these data indicated that zzso zzso possess distinct raft zzso and that zzso localized to regions appropriate for involvement with zzso zzso and zzso as well as signaling pathways regulating such processes as zzso and zzso zzso
