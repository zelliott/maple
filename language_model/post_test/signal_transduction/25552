We previously showed that zzso zzso suppressed the synthesis of various zzso zzso In this study, zzso showed a zzso zzso of NO synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of NO synthesis was related to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activity that led to significant zzso of zzso of zzso This effect in turn caused zzso of zzso binding which partially explains the zzso effect upon the synthesis of zzso zzso had no effect upon zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso was also not affected by zzso as determined by levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to block zzso of zzso and subsequent nuclear zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed that zzso fits well in the highly zzso zzso pocket of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the synthetic zzso is a zzso analogue that selectively zzso the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in the NO synthesis by the zzso zzso zzso
