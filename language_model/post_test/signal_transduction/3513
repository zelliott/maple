The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in normal zzso zzso but is not expressed or is expressed at negligible levels in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cells are known to be zzso compared with normal zzso cells, suggesting a role for differentiation cues in the expression of zzso Thus, we examined the relationship between zzso expression and stages of differentiation level in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein was expressed in cells above the zzso cell layer in normal zzso In zzso cells in culture, expression of zzso zzso was significantly zzso by cell contact in a cell zzso manner, and zzso expression of cell differentiation markers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso induced by cell contact was suppressed by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso We previously reported that zzso boxes and a zzso sequence in the zzso promoter region are associated with the expression of zzso Using a promoter zzso and zzso we demonstrated that binding of the stimulating zzso zzso zzso factor to a zzso box upstream of the zzso zzso start site was necessary for cell zzso zzso of zzso These results indicated that zzso of zzso was accompanied by differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso and that zzso binding to the zzso promoter region played an important role in this zzso
