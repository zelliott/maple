Signaling by zzso zzso factor zzso via the zzso zzso or by zzso zzso through the zzso zzso support distinct populations of sensory zzso The zzso signaling pathways activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso which in zzso promote zzso survival and target zzso are not well zzso Using mice with zzso or zzso receptors lacking the zzso site for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that zzso and zzso promote survival of sensory zzso mainly through zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these receptors use similar pathways to prevent zzso In contrast, the regulation of target zzso appears different: in zzso mice zzso lose target zzso whereas in zzso mice the surviving zzso zzso maintain target zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso at the zzso site positively regulates zzso of zzso but not of zzso Our findings show that although zzso and zzso signals zzso survival are largely similar, zzso and zzso signals required for maintenance of target zzso in zzso are regulated by distinct zzso
