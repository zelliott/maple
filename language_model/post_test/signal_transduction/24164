Memory extinction refers to a gradual decrease of the previously acquired response when exposed to conditional stimulus without pairing with unconditional zzso Here we show for the first time that fear zzso zzso of specific zzso in the rat zzso is reduced after extinction trials and is accompanied by an increase in the protein level and zzso activity of zzso In zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso protein zzso as well as extinction of fear zzso Thus, extinction training increased zzso activity likely via an expression of zzso zzso then created a zzso loop and directly or indirectly zzso specific zzso which, in their zzso state, were required for memory zzso zzso in our experimental condition, extinction could be ascribed at least in part to a weakening of the original zzso
