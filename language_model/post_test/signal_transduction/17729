zzso withdrawal, the standard therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer, zzso a rapid reduction of blood flow to prostate and prostate cancer zzso and the zzso onset of a hypoxic environment in these zzso To establish whether zzso (by means of the action of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso might affect the zzso or survival properties of prostate cancer cells, we studied how acute exposure of cultured human prostate cancer cells zzso cell line) to zzso might alter their pattern of gene expression and their in zzso zzso 

zzso cultures were placed in a zzso chamber for up to 24 zzso and were compared with control zzso cells for the expression of gene products by Western zzso and zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

Exposure of zzso cells to acute zzso activated a typical cellular zzso response characterized by zzso of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor protein zzso In contrast, expression of zzso proteins zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso or zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso Some of these latter changes zzso of zzso and zzso D zzso were not accompanied by corresponding reduction of zzso and were zzso by a zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that their loss was associated with their increased degradation rather than through zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso B and its downstream target, zzso zzso was highly zzso by zzso and cells exposed to transient periods of zzso became significantly less sensitive to an zzso stimulus zzso to zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that even acute zzso has the potential to drastically alter the growth, differentiation zzso and zzso sensitivity of a prostate cancer zzso
