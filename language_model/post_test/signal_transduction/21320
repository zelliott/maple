During zzso zzso zzso pulls sister zzso apart until each pair is fully zzso In turn, zzso zzso the cell between the separated zzso What ensures that zzso proceeds only after that all zzso arms are pulled out of the zzso plane was zzso Here, we show that a signaling pathway, which we call zzso delays the completion of zzso in cells with zzso zzso zzso depends on the Aurora zzso zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso which zzso to the site of zzso in an zzso manner and act as zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to premature zzso and zzso breakage by the zzso machinery and is lethal in cells with zzso zzso We propose that zzso monitors clearance of zzso from the zzso to ensure that zzso completes only after all zzso have migrated to the zzso
