Recent studies have shown that the proliferation of some tumor cells is dependent on zzso growth zzso that require zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso of these growth factors and, therefore, this zzso is an attractive target for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is an irreversible zzso inhibitor of zzso in zzso and has been shown to decrease lung cancer cell proliferation by zzso the synthesis of zzso growth zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso cells zzso but has little effect on the proliferation of normal zzso cells zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso lower concentration also exhibits a selective zzso of zzso cell growth compared to normal zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso produces a significant zzso of gap zzso communication between zzso cells following zzso day treatments, with a corresponding increase in the degree of zzso 43 zzso and an increase in the number of zzso zzso plasma membrane gap junction zzso Western zzso analyses indicate no effect of zzso on the proportion of zzso Ras in the membrane versus zzso zzso or on zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the cell zzso of zzso zzso cells is altered, so as to more closely resemble that of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in both zzso and zzso cells, and we demonstrate that zzso at long treatment times (4 zzso zzso zzso activity in both cell types at zzso that produce selective growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment times (24 zzso however, inhibit zzso activity in zzso but not zzso cells, an effect that was zzso by zzso Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that zzso returns zzso cells to a more normal zzso a finding consistent with the known increased dominance of the Ras signaling zzso in transformed zzso zzso
