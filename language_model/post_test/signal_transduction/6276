zzso zzso zzso channels control the zzso of zzso smooth zzso However, the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso channel function in smooth muscle remain zzso We examined the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso regulates zzso smooth muscle zzso channel function via zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso We found that sustained administration of zzso II decreased zzso currents zzso by reducing the expression of zzso zzso channel zzso This effect of zzso II was independent of pressure but required zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso zzso with our hypothesis, we found that zzso and zzso are obligatory components of the signaling cascade zzso reduced zzso by zzso zzso We conclude that sustained zzso II exposure increases smooth muscle zzso which leads to zzso of zzso and zzso culminating in decreased zzso expression and reduced zzso zzso These results support the novel concept that zzso controls the zzso of zzso smooth muscle by regulating zzso zzso
