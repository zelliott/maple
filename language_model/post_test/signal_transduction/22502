The zzso zzso zzso changes its hormone output under various zzso zzso One of the pathways implicated in the regulatory mechanism of this zzso is a zzso system that operates the zzso zzso cycle to transmit downstream signal through second zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso D1 and zzso receptors in medium zzso zzso of the zzso suggesting a plausible implication of zzso in zzso zzso However, it remains elusive whether zzso is involved in the zzso system in the zzso zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the expression and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso together with the molecular components involved in the zzso signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso C zzso and a major downstream zzso protein zzso C zzso Here we show that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the intermediate lobe and zzso to the plasma membrane side by zzso In addition, we reveal that zzso and zzso are the zzso expressed in the intermediate lobe among those zzso These findings will substantiate and further extend our understanding of the zzso zzso of zzso signaling and the functional roles of zzso in the zzso intermediate zzso
