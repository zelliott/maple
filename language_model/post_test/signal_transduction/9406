Group I zzso zzso receptors zzso on zzso have been shown to participate in cerebral zzso to zzso zzso in brain zzso zzso stimulation of zzso in brain slices can produce zzso zzso or zzso depending on the initial degree of vascular zzso Here, we examined whether pharmacological stimulation of zzso in zzso increases cerebral blood zzso A zzso solution of the group I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 5 zzso over the cortical surface of zzso rats produced a 30 zzso zzso zzso increase in blood flow measured by zzso zzso after zzso zzso The response was completely blocked by zzso of group I zzso zzso and attenuated by zzso of an zzso acid zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso an zzso synthesis inhibitor (11 zzso zzso and a zzso inhibitor (15 zzso zzso The peak blood flow response was not significantly affected by administration of zzso of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an inhibitor of the synthesis of zzso acid zzso The blood flow response gradually waned following zzso zzso of zzso zzso This loss of the flow response was attenuated by a zzso synthesis inhibitor and was prevented by zzso of an inhibitor of zzso zzso which zzso zzso These results indicate that pharmacological stimulation of zzso in zzso increases cerebral blood flow and that the response depends on the release of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso synthesis limit the duration of the response to prolonged zzso zzso
