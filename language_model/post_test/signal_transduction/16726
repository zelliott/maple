Signaling interactions between vascular zzso and invading zzso provide a unique way of zzso appropriate zzso responses, which are important zzso of the ensuing zzso mechanisms such as host defense and zzso Two major zzso of zzso zzso species, namely the zzso group zzso and the spotted fever group zzso exhibit marked differences in their zzso zzso Using in zzso infection of cultured human zzso cells with zzso zzso the zzso agent of Rocky Mountain zzso we previously identified zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as essential components of zzso signaling events responsible for zzso zzso zzso Our data also suggest that zzso activity does not contribute to zzso response, implicating involvement of independent upstream signaling zzso Since divergent zzso suggest potentially different interactions with host cells, the aim of this study was to compare these responses after zzso cell infection with zzso zzso the agent of Mediterranean zzso and a zzso representative zzso zzso the agent of endemic zzso
