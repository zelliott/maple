The zzso zzso gene encodes a zinc finger protein required for the differentiation and survival of embryonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that there is a functional relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso and zzso zzso function is required for zzso zzso gene expression and zzso activity in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects zzso those of the zzso zzso and require zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso partially zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso show dominant genetic interactions in the trachea and zzso zzso Together, these results show that zzso regulates signal zzso in developing zzso and zzso zzso
