zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whose zzso is linked to its ability to replicate within the host cell zzso zzso into the zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso complex called the zzso to release the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and trigger zzso cell zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso a type I zzso zzso response that is essential for zzso zzso zzso cell death, and release of zzso and zzso zzso type I zzso cell death resulting in zzso depletion occurs in zzso during zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso is also necessary for zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results show the specific connection between type I zzso signaling and zzso zzso which are two sequential events triggered by the recognition of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first example of the positive regulation of zzso zzso This connection underscores the importance of the zzso recognition of pathogens and highlights how multiple innate immunity pathways interact before commitment to critical host zzso
