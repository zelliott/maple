The influence of ethanol zzso on multiple zzso cell zzso subsets, in the steady state or following their zzso in zzso has not been zzso zzso generation of mouse bone zzso DC zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso was inhibited by zzso relevant zzso of zzso with selective suppression of zzso zzso zzso reduced surface expression of zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso but not that of zzso zzso zzso on resting or zzso DC zzso zzso zzso production by activated DC was zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso exhibited a reduced capacity to induce zzso zzso T cell proliferation and impaired ability to prime T cells in zzso DC zzso freshly isolated from zzso mice were also zzso Liver DC, inherently immature and resistant to zzso exhibited little change in their low surface zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso DC showed reduced expression of surface zzso molecules in response to zzso stimulation in zzso These zzso DC zzso reduced zzso zzso T cell proliferation in zzso and the zzso capacity of resting but not zzso liver DC was reduced by chronic zzso zzso T cells from animals primed with zzso DC produced elevated levels of zzso following ex zzso challenge with donor zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso differentiation and function of zzso DC and zzso in zzso zzso DC from chronic zzso mice are less affected than zzso DC, which exhibit impaired functional maturation following zzso zzso These results indicate a potential mechanism by which alcohol consumption is associated with zzso
