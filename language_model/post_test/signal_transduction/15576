zzso zzso zzso in the developing zzso are zzso in zzso function and gene zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso 4) and zzso has recently emerged as a key regulator of zzso zzso controlling zzso cell zzso and tip versus stalk cell zzso During zzso zzso tip cell formation is the default response to zzso zzso zzso growth zzso whereas the stalk cell zzso is acquired through zzso lateral zzso zzso how zzso zzso zzso stalk cells from becoming tip cells remains zzso Multiple components of the zzso zzso zzso system are regulated by zzso suggesting that quantitative differences in protein expression between adjacent zzso may provide key features in the formation of a functional zzso zzso zzso of this selection process in zzso with experimental observation and validation greatly zzso our understanding of the integrated processes at the systems zzso We anticipate that the study of mosaic vascular beds of genetically modified zzso in dynamic interactions with zzso zzso will provide a powerful tool for the investigation of the molecular control and cellular mechanisms of zzso zzso
