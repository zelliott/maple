zzso zzso cells are classical zzso zzso zzso The zzso regions of clusters of coupled zzso cells collectively form a zzso which constitutes the blind end of a tube created by zzso cells - a structure reminiscent of a zzso of zzso When activated by neural or hormonal zzso pancreatic zzso cells are zzso to zzso a variety of zzso These proteins are predominately inactive zzso zzso precursors called zzso zzso cell zzso is absolutely dependent on zzso increases in zzso free zzso The increase in zzso has precise zzso and spatial characteristics as a result of the exquisite regulation of the proteins responsible for zzso release, zzso influx and zzso clearance in the zzso zzso This brief review discusses recent studies in which transgenic animal models have been zzso to define in molecular detail the components of the zzso signaling machinery which contribute to these zzso
