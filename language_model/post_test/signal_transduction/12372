zzso T cell zzso expression is dictated by the context in which zzso engagement zzso Recently it has become clear that zzso changes play a role in this zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso is a de zzso zzso important to the zzso control of cell zzso We have determined that zzso expression is increased following zzso engagement and that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso T cells lacking zzso simultaneously express zzso and zzso after expansion under zzso zzso While global zzso of DNA from zzso and knockout T cells is similar, zzso T cells demonstrate selective zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso after zzso Such zzso knockout zzso cells retain a greater capacity to express zzso protein when they are subsequently exposed to zzso zzso Based on these findings we propose that zzso is a key participant in regulating T cell polarization at the molecular level by promoting stable selection of a zzso cell fate through zzso of selective targets in T zzso
