The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling network regulates cell growth, zzso survival and zzso This study was to investigate the effect and the underlying mechanism of zzso on prostate cancer zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with 1 zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso was examined by zzso The cell cycle distribution of zzso was measured by zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were examined by western zzso 

zzso increased the proliferation of zzso at 24 zzso however, it remarkably inhibited cell proliferation after 36 h zzso which became more obviously at 72 zzso Although incubation with zzso slightly induced cell arrest at the S phase at 24 zzso this gradually increased zzso cells at the zzso phase at 36 h and 48 zzso Compared with the control group, the protein levels of zzso and zzso were significantly decreased zzso and those of zzso and zzso remained unchanged after the treatment with zzso for 24 zzso the protein level of zzso was significantly increased at 24 h zzso but was obviously inhibited at 36 h and almost completely inhibited at 72 h zzso 

zzso zzso treatment zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso This may be caused by zzso cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and zzso of zzso zzso
