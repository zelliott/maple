zzso zzso zzso originates from the zzso of transforming growth factor zzso zzso and downstream zzso With attempts to rectify HS by zzso interference zzso against zzso we report the design of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and identify the optimal zzso sequence toward zzso zzso zzso To realize effective and sustained zzso we developed gene activated zzso zzso based on porous zzso scaffold and embedded zzso zzso zzso zzso for promoting cell growth and gene zzso The zzso exhibited zzso higher than zzso pore size of zzso desired mechanical strength, and sustained zzso release zzso zzso skin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were allowed to zzso and zzso in zzso at the zzso they were zzso with zzso zzso to display remarkably reduced zzso levels that lasted for up to 10 days, consequently zzso the zzso of type I and type III zzso We further unraveled the notably higher zzso levels of zzso in three-dimensional zzso than in zzso environment, which was attributed to the improved zzso interactions that promote cell proliferation and zzso zzso This highly safe and effective zzso may serve as a promising candidate towards HS zzso
