Ras zzso are common in lung zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso lung zzso zzso However, zzso lung zzso zzso rarely have zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may not zzso a growth advantage in these zzso In one zzso cell line zzso activated zzso expression induced increased neuroendocrine differentiation and decreased cell zzso We show here that zzso cells undergo differentiation and zzso growth arrest in response to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess the consequences of zzso the zzso zzso downstream of zzso we zzso a zzso cell line with zzso an zzso form of zzso zzso zzso suppressed cell proliferation and cloning on soft zzso by zzso without evidence of zzso Cell cycle analysis showed a reduced proportion of cells in S phase, and was associated with induction of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of the cell zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso was decreased after zzso zzso in zzso zzso The activity zzso and zzso was also reduced, as consistent with cell cycle arrest in cells with activated zzso zzso In addition, zzso reduced the expression of neuroendocrine zzso zzso releasing zzso and zzso gene in zzso zzso These results provide further evidence that zzso of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which is associated with transformation in many circumstances, can reduce the growth of zzso cells, and suggest that zzso of this zzso might be clinically zzso in some zzso
