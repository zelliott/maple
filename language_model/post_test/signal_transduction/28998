zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso by multiple myeloma cells is correlated with zzso bone disease in multiple zzso However, the zzso by which zzso contributes to this process is not zzso zzso we analyzed the functional role of zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso of this zzso in bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation was measured by alkaline zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso protein was separated by zzso pull-down zzso and analyzed by Western zzso A dominant negative form of zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso were zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells were also zzso with zzso specific to zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was activated in these cell lines in response to zzso as assessed by increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma from zzso patients containing high levels of zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The requirement for zzso signaling in zzso differentiation was confirmed by the following zzso 1) zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2) zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and 3) a dominant negative form of zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso did not increase zzso activity nor did zzso treatment result in zzso stabilization indicating that cooperation between these two pathways is required, but they are not zzso by either zzso These studies have revealed that zzso zzso signaling in zzso is necessary to promote zzso differentiation of zzso cells, while zzso signaling alone is not capable of inducing such zzso zzso zzso this process and may be a key factor regulating zzso differentiation and myeloma bone zzso
