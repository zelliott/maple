zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced in zzso root zzso zzso zzso and released from primary zzso zzso to mediate zzso effects and zzso zzso In this work, we determined whether zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso could trigger zzso release from cultured zzso zzso and if so, which cellular signaling zzso was involved in this zzso zzso concentration of calcium zzso plays a key role in neurotransmitter release, therefore zzso was also determined in cultured zzso cells using zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso release in a zzso and zzso manner from zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso in a zzso zzso The protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso specific inhibitor zzso 30 zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso 1 zzso inhibited 1 zzso zzso zzso release and zzso increase from zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 30 zzso did not block the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may stimulate zzso release and zzso zzso through zzso and zzso but not zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
