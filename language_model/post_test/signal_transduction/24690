We report that activated protein zzso C zzso can induce zzso reaction independently of elevated zzso zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso analog zzso to zzso human zzso resulted in stimulation of zzso reaction zzso to zzso provided the zzso underwent zzso zzso of zzso reaction by zzso zzso was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso but not by removal of zzso zzso zzso reaction was also enhanced by the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso alpha and zzso beta II in the equatorial segment, whereas zzso beta I and zzso zzso zzso was found in the principal piece of the zzso zzso reaction, thus far believed to be induced only by elevated zzso can therefore be triggered by activated zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso potentially involved in zzso reaction are most likely alpha and beta II, whereas the beta zzso and zzso might be involved in regulation of zzso zzso of human zzso
