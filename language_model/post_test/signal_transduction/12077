Cellular communication is a fundamental process in zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso is a key event in the development of common diseases such as type 2 zzso We applied an established zzso cell zzso system and comprehensive mass zzso analysis to detect zzso the zzso interaction of zzso zzso and zzso Altogether, we identified zzso proteins with at least two unique peptides of which zzso proteins were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso proteins for zzso zzso zzso Further, we observed over 12,000 zzso sites of which we could assign 3,200 zzso zzso with a single zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Using protein set enrichment and zzso zzso we zzso regulatory protein pathways involved in cellular stress and zzso which can contribute to zzso impairment of cells including insulin resistance and other zzso The generated data sets provide a zzso molecular zzso view on the interplay of zzso and zzso in disease processes and a resource for further zzso
