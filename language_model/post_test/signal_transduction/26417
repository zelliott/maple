zzso cells are attached to the zzso zzso zzso as they make cell fate decisions within the stem cell zzso Here we show that the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso is required for zzso decisions by cultured mouse embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso zzso cells produce zzso and assemble a zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso increased cell spreading and zzso zzso signaling through focal zzso zzso while zzso inducing the loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reducing zzso production by zzso cells growing on a zzso gelatin zzso caused loss of cell zzso decreased zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso These effects were reversed by providing the cells with zzso zzso thereby restoring zzso to the gelatin zzso Interestingly, zzso cells do not adhere directly to the gelatin zzso but rather adhere indirectly through zzso zzso which zzso zzso via its effects on cell zzso These results provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation of zzso by growth on a zzso zzso The effects of increasing or decreasing zzso levels show that zzso depends on an intermediate level of zzso zzso By providing cell adhesive signals that can act with other zzso factors to maintain zzso cell zzso zzso is therefore a necessary component of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso
