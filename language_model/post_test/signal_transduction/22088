zzso in the zzso gene result in zzso zzso zzso kidney disease zzso in zzso To determine the molecular mechanism of the zzso in zzso we recently generated a mouse model for zzso that carries a targeted zzso in the mouse zzso of human zzso The zzso zzso mice display zzso zzso whose zzso are similar to those of human zzso zzso By zzso of this zzso we developed two immortalized zzso collecting duct cell lines with zzso and two zzso Under zzso culture conditions, the zzso zzso cells displayed zzso zzso contacts and zzso The zzso cells also showed significantly reduced cell proliferation and elevated zzso To validate this finding in zzso we examined proliferation and zzso in the zzso of zzso mice and their zzso zzso Using proliferation zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar results were obtained in the zzso kidney zzso as in the zzso To identify the molecular basis of these findings, we analyzed the effect of zzso loss on multiple putative signaling zzso We demonstrated that the loss of zzso zzso multiple major zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and these disruptions either inhibit the zzso pathways to suppress zzso activity and ultimately reduce cell zzso or suppress zzso to zzso zzso and promote zzso Our findings indicate that zzso may be a major player in the zzso formation in zzso which may lead to new therapeutic strategies for human zzso
