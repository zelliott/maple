We report global gene expression patterns of zzso in response to chilling zzso A total of zzso significantly zzso expressed zzso involved in photosynthesis, signal zzso and regulation of transcription, were zzso To understand the gene network underlying the response to chilling stress in the poplar, zzso zzso we determined the zzso transcript expression profile using an zzso zzso with zzso zzso Our results revealed zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In terms of biological zzso gene zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso genes were enriched in response to temperature zzso zzso oxygen species, and hormone zzso GO terms including cellular nitrogen compound zzso zzso photosynthesis, and generation of precursor zzso and energy were enriched in the zzso zzso The functional zzso of zzso expressed genes revealed genes involved in photosynthesis, zzso signal zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso and zzso defense zzso Gene expression analysis showed that the majority of genes involved in photosynthesis were zzso but the zzso gene was zzso suggesting that it may play an important role in the production of zzso for leaf development under zzso zzso Several genes involved in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso defense systems were significantly induced under chilling stress, suggesting that they may act as positive regulators in the enhanced zzso tolerance of zzso Several zzso factors had divergent expression patterns, suggesting they have variable functional responses to zzso zzso This profile of global gene expression patterns during chilling stress will be valuable for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of chilling tolerance in woody zzso
