The zzso zzso is zzso in most zzso zzso including animals and zzso zzso and RB family proteins perform crucial functions in cycle controlling, zzso development and zzso However, there are two kinds of zzso zzso zzso and active zzso and three RB family members in zzso zzso now, the detail evolutionary history of these protein families and how zzso zzso evolved in different organisms remain poorly zzso 

We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of zzso RB and zzso zzso partners of zzso protein family in representative zzso zzso Several interesting facts were zzso First, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso family are present in several representative zzso organisms and all zzso organisms we zzso Second, ancestral zzso RB genes duplicated before zzso and zzso diverged, thus zzso family was divided into zzso zzso (including repressive zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso (including active zzso zzso zzso and zzso RB family was divided into zzso zzso (including zzso and zzso zzso (including zzso and zzso Third, zzso and zzso share more sequence similarity with the predicted zzso ancestral sequence than zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso also possess lower evolutionary rates and higher zzso selection pressures than zzso zzso and zzso Fourth, for RB family, the zzso zzso proteins possess lower evolutionary rates and higher zzso selection pressures compared with RB zzso proteins in zzso 

zzso evolutionary rates and zzso selection pressures are usually linked with protein zzso We speculated that function conducted by zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins might mainly represent the ancient function of zzso pathway, and the zzso zzso proteins and zzso protein might contribute more to functional diversification in zzso zzso Our results will enhance the current understanding of zzso zzso and will also be useful to further functional studies in human and other model zzso
