We studied the response of zzso zzso repair zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso in zzso followed by release into the cell zzso Only a subset of checkpoint proteins appears to mediate cell cycle arrest and regulate the timely zzso of replication origins in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso and zzso but not zzso and the zzso group of checkpoint zzso are required to delay cell cycle progression in zzso cells after zzso damage in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso takes place in zzso cells also in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with entry into S zzso zzso gel analysis indicates that late replication origins are not fired in zzso cells zzso in zzso and released into the cell cycle, which instead initiate DNA replication from early origins and accumulate replication and zzso zzso zzso through S phase of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with late origin zzso suggesting that zzso DNA replication in the presence of zzso zzso zzso might result from a failure to prevent initiation at late zzso
