zzso zzso proteins play a critical role in zzso zzso signaling zzso regulating essential cell functions by increasing the local concentration or altering the zzso zzso of downstream zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso can bind zzso zzso while its zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso by interacting with zzso such as zzso family zzso Although several studies have implicated zzso in regulating zzso zzso its role in living cells is not well zzso 

We used an zzso system to zzso zzso the local concentration of zzso zzso zzso on the plasma membrane of living zzso zzso of fusion proteins containing all three zzso zzso zzso induced localized zzso of zzso including the formation of zzso tails and spots, accompanied by general zzso zzso All three zzso zzso zzso were required, as zzso of individual zzso zzso or a combination of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to promote significant local zzso of zzso in zzso Changes in zzso dynamics induced by zzso zzso domain zzso required the recruitment of zzso but not zzso and were unaffected by zzso of zzso 

We show that high local zzso of zzso zzso zzso are sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso in living zzso This study provides strong evidence of a pivotal role for zzso in directly zzso zzso zzso zzso at the plasma membrane to localized changes in organization of the zzso zzso through a signaling zzso that requires zzso
