zzso in zzso DNA repeat tracts in humans have been correlated with a number of serious disorders, including zzso Despite their importance for human health, the genetic factors that influence zzso stability are not well zzso Previously, we identified zzso in the zzso zzso zinc zzso genes zzso and zzso that significantly increase the frequency of zzso zzso specifically during stationary zzso In this work, we identified zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that increase zzso instability during stationary zzso zzso analysis reveals that these zzso along with zzso and zzso comprise multiple pathways regulating zzso stability during stationary zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso of any of these pathways occur via zzso zzso We present evidence that suggests formation of zzso or zzso breaks may play a primary role in stationary phase zzso Finally, we examined the roles of these pathways in the stability of a human zzso tract associated with the zzso zzso and found that loss of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso the zzso zzso in stationary phase zzso This result indicates that the genetic control of stationary phase zzso stability is dependent on the sequence composition of the zzso zzso
