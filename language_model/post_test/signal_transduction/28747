The role of the G alpha zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso II zzso induced cardiac zzso remains zzso This study was to investigate the role of the G alpha zzso signal zzso zzso in the development of cardiac zzso in zzso zzso rats and in cultured zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the effects of the zzso on zzso induced cardiac zzso 

Renal hypertension was induced in zzso zzso rats by placing a silver clip around the left zzso zzso At 8 weeks after operation, the zzso blood pressure, the ratio of left zzso weight to body weight zzso and the concentration of zzso in the heart were zzso The protein levels of G alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso were zzso by Western zzso analysis, and the activity of zzso C zzso in the zzso was detected using zzso as a zzso Changes in zzso incorporation and in the protein levels of the signal molecules G alpha zzso zzso beta 3, and zzso were measured after zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

The protein levels of G alpha zzso and zzso in the hearts of zzso rats increased by zzso and zzso respectively, compared with the sham zzso The zzso activity in the zzso group was also significantly increased zzso zzso zzso The levels of G alpha zzso zzso beta 3, and zzso increased significantly after zzso were zzso by zzso The zzso of G alpha zzso zzso beta 3 and zzso in zzso occurred prior to zzso incorporation increases, and could be inhibited with zzso 

zzso can initiate cardiac zzso and zzso signal molecules in the G alpha zzso signal zzso pathway, such as G alpha zzso zzso beta 3 and zzso at both tissue and cellular zzso
