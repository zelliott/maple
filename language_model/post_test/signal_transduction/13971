The formation of novel blood vessels is initiated by vascular zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling controls the selection of tip cells, which guide new zzso and trailing stalk zzso zzso signaling in stalk cells is induced by zzso on the tip zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso are expressed in the stalk cell zzso to maintain zzso zzso zzso zzso causes formation of a zzso vascular network with disturbed blood zzso 

This study was aimed at identifying novel zzso of zzso signaling that interact with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso binding protein zzso also known as zzso zzso with the zzso binding motif of zzso and zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in stalk cells, enhanced zzso and zzso protein stability, and promoted zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso induced expression of the zzso target genes zzso zzso fringe zzso and zzso reduced zzso of zzso and decreased expression of the zzso factor vascular zzso growth factor zzso It inhibited the expression of genes enriched in tip cells, such as zzso zzso and zzso and impaired tip cell zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell migration, zzso and zzso zzso This could be rescued by blockade of zzso signaling or application of zzso zzso human zzso cells formed a functional vascular network in zzso mice with significantly increased vascular zzso 

These data identify zzso as a novel inhibitor of tip cell formation, executing its functions predominately by promoting zzso zzso
