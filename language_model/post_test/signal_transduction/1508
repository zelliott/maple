zzso of zzso zzso activated zzso gamma zzso in the growth response of colon cancer cells has been zzso 

To investigate the characteristics of zzso induced zzso in colon cancer zzso 

The effects of zzso for each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on DNA synthesis and cell viability were examined in zzso colon cancer zzso zzso of zzso related gene expression by zzso zzso was screened with zzso zzso and the results were confirmed by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were all expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppressed DNA synthesis of zzso cells whereas zzso for zzso and zzso had no significant zzso Both zzso and zzso induced zzso cell death in a dose dependent manner which was associated with an increase in fragmented DNA and was sensitive to a zzso zzso Among several genes selected by zzso array zzso quantitative zzso analysis confirmed zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso expression by zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso was zzso by the presence of serum in the culture zzso and interaction between zzso zzso and cell survival zzso through the zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

As zzso is an important target gene of the zzso zzso coli zzso and/or zzso pathway, zzso of zzso zzso appears to compensate for zzso zzso expression caused by zzso zzso The present results suggest the potential usefulness of zzso zzso for zzso and treatment of colon zzso
