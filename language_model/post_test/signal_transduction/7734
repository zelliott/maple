zzso necrosis zzso zzso promotes zzso in zzso zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso family, resulting in reduced zzso of zzso zzso The role of another pivotal zzso zzso activated by zzso nuclear zzso zzso has not been zzso We explored the role of zzso in zzso zzso of human fat zzso zzso cultures of human zzso were incubated in the presence of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso with zzso but not with a biologically inactive zzso zzso abolished the nuclear zzso of zzso and effectively zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that although zzso per zzso reduced mainly zzso protein zzso zzso in the presence of zzso resulted in a pronounced combined reduction of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of a set of other zzso or zzso proteins was not zzso The regulation was presumably at the zzso level, because zzso expression for zzso and zzso was markedly reduced with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso This was confirmed in gene reporter zzso using human zzso and zzso promoter zzso We conclude that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced, which suggests that zzso is essential for retained human fat cell zzso
