A series of individual proteins have been linked to performance in the Morris water maze zzso but no global effects have been zzso It was therefore the aim of the study to show which proteins were zzso global factors for training in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and gels from trained animals were from a previous own study and corresponding zzso groups were zzso zzso proteins were extracted and run on two-dimensional gel zzso zzso with different zzso levels between trained and zzso groups were punched and identified by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with two factors zzso and zzso was carried out and a zzso test was used to compare zzso 12 proteins from several pathways and zzso showed different levels in trained mice versus corresponding zzso animals in all strains zzso Four out of these proteins were verified by zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four proteins verified by zzso could be shown to be involved in training in the zzso as a global effect, independent of the strain zzso
