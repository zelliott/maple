In modern zzso and zzso major efforts are currently concentrated on creating artificial zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to a target zzso Such protein zzso possess great potential for controlling the cell metabolism as well as gene function upon light zzso This has recently been impressively demonstrated by designing a novel artificial fusion zzso connecting the zzso from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and by using it, to control the zzso of cancer cells from the zzso Although tremendous progress has been achieved on the generation of such protein zzso a detailed understanding of their signaling zzso after zzso is still in its zzso Here, we show through computer simulations of the zzso that the early processes after formation of the zzso involve the breakage of a zzso between the zzso oxygen zzso and the zzso group of zzso followed by a zzso zzso of its zzso This initial event is followed by successive events including zzso tightening and transmission of zzso stress along the zzso which leads to the disruption of the zzso from the zzso zzso Finally, this process triggers the detachment of the zzso from the zzso ultimately enabling the zzso of zzso via binding of the zzso protein zzso
