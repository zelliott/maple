In field conditions, plants may experience numerous environmental stresses at any one zzso Research suggests that the plant response to multiple stresses is different from that for individual zzso producing zzso zzso In particular, the molecular signaling pathways controlling zzso and zzso stress responses may interact and antagonize one zzso The zzso response of zzso zzso zzso to concurrent water deficit zzso zzso and infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso A unique program of gene expression was activated in response to a combination of water deficit and zzso stress, with 50 specifically zzso zzso zzso genes with potential roles in controlling the response to multiple stresses were selected and functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in roots by joint stresses but zzso zzso to drought stress and zzso infection when zzso zzso expressing plants had stunted root systems and extended root zzso Plants may produce signal peptides such as zzso to induce cell wall zzso in response to multiple zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by dual stress in leaves, zzso resistance to zzso when zzso It may regulate zzso metabolism under conditions of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in defense zzso in systemic plant zzso was zzso in leaves by joint stress and zzso drought zzso when zzso potentially as part of zzso zzso repression of pathogen response zzso The results highlight the complex nature of multiple stress responses and confirm the importance of studying plant stress factors in zzso
