zzso current electric fields zzso can induce directed cell migration in a wide variety of cells, and this has been proven to be of importance in wound zzso Here we observed the effects of zzso on cultured human retinal zzso zzso zzso cells and explored the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso 

zzso human zzso cells were exposed to an zzso at 5 zzso for 3 zzso The rate and zzso of cell migration were zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso focal zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso were performed in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

During exposure to an zzso at 5 zzso for 3 zzso the separated human zzso cells and wounded zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the cells was also polarized to the zzso and the expression in zzso and its protein level were obviously zzso Furthermore, exposure to zzso of 5 zzso triggered the zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso In contrast, blocking of zzso zzso zzso suppressed the directed migration of zzso cells and reduced the zzso of zzso in zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso exposure results in directed migration of the separated zzso cells and zzso zzso These effects may partially act through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
