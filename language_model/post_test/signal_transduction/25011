Intermediate filaments zzso which form the structural framework of zzso have been found to be dramatically reorganized during zzso Some protein zzso activated in zzso are thought to control spatial and zzso IF reorganization through zzso of IF zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the putative targets of the small zzso zzso does zzso IF zzso specifically at the zzso zzso during zzso This zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the local IF breakdown and efficient separation of IF zzso Recent studies on zzso signaling pathways have introduced new models about the molecular mechanism of zzso of zzso including zzso during zzso
