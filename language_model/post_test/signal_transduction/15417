Plants vary significantly in their ability to tolerate low zzso The zzso cold response zzso has been identified in many plant species and plays a pivotal role in low temperature zzso Here, we show that zzso is a functional zzso and zzso the zzso salt and zzso stress tolerance of transgenic zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso caused zzso and late flowering zzso which could be rescued by zzso application of zzso zzso zzso zzso contents were significantly lower in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the transcript levels of the zzso zzso genes were higher in zzso than in zzso plants, whereas the zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso related genes in different regulatory pathways were also affected by zzso which may account for the flowering delay zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso exhibited decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso which is associated with repression of expression of zzso and zzso zzso two key components in the zzso zzso
