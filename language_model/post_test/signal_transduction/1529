Endurance exercise training promotes zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and enhances muscle zzso capacity, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly zzso To investigate this zzso process, we generated transgenic mice that selectively express in skeletal muscle a zzso active form of zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso muscles from these mice showed zzso zzso DNA replication and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso involved in fatty acid metabolism and electron zzso and reduced zzso to fatigue during repetitive zzso zzso induced expression of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso 1 zzso a master regulator of zzso zzso in zzso and activated the zzso gene promoter in cultured zzso Thus, a zzso signaling zzso controls zzso zzso in zzso zzso
