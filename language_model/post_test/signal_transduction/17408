Increased serum levels of zzso are reported in type 1 diabetes zzso Here we report elevated serum soluble zzso levels in human zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso we generated double transgenic mice with pancreatic zzso expression of zzso and zzso The mice developed zzso marked zzso cell zzso zzso destruction, and zzso zzso that mimic early human zzso The diabetes in this model was reversed by zzso zzso signaling with zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso Furthermore, the diabetes could be reversed by administration of the zzso zzso 2/3 inhibitor zzso which blocks zzso zzso In an alternative diabetes model, zzso diabetic mice, zzso expression was increased in zzso cells in the zzso stage, and zzso of zzso signaling with zzso at the zzso stage delayed diabetes zzso In support of the view that these observations reflect the conditions in humans, we demonstrated pancreatic zzso expression of both zzso and zzso in human zzso Taken together our data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso zzso and the zzso system and its signaling zzso may be rational therapeutic targets for early zzso
