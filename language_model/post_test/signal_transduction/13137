In the current study, we show that bone zzso proteins zzso play a role in zzso that is independent of their function in specifying zzso zzso zzso When zzso activity is zzso or inhibited in zzso zzso zzso precursors are specified properly but few mature zzso are zzso zzso cellular defects zzso this loss of zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso precursors to undergo zzso cell death, whereas zzso zzso of zzso causes an increase in commitment of zzso zzso to zzso differentiation and a zzso decrease in zzso that is not due to enhanced zzso These blood defects are observed even when zzso activity is zzso solely in zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso generate zzso signals that regulate zzso independent of zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso zzso protein zzso IV zzso zzso is required to zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso downstream of zzso zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso zzso zzso signals by zzso a zzso possibly zzso zzso protein zzso that recruits limiting amounts of zzso binding protein zzso away from zzso complexes functioning downstream of zzso
