zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expressed signaling zzso that plays an integral role in development and zzso of B zzso B cell zzso zzso proliferation is completely blocked either in cells lacking the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso or in zzso cells treated with pharmacological zzso zzso However, the contribution of zzso to early signaling events has not been fully zzso Here we show that B cells lacking zzso have signaling zzso that are both zzso and zzso different from those in cells treated with zzso zzso Loss of zzso results in partial reductions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso is not zzso Moreover, although zzso zzso is partially reduced, zzso of several proteins downstream of zzso is zzso These partial zzso suggest that there are other routes to zzso zzso in B cells apart from zzso zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso restores zzso proliferation in zzso cells but not zzso cells treated with zzso zzso These findings suggest that the primary zzso signaling zzso in B cells lacking zzso is a failure to activate zzso signaling zzso most likely protein zzso zzso
