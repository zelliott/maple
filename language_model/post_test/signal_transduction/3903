In Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the cloned human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked increases in zzso monitored by digitized video imaging of zzso zzso zzso At zzso around 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were blocked by elimination of zzso zzso by a zzso C zzso zzso by a protein zzso C zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At higher zzso zzso induced a single zzso zzso rise consisting of a large peak followed by a lower sustained zzso while the response turned into zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was eliminated or a zzso inhibitor was zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso acid, and this was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso acid caused an increase in zzso which was dependent upon zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso might be involved, at least in part, in the zzso influx that maintains the sustained plateau phase of zzso as well as the zzso zzso when zzso receptors are zzso
