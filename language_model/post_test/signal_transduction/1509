zzso zzso is expressed along the route of neural growth from spiral zzso zzso zzso towards the developing organ of zzso and has been shown to enhance zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso in zzso Signal zzso pathways linking zzso signaling at the cell membrane to the cell nucleus can involve a variety of signaling zzso Data from other systems suggest the potential involvement of the small G protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso To assess these possibilities, the length and number of processes extending from zzso zzso cultured on zzso surfaces were evaluated after treatment with the Ras inhibitor zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which operates immediately upstream of the zzso zzso Treatment with the Ras inhibitor at levels known to inhibit the zzso and zzso zzso had no effect, while zzso levels known to inhibit zzso reduced only zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a decrease of both zzso while incubation with the zzso inhibitor had no zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso plays a central role in zzso signaling in zzso zzso While zzso signaling may participate in zzso increases in zzso zzso the zzso increase in zzso number appears to be activated by a different zzso zzso
