We modeled the zzso of drug binding to protein zzso in the zzso signaling zzso relevant to zzso lung cancer and found that binding zzso could influence therapeutic potential, that fast binding zzso was advantageous for most targets with a couple of exceptions, that targeting some protein zzso could enhance rather than zzso the pathway, and that zzso could be sensitive to the kinetic parameters of drug zzso
