Although zzso zzso zzso pathways in some species, the role of zzso as a regulator of zzso function in the pig has not been zzso zzso the primary objective of this study was to determine whether zzso influences specific zzso response variables in the pig in zzso or in zzso Fifteen pigs (five pigs per zzso were 1) injected with zzso human zzso and allowed to consume feed ad zzso 2) injected with vehicle and allowed to consume feed ad zzso or 3) injected with vehicle and zzso to the intake of the zzso zzso All the pigs also were injected with the zzso zzso zzso on d 0 and 15 of the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso daily feed intake and zzso zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso proliferation or zzso zzso In a second series of experiments, peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were isolated from zzso blood to determine the effect of stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso on the long form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine whether zzso altered zzso zzso zzso production, or signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the proliferation of zzso or on zzso zzso abundance or zzso The abundance of zzso zzso was decreased zzso zzso zzso in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso DNA binding was evident in mobility shift zzso but was not altered by either zzso or serum zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and that zzso expression is zzso in response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso coupled with the absence of zzso zzso indicates an alternative signaling zzso for zzso in pig zzso
