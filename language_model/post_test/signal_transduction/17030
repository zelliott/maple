zzso is a tightly regulated process: cellular zzso decisions cannot be accidental and must be zzso Since the suicide program may be initiated in response to numerous stress zzso signals transmitted through a number of checkpoints have to be eventually zzso 

In order to analyze possible mechanisms of the integration of multiple zzso signals, we constructed a simple model of the zzso family regulatory zzso The module collects upstream signals and processes them into zzso decisions by employing interactions between proteins from three zzso of the zzso family: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso single domain zzso zzso Although the model is based on ordinary differential equations zzso it demonstrates that the zzso family module behaves akin to a zzso logic gate of the type dependent on levels of zzso proteins zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso A low level of zzso Bad or a high level of zzso zzso implies gate zzso which allows for the initiation of zzso only when two stress stimuli are simultaneously present: the rise of the zzso killer level and zzso of zzso zzso In turn, a high level of Bad or a low level of zzso implies gate zzso for which any of these stimuli zzso for zzso 

Our study sheds light on possible signal integration mechanisms in cells, and spans a bridge between modeling approaches based on zzso and on zzso zzso In the proposed zzso logic gates switching results from the change of relative zzso of interacting proteins in response to signals and involves system zzso zzso the regulatory system may process two analogous zzso into a digital zzso zzso
