zzso zzso zzso has become a powerful tool to determine gene zzso Different methods of expressing the short zzso zzso zzso zzso required for interference in zzso systems have been developed, including the introduction of si (short zzso zzso by direct zzso or driven from zzso plasmids or zzso zzso zzso zzso (short zzso zzso Although zzso relies upon a high degree of zzso recent findings suggest that zzso zzso effects can be zzso We found that zzso of zzso can results in an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and global zzso of zzso zzso This effect is zzso in part by the zzso protein zzso zzso as this zzso is activated by the 21 zzso zzso and is required in response to the zzso However, the zzso factor zzso zzso factor 3) is also activated by zzso as a primary response, resulting in the stimulation of genes independent of an zzso zzso In cells deficient in zzso this response is zzso but can be restored by zzso of zzso Thus zzso induce complex zzso responses in target cells, leading to effects beyond the selective zzso of specific zzso
