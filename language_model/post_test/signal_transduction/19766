zzso recruitment of zzso from the blood into zzso zzso and zzso patches is zzso by high zzso zzso zzso specialized blood vessels found in secondary zzso zzso except for the zzso The zzso are distinguished from other types of blood vessels by their tall and plump zzso cells, and by their expression of specific zzso and zzso zzso which all contribute to the selective zzso trafficking across these blood zzso The development of zzso is zzso zzso and they appear zzso in the zzso High zzso zzso can appear zzso for instance in chronically inflamed zzso Given that zzso enable the efficient trafficking of zzso into zzso the induction of zzso at a tumor site could zzso zzso immune responses, and the artificial manipulation of zzso zzso might thus provide a new tool for cancer zzso However, the process of zzso development and the mechanisms by which the unique features of zzso are maintained are incompletely zzso In this review, we discuss the process of zzso zzso and development during zzso and their molecular requirements for maintaining their unique characteristics under zzso zzso
