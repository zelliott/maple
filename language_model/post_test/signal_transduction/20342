zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso zzso but the underlying signaling mechanism remains zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso transition pore zzso opening and zzso zzso to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso Human cardiac zzso and zzso rat cardiac zzso were exposed to hydrogen zzso with or without zzso with zzso human zzso zzso Cell zzso and zzso opening were zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was detected by western zzso zzso The results showed that zzso induced zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso inhibited zzso and activated zzso in the presence of zzso and further protected the cells from zzso zzso However, zzso failed to inhibit zzso opening and cell zzso in the presence of zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso activates zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso events in cardiac zzso subjected to zzso zzso
