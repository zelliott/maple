zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the committed step in the production of zzso which are major components of cellular zzso seed storage zzso and zzso wax zzso While the zzso activities of zzso have been characterized in detail, the cellular features of these zzso are only beginning to zzso Here we characterized the zzso relationships and cellular properties of two zzso zzso from the relatively large zzso zzso zzso family, including zzso which is involved in zzso zzso and zzso which is a new putative zzso that has extensive zzso with a zzso from zzso cells involved in storage oil formation and, thus, may have a similar role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that both proteins were localized to the zzso zzso zzso and differential zzso experiments indicated that their zzso and zzso were oriented towards the zzso However, these two proteins contained distinct types of zzso retrieval signals, with zzso possessing a divergent type of zzso motif zzso rather than the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso possessing a zzso zzso motif zzso where zzso are large zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the divergent zzso motif in zzso only functioned effectively when additional upstream zzso were included to provide the proper protein zzso zzso zzso analyses of the divergent zzso zzso based upon sequences present in the zzso of other zzso from various plant species, further expanded the functional definition of this molecular targeting zzso thereby providing insight to the targeting signals in other zzso family members as well as other zzso membrane proteins within plant zzso
