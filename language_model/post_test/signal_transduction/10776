zzso (for breast tumor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally identified from a human zzso breast zzso and its zzso is frequently observed in breast cancer and several other cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which this zzso zzso in zzso remains poorly zzso In the present study, we not only identified zzso as the binding partner and zzso of zzso but also discovered a novel signaling zzso by which zzso mediates zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso stimulation activates the zzso activity of zzso which in turn zzso zzso at zzso and zzso These zzso events promote the zzso of small zzso zzso via the function of zzso Through this pathway, zzso is capable of promoting cell zzso and invasion and functions as a zzso of zzso migration and zzso In accordance with these functional roles, zzso zzso to membrane ruffles, where it zzso with zzso during cell zzso Together, our findings identify novel signaling and biological roles of zzso and indicate the first potential link between zzso and zzso zzso
