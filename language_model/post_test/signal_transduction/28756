zzso between zzso zzso cells and their surrounding zzso govern the normal development and function of the zzso zzso zzso of these interactions can induce abnormal zzso signaling pathways that affect the development and progression of breast zzso One critical component of zzso zzso development, as well as breast cancer zzso is the expression of zzso zzso In a previous study using cultured zzso zzso zzso cells, we found that the basement membrane zzso zzso and zzso were involved in maintenance of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and that this response could be zzso with by zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we use zzso normal zzso zzso zzso cells to dissect the promoter region of the zzso that is involved in the selective response to basement zzso We also analyze the zzso of this response in zzso cells, a zzso cell line that shares a common lineage with the zzso cells, to provide insight into the relative zzso of zzso and the zzso to basement membrane regulation found in those zzso zzso Evidence is presented to show the relevance of the zzso between different signaling pathways in the constitution of a functional tissue organization and how this integration may be disrupted in the zzso zzso
