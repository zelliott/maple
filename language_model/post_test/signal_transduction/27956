The effects of the zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso on insulin signaling was studied in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso were cultured in the absence zzso zzso or in the presence of 100 zzso of a cholesterol zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alters cholesterol and zzso content of zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso a decrease in insulin responsiveness and creates an zzso state in these zzso Exposure to 100 zzso of zzso resulted in a significant enhancement of zzso zzso in control and cholesterol zzso zzso In control cells, zzso altered zzso in a zzso zzso In cholesterol zzso cells, zzso inhibited zzso zzso but restored zzso zzso zzso to understand the mechanism of zzso action, we analyzed early steps in the insulin signaling pathway, including insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, in both control and cholesterol zzso zzso Overall, the results suggest that zzso may interact with the insulin zzso and/or a component involved in the early steps of insulin signal zzso
