An emphasis in early detection and more effective treatments has decreased the mortality rate of breast zzso Despite this decrease, breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of death among women between 40 and 55 years of age and is the second overall cause of death among zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of zzso a zzso isolated from several plant species, which has been reported to have zzso and/or zzso effects in skin, zzso zzso and lung zzso The effect of zzso on cell proliferation was evaluated using four human breast zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso by cell count and zzso Moreover, zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and DNA zzso Gene expression changes following zzso treatment in zzso cells was assessed through zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso was found to inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell lines tested with a range of 37% to zzso The highest zzso was noted for the zzso cell line zzso An arrest at the S phase of the cell cycle and zzso were shown in the zzso cells treated with zzso The zzso profile indicated differential expression of two independent zzso including clusters of zzso and zzso signaling genes in cells as a result of zzso zzso These studies support the zzso effects of zzso in human breast cancer cells and, perhaps more importantly, illustrate novel actions by zzso in the zzso signaling zzso
