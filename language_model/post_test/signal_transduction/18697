zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are characterized by insulin resistance and muscle zzso but whether the insulin resistance associated with these disorders contributes to muscle zzso is zzso We examined this question in zzso mice with increased blood zzso despite high levels of plasma zzso Compared with control zzso mice, the weights of different muscles in zzso mice and the zzso areas of muscles were zzso In muscle of zzso mice, protein degradation and activities of the major zzso systems, zzso and the zzso were zzso We examined signals that could activate muscle zzso and found low values of both zzso 3 zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso that were related to zzso of zzso 307 of insulin zzso zzso To assess how changes in circulating insulin and zzso affect muscle zzso we treated zzso mice with zzso zzso improved zzso of insulin resistance and abnormalities in zzso signaling and decreased activities of zzso and the zzso in muscle leading to suppression of zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso include increased zzso production, decreased circulating zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso factor associated with increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These abnormalities were also corrected by zzso Thus, insulin resistance causes muscle wasting by mechanisms that involve suppression of zzso signaling leading to zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso causing muscle protein zzso
