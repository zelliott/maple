Human zzso zzso infections trigger acute zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and zzso The human airway zzso cell is the primary site of zzso infection and responds to infection with altered expression of multiple zzso the products of which could regulate the outcome to zzso zzso smoking zzso asthma symptoms, and is also the zzso risk factor for the development and progression of zzso zzso therefore, examined whether cigarette smoke extract zzso zzso viral responses by altering zzso zzso gene zzso zzso cultures of human zzso zzso cells were exposed to medium alone, zzso alone, zzso zzso alone or to zzso zzso After 24 zzso zzso were collected and total cellular zzso was zzso Gene array analysis was performed to examine zzso zzso Additional experiments, using real-time zzso zzso and/or western zzso validated altered expression of selected gene zzso zzso and zzso each induced groups of genes that were largely independent of each zzso When compared to gene expression in response to zzso alone, cells treated with zzso showed no obvious differences in zzso gene zzso By contrast, compared to gene induction in response to zzso alone, cells exposed to zzso showed marked suppression of expression of a number of zzso genes associated with various functions, including zzso defenses, zzso viral signaling and airway zzso These changes were not associated with altered expression of type I or type III zzso Thus, zzso alters zzso responses to zzso infection in a manner that may zzso impact zzso and host defense zzso
