The requirement of vitamin A zzso for successful completion of zzso zzso is well zzso zzso signaling involves a zzso zzso event in which zzso is first converted to zzso and then retinal is converted to the active zzso zzso acid, which zzso the zzso activity of a nuclear zzso acid zzso zzso During mouse zzso zzso acid is not detected at zzso days of embryonic development zzso when zzso first zzso but it is detected at zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso signaling during zzso may be initiated during the primitive streak zzso Here we have used zzso in zzso zzso to examine zzso mouse zzso for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso class IV alcohol zzso zzso and class I zzso zzso zzso which have been shown to have zzso and retinal zzso activities, zzso At zzso zzso alpha zzso was expressed zzso in embryonic and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso was detected throughout all embryonic zzso but zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso By zzso zzso alpha zzso was still zzso zzso beta zzso was now observed in zzso zzso zzso and adjacent zzso zzso gamma zzso was still observed in all embryonic zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso were now both expressed in primitive streak zzso In zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was still zzso zzso beta zzso was present in the zzso zzso as well as the closed neural tube and zzso zzso gamma zzso was widespread but most prevalent in zzso embryonic zzso and zzso for both zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso two zzso zzso able to convert zzso to zzso acid, are both initially expressed in primitive streak zzso at zzso when zzso acid is first zzso On the other hand, zzso alpha and zzso gamma expression is widespread and present at zzso prior to zzso acid zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression in primitive streak zzso may lead to zzso acid synthesis and initiation of zzso signaling during mouse zzso
