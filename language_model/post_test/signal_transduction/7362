The kidney zzso zzso is a key target in many forms of acute kidney injury zzso The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the normal zzso zzso zzso of filtered zzso including zzso zzso and markers of zzso By zzso the zzso of zzso zzso plays an essential role in the development of some types of zzso However, zzso also mediates the zzso zzso of molecules implicated in the protection against zzso and changes in zzso expression have been demonstrated in zzso in animal zzso Thus, zzso of zzso expression in response to zzso may be an important part of the zzso cell zzso to cellular protection and zzso and should be further investigated as a potential target of zzso This review explores current evidence linking zzso expression and function to the development, diagnosis, and progression of zzso as well as zzso protection against zzso
