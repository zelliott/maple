In response to the zzso activity of zzso there is an increase in the membrane association of the novel protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell Growth zzso 6, zzso We report here that in zzso cells zzso delta zzso with zzso and is zzso on zzso The zzso zzso delta had reduced zzso activity relative to the zzso zzso delta from zzso zzso The association between zzso and zzso delta was dependent upon both an active zzso zzso and membrane zzso The association between zzso zzso and zzso delta was substantially enhanced by mutating a zzso zzso site at zzso in zzso to Ala indicating that zzso delta zzso of zzso at zzso zzso the interaction, possibly in a negative feedback zzso These data demonstrate that upon recruitment of zzso delta to the membrane in zzso cells there is the formation of a zzso delta complex in which zzso delta becomes zzso on zzso and zzso
