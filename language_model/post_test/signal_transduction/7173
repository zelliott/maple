The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular responses to both moderate environmental challenges and tissue damaging insults in various zzso zzso zzso including the nervous zzso zzso and zzso functions of zzso in zzso are zzso through zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso signaling zzso that modify the zzso of zzso zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent key components of two important zzso zzso zzso Our previous study on insects revealed zzso and zzso functions of zzso human zzso zzso similar to those in zzso nervous zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso effectively zzso primary cultured locust brain zzso from zzso cell death induced by zzso or the chemical compound zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso abolished protective effects of zzso on locust brain zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso with zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso mediates the protection of locust brain zzso through interference with zzso pathways by the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The involvement of similar zzso pathways in zzso and insects for the mediation of zzso and support of neural zzso by zzso indicates that an zzso zzso signaling system with high structural and functional similarity exists in both groups of zzso zzso signaling involved in tissue protection appears to be an ancient beneficial function shared by zzso and zzso
