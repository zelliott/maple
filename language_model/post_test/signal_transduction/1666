zzso nerve injury results in a series of events culminating in degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the time period between zzso and zzso degradation zzso h in zzso there is calcium entry and zzso of zzso within the zzso The precise timing of these events during this period is zzso In the present study, zzso were generated to three distinct zzso zzso of zzso and a fusion protein zzso was generated to the intrinsic zzso inhibitor zzso These zzso were used to measure changes in these proteins in mouse zzso nerves during zzso zzso In zzso nerve zzso and cultured zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was significantly reduced in zzso nerves very early after nerve injury, long before zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein remained low as compared to control nerves for the remainder of the zzso time zzso No changes in zzso protein were zzso zzso treatment of animals with the zzso inhibitor zzso partially prevented the rapid loss of zzso zzso zzso of calcium in zzso cultures had the same zzso These data indicate that zzso protein is lost very early after zzso injury, and likely reflect zzso and degradation of this protein long before the zzso is zzso zzso zzso may be an early event in a zzso cascade that is initiated by zzso injury and culminates with zzso zzso
