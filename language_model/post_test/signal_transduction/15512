The directed differentiation of zzso zzso types from human embryonic stem cells zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso differentiate to zzso zzso with a predominantly zzso identity in a chemically defined medium without known zzso This is attributed to zzso zzso zzso which zzso the truncated form of zzso a zzso of sonic zzso zzso A high concentration of zzso or the zzso of zzso by zzso 1 zzso together with a low concentration of zzso almost completely converts the primitive zzso precursors to zzso zzso which is partially achieved through both zzso of the truncated zzso and zzso of full-length zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso zzso differentiate to functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, although zzso generate zzso zzso cells, as opposed to zzso zzso in other zzso in the absence of zzso zzso human cells use a similar molecular mechanism to control the zzso versus zzso zzso The coordination of zzso and zzso signaling through zzso represents a novel mechanism that regulates zzso patterning in the development of zzso zzso zzso
