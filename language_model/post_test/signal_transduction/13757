zzso resident zzso zzso cells zzso contribute to tissue zzso through various mechanisms, including the zzso of zzso factors that act directly on zzso stem cells to promote zzso However, zzso in zzso constitute a zzso population of zzso cells and different zzso may have different zzso In this study we show that zzso and zzso lung zzso cells have different zzso and zzso zzso zzso lung zzso cells exhibit high zzso potential with the capacity to differentiate along the zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso lung zzso cells have limited zzso potential and are committed to the zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso lung zzso cells do not share the same zzso capacity as their zzso counterparts, which support the growth of lung zzso stem cell zzso colonies in zzso In addition, ex zzso expansion of lung zzso cells also resulted in the loss of zzso capacity, which could be reinstated by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso We show that zzso capacity correlated with the level of zzso expression and the zzso of several lung zzso zzso In zzso these studies suggest that zzso signaling in zzso cells acts upstream of zzso to regulate zzso stem cell growth in the adult zzso
