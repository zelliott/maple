Central administration of zzso factor zzso elicits a specific pattern of behavioral responses resembling a zzso state and is zzso in zzso models of zzso 

zzso behaviors evoked by the administration of zzso were zzso The roles of zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso and zzso systems in zzso these responses were zzso 

zzso zzso and head shakes were zzso in rats following zzso administration of zzso and zzso II and after zzso with zzso The role of zzso zzso in the behavioral responses to zzso zzso zzso was examined following zzso with the zzso zzso and that of zzso after depletion using systemic administration of zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso and zzso zzso caused robust increases in zzso zzso and head zzso but zzso II was zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso pathways blocked spontaneous burying behavior zzso by zzso and zzso burying directed towards an zzso shock zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso selectively attenuated zzso zzso 

zzso behavioral responses produced by zzso zzso zzso and head shakes appeared to be zzso through the zzso zzso zzso burying behavior evoked by zzso or zzso burying directed towards a shock probe was disrupted by zzso of the zzso zzso bundle and may represent zzso behavior caused by zzso zzso of the locus zzso In contrast, zzso increases in grooming were dependent on zzso
