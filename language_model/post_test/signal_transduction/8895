To investigate the differential expression of different types of zzso in zzso normal scars and normal skins and its possible zzso zzso 

zzso and Western zzso methods were used to examine the expression of zzso zzso and proteins level in 10 cases of zzso in 10 cases of normal zzso and in 10 cases of normal skin zzso and zzso zzso of zzso normal zzso and normal skin were cultured in zzso The expression difference were compared and analyzed by zzso there was statistical difference when P zzso zzso 

The zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso were significantly down regulated in zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal skin zzso zzso zzso However, no significant difference of the zzso and protein expression of zzso 3 and the protein expression of zzso of zzso 3 in zzso normal scar, normal skin zzso and zzso 

The decreased expression of zzso in zzso might play a significant role in the increased zzso signal zzso which can not be terminated by zzso negative feedback zzso
