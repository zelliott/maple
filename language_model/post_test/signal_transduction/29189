Recent studies have emphasized the value of including structural information into the zzso analysis of protein zzso Here, we zzso structural information to investigate the role of intrinsic disorder in these zzso zzso proteins tend to be more zzso than other proteins zzso the zzso zzso however, we find this only true for those with one or two binding zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the distribution of zzso zzso in zzso hubs is indistinguishable from the overall zzso Surprisingly, we find that the binding zzso in zzso hubs are highly zzso as is the case for zzso zzso However, the binding partners of zzso hubs tend to have a higher level of disorder than the zzso average, suggesting that their binding zzso is related to the disorder of their binding zzso In turn, the higher level of disorder of zzso hubs can be partly explained by their tendency to bind to each other in a zzso A good illustration of this trend can be found in signaling pathways and, more specifically, in zzso zzso Finally, our findings have implications for the current controversy related to party and zzso
