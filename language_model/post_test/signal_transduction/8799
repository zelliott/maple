zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso signaling and zzso of zzso natural zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso cells play a central role in the regulation of zzso and protective immune responses against pathogens and zzso In the present study, we tested the effect of zzso zzso lethal toxin zzso on zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso zzso is a zzso toxin known to suppress host immune responses during anthrax disease and zzso cells by protective zzso zzso zzso delivery of lethal factor zzso a potent zzso We observed that zzso cells expressed anthrax toxin receptors zzso and zzso and bound more PA than other immune cell zzso A zzso dose of zzso administered in zzso in zzso mice decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells but not by zzso zzso The in zzso administration of zzso led to decreased zzso zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso Further analysis revealed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells attributable to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso causes a novel form of functional zzso in zzso cells and therefore has potential for contributing to immune evasion by the zzso
