The majority of zzso zzso maintain the expression of the cell growth zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso However, we find that zzso of zzso tumors show an uncommon zzso zzso of zzso zzso associated with high zzso zzso To reproduce such a situation, a zzso zzso devoid of its zzso zzso signal was generated zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso and fails to induce growth arrest in 2 different cell lines, indicating that zzso zzso is inactive as a growth zzso presumably because it does not interact with nuclear zzso zzso of zzso D3 may account in part for zzso zzso zzso In zzso tumors and cell lines, zzso D3 expression was associated with zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, expression of zzso D3 in zzso zzso cells induced zzso retention of zzso zzso and rescued zzso growth zzso zzso zzso also localized zzso to the zzso in normal zzso engineered to zzso zzso zzso D3 zzso zzso In these cells, zzso D3 induced the formation of zzso zzso zzso complexes, which zzso zzso away from zzso complexes that contain zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism that may contribute to overcoming the zzso zzso threshold in transformed zzso zzso
