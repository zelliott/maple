zzso zzso mediates its activities via a complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso binds zzso with low zzso but does not zzso However, when zzso combines with zzso zzso alpha zzso a signaling high affinity zzso complex for zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso alone binds zzso with high zzso but does not signal and has been zzso to be a decoy zzso zzso we investigated the cellular zzso of zzso and the regulation of its expression by zzso zzso and flow zzso in primary and cultured zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is largely an zzso zzso which is rapidly mobilized from zzso stores following treatment with zzso zzso zzso of zzso surface expression in response to zzso was zzso did not require protein zzso and resulted in diminished zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence that the zzso is predominantly an zzso zzso and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which zzso can regulate zzso zzso
