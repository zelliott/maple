Over the last 3 decades, there have been substantial improvements in diagnostic imaging and sampling techniques to evaluate pancreatic zzso The modern technology has helped us to recognize zzso conditions of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between benign and zzso zzso and early detection of any zzso transformation in zzso zzso are extremely important for further management zzso zzso zzso has limited sensitivity to further differentiate between benign, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso There is limited information about the zzso risk factors and molecular mechanisms leading to development and further progression to zzso of zzso Several studies have shown that pancreatic juice and pancreatic tissue from the zzso can be tested for molecular markers including zzso zzso and zzso to differentiate between cancer and chronic inflammatory zzso We review cellular signaling pathways that contribute to zzso of zzso of the zzso to further identify potential zzso and molecular zzso
