The mean time for a zzso zzso to activate a target protein located on the surface of a zzso can regulate cellular zzso When the zzso switches between various states induced by chemical interactions or zzso changes, while target zzso occurs in only one state, this zzso time is zzso We investigate this dynamics using new equations for the sojourn times spent in each zzso For two states, we obtain exact solutions in dimension one, and zzso ones confirmed by zzso simulations in dimension zzso We find that the zzso time is quite sensitive to changes of the switching rates, which can be used to zzso zzso Interestingly, our analysis reveals that zzso can be fast although the zzso spends most of the time zzso in the zzso zzso Finally, we obtain a new formula for the narrow escape time in the presence of zzso
