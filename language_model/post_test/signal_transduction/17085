zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso and is recognized for its role in zzso cell differentiation and as an inhibitor of tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso zzso cells to gain insight into the interplay between the immune system and development of the zzso zzso 

zzso signal zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells was measured by western zzso and synthesis of zzso and zzso by use of zzso and zzso zzso was measured using zzso and zzso kits and the role of zzso and zzso was determined by use of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso cell cultures with zzso induced zzso dependent zzso of zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso both zzso target zzso was profoundly zzso upon zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso proliferation in zzso zzso targeting of zzso almost completely zzso zzso and zzso expression as well as the zzso effect of zzso 

zzso function as an zzso regulator in zzso by zzso zzso and interfering with the zzso effect of growth factors through zzso zzso
