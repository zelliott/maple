The zzso zzso zzso regulatory system zzso zzso signals for zzso energy, and nitrogen status to fine tune regulation of the synthesis of zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso discrete mechanisms to perceive these signals leading to the formation of a zzso complex, which zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso signaling is zzso via a zzso zzso domain in the zzso region of zzso the nitrogen status is sensed via interaction with zzso signal zzso proteins and small molecular weight zzso The zzso form of the zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso to inhibit zzso zzso by zzso in zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso form of zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso zzso and that this interaction is dependent on zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the regulation of the zzso zzso interaction by zzso compared with the role of this zzso in modulating the interaction of enteric zzso proteins with their zzso We also report that the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso is abolished by zzso substitution of a single zzso acid in the zzso region of zzso zzso and that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso No association was detected between zzso zzso and the zzso region of zzso and our results demonstrate that zzso zzso directly interacts with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
