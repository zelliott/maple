Most land plants can form a root zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso In contrast, the zzso root zzso zzso is almost completely restricted to the zzso The finding that the two zzso share common signaling components in zzso suggests that the zzso younger zzso zzso has recruited functions from the more ancient AM zzso The recent advances in cloning of the genes required for zzso and AM zzso from the two model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide a unique opportunity to address biological questions pertaining to the evolution of root zzso in zzso Here, we report that nearly all cloned zzso genes required for zzso and AM zzso have their putative zzso in zzso The zzso relationship can be clearly defined on the basis of both sequence similarity and zzso zzso The results presented here serve as a prelude to the comparative analysis of zzso gene function between zzso and zzso and facilitate our understanding of how gene functions and signaling pathways have evolved to generate zzso or zzso zzso
