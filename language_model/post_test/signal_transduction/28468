To facilitate the construction of large zzso libraries of small interfering zzso zzso we have developed a dual promoter system zzso in which a synthetic DNA zzso a zzso zzso sequence is inserted between two different opposing zzso III zzso the mouse zzso and human zzso zzso Upon zzso into zzso cells, the sense and zzso strands of the duplex are transcribed by these two opposing promoters from the same template, resulting in a zzso duplex with a zzso zzso on each 3' zzso A zzso zzso protocol has been developed by using this dual promoter system that allows the production of zzso expression zzso in a zzso zzso We have shown that zzso transcribed by either the dual promoter zzso or zzso expression zzso can induce strong and zzso suppression of both zzso genes and zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso Furthermore, we have constructed an arrayed zzso expression cassette library that targets zzso genes with two zzso sequences per zzso A zzso screen of this library has revealed both known and unique genes involved in the zzso signaling zzso
