T zzso helper zzso cells represent a recently defined zzso T cell subset characterized by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and an enhanced ability to support B cells to mount zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso T helper cells are generated as separate zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso signaling in zzso cells and in zzso cells selectively stimulates zzso cell development in response to zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with this, the ability of zzso cells to produce the zzso zzso required for in zzso zzso zzso and zzso affinity maturation are both reduced in absence of type I zzso zzso Thus, our results identify type I zzso as a natural zzso that selectively supports the generation of zzso zzso resident zzso zzso
