zzso zzso zzso are rapidly recruited to zzso upon injury or zzso There, they can encounter local and/or recruited immature zzso cells zzso a zzso that could promote at least transient interactions and mutually influence the two zzso zzso Using human live blood zzso and zzso zzso we examined if these zzso actually zzso and whether this influenced DC zzso Indeed, zzso with live but not zzso zzso led to zzso of membrane zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso on zzso Whereas zzso zzso was dependent on soluble factors released by zzso as determined in cultures conducted in different chambers, cell contact was necessary for zzso and zzso zzso a process that was inhibited by zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso was zzso We also found that via a cell zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso from live as well as from zzso zzso and could thus elicit zzso T zzso zzso Altogether, our data demonstrate the occurrence of zzso between human zzso and zzso and provide new insights into the immune processes occurring upstream of the interactions between zzso and T zzso
