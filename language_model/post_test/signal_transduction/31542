zzso proteins of the zzso zzso undergo zzso to enter the zzso where they are zzso by the zzso zzso of many zzso requires an zzso complex consisting of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso We report that efficient elimination of zzso zzso proteins also involves zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso the degradation of zzso zzso proteins and triggers zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized by zzso zzso are accumulated in part as zzso form, suggesting an involvement of its zzso activity in zzso protein degradation zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso associates with the zzso membrane via zzso and the recently identified zzso complex, and its release from the membrane appears to be governed by both the zzso zzso cycle and its own zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso may promote zzso zzso to facilitate the transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso
