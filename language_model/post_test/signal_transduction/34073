zzso zzso zzso is activated by several zzso including DNA damage and zzso zzso Previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Honda, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that zzso is also induced in response to viral infections as a downstream zzso target of type I zzso zzso zzso Moreover, many zzso including zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and even zzso viruses such as zzso have evolved mechanisms designated to abrogate zzso zzso We describe a novel zzso function in the zzso of the zzso zzso We observed that infected mouse and human cells with functional zzso exhibited markedly decreased viral replication early after zzso This early zzso of viral replication was zzso both in zzso and in zzso by a zzso enhancement of zzso zzso specifically the induction of genes containing zzso response zzso Of note, zzso also contributed to an increase in zzso release from infected zzso We established that this zzso enhancement of zzso signaling is dependent to a great extent on the ability of zzso to activate the zzso of zzso regulatory factor 9, a central component of the zzso gene factor 3 zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso contributes to innate immunity by enhancing zzso zzso activity independent of its functions as a zzso and tumor zzso zzso
