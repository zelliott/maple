Many zzso genes are regulated by an zzso mechanism through modification of the zzso status of zzso sites at the zzso This study was carried out at a zzso scale to mine genes in which the zzso of zzso sites is altered in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was conducted using a zzso DNA mixture of ten normal and cancer tissue zzso A zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso sites of the whole zzso was interrogated and the resulting zzso level differences, as well as the zzso expression differences, between the normal and cancer sets for selected genes were verified in breast cell lines by zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso As a result, we identified and verified novel genes that were zzso in breast cancer, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the genes with altered zzso patterns identified the involvement of a zzso network of genes whose activity may be heavily regulated by zzso in breast zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of cellular processes relevant to zzso cellular differentiation may be intimately involved in breast zzso These findings lend zzso to the possibility of using zzso zzso in zzso patterns as zzso in zzso prognosis and assessing treatment options for breast zzso
