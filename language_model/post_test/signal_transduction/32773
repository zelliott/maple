zzso a zzso derived from zzso A, has a zzso and zzso effect to insulin in the rat zzso This effect is zzso by calcium and protein zzso C zzso Our aim was to study the possible zzso between zzso and the insulin zzso system, by using the well-studied insulin sensitive rat zzso zzso zzso First, we checked the zzso effect of zzso on insulin zzso zzso zzso inhibited insulin zzso zzso zzso This effect was not due to competition for insulin zzso Moreover, when protein zzso C zzso was blocked with zzso this effect of zzso was not zzso Next, we found a zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso by zzso In addition, zzso of the major zzso of insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also blunted and so was its association with zzso regulatory zzso of zzso Moreover, the insulin zzso of zzso zzso was also blocked by zzso Again, all these zzso effects of zzso were prevented by zzso Furthermore, zzso produced zzso zzso of insulin zzso by a zzso zzso Finally, we checked the zzso zzso of protein zzso C in zzso cells and found that a zzso zzso of this protein is zzso to the plasma zzso These findings suggest that zzso could exert its zzso effect in the zzso by interrupting the stimulation of early insulin zzso zzso as a result of zzso This interaction might have a role in the mechanisms of insulin zzso
