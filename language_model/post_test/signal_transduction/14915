The embryonic chick is able to zzso the zzso after it has been zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso cells present in the zzso zzso marginal zone zzso of the chick eye are responsible for zzso which can be induced by zzso zzso growth zzso zzso or Sonic zzso zzso Here, we reveal the mechanisms showing how zzso and zzso signaling are zzso during zzso zzso If the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso by zzso is zzso Likewise, if the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso by zzso is zzso We examined early signaling events in the zzso and found that zzso or zzso induced a robust zzso zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso also zzso the expression of several members of the zzso signaling zzso We show that zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased the number of zzso 3 zzso cells in the zzso and zzso of either zzso decreased the number of zzso zzso Additionally, both zzso and zzso signaling are required for cell survival in the zzso whereas zzso and not zzso signaling plays a role in maintaining the identity of the retinal zzso population in this zzso zzso our results support a model where the zzso and zzso pathways work together to stimulate zzso zzso
