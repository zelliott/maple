zzso zzso has been shown to improve zzso blood flow in experimental zzso This report evaluates the effects of zzso on liver zzso and zzso signal zzso in the liver tissue of septic shock patients using zzso magnetic resonance imaging and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso test was used to investigate zzso zzso 

Five septic shock patients received 150 zzso body weight zzso as an intravenous zzso injection over 15 zzso zzso was injected both prior to and following zzso administration in order to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso blood samples for zzso zzso zzso were performed 1 hour before and 1 hour after zzso zzso In addition to the zzso magnetic resonance imaging patients received two zzso magnetic resonance zzso one prior to and one 30 zzso subsequent to the onset of the zzso infusion at a zzso zzso clinical zzso for measurement of liver zzso and liver zzso signal zzso 

Following zzso infusion, the zzso signal intensity in the liver tissue showed a median decrease of zzso zzso there was a median increase in liver zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso serum concentration increased three times zzso 

A decrease in the zzso signal intensity in the liver tissue and an increase in the zzso serum concentration and in liver zzso might indicate improved liver function as a result of zzso zzso Patients with compromised zzso function, such as patients with septic shock due to zzso may therefore benefit from zzso zzso
