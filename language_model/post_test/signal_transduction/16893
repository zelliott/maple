Food security is in danger under the continuous growing threat of various stresses including climate change and global warming, which ultimately leads to a reduction in crop zzso zzso plays a very important role in many signal zzso pathways including stress zzso Different zzso stimuli trigger increases in zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso To cope with such zzso plants need to develop efficient zzso mechanisms to maintain zzso zzso The zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso which perform many fundamental processes in organisms by actively transporting zzso across cellular zzso In recent years, many studies have revealed that, as well as zzso mechanisms, zzso also play critical roles in sensing calcium fluctuations and relaying downstream signals by zzso definitive targets, thus modulating corresponding zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso is reported to play vital roles in stress zzso the presence of a unique zzso site in type zzso zzso indicates their potential role in zzso as well as zzso stress zzso The key roles of zzso in transport systems and stress zzso in cellular zzso are addressed in this zzso A complete understanding of plant zzso mechanisms under stress will allow zzso of improved crop plants, which will be crucial for food security currently observed worldwide in the context of global climate zzso Overall, this article covers zzso evolution, structural aspects of zzso and their emerging roles in plant stress zzso
