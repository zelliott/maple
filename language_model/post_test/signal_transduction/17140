zzso 1 zzso is a zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso whose function in development of the skeleton has not been examined in zzso Here we show zzso is zzso expressed in the early zzso limb bud zzso with expression becoming zzso as development zzso zzso expression is largely excluded from the critical signaling center of the zzso limb zzso the Zone of zzso zzso zzso as has been described for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2004, Science, zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso by a small subset of zzso cells and their descendants suggesting divergent regulation and function between the various zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso throughout the avian limb bud using viral zzso resulted in an zzso zzso with loss of digits from the anterior zzso although the development of more zzso elements of the zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of soft tissue and zzso were also observed, resulting from impaired zzso and failure of the anterior zzso to undergo zzso zzso instead zzso as an zzso soft tissue zzso Sonic zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso signaling were zzso and persisted later in development, however these changes were only detected late in limb development at zzso when zzso zzso would normally be zzso and increasing zzso signaling would cause termination of zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the early stages of the zzso signaling network are resistant to zzso leading to normal formation of zzso limb structures, but that later zzso zzso impaired by zzso zzso is essential for formation of the correct complement of zzso
