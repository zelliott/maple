In zzso primordial to primary zzso transition occur in the late zzso The interactions between Kit zzso zzso and its zzso zzso as well as zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso are crucial for the primordial zzso zzso It is well established that hormonal disruption zzso abnormalities in the developing zzso zzso zzso this study investigated the influence of zzso zzso on genes involved in the primordial to primary zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected with zzso zzso zzso seven times, every day) or corn oil zzso zzso starting on gestation days 83 zzso or 101 zzso Fetal zzso were excised on days 90 and 108 of zzso The proportion of primordial and primary zzso was determined, and zzso for zzso and zzso was zzso To assess zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression real-time zzso was zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso animals exhibited a greater proportion of primordial to primary zzso when compared to respective control zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso of primordial and primary zzso Both zzso zzso and protein levels and zzso zzso expression were diminished in zzso zzso zzso expression decreased at zzso and protein levels, whereas zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso our findings may indicate that the interactions between zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso are relevant to the initiation of zzso transition from primordial into primary zzso and can be affected by zzso zzso
