We identified a zzso zzso as a signal zzso that senses zzso energy levels rather than the external environment and that zzso signals for zzso zzso to zzso and other zzso behavioral responses in zzso zzso zzso in zzso are similar to the signaling domain in zzso receptors and the putative zzso domain of some zzso zzso A putative zzso site in the zzso domain of zzso shares a consensus sequence with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins that regulate gene expression in response to zzso changes, zzso and blue light, zzso A double zzso deficient in zzso and zzso which codes for the zzso zzso was negative for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each of which requires the zzso motive force and/or electron transport system for zzso We propose that zzso and zzso sense the zzso motive force or cellular zzso state and thereby integrate diverse signals that guide zzso coli to environments where zzso energy is available for zzso
