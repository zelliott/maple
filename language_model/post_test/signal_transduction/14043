Classical zzso cells zzso are specialized zzso cells zzso immunity and zzso zzso zzso decisions are largely controlled by zzso factor regulatory zzso Using an in zzso zzso targeting of zzso at various stages of DC lineage development we show that zzso is required for zzso zzso and function of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in DC zzso led to a substantial decrease in zzso zzso zzso Combined zzso zzso sequencing and gene expression analysis of zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a key gene expression regulator that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso alters zzso DC gene expression to a signature characteristic of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso caused a cellular change that diminished zzso and hampered zzso zzso DC capacity to prime zzso T cells, zzso to the significant role of zzso in specifying zzso DC identity and zzso
