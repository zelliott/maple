We previously showed that zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso blocks the survival and migration of zzso zzso Identification of in zzso zzso zzso agents that are suitable for zzso testing in zzso models in zzso will be critical for efficiently translating these agents to clinical investigation in children with zzso In this study, we investigated whether the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso effectively zzso zzso signaling required for zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cells zzso for 1 h with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated induction of zzso expression and significant zzso of zzso signaling activity and zzso of zzso in a zzso manner, in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso cell migration in response to both zzso and zzso serum at 4 and 24 h after zzso zzso with zzso for 1 h also resulted in detachment and decreased viability of zzso but not zzso cells and only after 48 h following zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso in either cell line at any time point, indicating that the zzso effects of zzso were not due to zzso cell zzso zzso similarly inhibited zzso signaling and migration of primary zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso mouse is an appropriate model for zzso testing of zzso These results indicate that zzso may be an important zzso agent for the treatment of invasive zzso particularly given evidence of its ability to cross the zzso barrier to target tumor cells, and thus warrants further in zzso testing for confirmation of zzso
