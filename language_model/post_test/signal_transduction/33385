zzso zzso factor zzso induced random migration of human zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso and zzso zzso induced both random migration and zzso Other inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso did not induce either zzso zzso exposure of zzso to zzso was sufficient for the induction of random migration, whereas zzso random migration required continued presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso had no effect on random migration induced by zzso whereas zzso movements were partially inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso inhibited movements of zzso induced by both zzso and zzso These findings also imply that some aspects of the signal zzso zzso of zzso leading to random migration is different from that of zzso Our findings suggest that cell movements are controlled through diverse signal zzso zzso
