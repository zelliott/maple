The zzso zzso zzso 4 and 6 zzso zzso pathway, governing the cell cycle restriction point, is frequently altered in breast cancer and is a potentially relevant target for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso proliferation of several zzso cancer cell lines and zzso zzso 

The basic features and abnormalities of the cell cycle in breast cancer are zzso along with their involvement in zzso signaling and zzso zzso The pharmacological features of zzso its activity in zzso models of breast cancer and the potential zzso of response are then zzso and its clinical development in breast cancer zzso A literature search on the topic was conducted through zzso and the proceedings of the main cancer zzso of recent zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso agents is a very promising treatment and Phase III clinical trials are ongoing to confirm its zzso Further, potentially useful combinations are those with drugs targeting zzso signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso Combination with chemotherapy seems more problematic, as antagonism has been reported in zzso zzso The identification of zzso factors, already explored in zzso studies, must be further refined and validated in clinical zzso
