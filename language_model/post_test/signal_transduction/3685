zzso receptors are unique members of the zzso zzso G zzso zzso family with a large zzso zzso sequence forming the zzso zzso binding zzso In a patient with zzso cell zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso that is truncated at zzso This protein retains limited zzso binding ability but cannot mediate zzso zzso To study interactions between zzso fragments defective in either zzso binding or signal zzso we zzso this truncated zzso together with a zzso zzso containing the zzso region of the zzso zzso and the TM region of the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso could not respond to human zzso zzso in producing zzso zzso with the truncated zzso zzso allowed partial restoration of zzso signaling through zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the same truncated zzso zzso with an zzso truncated zzso zzso that lacked the zzso zzso binding domain also partially restored zzso zzso Further zzso of the TM region in the zzso zzso found in the patient indicated that the zzso domain and zzso were sufficient for interactions with the N terminally truncated zzso In contrast, zzso of the N terminally truncated zzso together with zzso or soluble zzso region of the zzso zzso did not allow zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso of the anchored zzso region of the zzso zzso together with the zzso truncated zzso did not allow zzso signaling despite moderate levels of human zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso of binding zzso zzso and binding zzso zzso zzso fragments partially restores zzso signal generation and indicate the importance of zzso of the zzso zzso in the proper orientation of the zzso zzso binding zzso
