zzso and their receptors zzso have zzso zzso functions, including regulation of immune zzso However, the role of these molecules inside the immune system and the signal zzso zzso they use are largely zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso triggers a zzso program that zzso zzso T cells to zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso stimulation provoked zzso zzso into zzso raft zzso before binding with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso together with zzso zzso was rapidly incorporated into membrane zzso after zzso zzso resulting in the transport of zzso proteins into zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso of zzso did not show zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso This work identifies a novel zzso function of zzso and presents an unexpected signaling mechanism linking zzso to the tumor necrosis factor family zzso
