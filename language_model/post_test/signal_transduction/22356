The generation of robust zzso zzso immune responses requires the formation and expansion of zzso center structures within the zzso regions of the secondary zzso zzso zzso proliferation in the zzso center drives ongoing zzso selection and the generation of zzso zzso plasma and memory B zzso However, the mechanisms regulating zzso proliferation within this zzso are largely zzso Here, we report that zzso D3 is uniquely required for zzso center zzso zzso mice exhibit a zzso zzso in zzso center maturation and fail to generate an zzso zzso zzso We determined that the zzso resulted from failed zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso sustained expression of zzso D3 was found to be regulated at the level of protein stability and controlled by zzso zzso zzso 3 in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso in zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso B cells in zzso mice defines an underappreciated step in zzso center progression and zzso a role for zzso D3 in the immune response, and as a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso zzso
