The zzso molecules zzso and their zzso zzso play a zzso role in establishing the zzso zzso axis in zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso have been isolated from zzso and show a striking zzso expression pattern with respect to the primary zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to investigate their function during early development of the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed an zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso indicating a negative feedback zzso Our data further suggest that zzso signaling is required for symmetry breaking of zzso and zzso expression during zzso While zzso and zzso marker genes of the zzso zzso axis extended zzso other zzso markers of the zzso axis were not significantly zzso By contrast, expression of other zzso marker genes marking both the zzso and the directive axis were zzso Our data suggest that the logic of zzso signaling and the zzso zzso zzso differs significantly between zzso and zzso yet the double negative feedback loop detected in zzso bears systemic similarities with part of the regulatory network of the zzso axis patterning system in zzso
