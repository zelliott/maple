The most widely used animal model of zzso disorder zzso is the spontaneously zzso rat zzso which best represents the combined zzso zzso Recent evidence has revealed that a zzso strain, the zzso zzso from Charles River zzso zzso is useful as a model of the inattentive zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from Harlan zzso zzso and the Sprague zzso zzso have been suggested as zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in the zzso zzso and nucleus zzso core zzso is thought to play a significant role in the zzso of zzso but data obtained with the zzso is zzso Using high-speed zzso recordings with carbon fiber zzso we found that the zzso displayed decreased zzso zzso release versus the zzso model of zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso control did not differ from each zzso however, the control zzso released less zzso than the zzso model of zzso in the zzso zzso and less than the control zzso in the intermediate zzso The zzso had faster zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso versus both control zzso while the zzso model of zzso exhibited faster zzso zzso in the zzso versus the zzso zzso These results suggest that increased surface expression of zzso zzso may explain the more rapid zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso of these zzso models of zzso
