zzso of zzso by zzso receptors zzso and functionally related proteins is essential for host defense and innate zzso zzso recognize a wide variety of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso outer membrane protein zzso has zzso functions and triggers release of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso release was found to proceed via two distinct pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso of zzso and required the zzso signaling zzso protein zzso In contrast, release of tumor necrosis factor zzso was zzso and zzso zzso Both pathways involved zzso gene zzso Using a zzso screen, we could identify additional targets of zzso gene zzso such as the zzso and growth factors zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be major targets of zzso gene zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso via zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was induced via zzso zzso These data provide new insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso
