zzso zzso contains a functional mating response zzso that is similar to the well-studied system of zzso zzso We have characterized a regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso in zzso zzso with sequence similarity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso which had been designated zzso causes an opaque zzso zzso of strain zzso to show hypersensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso This hypersensitivity generates an enhanced cell cycle arrest detected in halo zzso but reduces the overall mating efficiency of the zzso zzso profiling of the zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso shows a pattern of gene induction similar to that observed in zzso cells, but the responsiveness is zzso This involvement of an zzso in the sensitivity to zzso is consistent with the prediction that the mating response zzso in zzso zzso requires the zzso of a zzso G zzso
