Cell line studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso and can result in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The current study therefore aims to establish if this has relevance to the development of clinical zzso zzso was employed to investigate the expression and zzso status of zzso and zzso in matched zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso from 68 zzso In the zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso was associated with shorter time to death from zzso zzso However, when an increase in expression in the transition from zzso to zzso prostate cancer was investigated, an increase in expression of zzso was associated with decreased time to zzso zzso zzso and an increase in expression of zzso and zzso were associated with decreased zzso survival zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso also strongly correlated zzso zzso in the zzso prostate zzso These results provide evidence using clinical zzso that zzso of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso during development of zzso suggesting that this zzso could be a potential therapeutic zzso
