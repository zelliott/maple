We investigated the membrane trafficking of zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells to clarify the zzso zzso of zzso permeated by zzso zzso was found to promote within 60 zzso the zzso of zzso from the zzso fraction to the plasma zzso This increased trafficking of zzso was suppressed by zzso C and protein zzso C zzso zzso and a zzso zzso accelerated the trafficking of zzso to the membrane zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso did not have any effect on the increased in trafficking of zzso by zzso and an zzso zzso did not affect the trafficking of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso was detected upon the treatment with zzso and the zzso transitional pattern of this zzso paralleled that of the increased trafficking of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the trafficking of zzso
