zzso oxygen species zzso are involved in the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso In this setting the role of zzso zzso an important source of zzso as second zzso is not completely zzso In particular in human cells detailed insights into this mechanism are zzso We investigated the role of zzso II and zzso growth factor zzso AA induced zzso generation derived from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso protein (AP) 1 in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Both zzso II and zzso AA induced zzso generation in zzso which was zzso type 1 zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated both zzso II and zzso AA induced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso AA but not zzso II induced zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso AA both activated the zzso zzso factor zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso in human zzso in response to zzso II and zzso AA is zzso via generation of zzso zzso This highlights the crucial role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso II and zzso AA induced signal zzso zzso
