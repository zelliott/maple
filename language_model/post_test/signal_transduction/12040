The existence of breast cancer zzso cells zzso has profound implications for cancer zzso zzso a zzso zzso found in soy products, has multiple robust zzso effects in various zzso especially in the breast and prostate zzso In this study, we aimed to evaluate zzso zzso of zzso and its potential mechanism by zzso zzso breast cancer cells and zzso these cells into nude zzso 

Cell zzso colony formation and cell zzso analysis were used to evaluate the effect of zzso on breast cancer zzso growth, proliferation and zzso We then used zzso formation zzso and zzso zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso A nude mice zzso model was employed to determine whether zzso could target zzso in zzso as assessed by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso The potential mechanism was investigated utilizing real-time zzso western zzso analysis and zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the zzso breast cancer zzso growth and proliferation and promoted zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso decreased breast cancer stem cells, and inhibited breast cancer zzso cells through zzso of the zzso Signaling zzso 

We demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso These findings provide support and rationale for investigating the clinical application of zzso in treating breast cancer, and specifically by targeting breast cancer stem zzso
