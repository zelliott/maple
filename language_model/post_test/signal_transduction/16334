zzso zzso is a common pulmonary complication of extreme zzso zzso lung development leads to zzso zzso but the molecular pathways that cause this arrest are zzso Lung injury and inflammation increase disease risk, but the cellular site of the inflammatory response and the potential role of localized inflammatory signaling in zzso lung zzso are not zzso In this study, we show that tissue zzso present in the fetal mouse lung mediate the inflammatory response to zzso and that zzso zzso zzso airway zzso zzso depletion or targeted zzso of the zzso signaling zzso protected airway branching in cultured lung zzso from the effects of zzso zzso also appear to be the primary cellular site of zzso production following zzso zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso in transgenic zzso was sufficient to inhibit airway zzso zzso zzso in zzso inhibited expression of multiple genes critical for normal lung development, leading to thickened lung zzso reduced airway zzso and zzso zzso We propose that fetal lung zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso by generating a localized inflammatory response that zzso zzso signals critical for lung zzso
