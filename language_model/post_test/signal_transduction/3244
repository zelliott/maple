The diversity of B cell zzso zzso zzso is generated by zzso zzso of gene segments during early B cell development, a process which bears the risk of producing zzso that recognize and lead to the destruction of zzso Traditional thoughts have mainly focused on how such zzso dangerous zzso are dealt with and in how they contribute to the development of zzso zzso However, a positive or even necessary role of zzso during B cell development has rarely been taken into zzso Now, considerable data reveal that the zzso cell zzso zzso which marks an important checkpoint during B cell development, acts as a surrogate zzso zzso This review outlines how zzso is necessary for efficient B cell development and how zzso receptors drive positive selection, leading to a diverse repertoire of zzso zzso in the mature B cell zzso
