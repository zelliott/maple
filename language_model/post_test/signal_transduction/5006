zzso a main zzso zzso component of zzso fruit, has been shown to possess zzso zzso However, its potential use for acute lung injury zzso has not yet been zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso properties of zzso using a mouse zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso 40, or 80 zzso resulted in a marked reduction in inflammatory cells and total protein concentration in the zzso zzso fluid zzso of zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso including zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly altered after treatment with zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso substantially inhibited zzso zzso wall changes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in lung zzso with evidence of reduced zzso zzso zzso In addition, we investigated potential signal zzso mechanisms that could be implicated in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may provide protective effects against zzso zzso by zzso inflammatory responses and that the zzso mechanism of action may involve blocking nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
