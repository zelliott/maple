The complement component zzso activates human mast cells via its cell surface G protein coupled zzso zzso zzso For most zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of downstream signaling pathways such as zzso zzso Previous studies in zzso zzso cells zzso G protein coupled zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in zzso zzso zzso However, the roles of these zzso on the regulation of zzso signaling and zzso release in human mast cells remain zzso 

We zzso zzso short hairpin zzso to zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human mast cell lines, zzso and zzso that zzso express zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression caused a more sustained zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso and enhanced zzso as well as zzso zzso when compared to zzso control zzso By contrast, zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso but caused a significant decrease in zzso mast cell zzso Interestingly, zzso or zzso zzso rendered mast cells more responsive to zzso for zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, it reveals the novel finding that zzso and zzso promote zzso mast cell zzso but inhibit zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso These findings thus reveal a new level of complexity for zzso regulation by zzso in human mast zzso
