zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is considered as a candidate for the zzso zzso zzso but the signaling zzso zzso by zzso remains zzso In our study, the signal zzso pathways of zzso were investigated in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso and compared to the native zzso signaling zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso binding in zzso cell membrane zzso suggesting that G protein may not be involved in zzso signaling zzso However, incubation of zzso with zzso or zzso for 5 zzso could induce an zzso of zzso zzso C zzso activity, and an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso the hydrolysate of zzso in a zzso zzso The elevated zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso could be blocked by zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso or zzso showed an increased level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, which could be reversed by zzso or zzso a selective zzso zzso These results suggest that the signaling zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso coupled with the zzso of zzso and its downstream signal zzso zzso zzso These findings are similar to those in the signaling pathways of native zzso providing some new evidence for the relationship between zzso and zzso
