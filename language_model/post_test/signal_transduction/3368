zzso binding to members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family controls essential cell fate decisions and tissue polarity during development and in zzso The zzso membrane recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical step in zzso signaling zzso but how zzso and zzso act together to drive downstream signaling events remains largely zzso Here, we use an zzso zzso zzso to uncover a mechanistically important role of the zzso zzso zzso domain and C terminal region zzso in binding a zzso zzso motif in zzso We show that cooperative use of two zzso motifs in the third zzso loop and the classic zzso motif of zzso is required for zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso in cultured cells and zzso zzso Within the complex, the zzso zzso domain mainly binds the zzso zzso tail, whereas a short region at the zzso zzso end is required to bind the zzso third loop and stabilize the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso binding to zzso is a key event in zzso signaling relay to zzso The zzso nature of the zzso interface may allow for precise regulation of the interaction in the control of zzso cellular zzso
