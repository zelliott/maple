To analyze the zzso among the western medicine action network for preventing and treating coronary heart disease zzso as well as traditional Chinese medicine zzso action network for zzso blood and zzso zzso In this article, 11 characteristic zzso values of network zzso including zzso zzso zzso were zzso The target identification model was established based on key zzso characteristic parameters in the zzso medicine intersection network with support zzso zzso Its C and y parameters were zzso zzso respectively, with the predicted zzso for positive and negative samples of zzso and zzso The predicted sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the test set samples were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides, the model was applied to predict potential action targets of the zzso blood and zzso stasis zzso intersection network, and 180 positive zzso and 42 negative zzso were zzso In this article, 9 positive zzso including zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor, were taken as examples to analyze the action mechanism of zzso for preventing and treating zzso The results showed that the network potential key target analysis method was helpful to explore the potential action targets of zzso blood and zzso stasis zzso for preventing and treating zzso zzso supportive to reveal the action mechanism of zzso at molecular and systematic levels, and significant in guiding the research and development of new zzso
