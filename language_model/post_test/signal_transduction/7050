Early coronary zzso of the zzso zzso is a desired therapeutic goal for the preservation of zzso zzso However, zzso itself causes additional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso C zzso cascade has been implicated in the zzso effects occurring after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls cellular zzso levels by converting zzso to zzso acid, and may act as an zzso regulator of zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the functional role of zzso in cardiac injury after zzso in in zzso mouse zzso We generated transgenic mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso The left anterior descending coronary artery was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso in zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso activity of zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased after zzso in zzso mouse zzso However, in zzso mice, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was attenuated compared to zzso zzso After zzso Evans zzso zzso double zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso showed that zzso mice had significantly larger zzso zzso and larger numbers of zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso revealed that left zzso zzso function was more severely depressed in zzso mice than in zzso mice after zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso injury by zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
