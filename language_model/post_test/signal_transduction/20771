zzso receptors activated by zzso acids were investigated with zzso techniques in zzso zzso zzso of the channel zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to act predominantly on different zzso zzso sites, activated zzso inward currents with zzso of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at membrane zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Different zzso acids were shown to induce responses in the same sensory zzso however, the zzso and the zzso of the observed whole cell currents differed among the stimuli and may therefore reflect zzso of different zzso acid zzso types or combinations of zzso types in these zzso zzso zzso currents appeared to have diverse zzso dependence and could also be classified according to the zzso of the spontaneous channel fluctuations underlying the zzso zzso A mean single-channel zzso zzso of 360 zzso was estimated from small noise zzso currents evoked by zzso within the same zzso zzso in which a mean gamma value of zzso zzso was estimated from zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso fired bursts of action zzso in response to either zzso acid stimulation or application of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels underlying generation of action zzso were similar in these zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked large zzso current zzso and single-channel zzso of zzso zzso and 110 zzso were obtained from the discrete current zzso These results suggest that in addition to the zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso of the channel zzso possess a variety of odor receptors coupled to different types of zzso zzso
