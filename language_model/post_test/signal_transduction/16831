zzso models are useful tools to help understand zzso pathways in plant zzso A systems biology approach where models and experimental data are combined can provide zzso verifiable predictions and novel zzso The zzso insensitive 1 zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso systems in zzso with clearly described zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso is attractive for mathematical zzso approaches to understand and interpret the spatial and zzso dynamics of signal zzso zzso in zzso To establish such a model, quantitative data sets incorporating local protein zzso binding affinity and zzso state of the different zzso components are zzso zzso zzso is increasingly employed in studies of plant growth and zzso In this section, we have focused on the use of quantitative imaging of zzso zzso proteins as an entry point in zzso zzso
