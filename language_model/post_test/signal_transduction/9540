zzso zzso control embryonic development and zzso in adult zzso In zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso factor 1 zzso binds zzso zzso Our crystal structure of zzso reveals a previously unidentified binding site for zzso two zzso chains extend deep into the domain, and the head group is exposed to the zzso zzso and cellular zzso indicate that there is a zzso zzso surface zzso to the zzso head group but also zzso the five zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso crystal structure shows that zzso zzso are wrapped back, zzso with zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso site, consistent with zzso positively charged zzso on zzso zzso This combination of zzso and zzso properties suggests a modular model for the zzso of zzso and for signal zzso within zzso zzso
