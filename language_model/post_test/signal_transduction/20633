zzso immunity depends on zzso zzso that is zzso by the zzso zzso functional zzso 1 zzso The small zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso through one of its zzso zzso adapter zzso zzso We show that zzso was recruited to the zzso plasma membrane zzso through its Ras association zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which were required for zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso inhibited membrane zzso In zzso the zzso domain bound both zzso and zzso with equal but relatively low zzso whereas in zzso only zzso was required for PM zzso The zzso domain bound zzso zzso zzso and was responsible for the spatial distribution of zzso only at the PM of activated T zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso and zzso zzso and found that, despite an intervening zzso of 50 zzso the two zzso were integrated into a single structural unit, which was critical for proper zzso to the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso function as a proximity detector for activated zzso and zzso
