zzso proteins are involved in many zzso zzso in signaling pathways and zzso zzso The study of scaffolds occurring in biological systems advances at a rapid pace and recently developed engineered synthetic scaffolds enable the precise placement of components of an zzso cascade within zzso zzso Recent experimental results demonstrate significantly increased zzso of zzso zzso as a result of the zzso of a scaffold, but our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this increase is not zzso We discuss the physics of zzso transport processes relevant for these unique zzso zzso
