The vast majority of zzso signaling is zzso by zzso receptors that form central signaling components of zzso complexes incorporating zzso zzso These include the common gamma chain zzso common beta chain zzso and zzso as well as zzso These receptors have the dual tasks of zzso zzso recognition, and formation of precisely oriented zzso signaling zzso Currently, detailed structural information on a shared zzso complex exists only for zzso which is a highly zzso shared zzso signaling zzso essential for zzso cell growth and zzso To date, more than 10 different zzso bundle zzso have been identified that incorporate zzso or one of its close relatives such as zzso zzso into functional zzso signaling zzso In this review we zzso our current knowledge of shared zzso recognition and zzso with a focus on zzso We discuss recent structural and functional information to analyze overall architectural zzso of zzso zzso complexes and probe the basis for the extreme zzso of zzso for its multiple zzso zzso
