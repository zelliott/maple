Leaf growth is the central process zzso energy capture and plant zzso This is also one of the most sensitive processes to a wide range of zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso are two major zzso of expansive growth zzso zzso and structural growth zzso matter zzso we review the interaction zzso between water and zzso We detail the zzso between water and carbon zzso including the dual role of zzso and zzso in regulating water and carbon zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso the interactions between leaf water relations and zzso capacity, the links between zzso zzso model and carbon zzso and the central regulatory role of zzso zzso Then, we argue that during leaf zzso these interactions change dramatically because of zzso modifications between several anatomical and zzso features of the zzso We conclude that the control of leaf growth switches from a zzso to a zzso limitation during the course of leaf zzso Finally, we illustrate how taking leaf zzso into account provides insights into the mechanisms underlying leaf growth responses to zzso stresses that affect water and carbon relations, such as elevated zzso low light, high temperature and zzso
