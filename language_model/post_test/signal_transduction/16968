The zzso signaling zzso plays a major role in several biological systems, including vascular zzso that occurs following zzso zzso coronary zzso Recent studies have shown that the LDL zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso regulator of the zzso signaling zzso The underlying zzso details of how this regulation occurs have yet to be zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain within zzso and generates an zzso zzso with increased affinity for zzso proteins such as zzso that are involved in signaling zzso zzso is a protein zzso zzso that positively regulates the zzso pathway, and is required for zzso zzso We investigated the possibility that zzso may regulate the zzso signaling zzso by binding zzso and competing with the zzso for this zzso 

To zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso domain, we zzso an zzso with zzso zzso zzso These studies revealed high affinity binding of zzso to zzso forms of both zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso By employing the well characterized zzso zzso zzso we established that zzso zzso zzso primarily occurs within zzso zzso the same compartments in which zzso is zzso zzso by activated zzso zzso studies revealed zzso of zzso and zzso following zzso stimulation of zzso To define the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso zzso we employed zzso expressing zzso and deficient in zzso and a specific zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso forms of zzso and zzso compete for zzso zzso and that expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
