zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects in driving cancer zzso yet the signaling mechanisms of zzso are still not fully zzso Here, we provide evidence for zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream signaling zzso in multiple human cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was attributed primarily to zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated with increased cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso induced cellular addiction to zzso zzso as evidenced by the pronounced zzso of these zzso attributes upon zzso zzso Of clinical significance, we verified elevated zzso expression as a zzso marker for favorable therapeutic response in a zzso zzso cancer zzso patient cohort treated with the clinically approved zzso zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso zzso and consequential addiction to zzso signaling opens new avenues for zzso zzso cancer zzso We propose that elevated zzso expression is an important clinical zzso zzso for favorable zzso cancer zzso
