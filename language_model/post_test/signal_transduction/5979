A single zzso zzso family member is capable of initiating several different zzso including cell cycle regulation, zzso cell migration, and zzso regulation zzso It is not clear, however, how the zzso protein selects which of these processes to zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso proteins that activate zzso zzso could be important in making this zzso We show here that in zzso zzso a zzso that is zzso expressed and specific for zzso is zzso required for zzso folding and zzso but not for other processes regulated by zzso The limitation of zzso function supports the hypothesis that the zzso selects the outcome of zzso zzso zzso exerts its effects in zzso through the regulation of zzso II to orchestrate coordinated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is also regulated by zzso zzso a zzso family member that is thought to activate zzso and is itself activated by a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also play a role in the zzso events requiring zzso suggesting the existence of a zzso signaling zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso locally activate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso
