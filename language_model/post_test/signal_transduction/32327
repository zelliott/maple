Complex networks of interacting molecular components of living cells are responsible for many important zzso such as signal processing and zzso An important challenge is to understand how the individual properties of these molecular interactions and zzso transformations determine the zzso properties of biological zzso Here, we address the issue of the accuracy of signal zzso performed by a bacterial zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of bacteria to a zzso zzso has been measured zzso from bacterial zzso in a zzso zzso The observed precision of the zzso depended on environmental conditions such as the concentration and molecular makeup of the zzso In a quantitative model, we derived the zzso response function, which is essential to describing the signal zzso process involved in bacterial zzso In the presence of a zzso an zzso solution is derived that reveals connections between the zzso sensitivity and the characteristics of the signaling system, such as reaction zzso These zzso parameters are integrated into two zzso zzso one characterizes the efficiency of zzso zzso and the other is related to the dynamic range of zzso Thus, our approach explains how a particular signal zzso property affects the zzso performance of bacterial zzso We further show that the two parameters can be derived from published experimental data from a zzso zzso which successfully characterizes the performance of bacterial zzso
