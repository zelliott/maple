zzso gene induction by zzso agents or the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso was found to require zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso element of the zzso promoter was localized to a region spanning zzso zzso to the zzso start site and contains zzso binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso factors, as well as zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso All three classes of zzso factor were activated in response to zzso zzso Moreover, representative protein components of each of these zzso factor binding sites, namely zzso zzso and zzso were found to undergo zzso zzso within their respective zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated an absolute requirement for the zzso binding element in controlling zzso zzso activity of the minimal zzso zzso In addition zzso zzso and zzso binding sites were required for zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso site seems to be important for supporting activity of the zzso site, because combined deletion of both sites completely blocks zzso zzso of zzso by zzso Together these results describe novel, zzso regulation of zzso activity that requires zzso zzso of multiple zzso factors within the same region of the zzso gene zzso
