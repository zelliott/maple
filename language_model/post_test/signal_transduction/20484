The zzso zzso factor zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso of its zzso zzso leading to enhanced production of various zzso proteins through induction of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Recently, there has been considerable debate about whether zzso zzso activates zzso zzso To zzso the underlying zzso zzso we investigated zzso interaction with zzso using pulse zzso zzso generated hydrated electrons reduced the oxidized form of the zzso cluster of zzso within 2 zzso A subsequent increase in zzso in the visible region corresponding to zzso of the zzso cluster was observed on a time scale of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso inhibited this delayed zzso in a zzso fashion zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso oxidized the reduced form of zzso zzso The zzso rate constant of this process was estimated to be 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar result was observed after pulse zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of reduced zzso much more effectively in zzso zzso even at a lower concentration zzso zzso 80 zzso indicating that the zzso response is much more sensitive to zzso in zzso coli than in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins play a distinct regulatory role in the zzso of zzso
