The zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of blood pressure and body fluid zzso and it plays a key role in the zzso of several cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, cardiac zzso zzso heart failure, and zzso The importance of human zzso zzso zzso zzso is illustrated by the common use of zzso zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso It is well established that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can selectively signal through G zzso and zzso mechanisms in zzso expression systems, primary cells and in zzso The in zzso work clearly demonstrates profoundly different cellular consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cardiovascular system, suggesting pharmacological potential for drugs which specifically affect a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it is currently unknown whether the human zzso zzso zzso can signal through G zzso mechanisms - and if so, what the zzso impact of such zzso zzso We have performed a detailed pharmacological analysis of the human zzso zzso zzso using a battery of zzso zzso and registered drugs targeting this zzso We show that the human zzso zzso zzso signals directly through G zzso pathways and supports zzso cellular zzso The realization of G zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso zzso has clear pharmacological implications for development of drugs with zzso actions and defined biological zzso
