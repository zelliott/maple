zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso patch clamp technique were used to simultaneously record zzso zzso zzso and membrane currents from guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso dialysis with the zzso zzso buffer zzso enabled us to record and zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso influx alone and by additional zzso release from the zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso In freshly isolated adult zzso zzso within zzso h of zzso both types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso uniform regardless of the zzso current zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in short-term cultured zzso zzso zzso exhibited marked spatial zzso zzso frequently evoked zzso waves that zzso from either or both ends of the cardiac zzso Reduction of the zzso duration caused zzso release that was restricted to one of the two halves of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso entry signals in freshly isolated and short-term cultured zzso indicated that the spatial properties of the zzso influx signal were responsible for the spatial properties of the triggered zzso release from the zzso In freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso influx was homogeneous while in short-term cultured cells pronounced zzso zzso could be found during zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of local zzso entry zzso were likely to cause zzso restricted zzso zzso zzso The changes in the spatial properties of zzso zzso signals during short-term culture were paralleled by a decrease (to zzso in the total cell zzso In addition, zzso the zzso with the zzso dye zzso revealed that, in cultured zzso zzso membrane connected functionally to the surface membrane was reduced or zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the short-term culture of adult zzso zzso results in the zzso loss of functionally connected zzso zzso The lack of the zzso system subsequently caused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence is presented to show that in zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso release was, most probably, the result of zzso zzso entry during zzso These findings directly demonstrate the functional importance of the zzso network for uniform zzso zzso zzso
