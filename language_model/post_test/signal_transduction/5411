We recently demonstrated that the zzso steroid zzso zzso induced zzso in rat hearts through direct stimulation of collagen I zzso by cardiac zzso This stimulation was also responsible for the cardiac zzso seen in experimental zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on the development of zzso zzso in rats was zzso Four weeks of zzso infusion triggered mild zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and the appearance of zzso scars in the zzso junction of the zzso zzso also significantly increased the protein levels and nuclear zzso of the zzso factor Snail in the zzso zzso It is known that zzso of Snail is associated with zzso transition zzso during zzso zzso To examine whether zzso alone can trigger zzso we used the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso cells grown to zzso to acquire a zzso shape and have an invasive zzso The expressions of the zzso proteins collagen I, zzso and zzso were increased zzso However, the total level of zzso remained zzso These zzso in zzso cells in the presence of zzso were accompanied by elevated expression and nuclear zzso of zzso During the time course of zzso zzso did not have measurable zzso effects on the zzso pumping activity of its natural zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso may be an important factor in inducing zzso and, through this zzso elevated levels of zzso in chronic zzso failure may play a role in the progressive zzso
