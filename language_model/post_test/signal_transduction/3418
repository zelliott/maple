With the rapid zzso of zzso zzso a class of newly identified small zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso functions has become one of the central tasks in zzso zzso Traditional methods have helped in the understanding of zzso but they also have zzso In this paper, we first gave a brief review for the progress of zzso methods in zzso function zzso and next presented a new framework zzso for zzso the functions of zzso by functional analysis of a novel dimension of zzso network, the context of its zzso factors zzso in a zzso interaction zzso This dimension represents specific biological processes initiated by zzso combinations and therefore differs from traditional methods in zzso To validate the accuracy of our method, we first zzso zzso zzso zzso functions and then made a comparison with the prediction zzso The results show that even using the stringent zzso rule, our method has independently predicted zzso of the literature reported zzso functions, suggesting that zzso has a high zzso Moreover, our approach successfully predicted specific functions that could not be zzso for given zzso using traditional zzso More importantly, it can distinguish zzso from the same family, as well as those present in multiple copies that cannot be differentiated through traditional zzso This study presents a new concept and dimension for zzso function zzso zzso represents an important and novel method for zzso the function of zzso zzso is available at zzso
