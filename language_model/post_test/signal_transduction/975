The zzso zzso has been implicated in regulating plant zzso However, its precise role in this process remains zzso We have shown previously that disruption of the zzso zzso with zzso B zzso zzso strongly promoted zzso in zzso zzso These effects were most evident on a zzso as zzso that would exceed 90 degrees despite short periods of horizontal zzso To probe further the cellular mechanisms underlying these enhanced gravity responses, we extended our studies to roots of zzso Similar to our observations in other plant species, zzso B enhanced the response of zzso roots to zzso zzso B zzso zzso and a stimulation time of zzso zzso were sufficient to induce enhanced zzso responses during zzso zzso B zzso zzso disrupted the fine zzso filament network in different regions of the root and altered the dynamics of zzso in the zzso but did not inhibit the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, the duration of the zzso response during continuous zzso was extended in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso reporter showed that the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso roots during zzso was accompanied by a persistent lateral zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and the development of the lateral zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso zzso is unnecessary for the initial perception of gravity but likely acts to zzso zzso by continuously zzso the zzso zzso
