By means of zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso methods, zzso bone zzso protein was observed in the process of generation of zzso bone in experimental punch holes in the zzso zzso In repair of the punch hole, zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and differentiated in the rim within 2 zzso By 3 to 4 weeks, zzso grew zzso down into and across the zzso and zzso openings and sealed the punch zzso A zzso structure consisting of a zzso of the zzso type cells covered the cut ends of the elastic zzso The zzso differentiated into zzso cells and zzso cartilage within 4 to 5 zzso Within 4 to 6 weeks, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and replaced zzso cartilage with a zzso ring of zzso zzso zzso protein 2 appeared first in the zzso then in the zzso and later in the zzso zzso A basic assumption was that zzso zzso bone zzso protein was converted to the zzso zzso protein zzso form by injury, zzso and zzso The zzso form and various other local factors contributed the zzso and spatial constraints of a zzso field for development of zzso zzso The receptors and mechanism of bone zzso protein signal zzso are zzso
