zzso zzso growth zzso plays a central role in regulating zzso migration and differentiation of dental pulp cells during the repair process after tooth zzso Our previous study showed that zzso zzso protein zzso may act downstream of zzso zzso to effect the differentiation of dental pulp zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger and regulate the process remain to be zzso zzso interacts with zzso pathways such as zzso and zzso to induce diverse biological zzso zzso activates zzso zzso increases zzso nuclear zzso and interacts with zzso to regulate gene zzso zzso changes in response to zzso are associated with zzso of zzso zzso but are zzso by zzso of zzso zzso a major downstream target of zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso pathways may mediate the downstream events of zzso zzso
