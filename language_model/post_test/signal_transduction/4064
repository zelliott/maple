The zzso median cells are unique zzso cells that reside on the surface of the zzso nerve zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is specifically expressed in these cells and is required for their zzso We have determined that proper zzso gene expression and zzso median cell differentiation requires signals from underlying zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso median cells fail to form in single-minded zzso and do not persist in slit zzso Through analysis of zzso zzso and targeted zzso zzso we also show that the zzso signaling zzso regulates the number of both the zzso median cells, as well as a set of zzso cells that arise next to the zzso and express the single-minded zzso Finally, zzso double zzso exhibit defects in the restriction of zzso median cells to segment boundaries and zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Taken together, these data define a novel zzso to zzso signaling zzso and suggest that unique zzso cell types are specified by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso
