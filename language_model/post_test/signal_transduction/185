A gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified from the leaves of black zzso zzso zzso which is a member of a small gene family of at least three genes that have zzso in tobacco zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potato zzso zzso zzso and sweet potato zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by wounding and by treatment with zzso zzso The zzso precursor protein contained a signal sequence and was zzso modified to produce three zzso zzso signals zzso zzso The three zzso peptides isolated from zzso leaf extracts were called zzso I (19 zzso acids with six zzso zzso II (20 zzso acids with six zzso and zzso III (20 zzso acids with either six or nine zzso by their sequential appearance in zzso The three zzso peptides were zzso and tested for their abilities to zzso suspension culture zzso with synthetic zzso I demonstrating the highest zzso zzso zzso I was capable of inducing zzso in other zzso cell types (or zzso indicating that structural zzso within the peptides are recognized by the different zzso to initiate signal zzso zzso apparently through recognition by zzso zzso To further demonstrate the biological relevance of the zzso zzso the early defense gene zzso D was shown to be induced by all three synthetic peptides when supplied to excised zzso zzso
