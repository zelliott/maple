By using zzso preparations we show that zzso zzso of zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso in the presence as well as in the absence of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso which also occurred in the absence of zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso affected the zzso zzso preference of zzso in its zzso zzso With zzso as zzso zzso but not zzso was significantly zzso by zzso to form zzso zzso 20 zzso The opposite situation was found when zzso served as zzso zzso efficiently and zzso zzso 5 zzso activated the zzso zzso but zzso zzso the zzso zzso to form zzso However, this weak zzso effect on zzso was overcome by excess zzso of zzso zzso 100 zzso This finding is in accordance with the in zzso situation, where activated zzso zzso the formation of zzso but not zzso We conclude that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso selectivity of zzso by zzso zzso toward zzso in the presence of zzso
