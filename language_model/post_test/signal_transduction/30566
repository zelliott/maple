Gene expression of zzso tissue growth factor zzso is induced in activated zzso zzso cells zzso the major zzso in zzso fibrosis, and production of zzso zzso zzso is consequently zzso We previously reported that zzso the yellow zzso in curry, suppressed zzso zzso leading to decreased production of zzso by zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate signal zzso pathways involved in the zzso suppression of zzso expression in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate effects of zzso of zzso pathways on the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses were conducted to determine expression of zzso 

zzso of zzso expression by zzso was zzso reversed by zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso increased the abundance of zzso and type I collagen in zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by dominant active zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by dominant negative zzso caused the zzso or suppression of the zzso promoter activity, zzso zzso suppressed gene expression of zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso On the other hand, interruption of zzso zzso by zzso or dominant negative zzso like zzso reduced zzso activity and in zzso zzso In contrast, the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso active zzso prevented the zzso effects of zzso 

These results demonstrate that the interruption of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso results in the suppression of zzso expression in activated zzso in zzso
