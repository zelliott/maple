zzso zzso are key regulators of the zzso zzso in membrane trafficking zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso in neuroendocrine cells by stimulating zzso assembly at zzso sites for zzso zzso These findings raise the question of the mechanism zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso which specifically activates zzso and is at an interface between membrane trafficking and zzso zzso appears as an ideal candidate to fulfill this zzso Using zzso and zzso cells, we now show the presence of zzso at zzso zzso Moreover, through an zzso interference strategy coupled with expression of various zzso zzso the zzso zzso exchange domain, we demonstrate that zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevents zzso zzso of zzso revealing zzso as the factor zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Our results extend the current role of zzso in zzso to a function in zzso and support the idea that zzso is an zzso that coordinates zzso membrane trafficking in zzso zzso
