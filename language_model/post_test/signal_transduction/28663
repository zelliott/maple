Several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause dense zzso release independently of zzso zzso Because protein zzso C zzso zzso are implicated in zzso zzso we investigated the role of individual zzso zzso in zzso dense zzso zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso manner that coincided with dense zzso release in response to zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso in human zzso Only zzso that caused zzso dense zzso zzso activated zzso zzso or zzso dense zzso release and zzso zzso occurred at the same respective zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso dense zzso release was blocked by zzso a zzso selective zzso In contrast, zzso dense zzso zzso was zzso by zzso but was abolished by zzso a classical zzso zzso zzso However, zzso dense zzso release was unaffected in the presence of zzso Finally, zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso indicating that zzso has no role in zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and the classical zzso zzso play a differential role in zzso dense zzso release zzso by zzso receptors and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso plays a positive role in zzso zzso dense zzso zzso whereas it functions as a negative regulator downstream of zzso VI zzso
