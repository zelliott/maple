Using zzso derived cell lines which zzso express either the wild type or zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso in which individual zzso zzso have been replaced with zzso we zzso the requirement for zzso zzso of the zzso for the zzso of zzso proteins in response to zzso We found zzso to be required for efficient zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso was not affected by the zzso of zzso to zzso The addition of zzso spanning zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso with the sequence surrounding zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso mobility shift zzso led to competition of the formation of zzso containing complexes, zzso and zzso with the DNA zzso These zzso did, however, not affect the formation of the zzso containing complex, zzso with the zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso led to a complete block of zzso of all zzso proteins in response to zzso however, this zzso does not appear to represent a zzso binding site of the zzso as a zzso spanning zzso of the human zzso zzso could not compete any zzso complex formation in zzso mobility shift zzso
