We have isolated a putative zzso zzso zzso gene with an expression pattern indicating that it may play a role in the zzso response to zzso zzso display zzso was used to select tobacco zzso with increased zzso following zzso zzso a zzso identified by this method, is zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily expressed in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso increase during floral development and are further increased by zzso reaching zzso zzso zzso hours after zzso and then zzso zzso levels can also be increased by the application of zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso by the zzso 16 open reading frame has sequence similarity to the zzso domain of several zzso protein zzso from plants including the zzso zzso implicated in the rejection of zzso in zzso species and the zzso gene product of tomato which zzso resistance to a bacterial zzso
