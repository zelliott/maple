Development of the zzso kidney is a complex process involving numerous signals and signaling zzso Other complex zzso have benefited enormously from studies in lower, simpler zzso The present review provides an update on what we have learned from the zzso zzso zzso and argues that zzso is an important but zzso zzso for study of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso provide zzso function to the zzso These require a number of signaling pathways for their development that are also seen in zzso kidney development, including the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso as well as nuclear factors such as zzso and zzso Many of these factors are shared between early zzso zzso development and zzso bud zzso The zzso signaling zzso which is central to zzso zzso development, is poorly understood in flies, although its expression pattern is zzso Surprisingly, other signaling factors such as zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso appear to work within later fly retinal development, providing a surprising link between these two disparate zzso 

zzso offers a powerful zzso of tools for zzso zzso zzso zzso these tools can often be examined at the level of single cells, permitting us to address issues of differentiation with high zzso If we are to take full advantage of zzso however, then we must target specific issues and gain a better understanding of the details of zzso zzso zzso
