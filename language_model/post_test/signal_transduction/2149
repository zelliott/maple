zzso of zzso receptors could regulate cellular responses to the two natural zzso zzso and zzso and to synthetic zzso used in the clinical diagnosis and symptomatic therapy of neuroendocrine zzso The five cloned zzso with or without zzso tags at their zzso were expressed in rat zzso zzso zzso Application of the two natural peptides or zzso at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C, to cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso 2 or 3 zzso resulted in a significant decrease of cell surface zzso for zzso In contrast, cells zzso with zzso 5 zzso only responded to stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso 1 zzso responded to zzso and 28, while cells expressing zzso 4 zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso revealed that 6 zzso after stimulation with zzso at 37 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 were zzso into zzso zzso was not observed at 4 degrees C in the presence of zzso M zzso and 80 zzso zzso oxide and hence proceeded via zzso through zzso pits and zzso After 20 zzso the zzso receptors appeared in zzso zzso and after 120 zzso they zzso at the plasma zzso This recycling was not sensitive to zzso and, zzso not dependent on de zzso protein zzso Recovery of cell surface receptors was, however, inhibited by zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso recycling proceeded through zzso traffic of zzso zzso The data are consistent with the assumption that the observed zzso and zzso specific zzso of zzso receptors in a neuroendocrine cell line may be important for zzso diagnosis and therapy and, thus, suggest a zzso control in cellular zzso
