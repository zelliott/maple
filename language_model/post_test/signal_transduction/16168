To address the roles of the zzso derived zzso zzso zzso in the course of experimental zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was induced by zzso injury and compared in zzso or zzso mice two weeks after zzso zzso factor expression in the early phase after injury was zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso cell, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the early phase after injury was evaluated by flow zzso zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso was zzso together with zzso of zzso zzso cells in the zzso after the zzso zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso mice exhibited enhanced zzso two weeks after injury, as evidenced by enlarged cluster of differentiation 31 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso was significantly enhanced in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso enhanced vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso Enhancement in zzso zzso expression was greater in zzso mice than in control mice after zzso Moreover, local administration of zzso zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso after zzso injury reduced zzso zzso 

zzso mice exhibited enhanced zzso zzso through enhanced zzso zzso cell zzso and increased zzso expression by zzso
