zzso crest zzso cells migrate exclusively into the zzso half of each zzso where they avoid the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in these zzso regions and throughout the zzso zzso In zzso zzso of NC spreading on zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso revealed that NC cells adopt on zzso a zzso zzso whereas on zzso they fail to zzso zzso inhibited zzso of NC cells on zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso up of NC cells on zzso zzso of zzso to trunk zzso inhibited NC migration into the zzso and treatment of zzso with zzso zzso yielded migration into otherwise zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is an zzso signal involved in patterning the zzso migration of NC cells and their topographical segregation within the zzso
