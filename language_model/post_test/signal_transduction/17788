zzso has been coupled to zzso events associated with smooth muscle cell zzso zzso integrity and free radical zzso Additionally, there is evidence that zzso is required for smooth muscle cell zzso Our investigation employed selective zzso to establish that zzso and not zzso was necessary for the stimulation of DNA synthesis by zzso zzso treatment increased zzso the activity of both soluble and particulate zzso as well as the number of modified zzso zzso of zzso zzso a selective decoy zzso of zzso zzso prevented the modification of these zzso zzso also blocked the stimulation of DNA and zzso zzso prevented smooth muscle cell migration and suppressed the induction of zzso and zzso gene zzso An examination of relevant signal zzso pathways showed that zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, it did inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This novel observation suggests that zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso zzso that is required for immediate early gene zzso
