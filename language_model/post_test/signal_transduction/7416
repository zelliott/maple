The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling contributed to the zzso of abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso were randomly distributed into three groups: Tan zzso control, and zzso The rats from Tan zzso and control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso and those in the sham group were zzso with zzso Only the Tan zzso group received Tan zzso (2 zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso tissue samples were harvested at 24 d after zzso and evaluated using reverse zzso chain reaction, Western zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 88 zzso zzso Nuclear Factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso were significantly decreased by Tan zzso zzso 

Tan zzso zzso zzso AAA in rats possibly via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which may be one potential explanation of why Tan zzso zzso AAA development through multiple zzso
