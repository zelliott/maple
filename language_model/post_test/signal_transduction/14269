The goal of this study was to understand roles of zzso and zzso transport processes in zzso pharmacology in cells derived from human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and three human zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso Human zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso activities and a zzso zzso activity were present in zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso was pH dependent with highest zzso seen at pH zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso was the major zzso zzso zzso transport activity was variable among the three zzso cell lines, with zzso showing the highest and zzso showing the lowest zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso alpha zzso increased zzso zzso levels and prior treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso followed by zzso or zzso resulted in enhanced sensitivity of all cell lines to zzso and two of three cell lines to zzso We report for the first time a zzso transport activity in zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, our in zzso zzso results showed that zzso cell lines differed in their response to zzso and zzso and prior treatment with zzso zzso zzso response to zzso of zzso
