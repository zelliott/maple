During development of the zzso regional zzso establishes a zzso zzso chamber and a zzso auditory chamber, which collectively constitute the zzso labyrinth of the inner zzso We identified the earliest zzso event heralding the formation of the zzso chamber, a rapid thinning and expansion of the zzso wall of the zzso and showed that this process is generated by changes in zzso cell shape from zzso to zzso as opposed to changes in other cell behaviors, such as localized changes in cell proliferation or cell zzso Moreover, we showed that thinning and expansion of the zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso which is both sufficient and necessary for localized thinning and zzso Finally, we showed that zzso signaling causes fragmentation of zzso in the zzso zzso occurring zzso with cell shape change, suggesting that zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso during the initial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso our results show that zzso signaling via zzso regulates the cell behaviors that drive the initial zzso zzso of the zzso providing new information about how regional zzso of a complex organ zzso the developing zzso zzso is zzso
