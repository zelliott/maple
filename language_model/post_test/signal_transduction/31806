The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in multiple cellular functions, such as cell zzso proliferation and zzso Many previous studies have shown that zzso regulates both zzso and zzso functions in trauma and various diseases in the central nervous system zzso Recently, we reported that zzso of zzso using zzso reduces neural tissue damage and locomotor impairment after spinal zzso injury zzso in zzso Our results demonstrated that the administration of zzso at four hours after injury significantly increases the activity of zzso and reduces zzso loss and cell death in the injured spinal zzso Furthermore, zzso mice show significantly better locomotor function in the zzso following zzso than zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso of zzso signaling using zzso during the acute phase of zzso produces zzso effects and reduces secondary damage at zzso zzso However, the role of zzso signaling in injured spinal cords has not yet been fully zzso Various functions are regulated by zzso signaling in the zzso and multiple zzso processes occur following zzso Here, we discuss several unresolved issues and review the evidence from related articles regarding the role and mechanisms of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso and zzso after zzso
