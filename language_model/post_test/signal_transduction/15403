zzso zzso zzso is a key protection against zzso compromised in zzso diabetes by an unknown zzso In this work, we present an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the zzso control zzso Our results indicate that a pancreatic network which zzso a few explicit interactions between the major zzso peptides and blood zzso zzso can replicate the normal zzso axis and explain its impairment in zzso A key and novel component of this network is an zzso zzso which drives zzso zzso and mediates triggering of zzso zzso by zzso via a zzso of the zzso suppression of the zzso We have performed simulations based on our models of the zzso zzso which explain the in zzso zzso response to zzso of the normal zzso and the enhancement of defective zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso suppressing zzso The models also predicted that reduced insulin zzso decreases and delays the zzso In conclusion, based on experimental data we have developed and validated a model of the normal zzso control mechanisms and their zzso in insulin deficient zzso One advantage of this construct is that all model components are clinically zzso thereby permitting its transfer, zzso and application to the study of the zzso abnormalities of the human zzso zzso in zzso
