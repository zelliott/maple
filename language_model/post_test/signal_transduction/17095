In the present study, we used a functional zzso approach to identify zzso A1 zzso interacting proteins in the zzso zzso cell zzso We focused on zzso because it is one of the major proteins zzso in zzso zzso cells versus zzso zzso Our zzso strategy revealed 21 zzso zzso analysis showed that most of these proteins are involved in cell death zzso Among the proteins identified, we studied the interaction of zzso with two zzso zzso and zzso which were recently identified as zzso of zzso sensitivity in patients affected by chronic zzso zzso Our data open new perspectives in the search for zzso signaling pathways and may shed light on mechanisms of resistance to zzso that are unrelated to zzso zzso All mass zzso data have been deposited in the zzso with zzso zzso
