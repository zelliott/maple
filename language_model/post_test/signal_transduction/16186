zzso and zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso have been recently involved in the triggering of death zzso zzso The zzso analogue zzso was the first zzso drug reported to induce zzso in cancer cells through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso death zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso raft clusters was independent of its zzso zzso zzso and could be zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso death domain protein zzso and zzso were also recruited into zzso zzso following zzso treatment, forming the zzso signaling complex zzso and hence these membrane zzso can act as scaffolds for zzso death zzso zzso accumulated in zzso zzso of cancer cells, altering raft protein and zzso zzso zzso an increasing number of zzso drugs have been found to induce zzso through recruitment of zzso into membrane zzso and some of these compounds accumulated in raft membrane zzso Additional downstream zzso signaling molecules have also been reported to be recruited into zzso following treatment of cancer cells with zzso agents, thus zzso zzso interactions and conveying zzso zzso On these zzso zzso zzso have become an appealing and promising target for therapeutic intervention in cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling provides a new insight in the regulation of death zzso zzso opening a new avenue in cancer zzso In this regard, an increasing number of patents are dealing with the above insights in order to improve cancer zzso
