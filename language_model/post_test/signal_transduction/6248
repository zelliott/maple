The prefrontal zzso is a higher brain region that regulates thought, behavior, and emotion using zzso knowledge, operations often referred to as working zzso We tested the influence of protein zzso C zzso zzso signaling on prefrontal cortical cognitive function and showed that high levels of zzso activity in prefrontal cortex, as seen for example during stress exposure, markedly impair behavioral and zzso measures of working zzso These data suggest that excessive zzso zzso can disrupt prefrontal cortical regulation of behavior and thought, possibly contributing to signs of prefrontal cortical dysfunction such as zzso impaired judgment, zzso and thought zzso
