zzso signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development, and its deregulation is closely linked to the occurrence of a number of zzso tumors, including breast and colon zzso The zzso also zzso zzso zzso transition zzso which is responsible for tumor invasion and zzso In this study, we show that zzso suppresses zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso activity by zzso the expression of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso induced a zzso switch via increased zzso consumption and zzso production, with induction of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso repression and zzso switching occurred through the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso a regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso and induced a zzso switch via Snail zzso indicating that zzso may contribute to zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, our findings provide a new function for zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso zzso (via zzso gene zzso and zzso metabolism (via PC gene zzso in tumor growth and zzso
