We have examined the regulation of zzso by soluble zzso and cell zzso as well as the relationship between the expression of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We find that zzso expression in zzso phase can be divided into two discrete zzso an initial induction that requires growth factors and the zzso of zzso and then a subsequent decline that is enhanced by cell zzso in an zzso zzso In contrast to the induction of zzso zzso the induction of zzso is zzso by transient zzso zzso Comparative studies with zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso regulation of zzso is important for proper control of zzso zzso zzso These data lead to a model in which zzso and zzso act in a parallel fashion to regulate zzso phase expression of zzso They also show that zzso growth factors and growth zzso zzso cooperation can have different roles in regulating zzso phase zzso activity and zzso both transient and sustained zzso signals have functionally significant roles in controlling cell cycle progression through zzso zzso
