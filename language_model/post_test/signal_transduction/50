This study aimed to describe the abundance and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during pig zzso zzso development and to evaluate their implication in improving zzso maturity in the zzso period preceding the second versus first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso were recovered from zzso zzso of zzso zzso at day 1, 2 and 4 after weaning and at day 14, 16 and 20 of their subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that with the exception of zzso zzso which was absent in zzso all genes were expressed in every cell zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most abundant in the zzso their expression remained relatively constant during zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso expressions in the zzso and zzso were temporally zzso zzso zzso abundance was positively correlated with plasma zzso zzso suggesting that its regulation by zzso may be implicated in normal zzso Interestingly, the increase in zzso zzso and protein abundance during the zzso period in zzso and zzso suggests a role for bone zzso protein zzso 15 in the zzso zzso Finally, expression of these zzso and receptors was not associated with potential differences in zzso maturity observed during the second versus first zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a complex zzso system within the pig zzso involving the transforming growth zzso zzso and their zzso and provide evidence to support a role for zzso and zzso during zzso
