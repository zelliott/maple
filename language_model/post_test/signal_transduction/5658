zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increases the number of zzso stem cells zzso present in the bone zzso zzso However, the zzso capacity of these zzso is severely impaired, suggesting that zzso expression might be an intrinsic requirement for zzso zzso To further examine this question, we developed a model in which zzso expression is zzso in zzso while they are resident in a zzso zzso In this setting, we find that long-term zzso by zzso zzso is not zzso Moreover, zzso zzso from this model repopulate at levels comparable with zzso zzso upon serial zzso However, when zzso from mice with systemic zzso of zzso are zzso they are functionally compromised for zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is not an intrinsic requirement for zzso function, but rather that zzso is required for the zzso milieu to support functionally competent zzso zzso with these findings, cells that comprise the zzso niche express zzso and zzso zzso profoundly alters their zzso
