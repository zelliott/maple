The first evident break in zzso symmetry of the primitive zzso heart tube is the shift in pattern of zzso expression from zzso zzso to zzso The zzso heart tube then zzso to the left and subsequently zzso to the zzso We examined 279 zzso affecting more than 200 zzso and found 21 zzso that zzso this zzso Some cause zzso to remain zzso zzso Others zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso symmetry is associated with failure to zzso zzso of the zzso pattern is associated with reversal of the direction of zzso and zzso Raising zzso zzso throughout the heart, via sonic zzso injection, or the blocking of its action by injection of a dominant negative zzso zzso prevent directional zzso or zzso The genes crucial to directing cardiac asymmetry include a subset of those needed for patterning the zzso axis and for zzso and zzso spinal zzso zzso Thus, the pattern of cardiac zzso appears to be in the zzso by which the heart zzso zzso signals from the zzso
