zzso movement has been studied in many plants but mainly as a model system for light zzso However, we recently showed that the avoidance response of zzso is also induced by mechanical stimulation in zzso zzso zzso Here we report the discovery of a mechanically induced zzso response of zzso in zzso When mechanical stimulation was directly applied with a zzso to a part of a cell, zzso moved towards and accumulated at the pressed site within 30 zzso after the onset of stimulation in all species zzso The zzso movement of zzso was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso B in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso To determine the contribution of external zzso to the response, we examined the effects on the zzso movement of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso channels, and zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of calcium zzso zzso of zzso was abolished by these drugs, but no effects were observed on zzso of zzso irrespective of light colors and zzso These results suggest that influx of external zzso through the plasma membrane is essential for the early steps in signaling of zzso of zzso whose zzso system is dependent on zzso
