The onset and progression of skeletal muscle zzso are controlled by a complex set of interactions between muscle precursor cells and their zzso Satellite cells constitute the main source of muscle precursor cells for growth and zzso After skeletal muscle injury, zzso signals induce their re-entry into the cell cycle and their migration into the damaged zone, where they zzso and differentiate into mature zzso The surrounding zzso zzso zzso together with zzso growth factors, such as transforming growth zzso zzso also likely play an important role in growth control and muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that bind zzso during skeletal muscle zzso In this paper, we show that the binding of zzso to the receptors zzso zzso diminished in a satellite zzso cell line during zzso in spite of an increase expression of both zzso In contrast, during the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso increased zzso with receptors zzso Both the addition and zzso of zzso in these zzso diminished the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso was added or zzso in zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso alternatively known as zzso was also zzso in zzso zzso zzso and diminished by zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso compete for the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso studies with the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso revealed that the addition of each zzso diminished zzso activity, for both zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso diminishing the zzso of zzso for its zzso receptors appears to be a feasible mechanism for the zzso of this zzso growth factor during skeletal muscle zzso
