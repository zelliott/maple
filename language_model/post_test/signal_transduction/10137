To understand how our brains function, it is necessary to know how zzso position themselves and target their zzso and zzso to their correct zzso Several zzso zzso zzso guidance molecules have been shown to help navigate zzso to their correct target zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has roles in early zzso and zzso cell movements, but its roles in zzso guidance are not well zzso Here, we report that zzso that disrupt the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause incompletely zzso defects in zzso targeting and zzso cell body zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso animals was an zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso active zzso zzso zzso signaling caused a lack of zzso outgrowth or an early termination zzso opposite to the zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso analyses suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is required for targeting or limiting zzso and zzso cells to specific regions, perhaps by zzso a repellent or stop zzso
