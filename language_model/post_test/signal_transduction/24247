zzso is a signal zzso protein expressed exclusively in the zzso system, where it plays a pivotal role in growth zzso differentiation and zzso zzso couples zzso zzso signals with the zzso of the zzso zzso leading to cell differentiation and/or zzso zzso was originally detected as an zzso but its involvement in human zzso has not been reported thus zzso We report here that zzso is expressed in a zzso cell line, zzso zzso analysis indicated that there are no gross zzso or zzso in the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso protein from zzso cells was similar to zzso zzso in apparent molecular weight, zzso state, and ability to associate with active zzso We also zzso the expression of zzso in 42 specimens of human zzso zzso was expressed in the majority of these zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play a role in the zzso process in a subset of zzso
