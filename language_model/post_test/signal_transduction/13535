The putative zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso factor zzso signal zzso is zzso zzso Recently, we zzso a zzso zzso apparently containing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, and hypothesized that this is one of the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso is ubiquitous and appears to be zzso zzso the zzso membrane zzso zzso we now show that the zzso zzso zzso is regulated in opposing fashions by two zzso zzso stimulating it and protein zzso C zzso zzso Furthermore, protein zzso C zzso the zzso zzso This suggests a novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso represents the zzso while zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso
