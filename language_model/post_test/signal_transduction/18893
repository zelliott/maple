The zzso zzso of the growth factor receptors is preceded by the involvement of various other zzso In particular, a zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in this zzso Several candidates that have potential effects on the negative control of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso have now been identified by our recent studies in zzso Among these zzso we focus on characterizing a novel zzso zzso which is a zzso and zzso zzso zzso is found to be zzso at zzso 145 and 146 upon zzso zzso and zzso 129 of zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso zzso has two motifs interacting with the zzso zzso zzso that might function as a binding site for the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso receptors are associated in an zzso manner, their interaction is required not only for zzso zzso but also for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is mainly located at the plasma membrane with zzso zzso and functions in its zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso secondary modifications of an zzso zzso are inhibited by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso may have competitive effects on the zzso of the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso functions as a novel inhibitor for the zzso of the zzso zzso and plays a crucial role for regulating the amount of the zzso zzso on the cell surface zzso
