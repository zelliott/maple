The fetal zzso zzso is characterized by elevated zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso which can lead to the development of zzso zzso zzso devastating inflammatory disease of the premature zzso exposure to zzso To define zzso strategies that could reduce zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso fluid can inhibit zzso signaling within the fetal zzso and zzso experimental zzso and we sought to determine the mechanisms zzso We show here that zzso of zzso fluid into the fetal zzso day zzso gastrointestinal tract reduced zzso signaling within the fetal zzso zzso zzso fluid is abundant in zzso which we show is required for its zzso effects on zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso because zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso fluid blocked the zzso effects of zzso fluid on zzso whereas zzso fluid did not prevent zzso signaling in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or in mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated the exaggerated zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the severity of NEC in mice through zzso zzso zzso NEC development in both mice and humans was associated with reduced zzso expression that was restored upon the administration of zzso fluid in mice or recovery from NEC in humans, suggesting that a lack of zzso zzso zzso signaling could zzso to zzso These findings may explain the unique zzso of premature infants to the development of NEC and offer therapeutic approaches to this devastating zzso
