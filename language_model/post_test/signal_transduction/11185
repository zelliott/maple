The expression of the zzso zzso zzso is one of the more important clinical parameters of breast zzso However, the relationship between the zzso and its zzso zzso and the zzso that zzso it are not well zzso The expression of zzso transcripts of members of the zzso zzso and zzso pathways including the zzso was studied in zzso 

zzso transcripts for zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso II, zzso zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso and zzso were zzso zzso by competitive zzso using an internal standard in 155 breast zzso In addition, the transcripts of zzso were zzso for alternative zzso of zzso 1 and an alternative zzso A zzso 

A great zzso of expression was observed, ranging from 0 to zzso zzso zzso The highest levels were observed for zzso and zzso and the lowest levels (close to zzso were observed for the zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso expression were zzso with respect to clinical and zzso parameters as well as for zzso zzso High correlation of the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso suggested a common regulation, possibly by their common zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in the 155 patients resulted in two main zzso representing the zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso The zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso did not follow the expression of the zzso in all cases, leading to the formation of several zzso of zzso Patients with no expression of zzso and patients with high levels of expression of zzso had significantly shorter zzso survival time zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was a better zzso factor than that of zzso in this zzso 

Our results indicate the importance of zzso and the zzso regulating the zzso zzso metabolism as factors of zzso survival in breast cancer, in addition to the well-known factors zzso and zzso
