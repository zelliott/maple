zzso zzso and assembly into ordered, zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a novel mechanism for regulating protein zzso For a zzso of zzso proteins known as zzso this process zzso zzso changes in normal cellular zzso ranging from neurodegenerative disease in animals and humans to new traits in zzso The severity and stability of these altered zzso states can be attenuated by the zzso or zzso sequence of the zzso but in most of these cases, the protein retains the ability to form zzso in zzso Thus, our ability to link zzso formation in zzso with its biological consequences in zzso remains a zzso In two recent studies, we have begun to address this disconnect by assessing the effects of the cellular environment on traits associated with the zzso of the zzso prion zzso zzso the effects of quality control pathways and of limitations on protein transfer in zzso amplify the effects of even slight differences in the efficiency of zzso zzso leading to dramatic changes in the associated zzso Together, our studies suggest that the interplay between protein zzso pathways and their cellular context is a crucial contributor to prion zzso
