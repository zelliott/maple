zzso is an important zzso signal during embryonic zzso The zzso contains several zzso zzso including cholesterol and zzso groups, apparently incompatible with long-range zzso Very recent research, however, performed in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso can be carried by insect zzso which strongly resemble zzso zzso zzso zzso enabling the zzso to act at long distances from its zzso Such long-range signaling of zzso is in perfect agreement with current insight that in zzso zzso signaling is not terminated after gestation has been completed but remains active throughout life, zzso among others zzso of adult zzso cardiac zzso In agreement, zzso gene therapy is highly effective in experimental zzso for limiting the damage after coronary zzso If indeed zzso is transported on zzso in zzso an interesting change of paradigm might emerge for zzso No longer would LDL merely be bad news for the progression of zzso zzso as it also conveys a zzso and tissue salvage signal in the form of zzso
