The deleterious zzso cascade induced after traumatic brain injury zzso is initiated by an zzso process triggered by excessive zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by increasing calcium influx, activates zzso oxide zzso zzso leading to a toxic production of zzso Moreover, after zzso free zzso are highly produced and participate to a deleterious zzso zzso Evidence has showed that the major toxic effect of NO comes from its combination with zzso zzso leading to zzso formation, a highly zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso mediates zzso stress and is a potent zzso of cell death through its reaction with zzso proteins and zzso Particularly DNA damage, caused by both zzso and zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso a nuclear zzso implicated in DNA zzso In response to excessive DNA damage, massive zzso zzso leads to energetic depletion and finally to cell zzso Since 10 years, accumulating data have showed that zzso of zzso either zzso or using zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso in experimental models of zzso Thus zzso generating zzso zzso and zzso stresses promotes zzso zzso contributing in post-traumatic zzso cognitive and zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso zzso provide protection might not entirely be related to the preservation of cellular energy stores, but might also include other zzso mechanisms that needed to be explored in a zzso zzso Ten years of experimental research provided rational basis for the development of zzso zzso as treatment for zzso
