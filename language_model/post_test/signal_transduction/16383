zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may activate relevant pathways and lead to chronic zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso remain elusive because of a lack of experimental zzso Modern zzso biology techniques were zzso to explore the mechanisms of zzso protein zzso due to various zzso 

zzso zzso domain predictions, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein structure zzso and molecular dynamics zzso simulations were used to build structural dynamic models of zzso and four clinically observed zzso of zzso The simulation results suggest that zzso and zzso are important in keeping the TM domain in its correct position within the zzso zzso at either of these two positions cause movement of the TM domain, altering the zzso of the nearby zzso domain in unexpected ways, and may cause the unwanted zzso zzso of zzso zzso partner, zzso 

Our findings represent the first zzso molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso and clinically observed zzso of the zzso zzso a critical element of the zzso signaling zzso In contrast to usual explanations for the zzso mechanism that are based on the relative zzso movement between rigid zzso of zzso our results suggest that zzso within the TM region could result in zzso changes including tilt and rotation zzso angles along the membrane zzso Such changes may significantly alter the zzso of the adjacent and zzso flexible zzso zzso zzso caution should be exercised when interpreting experimental evidence based on rigid models of zzso receptors or similar zzso
