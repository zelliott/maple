One of the major therapeutic challenges in the arena of zzso zzso is to design strategies aimed at reducing zzso tissue damage after zzso zzso In response to tissue injury, an innate immune response is initiated that zzso zzso responses and is a prerequisite for subsequent wound zzso An exaggerated inflammatory reaction, however, zzso these beneficial effects and contributes to zzso tissue zzso zzso we discuss the pathways involving the innate immune system that have been investigated in the setting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signals zzso molecular patterns zzso are expressed following tissue injury and alert the innate immune zzso zzso receptors and the complement system are zzso resulting in an inflammatory reaction involving inflammatory cell influx and the production and release of inflammatory zzso A potential involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso of the innate immune response following zzso injury will also be zzso Our future challenge lies within the zzso of zzso inflammatory zzso without interfering in the benign wound healing response, and in translating these zzso strategies into clinical zzso
