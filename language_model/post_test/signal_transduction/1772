To investigate the effect of simulated zzso on zzso in rat zzso zzso 

zzso were isolated from zzso rat zzso and then were set to two zzso One was cultured in zzso to simulate the zzso zzso Another was cultured in 1 G zzso zzso After 60 zzso zzso were treated with zzso Pa or zzso Pa zzso in a flow zzso The zzso treatment time was set to 30 zzso and 60 zzso zzso The specimens of each group were obtained for zzso zzso and determination of expressions of zzso zzso in zzso 

In zzso cultured in 1 G zzso environment, zzso expression was increased remarkably from 30 zzso to 60 zzso with the treatment of zzso zzso There was no clear difference between the expression of zzso after treatments of zzso Pa or zzso Pa zzso In cells cultured in simulated zzso environment, no zzso expression of zzso was found with the treatment of zzso Pa zzso The expression of zzso was only detected after 60 zzso treatment of zzso Pa zzso but the level of expression was decreased significantly zzso 

These results demonstrated that the zzso in zzso was zzso in simulated zzso of zzso zzso
