The expression of zzso zzso zzso is induced in rat liver by zzso and zzso and is completely inhibited by 100 zzso zzso Various studies have implicated zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso of the zzso factors zzso in zzso 1 zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study we examined insulin regulation of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso insulin zzso of zzso zzso levels was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was a corresponding zzso of zzso zzso In these same cells, zzso of the insulin effect by zzso occurred in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso insulin could not activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, but still inhibited zzso gene expression in an zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso gene expression by zzso but did not produce zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, 1 zzso insulin inhibited the zzso zzso level by zzso and zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso to a level comparable to that observed with 100 zzso zzso These results suggest a potential role for a zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso gene transcription, which is not downstream of zzso and is independent of zzso In conclusion, we have found that in rat liver, insulin zzso of zzso zzso levels can occur in the absence of the zzso of zzso whereas zzso of the zzso zzso is both necessary and zzso
