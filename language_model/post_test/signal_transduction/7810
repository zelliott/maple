Although airway zzso cells provide important barrier and host defense functions, a crucial role for these cells in development of acute lung inflammation and injury has not been zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso signaling in airway zzso could decisively impact inflammatory zzso in the lungs by using a zzso system to achieve selective zzso zzso or zzso in zzso In transgenic mice that express a zzso active form of zzso zzso 2 under control of the zzso zzso promoter, treatment with zzso induced zzso zzso with zzso production of a variety of zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso treatment with zzso caused progressive lung injury and zzso with a high mortality zzso In contrast, zzso expression of a dominant inhibitor of zzso in airway zzso prevented lung inflammation and injury resulting from expression of zzso active form of zzso zzso 2 or zzso coli zzso delivered directly to the airways or zzso via an zzso pump implanted in the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso in airway zzso cells is critical for generation of lung inflammation and injury in response to local and systemic zzso therefore, targeting inflammatory pathways in airway zzso could prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy for inflammatory lung zzso
