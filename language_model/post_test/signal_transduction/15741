zzso zzso is enhanced by the scaffolding proteins zzso and zzso localized near the cell membrane and late zzso respectively, but little is known about their dynamic zzso We develop here a mathematical model with ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamic zzso of zzso signaling under a conventional zzso without zzso a zzso pathway, and an zzso pathway, and their impacts were examined under the influence of the zzso regulators, zzso and zzso zzso This new integrated model, validated against experimental results and zzso constraints, shows that changes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depend on these scaffold proteins and zzso The zzso and the conventional pathways act zzso and are sensitive to zzso zzso When the zzso level is high, the sensitivity of zzso zzso from this combined zzso remains low when zzso level is zzso But, such sensitivity can be increased with increasing levels of zzso if zzso level becomes zzso However, reduced zzso levels already present high sensitivity independent of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso by zzso is additive to that of zzso but it shows little zzso under high levels of zzso This can be partly reversed by increasing level of zzso while keeping zzso level zzso Further analyses showed that high levels of zzso affect zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso ensures the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These simulations constitute a zzso exploration of how zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso affected by scaffolds zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results provide a detailed and quantitative demonstration of how regulators and scaffolds can collaborate to fine-tune the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which could zzso differences during normal zzso disease states and drug zzso
