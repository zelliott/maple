The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has an essential role in the maintenance of oxygen zzso in zzso zzso expression and activity in the hypoxic response is regulated at the translation and zzso zzso However, the mechanism and zzso of zzso translation during zzso is not fully zzso We found that zzso expression during zzso was zzso by the zzso 130 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family are elevated under zzso and their target is zzso zzso which is a component of the zzso Furthermore, we found that a decrease of zzso expression by the zzso family enhanced the translation of zzso in an internal zzso entry site zzso zzso These results reveal a new zzso zzso mechanism and a role for zzso in hypoxic zzso
