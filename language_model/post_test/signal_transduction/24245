The zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are the two zzso zzso proteins exported by the zzso coli zzso zzso Whereas zzso does not contain zzso zzso is a zzso and the acquisition of the zzso is a prerequisite for its zzso The overproduction of each protein leads to the zzso of its zzso but it was unknown if the overproduction of one zzso could zzso the zzso apparatus and block thus the zzso of other zzso zzso Here, we showed that the overproduction of zzso saturated only its own zzso but had no effect of the zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso To dissect the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso we shortened by about one-third of the zzso protein and removed nine consensus zzso zzso Like zzso the truncated zzso zzso did not contain zzso and would not compete with the full length zzso for zzso zzso The overproduction of zzso completely inhibited the export of the full length zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletion of the zzso signal zzso of zzso abolished the zzso zzso Moreover, the overproduction of the zzso signal zzso fused to the green zzso protein zzso was sufficient to block the zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso signal zzso of the zzso protein specifically zzso the zzso of a subset of zzso zzso probably at the step of their targeting to the zzso zzso
