Upon zzso of cell surface receptors coupled to the zzso zzso of G zzso zzso C zzso beta zzso membrane zzso to yield a pair of second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been characterized as the zzso enriched in zzso zzso cells zzso and the zzso and involved in motor and visual zzso Here we examined cellular and zzso zzso of zzso in adult mouse zzso zzso showed that high levels of zzso were detected in the zzso domain of zzso populations expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso including zzso zzso cells, zzso in the bed nucleus anterior zzso thalamus, zzso zzso inferior olive, and zzso brush cells and PCs in the zzso Low to moderate levels were detected in many other zzso zzso and in a few zzso zzso In PCs, zzso electron zzso localized zzso to the zzso at which zzso is zzso and to the smooth zzso zzso in zzso and zzso an zzso zzso store gated by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso demonstrated its concentrated distribution in the zzso density and zzso zzso where zzso and type 1 zzso zzso were also greatly zzso Furthermore, zzso formed zzso complexes with zzso type 1 zzso zzso and Homer zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso localized in the zzso and smooth zzso zzso as a component of the physically linked zzso signaling zzso This close molecular relationship might provide zzso with a zzso zzso function to mediate various zzso responses under zzso and zzso zzso
