The zzso zzso zzso zzso family was discovered from an orphan nuclear zzso approach, and thereafter, three zzso were identified, namely zzso zzso or zzso and zzso The two former seem to regulate zzso zzso whereas the latter is involved, among others, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso first using zzso zzso such as zzso which demonstrate moderate affinity zzso at zzso zzso and low zzso versus zzso zzso zzso several laboratories have started the search for potent and zzso natural zzso zzso In this respect, zzso zzso compounds were identified as good zzso zzso with varying zzso the most notable zzso zzso being zzso zzso Recently, an oxidized zzso was identified as a potent alternative zzso natural zzso of zzso In the present review, we discuss the different zzso and zzso biological effects of the PG zzso zzso and the concern about their low potency in molecular models as compared with zzso zzso a family of potent zzso synthetic zzso zzso Finally, the oxidized lipids are presented as a novel and interesting alternative for discovering potent zzso zzso in order to understand more in details the implications of zzso in various zzso zzso
