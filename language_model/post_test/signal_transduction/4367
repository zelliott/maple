zzso belongs to a novel class of zzso zzso which includes zzso and zzso These proteins are unique among Ras zzso zzso since their expression is under zzso regulation in zzso zzso To gain insight into the function of zzso we took advantage of the zzso signal zzso pathways of zzso When zzso is expressed in zzso zzso the zzso form zzso and exhibit invasive properties characteristics of zzso cells undergoing a zzso transition induced by nitrogen zzso Analysis of zzso signaling zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso formation requires a zzso zzso cascade involving zzso zzso zzso but not zzso gene zzso Furthermore, our results are consistent with the idea that zzso functions upstream of the zzso zzso which plays a critical role in two distinct zzso zzso zzso
