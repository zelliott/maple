zzso II zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso converting zzso 1 zzso zzso have been shown to reduce acute cardiovascular events in patients, improve plaque stability and modify zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of the zzso axis in zzso zzso regulation has not been fully zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso and zzso blockade on the expression and activity of zzso zzso and zzso in human carotid zzso 

zzso samples zzso zzso 24) were obtained from patients undergoing carotid zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blockade on the expression of zzso the zzso zzso and soluble zzso fragments were investigated in zzso culture zzso zzso zzso samples were incubated with intervention or media control for 4 zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso were determined by zzso 

zzso but not zzso blockade significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso blockade significantly increased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso concentration in zzso zzso significantly increased after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso fragments increased after zzso and zzso zzso but was not changed by an zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso blockade alters zzso zzso zzso expression and a marker of zzso degradation in human zzso but that the zzso degradation response is not zzso zzso This data contributes to the zzso ability of zzso blockade to modify plaque zzso
