This study was to investigate the effect of high zzso zzso on zzso expression and the underlying mechanisms in bone zzso stem zzso 

zzso bone zzso zzso adult zzso cells zzso were cultured in normal zzso zzso and zzso media zzso zzso for up to zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso was used as high zzso zzso zzso expression was evaluated using quantitative zzso zzso and zzso zzso for its zzso and protein level in the cells and in the zzso zzso The expression and zzso of zzso and zzso were examined in zzso cultured in zzso media with Western zzso 

zzso level of zzso was detected in the cells cultured in normal zzso zzso expression was substantially increased in zzso after 36 h of culture in zzso media with over zzso increase in the zzso and zzso increase in protein level over zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso cultured in zzso media, while in zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso was dramatically zzso Treatment of cells with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and completely restored the level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultured in zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso expression without change in zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso increased zzso expression through zzso of zzso zzso by enhanced zzso signaling in zzso
