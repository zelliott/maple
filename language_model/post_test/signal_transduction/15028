zzso play a central role in vein graft zzso zzso which is significantly zzso under low zzso zzso The current concept is that zzso force regulates zzso zzso predominately through zzso of zzso and growth factors within the graft zzso Using rabbit and zzso vein graft models, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment and a low zzso environment act zzso to augment zzso zzso development and removal of either of the conditions leads to a significant reduction in zzso zzso We propose a novel concept that the zzso stress response element zzso stems from the complex interplay of the biological and physical zzso
