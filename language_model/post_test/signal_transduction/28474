DNA damage checkpoints are signal zzso pathways that are activated after zzso insults to protect zzso zzso The zzso protein functions in the DNA damage checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso and is essential for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We recently described the zzso of two soluble distinct zzso zzso The large zzso zzso complex consists of zzso zzso and the zzso proteins zzso This complex is found both in undamaged cells as well as in cells treated with DNA damaging zzso The smaller zzso zzso complex contains zzso zzso zzso and, in addition, zzso This complex forms only in cells with compromised DNA zzso Once bound to the smaller complex, zzso can be activated by in trans zzso Here, we propose a model in which the large zzso complex is zzso after a zzso insult by zzso activity to a smaller zzso zzso zzso
