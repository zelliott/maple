Tail zzso in zzso zzso is a favorable model system to understand the molecular and cellular basis of tissue zzso Although turnover of the zzso zzso zzso is a key event during tissue injury and repair, no functional studies to evaluate its role in zzso zzso have been zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso an zzso zzso is particularly attractive because it can activate zzso signaling zzso after tissue zzso Here we studied the function of zzso and components of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso tail zzso We found that transcripts for components of this pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in the zzso bud after tail zzso zzso an increase in zzso levels was zzso zzso experiments using zzso a specific HAS inhibitor that blocked the increase in zzso levels after tail zzso and zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso is required during the early zzso of tail zzso Proper levels of zzso are required to sustain proliferation of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso was sufficient to rescue proliferation and tail zzso when zzso synthesis was zzso suggesting that zzso is downstream of the zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso is an early component of the zzso zzso and is required for cell proliferation during the early zzso of zzso tail zzso In addition, a zzso between zzso and zzso signaling during tail zzso was zzso
