We have previously shown that lung zzso zzso protein A zzso and zzso protein D, interact with zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso or zzso zzso of lung zzso to zzso and zzso result in the zzso of signaling through these zzso suggesting the zzso functions of lung zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is another zzso zzso which has structural zzso to zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso has not yet been zzso 

We prepared zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso to zzso soluble forms of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso bound to zzso and zzso The interactions were zzso and inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso against the zzso domain of zzso Treatment of zzso or zzso by zzso zzso F significantly decreased the binding of zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and this property did not change in zzso molecules of zzso in which zzso or zzso of zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso zzso 

These results suggested that zzso binds to zzso and zzso through the zzso domain, and that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are important for recognition by zzso Since our previous studies indicated that lung zzso bind to the zzso portions of zzso zzso and lung zzso interact with zzso by different zzso These direct interactions between zzso and zzso or zzso suggest that zzso may zzso cellular responses by altering signals through zzso
