The recognition and zzso of microbes by zzso is a principal aspect of innate immunity that is zzso from insects to zzso zzso zzso has circulating zzso that zzso microbes similarly to zzso zzso suggesting that insect zzso can be used as a model to study zzso innate zzso We devised a zzso zzso zzso screen in zzso zzso zzso cells, and have defined 34 gene products involved in zzso These include proteins that participate in zzso development, zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation and a cell surface zzso This zzso zzso recognition protein zzso zzso is involved in zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity also zzso between zzso and zzso bacteria through the zzso and Toll zzso zzso however, a zzso for the zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we show that zzso is important for zzso zzso synthesis induced by zzso coli both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, totem zzso which fail to express zzso are susceptible to zzso zzso zzso but not zzso bacterial zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is an essential component for recognition and zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, this functional zzso approach is likely to have applications beyond zzso
