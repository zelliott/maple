zzso or systemic sclerosis zzso is a complex zzso tissue disease characterized by zzso of skin and internal zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso plays a key role in the zzso of zzso zzso We have previously identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso production in human zzso skin zzso 

zzso expression was determined in skin tissue and cultured skin zzso of zzso patients and normal healthy subjects, using zzso western zzso and zzso The effect of zzso on zzso synthesis was determined by blocking zzso expression using zzso zzso or addition of zzso zzso zzso and analyzing the expression of zzso components by western zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso markedly increased in zzso skin tissue in zzso and in zzso skin zzso in zzso as compared to their normal zzso zzso both zzso and normal skin zzso zzso with zzso zzso display increased zzso collagen type I and zzso protein levels and enhanced zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of zzso zzso protein decreases zzso zzso collagen type I and zzso levels in zzso and normal zzso 

The zzso of zzso protein in zzso may represent an adaptation or consequence of zzso zzso signaling in zzso Our finding that zzso is able to decrease excessive zzso production in zzso zzso suggest that this zzso has potential therapeutic value for the treatment of zzso
