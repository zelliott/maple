The capacity of neural stem cells zzso to zzso into a wide range of zzso lineages is the subject of zzso One approach to test zzso plasticity is to zzso place zzso in zzso or zzso zzso in which the signals driving differentiation of multiple cell types are being zzso Here we produce zzso body zzso zzso by combining zzso derivatives from fetal mice zzso expressing green fluorescent protein with embryonic stem zzso cells isolated from zzso mice zzso expressing nuclear zzso Under these conditions, we assess zzso to zzso heavy chain, zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we determine zzso zzso expression and undertake zzso in zzso zzso to assess zzso zzso stem zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that following zzso in hanging drops with zzso cells, zzso derivatives display zzso to zzso zzso in particular smooth muscle, which is not dependent upon zzso zzso These results suggest that given an appropriate environment, zzso may lose their in zzso restrictions and display zzso zzso
