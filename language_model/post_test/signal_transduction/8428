Although the role of systemic zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso in septic zzso has been well zzso little is known about the contribution of zzso zzso signaling in this zzso zzso Here, we used transgenic mice that zzso zzso a zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso selectively on zzso and their zzso zzso to define the role of zzso zzso in septic zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso challenge (5 zzso zzso caused markedly increased plasma markers of zzso decreased plasma zzso level, and widespread tissue zzso deposition, which were zzso by zzso zzso blockade in transgenic zzso zzso zzso blockade inhibited tissue factor expression in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso blockade did not inhibit zzso tissue factor expression in heart, zzso and zzso zzso zzso blockade prevented zzso zzso of zzso protein C zzso zzso and zzso protein expressions, inhibited tissue tumor necrosis zzso converting zzso activity, reduced zzso zzso and restored plasma protein C zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso intrinsic zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in septic zzso and suggests a link between zzso zzso zzso and the impairment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
