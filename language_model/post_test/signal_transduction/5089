zzso is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall associated with oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso and a critical intermediate of the electron transport chain, has been reported to inhibit LDL zzso and thus the progression of zzso However, its molecular mechanisms on zzso cells remain still zzso 

In this study, primary human zzso vein zzso cell cultures treated with zzso were used to explore the protective effects of zzso 

Our results showed that zzso attenuated the zzso generation of zzso oxygen species and improved the zzso zzso zzso also attenuated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso In addition, zzso suppressed zzso zzso and downstream inflammatory zzso including expression of zzso zzso release of zzso zzso and the adherence of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor of zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso as well as NO zzso zzso 10 zzso were used to clean up the zzso 

These results provide new insight into the possible molecular mechanisms by which zzso protects against zzso by zzso zzso
