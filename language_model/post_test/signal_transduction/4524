Low oxygen tension is a zzso hallmark of chronic zzso To investigate the influence of zzso on zzso biology, we analyzed the interaction between the zzso pathogen zzso tuberculosis and primary human zzso Although the zzso activity of zzso zzso tuberculosis was reduced at oxygen levels between zzso and zzso the zzso remained viable throughout the 4 d of zzso zzso of virulent zzso tuberculosis and the zzso release of inflammatory zzso by zzso were not affected by oxygen levels as low as zzso However, we detected the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso by the vitamin D zzso and human zzso zzso zzso This finding was functionally relevant, because zzso zzso growth was inhibited by 58 zzso zzso at zzso zzso We conclude that a hypoxic zzso which is characteristic of infected zzso supports the efficacy of zzso zzso in part by the zzso of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso
