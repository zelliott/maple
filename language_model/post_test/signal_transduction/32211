zzso zzso zzso exists in zzso cells that are in contact with neighboring zzso This phenomenon explains the poor zzso capacity of in zzso human zzso zzso cells during aging, injury and zzso This study demonstrated that the conventional approach of expanding human zzso zzso cells by zzso contact zzso with zzso followed by zzso activated zzso zzso signaling and lost the normal zzso to zzso transition, especially if zzso was zzso By contrast, zzso against zzso zzso zzso also uniquely promoted proliferation of the zzso cells by zzso trafficking of zzso zzso to the nucleus, thus zzso repression by nuclear zzso This nuclear zzso signaling is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but not with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells maintained a zzso shape, with zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso Further expansion of human zzso zzso zzso with a normal zzso and a higher density was possible by zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso followed by its zzso This new strategy of zzso contact zzso by selective zzso of zzso signaling without zzso adherent junction could be used to engineer surgical zzso containing normal human zzso zzso cells to meet a global zzso shortage and for zzso zzso
