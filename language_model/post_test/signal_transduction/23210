The precise regulation of synaptic growth is critical for the proper formation and plasticity of functional neural zzso Identification and characterization of factors that regulate synaptic growth and function have been under intensive zzso Here we report that brain tumor zzso which was identified as a zzso zzso in multiple biological zzso plays a crucial role at zzso zzso junction zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that brat zzso exhibited synaptic overgrowth characterized by excess satellite zzso at zzso zzso whereas electron zzso revealed increased synaptic zzso size but reduced density at active zones compared with zzso zzso miniature zzso zzso potential zzso were larger and evoked zzso content was lower at brat zzso zzso In agreement with the zzso and zzso zzso loss of zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso at the zzso zzso indicating that brat regulates synaptic zzso zzso analysis revealed that the actions of zzso at zzso are zzso through mothers against zzso zzso the signal zzso zzso of the bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses showed zzso levels of Mad protein but normal zzso levels in the zzso brains of brat zzso suggesting that zzso suppresses Mad zzso zzso zzso of brat by zzso interference in zzso zzso cells also increased Mad protein zzso These results together reveal an important and previously unidentified role for zzso in synaptic development and zzso zzso by suppression of zzso zzso
