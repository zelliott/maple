zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso to generate zzso acid, act as either positive or negative key regulators of cell zzso We previously showed that zzso mediates growth zzso zzso of zzso whose activity is required for cell zzso proliferation and zzso Here, we demonstrate that both zzso growth factor zzso stimulation and zzso transformation induce zzso zzso of zzso on zzso through a mechanism requiring its zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that both zzso sequence and zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso its ability to interact respectively with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso its recruitment to the zzso In addition, we show that zzso of zzso on zzso is required for zzso zzso while its zzso recruitment at the membrane by zzso is sufficient to trigger spontaneous zzso in absence of zzso Providing the first evidence that zzso zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso and membrane zzso these findings underscore its relevance as a zzso whose zzso is a threshold to elicit growth zzso migratory zzso
