zzso zzso is a normal phenomenon in which cells respond to changes in their environment through a cascade of zzso zzso changes culminating in cell zzso However, it is not clear at what point in this process the cell becomes committed to zzso An early zzso change characteristic of cells undergoing zzso is the loss of plasma membrane zzso such that high levels of zzso become exposed on the outside cell zzso These cells can be recognized by zzso with zzso zzso which binds to zzso with high zzso To investigate the mechanisms controlling zzso zzso we have examined the response of a B cell zzso to zzso of the membrane zzso zzso zzso We have found that many of the cells that stain positive for zzso V are viable and can resume growth and zzso zzso asymmetry once the signal is zzso These results indicate that zzso V zzso and thus loss of membrane zzso precedes commitment to zzso death in this zzso
