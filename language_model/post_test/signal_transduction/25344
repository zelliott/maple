zzso plays important zzso roles in development, growth, zzso and aging of zzso zzso Mouse zzso with altered zzso signaling have been increasingly instrumental in studying zzso zzso However, the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso are difficult to study in mice because zzso is cumbersome and long-term serial sampling is limited by small body size and blood zzso We therefore developed an approach routinely zzso to mice, which detects zzso zzso zzso pattern from randomly obtained spot zzso We determined individual hormone concentration in large groups of mice, ranked the data by zzso and statistically analyzed the resulting zzso This revealed that the zzso distribution of plasma zzso concentration in mice was similar to other zzso and that zzso and sex differences existed as zzso We found handling stress to be a potent immediate zzso of circulating zzso We showed that samples need to be taken within seconds to reflect true zzso levels, unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso measured in the liver correlated strongly with plasma zzso levels, but peak zzso did not further increase the zzso zzso We applied this rank plot analysis to the zzso and zzso zzso IGF-1 zzso knockout zzso mouse zzso and found a high proportion of low zzso zzso indicative of extended trough periods and rare zzso Taken together, we showed that rank plot analysis is a useful method that allows straightforward studies of zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso
