The general stress zzso of zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso factor zzso Environmental stress activates zzso via a zzso cascade that triggers zzso release from an anti zzso factor zzso To determine if the members of the zzso cascade are sufficient to detect environmental stress and activate zzso we expressed zzso and its regulators in zzso zzso In zzso coli, as in zzso zzso the intact collection of regulators silenced zzso while allowing zzso to be active if the zzso most upstream negative regulator was zzso The regulators could not, however, activate zzso in response to ethanol treatment or heat zzso In other experiments, the zzso and zzso zzso known to be important in controlling stress zzso factors in zzso coli, were found to be zzso for zzso activity in zzso zzso The findings argue that stress induction of zzso requires novel factors that are zzso zzso zzso
