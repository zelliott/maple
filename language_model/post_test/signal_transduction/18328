zzso signal recognition particle zzso is a novel type of zzso that contains a zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso absent from all zzso zzso but lacks zzso It is also distinctive in its ability to zzso interact with zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso proteins zzso in the zzso and targeted to the zzso via the zzso zzso integration into zzso zzso requires the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the membrane protein zzso It had previously been shown that the zzso domain, an zzso acid zzso between the second and third zzso zzso and a zzso domain are required for interaction with zzso In the present study we used a pull-down zzso with zzso or zzso fused to zzso to study interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not observed to form significant interactions with any of the proteins even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso binds to the zzso domain, that zzso binds to the zzso domain, and that zzso and zzso independently bind to zzso These data confirm that the novel zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso through binding to zzso
