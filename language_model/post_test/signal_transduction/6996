Adult zzso are rare tumors zzso in general, by their poor prognosis and the paucity of effective zzso However, the deeper understanding of their underlying molecular pathology, signaling pathways and key zzso has permitted the development of a number of drugs able to inhibit important processes in zzso zzso Some of these novel compounds have been assessed in clinical trials with successful zzso 

The latest reported trials are zzso zzso Thus, the Phase III studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are extensively discussed as well as the biological rationale for the use of these zzso In addition, the most promising drugs that still are in earlier stages of development such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso 

It is crucial for the correct identification of active drugs in zzso that new clinical trials are focused on specific zzso and/or molecular zzso The results of these studies should improve the prognosis of the patients affected by zzso in forthcoming zzso
