zzso is generally considered a repressive mark for many zzso zzso However, the in zzso importance of zzso for any given zzso remains unclear and is questionable because the extent of zzso appears zzso low for most zzso Here, we permanently eliminated zzso zzso in mice zzso zzso or zzso and found that zzso mice failed to zzso a simple gain of zzso function or show elevated levels of well-established zzso target zzso Instead, zzso mice exhibited marked zzso abnormalities and changes in cell fate that reflected an inappropriate zzso of zzso signaling and other potential zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and exhibited preferential recruitment to zzso zzso elements in zzso We conclude that the zzso cycle greatly expands the functional capacity of zzso factors such as zzso and is leveraged during development to achieve zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
