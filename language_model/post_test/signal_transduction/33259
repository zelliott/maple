T cells from old mice showed impaired zzso response to zzso zzso To understand the mechanism underlying the age-related impairment of T cell functions, the signal zzso zzso was examined and compared between T cells from young and old mice, and between T cell clones established from a young and old zzso The age-related changes in T cells were as zzso zzso reduction in the expression and the zzso of protein zzso zzso associated with T cell zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso C gamma 1 zzso gamma zzso zzso reduced production of second zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso reduced influx of zzso zzso Thus, a T cell clone established from an old mouse showed impaired proliferation by stimulation with zzso zzso but was fully activated to the level of a T cell clone from a young mouse by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso However, zzso T cells freshly prepared from old mice did not show full recovery by the same zzso The results indicate that one major blockade in the signal zzso of T cells from old mice is present in the zzso just after zzso but besides this, the blockade is also present in multiple sites zzso which can not be zzso by stimulation with zzso plus zzso
