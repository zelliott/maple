The intermediate filament protein zzso is present in zzso zzso and zzso cells but not in mature zzso Here we demonstrate a role for zzso in enhancing zzso cell proliferation and zzso survival, as zzso zzso interference decreased both behaviors by inducing zzso arrest along with zzso zzso and increased protein levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involvement was demonstrated by decreased zzso of its zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso activity and zzso at essential zzso zzso zzso zzso however, did not affect the activities of zzso and zzso complex 2, which directly zzso zzso zzso sites, but instead enhanced the activity of the major regulator of zzso zzso protein zzso type 2A zzso This was accompanied by changes in zzso zzso distribution resulting in increased physical interactions between zzso and zzso as shown by proximity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments further revealed that zzso and zzso form a protein zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso acid resulted in proliferation and zzso and zzso levels similar to those of zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso positively regulates zzso cell proliferation by helping zzso zzso away from zzso thereby favoring zzso zzso
