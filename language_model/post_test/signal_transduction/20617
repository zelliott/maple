zzso and zzso are two zzso proteins that link zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso While some receptors bind zzso directly, others bind zzso which provides a binding site for zzso In order to compare signal zzso through a zzso site with signal zzso through a zzso site, we replaced the zzso site in the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso and zzso sites have similar abilities to activate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, they displayed dramatic differences in their ability to activate DNA zzso
