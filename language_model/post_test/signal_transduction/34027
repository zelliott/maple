zzso zzso and zzso act zzso in the brain to regulate food intake and energy zzso Recently we have reported that zzso enhances the zzso of brain barriers to zzso and we have proposed that zzso enhances energy expenditure in rats by zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is coupled to zzso zzso Because plasma zzso concentration follows a zzso rhythm zzso zzso concentration rise zzso values during the night, after rats start zzso we have hypothesized that the interaction between zzso and zzso should be more intense in animals receiving zzso during the night, zzso during periods of positive energy zzso In order to further characterize the zzso relevance of the interplay between zzso and zzso we have compared the effect of zzso zzso nocturnal administration of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso on zzso body weight and food zzso and zzso zzso zzso by analyzing zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso nucleus of the zzso Our results show that zzso decreases body weight and food intake only after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso was more intense in zzso than in zzso zzso These data suggest that the effect of zzso on zzso pathways follows a zzso rhythm linked to the energy balance status and gives further support to the interaction between zzso and zzso
