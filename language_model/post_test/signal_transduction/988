zzso zzso evidence indicates that calcium plays a critical role in zzso We have previously shown that zzso a zzso calcium channel blocker, zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine the mechanisms by which zzso exerts its zzso zzso zzso Adult male rats were subjected to 30 zzso of zzso followed by 3 h of zzso zzso were zzso to receive either vehicle or zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso before zzso zzso Compared with rats receiving vehicle, those rats treated with zzso had reduced zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by decreased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso zzso c release and zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso exerts its zzso effect by zzso the zzso but not death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment not only increased the zzso activity of zzso at 10 zzso after zzso but also prolonged the duration of zzso zzso zzso treatment had no significant effect on other zzso regulating zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our present study demonstrated for the first time the differential regulation of a calcium channel zzso zzso zzso the balance between zzso and zzso zzso toward an zzso state, decreased zzso zzso c release, reduced zzso zzso and attenuated subsequent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
