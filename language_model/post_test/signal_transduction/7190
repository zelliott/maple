zzso relief is the principal action of zzso zzso zzso a growth hormone zzso zzso is also known to alleviate pain even in cases when zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that mice are prone to sustained pain and devoid of zzso effect in the absence of zzso zzso 4 zzso In the present study, using brain zzso cultured zzso and zzso cells, we showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso exist in a zzso complex and function in synergistic zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso brain regions and spinal zzso Using cultured zzso cells, we describe the zzso complex formation of zzso and zzso at zzso cell body and zzso zzso cells display zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso oppose zzso trafficking induced by individual zzso zzso Furthermore, downstream signaling pathways either associated with withdrawal or pain relief are modulated zzso with a zzso role of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are the possible cellular adaptations to prevent withdrawal induced by chronic zzso zzso Our results reveal direct zzso interaction between zzso and zzso and provide insights for the molecular mechanism for the zzso property of zzso in combination with zzso as a potential therapeutic approach to avoid zzso withdrawal zzso
