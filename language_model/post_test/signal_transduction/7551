The zzso zzso family consists of three zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso family members have no intrinsic zzso activity, but rather function as scaffolding zzso zzso they organize multiple diverse, large signaling complexes that participate in a variety of cellular zzso Moreover, they appear to be zzso zzso for the major zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso family members associate with zzso center zzso III zzso as well as other novel zzso earning these zzso the name zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and zzso studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of zzso and zzso complexes in cellular processes of multiple zzso These studies have identified novel zzso and zzso complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling zzso Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in zzso family complexes because they have revealed roles in zzso cell cycle control, zzso zzso trafficking, zzso zzso cell zzso cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac zzso Moreover, zzso complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, zzso and cerebral cavernous zzso In this review, we discuss the zzso zzso and protein domain structure of zzso family zzso Then we consider the diverse complexes these proteins and their zzso form in various organisms, emphasizing what is known regarding function and zzso Finally, we explore possible roles of zzso family complexes in disease, especially cerebral cavernous zzso
