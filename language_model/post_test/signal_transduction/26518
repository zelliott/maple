zzso zzso zzso anorexia and expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso administration of the zzso inhibitor zzso W zzso the zzso effects of zzso Here we investigated the role of central NO signaling in zzso zzso In zzso studies we tested whether zzso W zzso the zzso zzso of Arc zzso triggered by in zzso or in zzso stimulation with zzso We used the hormone zzso as a functional reference stimulus because zzso is known to activate zzso Arc zzso Further, we investigated whether in zzso zzso stimulation zzso an zzso formation of the second zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso expression we investigated whether zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Finally we tested the effect of zzso injection of zzso W on zzso zzso zzso with zzso W zzso zzso increased zzso activity in 37% of zzso in Arc slices from zzso treated zzso zzso zzso but not from saline treated zzso Similarly, zzso W excited zzso of Arc zzso after in zzso stimulation with zzso zzso zzso In both approaches, a considerable percentage of zzso W sensitive zzso were excited by zzso zzso 50% and zzso zzso In zzso stimulation with zzso induced zzso formation in the zzso which was blocked by zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso a zzso response in the Arc of zzso Central zzso W injection (4 zzso attenuated zzso anorexia and zzso the zzso decrease in respiratory zzso and energy zzso In conclusion, the current findings substantiate a role of central zzso dependent NO formation in zzso effects on eating and energy zzso A pharmacological blockade of NO formation might be a therapeutic approach to zzso zzso zzso
