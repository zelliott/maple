The effect of endurance training zzso 90 zzso for 5 days a week for 60 zzso on cardiac zzso was investigated in the spontaneously zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rats were used as zzso Exercise training enhanced zzso zzso assessed by left zzso zzso length zzso versus zzso zzso in zzso and exercised zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area increased approximately zzso collagen volume fraction decreased approximately zzso and zzso density increased approximately zzso in zzso compared with zzso The zzso abundance of zzso zzso factor and zzso light chain 2 was decreased by the swimming routine zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso factor and zzso light chain 2 in zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso pump was significantly zzso whereas that of zzso zzso was unchanged zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso pump and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Endurance training inhibited zzso as reflected by a decrease in zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity without inducing significant changes in the zzso zzso zzso The swimming routine improved zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso versus zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and decreased the left zzso free wall zzso zzso cavity radius toward an eccentric model of cardiac zzso zzso versus zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we present data demonstrating the effectiveness of endurance training to convert pathological into zzso zzso improving cardiac zzso The reduction of zzso zzso and zzso activity plus the increase in zzso density represent factors to be considered in determining this beneficial zzso
