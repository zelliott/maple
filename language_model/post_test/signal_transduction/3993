zzso zzso have recently been reported as powerful zzso of zzso zzso in a number of cell zzso Given the role of this zzso factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response, zzso zzso have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory zzso We show here that zzso inhibited both zzso 2 zzso synthesis and membrane expression of zzso which are induced during zzso zzso This zzso which occurred with a parallel zzso of zzso zzso functions and zzso was reflected by zzso experiments at the zzso promoter level, and involved not only the zzso of zzso reporter zzso but also that of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso indicated that zzso DTC zzso prevented zzso and zzso zzso activity in T cells zzso with either zzso zzso zzso plus zzso or zzso against the zzso zzso complex and simultaneously activated the binding of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso targeted both zzso and zzso family members, zzso the zzso functions of zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso experiments indicated that zzso promoted a transient and rapid shuttling of zzso and zzso leading to their accelerated export from the nucleus of activated T zzso We propose that the zzso of an zzso zzso by zzso could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the zzso therefore zzso converting the sustained zzso of this zzso factor that occurs during zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso zzso zzso can act by directly zzso zzso In addition, the combined zzso effects on zzso and zzso support a potential use of zzso as zzso
