zzso and zzso signaling mechanisms are traditionally difficult to study due to the zzso nature of the process and the zzso zzso zzso This has proven to be especially limiting in the study of embryonic stem cells that might rely on such signaling for zzso zzso and zzso To better characterize possible effects of zzso and zzso signaling in the setting of expanding stem cells, we developed a zzso model assuming a critical need for zzso survival zzso This model suggested that the precise way in which the removal of putative survival factors could affect stem cell survival in zzso We zzso tested the predictions in mouse embryonic stem cells by taking advantage of a novel zzso device allowing removal of the zzso medium at defined time zzso Experimental results in both zzso and defined zzso media confirmed zzso model predictions, suggested existence of unknown survival factors with distinct rates of zzso and revealed an zzso phase in mouse embryonic stem cell response to a lack of zzso zzso We suggest that the described zzso platform can be used to identify and study specific factors and pathways involved in a wide variety of zzso signaling zzso
