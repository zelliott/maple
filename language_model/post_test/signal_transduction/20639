Cell differentiation zzso zzso is an extraction from healthy human urine consisting of primary organic acids and zzso and it has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and induce differentiation in zzso and other cell zzso But the mechanism of zzso remains zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso inhibited cell growth and induced differentiation of zzso cells, accompanied with decreased expression of zzso Twist and zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso or Twist greatly eliminated the efficiency of zzso in inducing zzso Further study showed that zzso treatment resulted in great changed zzso zzso detected by quantitative zzso in which zzso was one of the most changed zzso and its level was increased by zzso The result of zzso target prediction showed that zzso could regulate hundreds of genes which were relative to cell zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso focal zzso tight zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Twist and zzso zzso and partly eliminated the function of zzso on these zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated for the first time that zzso induced cell differentiation through suppressing Twist and zzso via zzso in zzso zzso
