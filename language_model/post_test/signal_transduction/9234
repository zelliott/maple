To evaluate the effect of zzso interference zzso zzso silence of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso 

zzso specific zzso was used to silence the expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell line zzso The zzso effects of zzso against zzso were studied in zzso and in experimental cancer zzso in nude zzso The potential pathways involved in zzso signaling were detected using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso 

The expression of the zzso was inhibited using zzso in zzso zzso zzso against zzso inhibited cell zzso induced cell zzso and significantly reduced the levels of zzso and zzso when compared with parental and control zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed that zzso against zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells and significantly suppressed tumor growth when it was directly injected into zzso 

zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in the progression of pancreatic cancer, and silence of zzso gene using zzso technique may be a novel therapeutic option for treatment of pancreatic zzso
