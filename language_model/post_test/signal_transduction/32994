The function of the zzso domain zzso of zzso a plasma membrane zzso domain zzso sensor of the zzso zzso zzso response pathway, has been studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that retain an intact zzso domain are capable of zzso the zzso of an zzso zzso By observing levels of zzso zzso as well as the zzso state of zzso the zzso activities of various zzso constructions were zzso In derivatives that do not contain the first zzso zzso activity was no longer dependent on medium zzso but appeared to be zzso active even under conditions of high zzso zzso of the first zzso zzso zzso gave a protein that was strongly zzso whereas zzso was largely zzso as expected if the active form of zzso is zzso When both zzso as well as the zzso were deleted, so that the zzso domain is zzso zzso was not zzso whereas zzso became zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso signaling zzso was not sufficient to result in cell zzso When the zzso of the zzso construct was replaced with a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso so that zzso became mostly zzso In contrast, when the zzso zzso construct was crippled by a zzso of one of the internal zzso the zzso zzso was zzso These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso functions as a zzso and zzso domain but that zzso regulation of activity requires the presence of the first zzso
