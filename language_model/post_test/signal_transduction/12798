Recent evidence suggests that the major zzso complex class II molecules of B zzso function as zzso receptors during the generation of T zzso zzso immune zzso By zzso with other zzso we zzso that zzso of the class II molecules is coupled to the generation of zzso second zzso through interactions involving the zzso and/or zzso zzso of the class II zzso We report a series of experiments that assess which zzso acids of the class II zzso zzso are required for zzso it to the zzso zzso We prepared a series of zzso zzso that express zzso molecules with zzso zzso of either the Ak alpha or Ak beta chain or zzso The ability of each zzso class II zzso to zzso a signal after being bound by zzso zzso was found by monitoring the zzso of protein zzso C from the zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso B zzso zzso indicate that the Ak beta chain plays the dominant role in signal zzso and that the 6 zzso zzso acids of Ak beta chain most zzso to the inner plasma membrane are of greatest importance in zzso zzso molecules to the molecules of the signaling zzso
