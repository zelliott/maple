The zzso activity of a gene can be regulated by a multitude of zzso factors that interact with specific zzso zzso mostly located in the promoter zzso The function of zzso factors is modulated by zzso signal zzso zzso which are activated by specific zzso binding to the appropriate membrane zzso Here we discuss the links between the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response of zzso genes that is achieved by the interplay of a multitude of nuclear zzso factors such as zzso and zzso
