The zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso technologies have yielded large inventories of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The challenge is to find out how these entities work together to regulate the processes by which cells respond to external and internal zzso zzso and zzso modeling of signaling networks has a key role in this task, and network analysis provides insights into biological systems and has applications for zzso Here, we review experimental and theoretical progress and future challenges toward this zzso We focus on how networks are reconstructed from data, how these networks are structured to control the flow of biological information, and how the design features of the networks specify biological zzso
