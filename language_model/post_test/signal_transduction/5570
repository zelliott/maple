zzso zzso receptors delta zzso is known to be expressed zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of cardiac zzso However, relatively less is known regarding the role of zzso in cardiac cells except that zzso zzso treatment protects cardiac zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus, in the present study, we examined the effect of selective zzso zzso zzso on zzso II zzso induced cardiac zzso and its underlying mechanism using zzso According to our data, zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of the fetal gene zzso zzso factor zzso and increase of zzso zzso Previous studies have implicated the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso in the progress of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso increase and subsequent zzso of zzso Further experiment using zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso induced zzso zzso and this was also blocked by zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso using zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso increase and zzso zzso while zzso zzso treatment abolished the effect of zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cardiac zzso by suppressing zzso zzso signaling zzso in a zzso dependent zzso
