zzso cell death in animals is usually associated with zzso zzso and requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell death have been reported, but mostly in experimental conditions that lead some to question their existence it in zzso Loss of zzso cells in the mouse zzso a paradigm of cell death during development zzso is known to include an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that, when zzso activity was inhibited using drugs or when zzso was prevented genetically zzso zzso zzso mice, or mice zzso for a zzso in the gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death still zzso This cell death was negative for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was no overall cell zzso At the electron zzso level, peculiar zzso zzso zzso and marked zzso and membrane zzso suggestive of classical zzso cell death, were observed with no zzso zzso and no local inflammatory zzso Thus, in this zzso context, although zzso activity zzso cell death with an zzso zzso in the absence of zzso activity an underlying mechanism independent of known zzso can also zzso cell death, but with a zzso zzso This cell death can go zzso when using zzso methodology, and cannot be blocked by agents that act on zzso
