Much of cell death from zzso in heart and other zzso is generally thought to arise from zzso zzso transition zzso in the first minutes of zzso In zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso receptors prior to zzso triggers a zzso cascade that protects the heart from zzso We believe that the zzso component of this trigger zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso resulting in increased production of zzso and subsequent zzso of protein zzso G zzso zzso zzso a protein on the zzso outer membrane zzso which then causes the zzso zzso channel zzso on the zzso inner membrane to open, leading to increased production of zzso oxygen species zzso by the zzso This implies that the protective signal is somehow transmitted from the zzso to its inner zzso This is accomplished by a series of zzso zzso steps that includes protein zzso C zzso zzso The resulting zzso then activate a second zzso pool which, through another signal zzso zzso termed the zzso pathway, causes zzso of zzso and reduction in cell zzso
