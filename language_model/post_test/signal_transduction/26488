zzso plays a central role in maintaining energy balance, with multiple other systemic zzso Despite zzso importance in peripheral regulation of zzso stem cells zzso zzso little is known about its expression zzso zzso is often described as zzso while it is expressed by other cell zzso We have recently shown an in zzso zzso zzso enhanced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso expression in zzso from bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso but not zzso expressed zzso that was strongly enhanced by zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso Since zzso was shown to signal via zzso and/or zzso zzso we analyzed the expression of proteins from both zzso In zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso inhibitor zzso induced zzso expression and significantly restored zzso zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso These results suggested the zzso zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso while zzso as an zzso Indeed, zzso expression zzso induced zzso expression zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced the expression of zzso while decreasing zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso In zzso differentiation revealed differential zzso potential in zzso zzso and zzso that was correlated to their zzso expression zzso Our results suggest that zzso balance regulates zzso expression in zzso It also zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso for cell therapy protocols where zzso expression is not zzso
