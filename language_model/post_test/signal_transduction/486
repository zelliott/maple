Most zzso cells, besides their ubiquitous zzso zzso are polarized within the plane of the zzso which is called zzso cell polarity zzso Using zzso as a model, meaningful progress has been made in the identification of key zzso factors and the dissection of their zzso molecular zzso The zzso global aspects of coordinated polarization and the zzso regulatory mechanisms that create the initial polarity direction have, however, remained zzso Several recent publications have outlined potential mechanisms of how the global regulation of zzso might be controlled and how the distinct core factor groups might interact via zzso Van zzso or zzso This review focuses on these exciting features and attempts to provide an integrated picture of these recent and novel zzso
