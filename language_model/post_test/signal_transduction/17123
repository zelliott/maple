zzso activity of zzso box zzso factor class O zzso proteins can result in a variety of cellular outcomes depending on cell type and zzso zzso These zzso factors are zzso regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling pathway, which is thought to have a pivotal role in regulating survival of tumor cells in a variety of zzso Recently, it has become clear that zzso proteins can promote resistance to zzso zzso designed to inhibit zzso activity, by inducing the expression of proteins that provide feedback at different levels of this zzso We questioned whether such a feedback mechanism may also exist directly at the level of zzso zzso To identify critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso we performed gene expression analyses after conditional zzso of key components of the zzso signaling zzso and identified zzso as a direct zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso followed by next-generation sequencing, we show that zzso binds enhancers that are zzso by zzso By sequencing the zzso of cells in which zzso is specifically activated in the absence of zzso we demonstrate that zzso can zzso the expression of a specific subset of zzso target zzso including zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in increased cell death, demonstrating that zzso prevents zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso represents an important zzso of zzso transcription, promoting cellular zzso
