The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the zzso assembly and zzso modification of proteins destined for the zzso zzso and for zzso The processes which occur in the zzso of the zzso are vital to the correct functioning of the cell, and mechanisms must exist to enable the cell to monitor events within the zzso of the zzso How the cell is able to do this is not known, but it would apparently require the passage of signals from the zzso of the zzso to the zzso from where signals can be sent to, for example, the nucleus to effect changes in zzso Here, it is suggested that the membrane of the zzso may contain the components zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso in much the same way as the plasma membrane zzso This hypothesis will be discussed in relation to known zzso proteins which might act as zzso zzso
