The zzso zzso zzso defines an zzso zzso cell signaling mechanism that zzso cell fate choices through local cell zzso The zzso repeat region of the zzso zzso is essential for signaling and has been implicated in the interactions between zzso and two zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Here we examine directly the function of the zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso by transgenic and zzso zzso We present evidence implicating the zzso repeats in the regulation of zzso signaling through zzso zzso In zzso expression of the zzso zzso repeats reveals a cell zzso effect and elicits zzso zzso that indicate the existence of novel downstream events in zzso zzso These signaling activities are independent of the known zzso zzso and suggest the existence of yet unidentified zzso zzso zzso
