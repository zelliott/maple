zzso is an important zzso regulator of growth and function in zzso zzso The mechanism of action of zzso depends on interaction with its zzso coupled to zzso G zzso We show here that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso cells and in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso zzso zzso The zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are rapidly zzso zzso in response to zzso We also find that zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso indicating that the zzso may be able to signal through the zzso zzso zzso used by the zzso zzso zzso increases zzso promoter activity and also zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso a known target gene of zzso The expression of a dominant negative form of zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso is able to signal through zzso zzso
