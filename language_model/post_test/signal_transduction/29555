The role of transforming growth zzso zzso in regulation of zzso growth and zzso events zzso its signals are not zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso cell proliferation in 10 primary human zzso cell cultures and whether zzso signals are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso pathways in zzso We also tested whether zzso zzso to zzso alter zzso stimulation of zzso cell zzso On average, zzso reduced zzso cell zzso incorporation to zzso of controls at zzso and to zzso of controls at 36 zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation was associated with a suggestion increased zzso of zzso 2/3 in 2 cases and high zzso zzso in 3 but no change in zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso As shown zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in the 3 cultures zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso this stimulation in 2 of 3 zzso These findings suggest that zzso exerts a largely zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso perhaps in part through zzso zzso
