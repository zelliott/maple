The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, elicits the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso lateral region of the zzso and produces an acute zzso response in zzso that zzso with the motor side effects of zzso in zzso Mice harboring a targeted disruption of the zzso zzso of protein zzso A have a profound deficit in zzso zzso activity in the zzso When treated with haloperidol, zzso zzso mice fail to induce either zzso or zzso zzso and the acute zzso response is zzso However, both zzso and zzso mice become zzso when zzso zzso is directly injected into the lateral zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso does not interfere with the action of zzso but rather its synthesis and zzso These results establish a direct role for protein zzso A as a zzso of zzso induced gene induction and zzso zzso
