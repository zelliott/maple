The zzso zzso class of zzso drugs, which are zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to possess potent zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show in zzso cells that zzso zzso inhibit zzso expression by transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso 1 enhanced zzso zzso zzso and this enhancement was zzso by zzso with zzso zzso mobility shift zzso identified that zzso inhibited zzso zzso DNA binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso reporter activity but not zzso binding elements reporter activity without affecting zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso expression by suppressing zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely zzso the zzso effect of zzso and incompletely blocked its effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Delta zzso zzso did not affect the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso dependent on zzso while zzso acts through a dual mechanism independent of and dependent on zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso
