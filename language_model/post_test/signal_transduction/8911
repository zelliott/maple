zzso cell zzso regulates multiple cellular processes crucial for development, zzso and zzso Since zzso lack zzso activity they need to recruit zzso and signaling proteins to mediate their zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso associate with zzso tails and thereby link zzso with the zzso zzso and various signaling zzso In comparison to their role in regulating zzso function in zzso zzso less is known about the functions of zzso and zzso in other cellular zzso such as zzso contacts and in the zzso
