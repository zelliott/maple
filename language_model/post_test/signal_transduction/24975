Ras proteins are small zzso playing a pivotal role in cell proliferation and zzso Their zzso state depends on the competing action of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Exchange zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in all zzso zzso identified so far has been previously shown to be essential for zzso zzso Its substitution with zzso acid results in a zzso inactive zzso which is able to efficiently zzso zzso zzso from zzso and to originate a stable zzso zzso complex due to the reduced affinity of the zzso zzso complex for the incoming zzso We show here that this zzso zzso can be zzso to zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in mouse zzso transformed by zzso zzso In fact zzso of the dominant negative zzso in stable zzso cells strongly reduces zzso zzso levels in zzso transformed zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso on the basis of zzso cell cycle and zzso independent zzso The zzso of the transformed zzso is accompanied by DNA zzso The possible use of dominant negative zzso zzso as a tool to zzso tumor growth is zzso
