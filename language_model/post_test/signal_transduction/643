The sequencing of whole zzso including those of model organisms, has provided an unprecedented resource to the research community to make sense of the genetic zzso However, it is the advent of novel functional zzso technologies that have been truly instrumental in bridging the gap between gene sequence and gene zzso The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth in the development and zzso of zzso screening zzso technologies that researchers are now using to discover zzso in an zzso zzso time and zzso zzso One of the most promising functional zzso approach that has emerged in the past few years is based on zzso zzso in which the introduction of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso into cells or whole organisms can effectively suppress zzso gene zzso The zzso screening technology has made it feasible to query the function of whole zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso pathways and the zzso between them in zzso zzso that are known to influence important cell biological functions, such as cell proliferation and growth, cell zzso cell zzso and cell zzso In this review we discuss the application, advantages and limitations of zzso and other zzso technologies in the identification of novel zzso of zzso zzso with a focus on the zzso signaling zzso We also discuss the future scope and utility of designing additional zzso of these zzso zzso
