The zzso family of proteins have the potential to act as both zzso adapters and zzso for zzso zzso They have therefore been proposed as regulators of the zzso in various cell zzso We have used zzso from mice deficient in all three zzso zzso to determine how their function affects cell zzso and zzso zzso lacking zzso proteins adopt an zzso zzso and have enhanced migratory persistence in zzso To investigate the pathways through which zzso proteins exert their effects we zzso the responses of zzso to the zzso zzso and to zzso We found that zzso and zzso responses of zzso to zzso did not require zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and cell zzso were all dependent on zzso zzso We propose that zzso proteins affect zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso receptors to zzso and zzso activity and regulating zzso zzso events such as zzso and zzso zzso by acting as zzso
