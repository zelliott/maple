The zzso gene family plays a crucial role during the development of zzso zzso The zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso are close relatives of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso but their function is not currently zzso To investigate their role, we identified zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso contributes zzso with zzso to the maintenance of the shoot zzso zzso zzso and organ zzso zzso with this role, the expression domain of zzso in the SAM marks the boundaries between the SAM and zzso The lack of zzso activity in the zzso zzso double zzso and the fusion of zzso were linked to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso is expressed later than zzso and zzso In agreement with this fact, zzso and zzso were zzso required for zzso zzso These data provide the basis for a model in which zzso contributes to SAM maintenance and boundary establishment in the zzso via the zzso zzso zzso although the closest related member of the family to zzso did not have such a zzso
