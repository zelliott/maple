zzso has increased in prevalence worldwide, attributed in part to the influences of an zzso environment and genetic zzso While obesity and overweight increasingly seem to be the norm, there remain individuals who resist zzso We present here an overview of data supporting the idea that zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso 1) may be a key component of brain mechanisms underlying obesity zzso Prior work with models of obesity and obesity resistance in zzso has shown that increased zzso and/or zzso sensitivity is correlated with elevated spontaneous physical activity zzso and that zzso zzso contributes to obesity resistance via increased zzso activity zzso zzso However, central zzso zzso signaling mechanisms that regulate zzso remain zzso Our ongoing studies and work of others support the hypothesis that one such mechanism may be zzso of a zzso factor 1 alpha zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso may promote obesity resistance both by increasing zzso and by influencing the zzso state of zzso zzso zzso We discuss potential mechanisms based on both animal and in zzso pharmacological studies, in the context of zzso potential molecular targets for obesity prevention and zzso
