Fluorescent protein zzso now permit spatial zzso of specific zzso signaling molecules to be observed in real zzso zzso models have been used to simulate molecular zzso and other spatial patterns within cells, and the output of such models may be compared directly with experiments if the binding of the fluorescent probe and the physics of the imaging technique are each zzso Here we present a comprehensive model describing the dynamics of 3' zzso zzso zzso second zzso produced in the plasma membrane in response to stimulation of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, as monitored in the zzso contact area using total internal reflection zzso zzso With this technique it was previously shown that uniform stimulation of zzso with zzso growth factor elicits the formation of zzso 3' zzso zzso which we now characterize in the context of our zzso We find that upper and lower bounds on the relevant zzso model zzso values for an individual cell can be calculated from four zzso zzso zzso Based on our analysis, we expect that the key zzso group, the ratio of 3' zzso turnover and diffusion rates, can be estimated within approximately zzso or zzso
