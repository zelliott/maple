Systems with zzso zzso zzso dynamics were recently introduced in order to study the convergence of positive feedback zzso zzso to many different equilibrium zzso The author shows how this notion can be used to perform zzso analysis and globally predict zzso of a zzso feedback zzso just by using the knowledge of zzso zzso responses of the zzso To illustrate the theory, this method is then applied to a recently published model of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, some examples zzso motivated by molecular zzso of systems that enjoy the property are presented and zzso
