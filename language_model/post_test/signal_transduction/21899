zzso for specifically regulating transplanted cells have many applications in gene and cell zzso We examined the response of human zzso blood zzso cells to a specific zzso signal in zzso Using a conditional signaling zzso zzso that is specifically activated by an artificial zzso called a chemical zzso of zzso zzso human zzso cells transplanted into immune deficient mice were induced to zzso Only zzso zzso precursors and zzso and zzso zzso zzso unit zzso and burst forming zzso zzso zzso however, the nature of the response differed markedly between bone zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso induced a 12- to zzso expansion of differentiated zzso precursors and a loss of zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso induced a marked rise in zzso and zzso and, relative to zzso a much less prominent rise in more mature red zzso zzso analysis was most consistent with the interpretation that the zzso and bone zzso zzso regulate the response of human zzso to a zzso zzso possibly influencing zzso expansion versus zzso These findings establish zzso as in zzso growth factors for human zzso zzso
