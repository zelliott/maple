zzso zzso factors critically control fundamental cellular zzso including zzso cell zzso cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and other reactions to cellular zzso zzso factors sense the balance between stimuli promoting growth and differentiation versus stress stimuli signaling zzso Integrated through the zzso system, these divergent stimuli decide on cell fate, a choice between zzso zzso or zzso In pancreatic beta cells, most recent evidence highlights complex zzso responses to zzso insulin, or other growth factors, which include regulatory zzso In the short term, zzso mechanisms help beta cells to accomplish their zzso function, and may increase their resistance to zzso stress due to transient zzso In the long term, zzso responses lead to the adaptation of beta cell mass, conditioning the future ability of the zzso to produce insulin and cope with changes in fuel zzso zzso emerges as a key factor for the maintenance of a functional zzso zzso and represents an interesting element in the development of therapeutic approaches to treat zzso This review on the role of zzso zzso factors in pancreatic beta cells has three zzso In Part I, zzso zzso factors will be presented in general: structure, molecular mechanisms of regulation, cellular functions, and zzso zzso Part II will focus on specific data about zzso factors in pancreatic beta zzso zzso in Part III, it will be attempted to combine general and beta zzso knowledge with the aim to zzso globally the role of zzso factors in beta zzso physiology and zzso
