In this study, three kinds of zzso drugs were analyzed to explore their potential zzso zzso First, target proteins that could interact with zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Then, the target proteins of the three drugs were zzso Cell signaling zzso enrichment and related disease enrichment were conducted for the intersected proteins to extract the enrichment categories associated with zzso By regulation network analysis of the protein zzso the mechanisms of action of these target proteins in tumor tissue were zzso thus confirming the potential zzso mechanisms of the zzso zzso The final results of cell signaling zzso enrichment and related disease enrichment showed that the categories with the highest score were all found in zzso Target proteins belonging to the tumor category included signaling zzso members such as zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Moreover, another target zzso zzso could indirectly act on target proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby affecting tumor cell division and zzso zzso zzso drugs may have potential zzso effects, and zzso target proteins play important roles in the process of cell signaling zzso zzso
