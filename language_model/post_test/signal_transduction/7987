zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso However, the downstream mechanism that accounts for the zzso actions of zzso during zzso zzso has not been zzso We report that zzso a zzso zzso selective, and zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso cell zzso induced by zzso zzso via suppression of the zzso zzso This zzso to the decrease in zzso zzso at 20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 3 h after zzso zzso Additionally, zzso attenuated the increased expression of zzso induced by zzso at 3 zzso The administration of zzso prior to zzso was also zzso Thus, our findings imply that zzso can inhibit the zzso of the zzso zzso and protect zzso zzso zzso cells against zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that targeting the zzso zzso provides a promising therapeutic approach for zzso zzso zzso
