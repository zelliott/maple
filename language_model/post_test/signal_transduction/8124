zzso stem cells zzso are zzso and give rise to distinctly differentiated cells from all three germ zzso While zzso zzso blood derived zzso cells were previously shown to be capable of zzso into the neural lineage both in zzso and in zzso the underlying molecular mechanisms and signal zzso pathways remain to be zzso In this study, we show that zzso cells from zzso zzso blood are capable of neural differentiation and this capability is zzso by the zzso zzso A zzso signal zzso zzso While zzso of zzso via experimental zzso zzso leads to outgrowth of zzso structures as well as expression of neural marker zzso blocking zzso activity completely zzso all these zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that zzso function is sufficient and required for zzso outgrowth and regulation of neural specific gene expression in zzso stem cells from zzso zzso
