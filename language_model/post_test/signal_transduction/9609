Recent technological advances have made it possible to identify and zzso thousands of proteins in a single zzso zzso As a result of these developments, the analysis of data has become the bottleneck of zzso zzso To provide the zzso community with a zzso platform for comprehensive analysis, inspection and zzso of quantitative zzso data we developed the zzso zzso Data Explorer zzso The program requires no special zzso training, as all functions of zzso are accessible within its zzso zzso interface which will be intuitive to most zzso Basic features facilitate the uncomplicated management and organization of large data sets and complex experimental zzso as well as the inspection and zzso plotting of quantitative zzso These are zzso by readily available high-level analysis options such as database zzso zzso based on abundance ratios, feature enrichment tests for zzso GO terms and zzso analysis zzso A number of plotting options for zzso of quantitative zzso data is available and most analysis functions in zzso create zzso high quality zzso displays in both zzso and zzso zzso The generic import requirements allow data originating from essentially all mass zzso platforms, zzso strategies and software to be analyzed in the zzso zzso represents a powerful approach to zzso data analysis providing zzso zzso with a zzso for zzso analysis of quantitative zzso zzso The program is released as zzso and can be freely downloaded from the project zzso at zzso
