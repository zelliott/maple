Multiple zzso mechanisms exist in complex zzso to resist zzso zzso including a variety of zzso zzso pathways that control cell proliferation and zzso In zzso additional mechanisms of tumor resistance could potentially rely on cancer cell elimination by specialized zzso zzso such as natural killer zzso zzso Such mechanisms would require that cancer cells be reliably distinguished from normal zzso The zzso for zzso an zzso zzso cell zzso are expressed on many tumor cell lines and at least some primary human zzso However, it is unknown whether their expression is induced as a direct result of zzso transformation in zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso are induced on spontaneously arising tumors in a zzso model of zzso and that zzso is involved in their zzso zzso of zzso zzso is induced at an early, distinct stage of zzso upon acquisition of genetic zzso unique to cancer cells, potentially defining a critical step in zzso This finding suggests that the regulation of zzso zzso depends on a mechanism for intrinsic sensing of zzso zzso
