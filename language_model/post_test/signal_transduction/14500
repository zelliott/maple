The zzso group and its target genes regulate diverse aspects of plant development, including zzso and lateral zzso formation, leaf zzso and vascular zzso We demonstrate here that zzso genes are zzso controlled in regulating shoot zzso zzso zzso and floral development in parallel to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso cleave same target zzso individual zzso genes exhibit distinct expression zzso in different plant zzso The zzso expression is also temporarily zzso zzso with the dynamic expression patterns, an array of zzso in SAM activities and floral zzso was observed in the zzso zzso In addition, when a zzso zzso was genetically crossed with zzso defective in the zzso pathway, the zzso crosses exhibited additive zzso effects, suggesting that the zzso signal exerts its role via a distinct signaling zzso
