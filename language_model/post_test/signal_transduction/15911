The zzso a dynamic network of zzso zzso plays a central role in numerous fundamental zzso such as development, zzso and cellular responses to zzso and zzso zzso As a platform for innate immune responses in zzso cells, the zzso zzso is a central component in the organization and zzso of host defenses, including signaling and cellular zzso In plants, our understanding of the genetic and zzso responses in both pathogen and host that are required for zzso and resistance has grown zzso Additional advances in zzso imaging of zzso dynamics have markedly altered our view of zzso turnover in zzso In this review, we outline current knowledge of host resistance following pathogen perception, both in terms of the genetic interactions that mediate defense zzso as well as the zzso and cellular processes that are required for defense zzso
