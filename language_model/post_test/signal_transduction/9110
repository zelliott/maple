zzso signaling molecules are critical for both human brain development and the zzso of zzso We examined the expression of transcripts derived from three genes related to zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso formation of a large cohort of zzso control human brains zzso zzso zzso across the lifespan (from fetal week 14 to 80 zzso and in patients with schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso using quantitative zzso We also examined whether a schizophrenia zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso is related to expression of these zzso Our studies revealed that development and maturation of both the zzso and zzso formation are characterized by progressive switches in expression from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that the former leads to zzso zzso and the latter leads to switching from zzso to zzso zzso In the zzso formation, zzso and zzso ratios are increased in patients with zzso reflecting a potentially immature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression ratios are associated with zzso zzso with risk zzso again predicting a relatively less mature zzso These findings suggest that abnormalities in zzso signaling critical to brain development contribute to genetic risk for zzso
