zzso are zzso signaling zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are activated by zzso zzso Here, we have cloned mouse zzso and functionally characterized its ability to zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso active zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso were zzso zzso and induced zzso interaction with zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso active zzso type I zzso In contrast, zzso active zzso type I zzso zzso did not exhibit any action on zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced the promoter of zzso a zzso gene that responds specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit the increase of alkaline zzso activity induced by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The presence of zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells and zzso suggests a role of zzso in the zzso differentiation and zzso
