zzso constitutes the primary line of host innate and zzso zzso against incoming microbial zzso providing an efficient means for their removal and zzso However, several virulent bacteria that do not function as zzso pathogens have evolved mechanisms to avoid and prevent zzso that constitute an essential part of their zzso zzso Some of these mechanisms include preventing recognition by zzso receptors or blocking zzso by professional zzso Recently, the molecular mechanisms of such zzso properties have been zzso for some zzso Such mechanisms illustrate the diversity of mechanisms bacterial pathogens use to avoid zzso zzso
