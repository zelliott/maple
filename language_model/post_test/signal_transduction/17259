zzso cerebral zzso induced by permanent zzso of the bilateral common carotid artery zzso in rats has been commonly used for the study of Alzheimer's disease and vascular zzso Despite the apparent cognitive dysfunction in rats with zzso the molecular markers or pathways involved in the pathological zzso have not been clearly zzso 

zzso changes zzso 21, 35, 45, 55 and 70 zzso in gene expression in the zzso of rats after zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to identify the functional involvement of temporally regulated genes in zzso 

Two major gene expression patterns were observed in the zzso of rats after zzso One pattern, which was composed of zzso early zzso genes after the surgical zzso was zzso involved in zzso biological functions zzso discovery rate zzso Another pattern composed of 182 temporally delayed zzso genes was involved in sensory perception such as zzso and zzso functions zzso In addition to the two gene expression patterns, the zzso change of GO and the zzso activities using all zzso expressed genes also confirmed that an immune response was the main early change, whereas sensory functions were delayed zzso Moreover, we identified zzso and zzso as possible core genes in the sensory function loss process using text-based mining and interaction network zzso 

The zzso regulatory mechanism first reported here could provide molecular evidence of zzso impaired memory in rats as well as mechanism of the development of vascular zzso
