zzso zzso of zzso fat is robustly inhibited by insulin or by feedback zzso by the zzso fatty acids zzso produced during zzso However, the mode of action of zzso in suppressing zzso zzso is not zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso that is neither zzso into lipids nor zzso and therefore, it was exploited for suppressing zzso zzso in zzso to natural zzso zzso is shown here to suppress zzso zzso in the rat in zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is due to decrease in zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso levels is accounted for by zzso of the zzso zzso due to suppression of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso of zzso is further zzso by induction of components of the zzso by zzso Our findings imply genuine zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso independent of their zzso or zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso and cellular zzso levels independent of the insulin zzso zzso may indicate that synthetic zzso could serve as insulin zzso in the zzso context under conditions of insulin zzso
