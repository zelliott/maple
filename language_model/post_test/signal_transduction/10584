zzso transplantation is associated with a high rate of early graft failure caused by early immune attack and poor functionality of zzso zzso of zzso cells appears soon after zzso isolation and primarily involves the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of zzso to zzso zzso zzso proteins on survival of the zzso of zzso following zzso zzso zzso that had been cultured for 24 h on collagen type I showed an zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso while zzso that had been cultured on collagen type IV and zzso showed an zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that had been zzso with zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso peptides showed a decrease in the level of zzso by a factor of zzso and zzso respectively, and an increase of zzso zzso zzso activity by a factor of zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso When detached from their natural zzso surrounding in the zzso zzso cells undergo zzso unless zzso are cultured on collagen IV or zzso or treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso peptides to mimic zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso may offer opportunities to improve function and viability of zzso zzso
