The zzso effect of zzso on the cellular response to growth factor stimulation is well zzso Given the significant overlap in signaling pathways involved in regulating cell proliferation and stress zzso we hypothesized that zzso would also affect a cell's ability to respond to environmental zzso Here we investigated the ability of zzso to zzso the cellular response to sodium zzso and thereby alter survival of the human cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were found to be much more sensitive to the toxic effects of sodium zzso than either zzso parental cells or parental cells zzso with an empty zzso zzso the zzso cells also exhibited a significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which additional studies suggested was likely due to decreased neutral zzso activity and zzso zzso In contrast to its extensively documented zzso influence, the elevated activity of zzso appears to be important in zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso as both zzso of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso markedly improved the survival of zzso zzso This zzso influence of the zzso zzso in zzso cells appeared not to be unique to sodium zzso as zzso zzso also resulted in increased survival in the presence of zzso In zzso our results indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which appears to be a death signal in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso cells to environmental zzso
