To determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso expression in pancreatic zzso and to further assess signaling mechanisms regulating zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso cancer remains one of the leading causes of zzso cancer zzso novel strategies for the early detection and treatment of these zzso is zzso Previously, the authors have shown that zzso an important zzso hormone, stimulates the proliferation of an zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso 

A total of 26 human pancreatic zzso obtained after zzso and 5 pancreatic cancer zzso were analyzed for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substance P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth in response to zzso was determined in zzso a zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso was expressed in zzso of the surgical specimens examined and all five of the pancreatic cancer zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected in zzso zzso and zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso functionally coupled to the zzso signaling pathway, was identified in zzso zzso treatment with zzso (10 zzso zzso proliferation of these zzso 

The authors demonstrated zzso expression in most of the pancreatic zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected in fewer of the pancreatic zzso The expression of zzso and other zzso receptors suggests the potential role of zzso manipulation in the treatment of these zzso Further, the presence of zzso receptors may provide for targeted chemotherapy or radiation therapy or in zzso zzso for early zzso
