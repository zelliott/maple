zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two major zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso To clarify the role of zzso in the interaction between zzso zzso and the innate immune system, zzso reporter cells expressing zzso or zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso of nuclear zzso in these cells was zzso While zzso cells and zzso cells, an zzso zzso derived from zzso cells, failed to respond to zzso zzso zzso they responded to zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells responded to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso have no effects on zzso signaling from zzso zzso but have zzso effects on zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Indeed, the activity of zzso zzso zzso to induce the zzso of zzso cells was diminished after treatment of the bacterial cells with zzso We next partially zzso bacterial cell components zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso The activity of the partially zzso components was diminished by treatment with heat or zzso It is also noteworthy that zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells induced by the partially zzso zzso These results indicated that the components of zzso zzso that were able to induce zzso zzso signaling were zzso by zzso before being recognized by zzso The zzso of the components would be helpful for zzso zzso to escape from the innate immune zzso
