We have previously demonstrated that zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso powerfully inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso The aim of the present study was to assess whether these compounds are effective at zzso the growth of B cells at more advanced stages of zzso including fully transformed B zzso To this end, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso We report that zzso zzso and zzso also markedly inhibit the proliferation of zzso by inducing zzso growth arrest as well as enhancing rates of zzso zzso all but 1 zzso of the 8 zzso cell lines investigated were poorly zzso Moreover, unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells rapidly resumed proliferation upon drug zzso Analysis of cell zzso proteins showed that, as in zzso strong zzso of zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso While the zzso activity of all 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was strongly inhibited in zzso zzso only zzso zzso activity was reduced in zzso cells arrested in zzso by zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells failed to show the zzso of zzso D3 observed in zzso Use of zzso zzso and zzso showed that in zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso growth arrest is mainly zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was also effective at very low zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, comparable levels of zzso zzso were found in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, indicating that mechanisms different from zzso deregulation of zzso probably zzso the differential responsiveness of zzso zzso
