zzso is a potent inhibitor against zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso that has been approved for the clinical treatment of advanced zzso and liver zzso Combining zzso with other agents has been shown to improve its zzso efficacy by not only reducing the toxic side effects but also preventing primary and acquired resistance to zzso We have previously observed that zzso exhibits potent zzso effects in human zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the synergistic zzso activity of zzso in combination with zzso 

This was a zzso investigation that included the in zzso effects of zzso in combination with zzso on cancer cells and the in zzso zzso efficacy of this drug combination on zzso zzso in nude zzso 

Combined treatment showed a good synergistic zzso effect yet spared zzso zzso The potential molecular mechanism may be mainly that it activated zzso death zzso and induced zzso zzso in the cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso may also be involved in zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso plus zzso may be attributed to the induction of the intrinsic zzso zzso through zzso zzso This finding provides a novel approach that may broaden the clinical application of zzso
