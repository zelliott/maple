Signaling by members of the zzso growth factor zzso family plays an important role in breast development and breast zzso Earlier work suggested that one of these zzso zzso is coupled to unique responses in this zzso To determine the function of zzso signaling in the normal mouse zzso zzso we zzso zzso signaling by expressing a zzso terminally deleted zzso zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso in the zzso zzso Despite the expression of zzso from zzso through later stages of zzso development, an zzso zzso was not observed until zzso At zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso protein were condensed and lacked normal zzso zzso zzso In these zzso zzso zzso detected by in zzso zzso was zzso However, zzso zzso protein zzso was reduced, and zzso zzso was zzso zzso expression was detected by zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso was not zzso at zzso and was, therefore, probably zzso When expressed zzso in zzso cells, zzso induced zzso of zzso This zzso required an intact zzso zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that zzso signaling is necessary for zzso terminal differentiation and zzso zzso at zzso
