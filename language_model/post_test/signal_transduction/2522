The ability of organisms to quickly respond to stresses requires the zzso of many zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso intermediate zzso is thought to be particularly important for zzso and zzso signaling pathways during zzso stress zzso Here we present the first evidence that zzso and other zzso zzso are signaling molecules in the zzso zzso heat stress zzso Our data show a zzso transient increase in the concentration of zzso and zzso more than a zzso transient increase in zzso and zzso and a more stable zzso increase in zzso containing zzso and a zzso increase in zzso containing zzso following heat zzso Treatment of cells with zzso activates zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and causes zzso a known zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter zzso showing that the global stress response element, zzso found in many zzso promoter sequences can be activated by zzso zzso The zzso promoter contains four zzso that may mediate zzso zzso Using genetic and other approaches it should be possible to identify zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso and zzso the importance of each during heat zzso
