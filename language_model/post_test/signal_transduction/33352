zzso zzso zzso zzso vessels from the zzso of the guinea-pig were examined in zzso to investigate their zzso activity and the zzso of this activity between adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso at fairly regular intervals and exhibited zzso periods of up to 3 s during which zzso did not zzso zzso The zzso activity of adjacent zzso was highly zzso zzso The smooth muscle was found to be continuous between the adjacent zzso for the majority of valve regions examined zzso zzso of 63 zzso zzso Mechanical and electrical zzso between adjacent zzso was zzso as some zzso underwent transient zzso just prior to zzso whereas direct zzso zzso showed that the smooth muscle of most adjacent zzso was zzso coupled across the valve (15 out of 20 pairs of zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso of guinea-pig zzso zzso vessels rhythmically zzso with the zzso activity of adjacent zzso highly zzso The findings also indicate that transmission of both mechanical and electrical signals between the adjacent zzso contribute to the zzso of their zzso zzso
