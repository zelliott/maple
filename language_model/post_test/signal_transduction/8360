zzso swelling of zzso zzso cells has been suggested to contribute to retinal zzso We determined the role of zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso cell swelling in the zzso zzso 

The size of zzso cell zzso was recorded before and during zzso of retinal sections and isolated zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso were freshly isolated from zzso mice and mice deficient in zzso zzso receptors zzso or cultured as zzso for three zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells was recorded in isolated cells, and retinal slices were zzso against zzso 

zzso exposure for 4 zzso induced a swelling of zzso cell bodies in retinal slices from zzso mice but not zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors or of the zzso induced zzso swelling of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the swelling of zzso cells from zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the swelling of zzso cells from zzso zzso this effect was blocked by an zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells and the zzso zzso of retinal slices were not different between zzso and zzso mice, both in freshly isolated zzso and retinal organ zzso 

The data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso generated zzso mediates the volume zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso is zzso by enhancement of zzso zzso zzso
