We reported previously a novel mode of action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through the direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We aimed to further clarify the mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso which leads to prolonged zzso oxide zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (in zzso zzso release NO by zzso zzso NO zzso zzso in bovine and zzso NO zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso activate zzso by zzso different signaling zzso zzso enhances zzso generation and zzso zzso by first zzso zzso release and then the influx of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso stimulates only the influx of zzso zzso through rare zzso channels, and its effect is blocked by zzso toxin or protein zzso C zzso In addition, unlike zzso zzso can also release NO independent of zzso in bovine zzso zzso The inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso induce both zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso activate zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso enhance zzso zzso and release NO independent of zzso zzso This is the first report on the direct zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in human zzso zzso This interaction leads to prolonged NO release and possibly contributes to the documented benefits of the use of zzso zzso
