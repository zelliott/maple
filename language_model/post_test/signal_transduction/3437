An imbalance between zzso and zzso pathways in brain cells can lead to zzso cell death and zzso While such imbalance is known to be associated with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso the underlying mechanisms remain zzso We identified the protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso an zzso associated with zzso zzso as a key trigger of survival pathways that can prevent zzso death and zzso in the adult zzso We show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso limits zzso zzso zzso and zzso overload during an zzso event, while zzso zzso favors zzso overload and cell zzso The protective effect of zzso is associated with a selective zzso on a zzso zzso by zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso which promotes zzso pathways and associated zzso zzso These results reveal a novel contributor to the mechanisms of zzso and underscore the importance of zzso zzso in these zzso They provide a new target for the development of potential therapeutic treatment of zzso
