zzso stem zzso cells have a broad potential application in zzso medicine and can be differentiated into cells of all three germ zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso proteins is essential for the differentiation zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso that have the ability to activate many zzso signaling zzso zzso we zzso that the expression and function of zzso receptors is a critical step in zzso zzso Using functional cell zzso zzso our study demonstrates that zzso is a major functional zzso zzso expressed on the cell surface of zzso mouse zzso cells, which showed significantly higher binding to zzso as compared to zzso This zzso was specific zzso by zzso zzso as evident from the zzso with a zzso selective for this particular zzso zzso of zzso cells on zzso or on a collagen zzso zzso caused further selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the cells, as evaluated by zzso zzso analysis and quantitative zzso was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers zzso zzso 17, zzso in parallel to increased expression of zzso zzso Taken together, the data indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells to specific zzso molecules are linked to early stages of mouse embryonic stem cells commitment to zzso zzso
