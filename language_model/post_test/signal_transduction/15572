We have applied search zzso to expression databases to identify genes whose expression is restricted to the zzso zzso Such genes frequently play a critical role in zzso biology and zzso Two such genes are the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express both zzso and zzso which we have knocked down using zzso zzso interfering zzso and then studied the effect in a variety of in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited in zzso tube formation on zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells increased the number of zzso extensions from the cell, but failed to do so in zzso zzso Separate zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso zzso We conclude from this and other work that a zzso of zzso and zzso signals through zzso zzso syndrome zzso and other zzso zzso factors to increase the number of zzso and cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein in zzso cells also reduced zzso and impaired tube formation on zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies showed that, in contrast with the zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that all three of these genes are critical for effective zzso cell migration and, in turn, zzso
