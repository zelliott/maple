As the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Barrett's esophagus zzso is characterized by zzso zzso in the normal esophagus zzso Gene expression profiling with zzso and serial analysis of gene expression zzso may help us understand the potential molecular mechanism of human zzso 

We analyzed three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso with statistical tools, significance analysis of zzso zzso and zzso to identify individual genes zzso expressed in zzso Gene set enrichment analysis zzso was used to identify a zzso defined sets of genes that were zzso zzso These gene sets were grouped according to either certain signaling pathways zzso zzso or the presence of consensus binding sequences of known zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to validate differential gene zzso 

Both SAM and zzso identified 68 zzso expressed genes (55 BE genes and 13 zzso zzso with an arbitrary zzso ratio zzso or zzso With zzso on matched pairs of zzso and BE zzso from 6 patients, these genes were grouped into 6 zzso category I zzso genes only expressed in zzso category II (5 genes only expressed in zzso category III (8 genes expressed more in BE than in zzso and category IV (2 genes expressed more in zzso than in zzso zzso expression of the remaining genes was not confirmed by zzso either due to false discovery zzso zzso or lack of proper zzso zzso zzso Besides individual zzso the zzso zzso and several zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso as enriched pathways and motifs in zzso Apart from 9 target genes known to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso of 19 additional zzso and zzso target genes in zzso 

Our data suggested an important role of zzso and zzso in the development of zzso The zzso gene list will lead to future studies on the molecular mechanism of zzso
