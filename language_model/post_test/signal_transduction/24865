Most of the activities of zzso are the result of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso tumor zzso acts in concert with zzso to zzso activate zzso of a subset of zzso target genes and mediates growth zzso by this zzso After zzso treatment, induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated by zzso whereas the zzso gene was zzso zzso the differential induction of zzso was impaired in breast cancer cells zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis illustrated that the mechanism of this zzso zzso involves interaction between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso including zzso whose zzso is crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso at zzso bind poorly to zzso reinforcing the importance of zzso in the recruitment of zzso zzso by zzso zzso These findings reveal a novel mechanism for zzso function in the zzso tumor surveillance zzso
