In the early stages of lung development, the zzso zzso extensive and zzso branching zzso During this process, a simple zzso bud develops into a complex zzso system of tubes specialized for the transport and exchange of gas with zzso The zzso cells in the zzso tips of the developing lung express a special set of zzso have a higher proliferation rate than zzso part, undergo shape change and initiate branching zzso In this study, we found that of the four zzso zzso only zzso alpha zzso is localized specifically to the zzso zzso suggesting a role in the regulation of budding zzso Chemical zzso specific for the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso suppress budding of embryonic mouse lung zzso and isolated zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha in cultured lung zzso using zzso also inhibited budding zzso consistent with the chemical zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso alpha did not affect proliferation or expression of the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso However, the amount of zzso protein increased significantly and zzso expression of zzso also impaired budding of zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso interactions and possibly cell zzso during branching zzso This study provides the first evidence that zzso alpha is involved in the zzso of an zzso zzso
