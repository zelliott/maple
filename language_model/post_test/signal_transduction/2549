The very late activated zzso zzso molecules not only mediate T cell zzso but also provide zzso in a zzso zzso However, little is known about the signals zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso Previous work from our laboratory identified a zzso protein that is predominantly zzso on zzso zzso upon engagement of zzso in a human T zzso cell line, zzso and in peripheral T zzso In the present study, we have shown that the A and B zzso of zzso plays a key role in zzso T cell zzso Moreover, we have demonstrated that the solid phase zzso of zzso using zzso (against A and zzso or the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso proteins in addition to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of the C zzso of zzso mainly induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced other protein zzso zzso and additionally induced only minimal T cell zzso Using zzso we have identified some of the zzso proteins to be zzso C gamma zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Since solid phase zzso of zzso by B2 zzso zzso induced T cell zzso most strongly via the zzso pathway, our results suggested that the above zzso proteins may play an important role in zzso T cell zzso signaling zzso
