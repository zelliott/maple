zzso zinc zzso is crucial in regulating the zzso response at any zzso It is tightly regulated by zinc zzso that control influx, zzso and zzso of zinc within the zzso zzso methods for detecting the age-related differences in zzso zinc signaling are poorly zzso We report a novel zzso induced after the in zzso zinc addition in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and in zzso from young and old donors in the zzso of in zzso zinc depletion zzso zzso The zzso zzso zinc variations are monitored over time by flow zzso using zzso AM zzso The best curve fit of the data is calculated using a zzso zzso model defined as zzso zzso zzso depends on the initial free zinc value zzso zzso zzso describes the rate of the speed in reaching the maximum zzso free zinc zzso zzso represents the maximum zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso is the time zzso zzso zzso free zinc variations occur in zzso and zzso incubated in zzso zzso The higher plateau of the curve zzso was observed in younger zzso An zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso influencing zinc influx, is more pronounced in the young than old zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso overproduction was enhanced in old individuals, suggesting the presence of more marked zinc zzso and chronic zzso In conclusion, the determination of zzso zinc signals induced by in zzso zinc addition using zzso parameters may be useful to estimate the rate of zzso zinc zzso and its role in zzso response in zzso
