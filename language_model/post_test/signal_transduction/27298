The molecular mechanism of signal zzso pathways which mediate the action of zzso are poorly zzso Recently, we and others have shown that the as zzso type zzso elements can respond to zzso and salicylic acid, two zzso signaling molecules in zzso In the present work, we have examined a comprehensive set of zzso and zzso agents and found that zzso salicylic acid and zzso are three effective zzso of the zzso elements in transgenic zzso Using a cell suspension culture containing a synthetic zzso fusion, we demonstrated rapid and sensitive induction of the zzso element by these zzso Furthermore, a tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains an zzso binding site in its promoter is also zzso by zzso salicylic acid and zzso with similar zzso As zzso et zzso have recently reported, we found that the zzso elements can also respond to zzso zzso of zzso and salicylic zzso In addition, we show that hydrogen zzso can also effectively activate the expression of zzso as well as the zzso element in a cell suspension culture, but not with whole zzso These results are discussed with respect to the possible zzso through which a single zzso element may respond to a diverse array of zzso
