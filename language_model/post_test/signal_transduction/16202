The zzso zzso zzso provides a paradigm for zzso signaling pathways and controls stem cell function, zzso cell fate decisions, and cellular zzso The zzso zzso is zzso activated in human zzso by zzso zzso zzso point zzso or altered expression zzso zzso the zzso zzso is the subject of zzso intervention in a variety of human zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the zzso dependent zzso zzso of the zzso to liberate the zzso zzso domain that acts to mediate zzso recruitment to the DNA binding zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso prevents zzso production and regulates zzso zzso zzso To interrogate the loss of zzso activity in breast and prostate cancer cells, we used zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso expression was assessed by decreased DNA binding activity and resulted in decreased cell zzso In contrast, zzso inhibitor zzso treatment of these prostate and breast cancer cell lines resulted in minimal growth zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso genes identified expression changes in few genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso with differential effects of zzso on cell survival, zzso treatment failed to zzso the gene expression changes observed after zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may provide a more effective mechanism to inhibit zzso dependent cancer cell proliferation as compared to zzso zzso
