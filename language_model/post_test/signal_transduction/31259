Little is known how age alters the dynamics and function of cell zzso zzso especially under inflammatory and stressful zzso One membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that regulates key zzso and zzso signals associated with zzso zzso If conditions such as age and inflammation change usual zzso action then important downstream effects ultimately zzso zzso cell zzso In this report, zzso accumulates in late passage zzso cells when compared to early passage zzso cells, yet zzso protein expression is attenuated when zzso cells are challenged by zzso zzso zzso age alters zzso dynamic properties from directed to random zzso motion within the zzso Single particle tracking reveals that the average zzso mobility is zzso less in late than early passage cells after its motion is zzso by the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism for altered zzso mobility partly can be explained by a reduced rate of zzso linking with zzso in late passage Human Pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso a zzso for zzso zzso is markedly reduced in zzso zzso These findings support a hypothesis that zzso results in changes of zzso zzso and zzso thus resulting in an zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso further understanding of zzso disturbances of zzso regulation during inflammation can provide important clues as to appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions and prevention of vascular disorders in elderly at the level of the zzso surface zzso
