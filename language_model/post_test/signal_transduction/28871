In zzso smoke exposure is associated with more respiratory illnesses and decreased lung zzso We hypothesized that zzso lung is particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of cigarette smoke zzso and that exposure to zzso during this period may alter expression of immune response genes and adversely affect lung zzso To test this, we exposed zzso mice to 14 days of zzso Immediately after exposure to zzso pulmonary gene expression profiling was performed on zzso zzso lung and zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso At 8 weeks of age, lung volume zzso were determined and mean linear intercept zzso were zzso Pulmonary gene expression profiling revealed that zzso exposure significantly inhibited type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso Neonatal zzso lung also had a significant increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso when compared with adult zzso lung and zzso control zzso Lung volumes at 8 weeks of age were modestly but significantly decreased in mice exposed to zzso in the zzso period compared with zzso controls, consistent with impaired lung zzso The results of this study indicate that exposure to zzso during the zzso period zzso expression of genes involved in innate immunity and mildly zzso zzso lung zzso These findings may in part explain the increased zzso of respiratory symptoms in infants and children exposed to zzso
