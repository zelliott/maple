Human zzso is one of the zzso zzso proteins and has a protective function against zzso zzso To evaluate the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso function of zzso zzso we zzso the effect of zzso E1 on cellular injury by hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cellular survival of human retinal zzso zzso cell line, established from normal retinal zzso zzso cells, following exposure to hydrogen zzso was markedly improved by zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in a zzso manner when retinal zzso zzso cells were zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso E1 1 zzso before the exposure to hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso level was elevated by zzso E1 when the cells were simultaneously exposed to hydrogen zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso could also induce zzso and extend survival of retinal zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso induction and cellular protection by zzso E1 was blocked by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso dependent protein zzso zzso induction was zzso significantly by zzso with zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso dependent signal pathway, while treatment with zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso signal pathway, failed to enhance zzso These findings indicate that zzso E1 has a zzso activity against zzso injury, partly through zzso induction via zzso zzso dependent zzso
