A large number of hormones, zzso and other signaling substances that bind to zzso zzso receptors have their signals zzso at one sole second messenger, zzso The question of how specificity can be maintained in a zzso system in which many zzso signals leading to a vast array of zzso responses are all zzso through one zzso system has been the subject of thorough investigation and a great deal of zzso An increasing number of zzso zzso consisting of zzso or zzso of R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may, at least in part, explain this zzso The various zzso zzso display distinct zzso properties, and the zzso zzso of zzso reveal zzso expression and differential regulation at the level of gene transcription, zzso stability, and protein stability in response to a wide range of hormones and other signaling zzso The existence of a number of zzso proteins specific to either zzso or zzso and which zzso zzso zzso toward distinct zzso at defined zzso zzso strongly supports the idea that specific functions can be assigned to the various zzso zzso The demonstration that selective zzso of zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the observation that zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso of zzso to the zzso is also compatible with the notion of zzso zzso
