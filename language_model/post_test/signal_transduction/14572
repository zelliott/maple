Previous studies have shown that cellular prion protein zzso plays zzso and zzso role against cell death induced by zzso zzso in an immortalized prion protein zzso zzso cell line derived from zzso prion protein zzso zzso zzso mice, which zzso produce excess zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death without zzso an immortalized cell line was established from the brain of zzso zzso mice, which do not show zzso expression of zzso The results using a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso showed that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso expression enhanced the zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso production did not affect zzso and zzso functions of zzso suggesting that zzso may be directly correlated with protection against zzso zzso
