zzso family proteins are essential for transforming growth factor beta zzso signal mediation downstream of a zzso complex of the type I and type II zzso zzso zzso A distant family member, zzso is expressed in most zzso zzso and cells and prevents zzso zzso In this study, we examined the zzso role of zzso in zzso the effects of zzso a member of the zzso zzso of peptides that functions in a number of zzso including zzso zzso We report here that zzso expression is specifically absent in particular zzso cells that respond to zzso by zzso into the zzso lineage and that zzso production of zzso causes mouse zzso leukemia zzso cells to become resistant to zzso induction of zzso zzso When zzso with type I zzso zzso zzso or zzso in concert with type II zzso zzso zzso efficiently reduced an early zzso response zzso by zzso but had only a minimal effect on the response zzso by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso of an activated form of zzso but not of an activated form of zzso induced zzso cells to zzso These results suggest that zzso selectively interferes with the zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso The findings also indicate the existence of a novel activity of zzso that zzso zzso differentiation by blocking zzso signaling of zzso
