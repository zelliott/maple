zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso may help control cell proliferation and outgrowth within the nervous system, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly zzso In the embryonic enteric nervous system zzso of the zzso zzso zzso migratory zzso forming the enteric zzso zzso zzso express a single zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas adjacent zzso cells that are zzso to migration express the zzso zzso zzso zzso down zzso zzso expression in cultured zzso with zzso zzso zzso allowed the zzso cells to cross the zzso zzso consistent with the model that reverse signaling via zzso mediates a repulsive response in the zzso zzso family zzso have been implicated in reverse signaling by zzso zzso in other zzso and zzso zzso with activated forms of zzso zzso in the leading processes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the developing zzso induced zzso zzso zzso similar to the effect of blocking zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso reverse signaling with zzso fusion proteins induced the rapid zzso of zzso zzso specifically within the zzso cells, as zzso by Western blots of single embryonic gut zzso and by zzso zzso of cultured zzso In longer cultures, treatment with zzso caused a global zzso of zzso cell migration and zzso an effect that was prevented by zzso zzso zzso These results support the model that zzso reverse signaling zzso the zzso zzso of zzso cell processes away from the enteric zzso thereby helping to zzso the zzso to their appropriate zzso
