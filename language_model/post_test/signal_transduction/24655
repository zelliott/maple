The input zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has not yet been zzso To test the hypothesis that an zzso zzso signaling system might be involved in zzso signal zzso phase zzso by light was zzso in the zzso zzso strain under conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that cultures maintained on low zzso zzso zzso were several orders of magnitude more sensitive to light than those maintained on high zzso zzso zzso This difference in light sensitivity was a property of zzso zzso and was not seen in the wild type or in an zzso zzso zzso Phase zzso by temperature was not affected by zzso zzso indicating that the effect on light zzso is specific to the light input zzso and is not the result of a change in the zzso of the zzso zzso The results indicate an indirect role for zzso zzso in the light input zzso that is not likely to involve direct participation of an zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
