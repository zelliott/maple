At the cellular level, free zzso are tightly controlled by an zzso zzso program, since at low zzso amounts they contribute to zzso zzso and zzso However, high levels of zzso stress promote the zzso of damaged zzso the impairment of cell zzso pathways and the increase of zzso zzso As the zzso and zzso levels of zzso stress increase during zzso or in various diseases, so does the amount of damaged zzso since the repair mechanisms are also targets of zzso damage and thus become gradually ineffective over zzso Depending on the severity of the zzso damage, the responses of normal human cells to zzso may range from transient growth arrest to premature zzso and even to cell zzso Although some responses are clearly zzso suppressing zzso others may be potentially zzso as they combine damage zzso with a retained ability for proliferation zzso growth zzso or with inflammation zzso zzso This array of events significantly increases the likelihood of the appearance of zzso cells, which may then give rise to zzso focal zzso and eventually to zzso In the present zzso we will focus on the role of free zzso zzso damage and inflammation in zzso
