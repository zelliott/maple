The use of gene expression zzso in the evaluation and zzso of tumors is becoming increasingly important in a number of zzso This is a powerful technique able to disclose zzso zzso in gene zzso Such variation in gene expression may be the cause of different disease outcome and may reflect disease zzso or zzso Acute zzso leukemia is a zzso disease of the bone zzso where overall long-term zzso survival is less than zzso The need for better disease zzso and evaluation is consequently zzso Gene expression profiling in acute zzso leukemia has, in recent years, proven able to distinguish acute zzso leukemia zzso and predict clinical outcome and is, as such, a promising technique for improved disease zzso The early detection of gene expression in response to chemotherapy may be a novel way of monitoring disease zzso The immediate gene response may be an indication of whether the drug of choice is efficient in zzso cell zzso and may early indicate the need for other therapeutic zzso Furthermore, these early zzso in gene expression could facilitate identification of new treatment targets, thereby enabling better patient care and follow-up in the zzso
