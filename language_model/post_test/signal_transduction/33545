zzso II zzso zzso acting via zzso type 1 receptors in the brain, activates the sympathetic nervous system in heart failure zzso We reported recently that zzso II stimulates zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso brain zzso type 1 receptors in zzso zzso In this study we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways contribute to sympathetic zzso in zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso 2 selective zzso zzso zzso induced significant decreases in mean zzso pressure, heart rate, and zzso sympathetic nerve activity in zzso rats, but had no effect on these variables in zzso zzso zzso with zzso attenuated the effects of zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on mean zzso pressure, heart rate, or zzso sympathetic nerve activity in zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso induced a small decrease in mean zzso pressure and heart rate but no change in zzso sympathetic nerve zzso zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso zzso activity in zzso of the zzso nucleus of the zzso of zzso rats, zzso with zzso activity zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso activity in the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso acute studies, zzso zzso II increased mean zzso pressure, heart rate, and zzso sympathetic nerve activity in zzso rats and zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso of zzso intact zzso Central administration of zzso markedly reduced these zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso and zzso sympathetic nerve activity in rats with zzso
