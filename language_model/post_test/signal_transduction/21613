In zzso and zzso zzso defined zzso gene expression is an early and essential event in zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the mechanisms involved in establishing zzso gene expression in the zzso of a group of small zzso zzso zzso which on the legs of the zzso adult are arranged in a series of zzso rows along the leg zzso In zzso legs, the zzso gene zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso which comprise the leg zzso zzso We have previously shown that periodic zzso expression is partially established by the zzso zzso hairy, which zzso zzso expression in four of eight zzso zzso Here, we identify Delta zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso as a second leg zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso function zzso and zzso to define periodic zzso zzso We also explore the regulation of periodic zzso zzso In prior studies, we have found that expression of two zzso stripes along the zzso axis is induced in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that expression of two other zzso stripes along the zzso zzso axis is established through a distinct mechanism which involves uniform zzso combined with repressive influences from zzso and zzso Our findings allow us to formulate a general model for generation of periodic pattern in the adult zzso This process involves broad and late zzso of zzso expression combined with refinement in response to a zzso of repression, established by zzso and zzso which unfolds progressively during zzso and early zzso zzso
