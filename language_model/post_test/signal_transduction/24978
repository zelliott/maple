zzso zzso which has intrinsic protein zzso zzso activity, has been found in human solid tumors such as zzso and breast zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the inner surface of the membrane after zzso zzso and is implicated in zzso of signals to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso modification process called zzso To investigate whether, through zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of gallbladder zzso the authors investigated expression of zzso and zzso in in zzso and invasive zzso 

One hundred cases of documented gallbladder zzso were zzso and 30 cases were selected randomly to evaluate expression of zzso and zzso by zzso in both in zzso and in invasive tumor zzso 

zzso cases zzso of gallbladder zzso showed moderate to strong zzso zzso for zzso with increased intensity in the invasive zzso and 12 cases zzso were zzso The in zzso component revealed mild to moderate zzso zzso in 20 cases zzso whereas the normal gallbladder zzso showed weak to negative zzso zzso zzso to strong zzso zzso was observed in 17 in zzso cases zzso and 24 invasive cases zzso The in zzso zzso patterns of zzso were unrelated to the clinical outcome of the zzso However, moderate to strong zzso of the invasive component as observed in 15 cases zzso was associated with a mean survival of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in normal gallbladder zzso and invasive zzso were similar in intensity, suggesting the absence of zzso gene amplification in these zzso 

The increased expression of zzso in these tumors could be due to zzso zzso zzso with increased expression of zzso and zzso were associated with poor clinical outcomes as evidenced by their mean survival zzso zzso is likely to play a zzso role in gallbladder zzso
