zzso of the zzso factor zzso in mice leads to acute zzso characterized by a differentiation block at the zzso zzso In this study, we made use of a new cellular system allowing us to reach graded expression of zzso in zzso cells to dissect mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso This system is based on conditional production of 1 or 2 zzso zzso zzso inserted into zzso transgenic zzso We show that zzso zzso was sufficient to reinstate the zzso differentiation zzso This differentiation process was associated with an exit from the cell zzso Evidence is provided that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso displays an zzso role that is independent of its function in blocking zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso did not involve zzso of the zzso signaling zzso nor a failure to activate zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that reducing the zzso level yields to zzso zzso and increased zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may affect major signaling pathways downstream of the zzso in zzso zzso These findings reveal 2 distinct roles for zzso during zzso zzso blocks the zzso differentiation program and acts to impair zzso death in cooperation with an zzso zzso
