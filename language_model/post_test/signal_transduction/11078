zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of cell size and zzso It is regulated via zzso zzso zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso We demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso associates specifically with zzso The association was observed between native and zzso zzso proteins in zzso as well as by zzso analysis in zzso The sites of interaction were mapped to the zzso regions of both zzso zzso and zzso In zzso studies indicated that the interaction does not affect their zzso activities and that zzso zzso is not a zzso for zzso zzso This study zzso a potential link between zzso signaling zzso and energy metabolism through zzso and its zzso zzso but its zzso relevance should be further zzso
