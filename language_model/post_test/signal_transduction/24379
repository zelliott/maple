Using dual cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso separated by a physical barrier, we demonstrate that zzso from zzso spores produce a zzso factor that is perceived by roots in the absence of direct physical zzso This AM factor elicits expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso induction occurs primarily in the root cortex, with expression stretching from the zone of root hair emergence to the region of mature root zzso All AM zzso tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso margarita, and zzso zzso elicit a similar response, whereas zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso do not, suggesting that the observed root response is specific to AM zzso Finally, zzso induction in response to the zzso AM zzso factor is also observed with all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the same zzso are blocked in their response to zzso zzso This positive response of the zzso zzso to the zzso AM zzso factor and the different cellular zzso of zzso expression in response to zzso factor versus AM factor suggest that signal zzso occurs via different pathways and that expression of zzso is differently regulated by the two zzso zzso
