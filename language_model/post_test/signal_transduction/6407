zzso targeting directly couples synthesis of proteins to their zzso across or zzso into zzso The signal recognition particle zzso and its zzso zzso facilitate the targeting of the translation machinery, the zzso via recognition of a signal sequence in the nascent zzso zzso By combining structures of free and zzso zzso we derive a structural model describing the dynamic nature of zzso when it meets the zzso
