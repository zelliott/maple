A human zzso line, designated zzso has been established from peripheral zzso zzso expresses a number of zzso markers as well as a broad array of zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso expresses high levels of human zzso zzso zzso class I and class zzso In response to zzso of zzso class II zzso but not in response to zzso of zzso class 1, zzso forms tighter zzso zzso and develops a striking zzso culture zzso zzso also expresses zzso receptors for zzso G zzso zzso zzso and zzso and can be shown to zzso polystyrene latex zzso as well as zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line should therefore prove useful for studying both zzso through zzso zzso class II and zzso
