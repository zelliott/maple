zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso complex, a zzso zzso zzso Recently a role for protein zzso C zzso in the induction response has been reported in which zzso or a related zzso positively zzso zzso zzso We have examined the role of zzso by determining the effect of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one specific zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Although no zzso activity was zzso in zzso under the conditions used for our zzso zzso transformation and DNA binding still zzso zzso of relatively high zzso of the zzso zzso also had no significant effect on zzso complex zzso Thus, our results indicate that protein zzso activity does not appear to be necessary for zzso zzso transformation and DNA binding and they imply that protein zzso must play a role in another zzso in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso
