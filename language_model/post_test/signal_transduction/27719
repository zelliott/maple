The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates growth and differentiation of many cell types and zzso production of zzso proteins in zzso Here we report that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso induced by transforming growth zzso zzso a well known zzso zzso in liver zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso while showing no effect on the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso interferes with only a subset of zzso zzso To further zzso the mechanism of this zzso effect of zzso we investigated which signaling zzso zzso by zzso is responsible for this zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells induced a rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso activity followed by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso abolished the protection of zzso against zzso zzso A zzso zzso also zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso however, only zzso attenuated the zzso zzso Finally, zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso by treating cells zzso the zzso zzso with zzso completely blocked zzso survival zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso pathways mediates the zzso effect of zzso against zzso with the former likely playing a major role in this zzso
