Recently, zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso have been reported to increase zzso zzso but the signaling mechanisms involved are zzso Using zzso a zzso zzso known as an zzso compound, we investigated the molecular mechanism of its effect on NO production in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso NO production in a zzso and zzso manner with no zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso increase ( approximately zzso was achieved with 20 zzso zzso treatment for 12 zzso and this increase was accompanied by increases in the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Analysis with zzso specific for each zzso site demonstrated that zzso (20 zzso treatment for 12 zzso significantly increased both the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso but did not alter zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso to zzso the increased zzso induced by zzso partially inhibited zzso NO zzso This was accompanied by the zzso of zzso increases in the zzso of zzso and zzso with no zzso in zzso zzso We also found that zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso NO production with a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso but with no zzso in zzso zzso induced by zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that prolonged treatment with zzso increases zzso NO production by at least two independent signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
