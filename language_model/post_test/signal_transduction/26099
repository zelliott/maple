The multiple zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso make it a promising therapeutic zzso This study investigated whether the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso were used to study the effect of zzso on zzso zzso A signal zzso zzso involving zzso oxygen species zzso was also zzso We found that zzso can zzso zzso gene and protein expressions in zzso zzso and zzso This effect was not diminished by zzso zzso or zzso while it was additive to zzso zzso zzso suggesting an event independent of zzso activity or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as increased zzso zzso All these events contributed to the increase in the expression of zzso caused by zzso In this study, we also, for the first time, demonstrated that zzso protein zzso zzso can mediate zzso expression via the downstream zzso of zzso and zzso However, the zzso actions of zzso and zzso were not associated with zzso This study demonstrates a zzso action of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso This action is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into the action mechanism of zzso with broad implications for zzso zzso
