zzso systemic hypertension causes cardiac pressure overload leading to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso is a master regulator of zzso zzso Mouse zzso lacking expression of the zzso zzso zzso die at zzso with severe cardiac zzso and vascular zzso Here we report that zzso conditional knockout mice, which lack zzso expression only in zzso lineage cells, develop zzso but when subjected to pressure overload induced by zzso zzso zzso they manifest rapid cardiac zzso which is accompanied by excess cardiac zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso density, increased zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso signaling through both zzso and zzso pathways that activate zzso and zzso respectively, within zzso cells of cardiac blood zzso zzso also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso through enhanced zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso signaling prevented zzso zzso dysfunction and pathological zzso Thus, zzso plays a critical protective role in the adaptation of the heart and zzso to pressure overload by zzso regulating zzso signaling in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso which zzso zzso zzso resulted in rapid cardiac failure after zzso Although zzso has been used for decades as an zzso agent to treat heart failure, it does not improve survival, suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso observed in the zzso mouse model may have clinical zzso
