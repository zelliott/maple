The molecular mechanisms that drive the development of embryonic zzso are being uncovered zzso One such fascinating example is the development of the zzso the most anterior part of the nervous zzso In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms that induce the formation of the zzso in multiple zzso systems, placing emphasis on a recent article published by zzso et zzso zzso Using zzso as a model system, these authors combine elegant zzso zzso with the use of early markers of the zzso zzso to show that initial induction and patterning of this tissue occurs near the onset of zzso In addition, their results confirm observations made in other systems that zzso signals, those traveling in the plane of the zzso are involved in zzso induction and zzso
