zzso stem cell zzso regulation is highly dependent on interactions with the zzso zzso of which zzso cells play a crucial zzso While evidence is accumulating for an important role of intrinsic zzso in regulating zzso and zzso whether zzso signaling pathways are also necessary in the zzso control of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso 

Using the immortalized clone with the characteristics of zzso zzso in zzso expansion, long-term culture initiating cell zzso and non-obese zzso combined zzso disease zzso mice zzso cell zzso zzso revealed that the zzso expression of zzso partly promoted the ability of zzso to support human zzso blood zzso zzso cell expansion and maintain their zzso It also seemed that zzso zzso was prone to cause a specific expansion of the zzso zzso zzso deficient expression of zzso partly inhibited the zzso supporting ability of zzso We further identified that zzso is responsible for, at least in part, the promoted zzso supporting ability of zzso caused by zzso zzso expression is markedly enhanced in zzso zzso zzso upon interaction with CB zzso cells compared to other niche associated zzso More interestingly, the specific zzso lineage expansion of CB zzso cells caused by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso knock zzso 

Our data demonstrated that CB zzso cell expansion can be partly promoted by zzso zzso and in particular, zzso zzso can cause a specific expansion of the zzso lineage through zzso zzso in zzso
