zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 2) represents a unique family of protein zzso in regulating signaling zzso in zzso Although the regulatory mechanisms of zzso have been well demonstrated in zzso zzso their functions in zzso are still zzso In our study, we cloned an zzso gene from zzso zzso which zzso a putative zzso of the rice zzso zzso zzso had two copies in the zzso zzso and zzso eight zzso in its coding zzso We demonstrated that zzso expressed zzso in various zzso of zzso plants and was zzso by zzso and drought zzso A green fluorescent protein zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in the cell zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso preferred zzso to zzso as zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso loop was important for its zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso could significantly strengthen tolerance to salt zzso Under salt treatment, zzso transgenic plants exhibited higher zzso rate and zzso content, low zzso leakage and higher survival rate than wild zzso Further analysis indicated that transgenic plants showed increased zzso of the stress-related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso was involved in diverse stress signal zzso Moreover, no obvious adverse effects on growth and development in the zzso transgenic plants implied that zzso was potentially useful in transgenic breeding to improve salt tolerance in zzso
