We and others have reported that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso effectively zzso the growth of multiple cancer cell zzso Our previous studies indicated that prolonged zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in acute zzso leukemia zzso Whether treatment with zzso has an earlier effect on other proteins that are important for either signal zzso or zzso is zzso zzso activated signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is frequently found in human breast cancer zzso zzso activated zzso was shown to zzso zzso in several types of cancer and has a feedback effect on zzso and zzso To examine the effects of zzso on zzso signaling in breast cancer, we used the zzso zzso breast tumor model, which is largely resistant to zzso In zzso after treatment of zzso cells with 500 zzso zzso for 2 zzso we found zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso of cells in zzso cell cycle phase, zzso zzso of invasive growth of zzso cells, and zzso lack of zzso zzso In in zzso studies, zzso completely eliminated zzso breast cancer growth and lung zzso induced by zzso cells in mice when treatment started 1 day after tumor zzso and significantly inhibited tumor growth when started after 5 zzso In zzso studies also indicated that zzso mature zzso cells were restored after zzso zzso In zzso these data suggest that zzso may have therapeutic potential in breast cancer therapy, in part, through zzso of zzso
