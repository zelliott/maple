The zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling contributes to several human zzso including many zzso We have generated zzso zzso zzso that inhibit zzso signaling without interfering with collagen zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso region bound to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso zzso domain is tightly associated with the following zzso domain, which contains the zzso of all zzso A zzso surface patch in the zzso domain outside the zzso site is shown to be required for zzso Thus, the active zzso of the zzso zzso involves zzso contacts between the zzso zzso in addition to the previously identified association of zzso zzso The zzso likely inhibit signaling by zzso blocking the zzso association of zzso zzso
