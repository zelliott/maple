zzso are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize zzso molecular zzso from a wide variety of zzso Following recognition of zzso zzso recruit signaling adapters to initiate a zzso signaling cascade culminating in the zzso of several zzso factor zzso Additionally, zzso signals lead to zzso of zzso affecting many aspects of the cellular response, including cell survival, proliferation and regulation of the zzso zzso The recent discovery of zzso as a zzso signaling zzso crucial for linking zzso to zzso zzso allows new questions of the importance of zzso zzso downstream of zzso Here, we zzso the current understanding of signaling pathways activated by zzso and provide our perspective on zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its impact on regulating cellular zzso
