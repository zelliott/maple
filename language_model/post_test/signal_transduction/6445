The initial steps of primitive zzso and zzso vascular formation in the human zzso remain to be zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel marker, namely the zzso zzso class I zzso which targets both primitive zzso cells of the zzso zzso and zzso cells from developing zzso Moreover, zzso was present in its soluble form in the zzso lineage in all zzso sustaining primitive to definitive zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and bone zzso The alternatively spliced transcript coding the soluble zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso stage to the zzso but was lost in mature zzso and in zzso cells from differentiated zzso This study constitutes the first description of an zzso class I zzso expression on the primitive zzso lineage and provides a way of seeking both primitive and definitive zzso using zzso This new marker, previously known by its zzso properties, may be involved in zzso zzso zzso or zzso
