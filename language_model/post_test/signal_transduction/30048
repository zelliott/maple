We investigated the signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cells, a cell line known to zzso express zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso specifically acts on a zzso zzso to zzso increase (three to zzso over zzso zzso through a zzso zzso In fact, while zzso zzso zzso increase was only partially sensitive to zzso toxin zzso Ras zzso was almost completely inhibited by the same zzso Furthermore, the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso completely inhibited both zzso and zzso increase, suggesting that in these cells zzso is the point of convergence for both zzso insensitive and sensitive pathways leading to zzso release and Ras zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso prevented zzso Ras zzso indicating that this zzso plays an essential role for zzso downstream signaling in differentiated zzso zzso zzso In addition, while zzso did not appear to be substantially involved in zzso zzso zzso was able to partially inhibit zzso zzso transient ( approximately zzso and almost completely prevented Ras zzso zzso suggesting a potential role for other zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso stimulation was followed by a specific zzso regulated zzso zzso 1/2 zzso an event with a pharmacological profile similar to that of Ras zzso partially ( approximately zzso sensitive to zzso zzso lethal toxin and totally blocked by zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells leads to Ras zzso and zzso zzso mostly through a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
