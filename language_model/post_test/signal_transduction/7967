The zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has gained much attention due to its specific zzso potential without toxic side zzso TRAIL binds to a complex zzso zzso In humans there are two zzso receptors for TRAIL while only one is present in zzso The signaling induced by these receptors leads to zzso but might also result in zzso of survival zzso To assess the safety and possible side effects of zzso cancer therapy it is necessary to understand the zzso role of the zzso zzso This has been addressed in mice deficient either for TRAIL or for its only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this review we will discuss their zzso and the results of recent studies on the role of TRAIL in the zzso of the immune system, the influence of the zzso system on infection and zzso diseases and the still controversial role of TRAIL in zzso Clinical trials with TRAIL and other TRAIL zzso zzso are now under zzso It will be exciting to determine which zzso zzso either alone or in combination with other zzso zzso will result in better outcome of cancer treatment in the zzso
