Bone zzso stem cells zzso have been shown to improve neurological function recovery in cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a more stable zzso form of zzso which is a crucial zzso zzso To investigate the protective effects of zzso zzso on zzso survival in cerebral zzso models, we zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells zzso zzso and observed a significant increase in the release of vascular zzso growth factor zzso from zzso the decreased zzso cell zzso and the zzso of zzso expression reduced by zzso in zzso cells compared to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso In addition, to explore whether zzso zzso by zzso zzso plays an important role in preventing zzso zzso and the possible mechanism involved, zzso zzso were applied and the similar protective effects on zzso cells were observed in zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the administration of zzso reversed these zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso ability on zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso zzso the active form of zzso presented further repression on zzso promoter, indicating that zzso directly binds on zzso promoter as a zzso zzso and that zzso status of zzso affects its zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso after cerebral zzso in zzso sufficiently reduced zzso zzso decreased cerebral zzso volume, and induced a significant improvement on the modified neurological severity score compared to the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso showed an obvious protective effect on zzso cells or zzso after zzso in zzso and in zzso at least in part, through the zzso zzso
