zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and subsequent inflammation are important pathological processes involved in the formation of zzso portal zzso This study characterizes the zzso mechanisms leading to zzso liver zzso and portal hypertension, and focuses on zzso target of zzso zzso zzso as a potential zzso in the early phase of zzso portal zzso 

Early zzso portal hypertension was induced by zzso duct zzso zzso for three zzso One week after operation, zzso zzso and zzso rats received zzso (2 zzso by zzso injection for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats served as zzso zzso zzso and portal pressure were evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso Expressions of zzso and zzso genes in liver were measured by zzso alpha smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso expressions of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso were assessed by western zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso was markedly activated in the early phase of zzso portal hypertension induced by zzso in zzso zzso blockade by zzso profoundly improved liver function by limiting zzso zzso and portal zzso zzso significantly inhibited the expressions of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso zzso relative to their total proteins in zzso zzso Those results suggested that zzso Complex 1 zzso rather than zzso was inhibited by zzso Interestingly, we also found that the level of zzso to zzso was significantly increased in zzso rats, which was little affected by zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso played an important role in the early phase of zzso portal hypertension in rats, which could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the early phase of such zzso zzso
