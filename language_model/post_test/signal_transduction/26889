Increased levels of plasma cholesterol are a common feature of patient of type 2 zzso However, the links between elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso and dysfunction of zzso are still zzso 

The zzso were fed with a zzso zzso diet for 8 zzso Blood samples were collected from the mice for measurement of plasma zzso zzso The zzso were embedded in zzso compound and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for further zzso To examine the effects of LDL on zzso function, insulin content, cell zzso and zzso production were measured in pancreatic zzso of zzso and mouse pancreatic zzso line zzso Relative cell signal pathways were determined by Western zzso 

zzso insulin content and increased zzso and zzso production were found in pancreatic zzso of zzso accompanied by elevated plasma zzso The zzso levels were significantly enhanced in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso insulin synthesis and zzso insulin zzso and elevated zzso were reversed by suppression of zzso zzso Moreover, LDL induced dysfunction and zzso of pancreatic zzso cells through zzso and zzso zzso which were rescued by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may play a key role in zzso dysfunction and zzso of pancreatic zzso through zzso and zzso zzso
