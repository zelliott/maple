Previous studies have demonstrated a protective effect of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso against zzso and zzso two disorders characterized by abundant proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and zzso zzso These therapeutic effects might result from zzso suppression of both cell proliferation and zzso However, the interplay between cell growth and locomotion remains zzso We show here that zzso zzso cellular changes that normally occur during cell locomotion zzso zzso formation and reorganization of zzso filaments and focal zzso zzso a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso activity failed to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell and zzso proliferation and zzso Moreover, a zzso active zzso of the zzso protein zzso insensitive to zzso zzso inhibited both cell proliferation and zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso by forced expression of the zzso zzso zzso correlated with high zzso and migratory zzso zzso these results suggest that cellular proliferation and migration are regulated in a coordinated manner by the zzso zzso These findings might have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the zzso component of vascular zzso zzso
