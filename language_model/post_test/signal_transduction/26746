During zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is necessary to promote migration of zzso cells into the zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso that has numerous cell functions, including regulation of zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso a downstream zzso factor of zzso plays crucial roles in wound healing in the zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso driven by the zzso 14 promoter zzso were confirmed to have significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso wounds were made in the zzso zzso and wound healing was assessed zzso for 7 zzso zzso was significantly retarded on day 2, while collagen deposition was enhanced on day 7 in zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso 16 zzso an indicator of zzso migration, was significantly inhibited in zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso coincided with the induction of zzso in the corresponding zzso while zzso incorporation was zzso These results indicated that zzso has zzso effects in regulating zzso migration during zzso wound zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso expression must be tightly regulated during zzso zzso
