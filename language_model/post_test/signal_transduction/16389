It has recently become clear that the zzso of zzso in zzso cells can have deleterious effects that go far beyond a simple shortage of zzso In this work we find that cells deficient in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso produce zzso lacking zzso that are exported to the zzso and that can be incorporated into zzso The presence of such defective zzso leads to slow growth and appears to render the cells hypersensitive to zzso in the zzso zzso Several genes that were reasonable candidates for degradation of zzso zzso lacking zzso fail to do so, suggesting that key players in the surveillance of zzso zzso remain to be zzso Interestingly, in spite of rendering the cells hypersensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso shortage of zzso partially suppresses the zzso temporary repression of zzso synthesis caused by zzso
