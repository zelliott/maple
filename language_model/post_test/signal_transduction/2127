The discovery of specific zzso of a gatekeeper zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso led to a hypothesis that the human zzso of patched zzso normally functions as a negative regulator of the signaling zzso that is initiated by zzso zzso and activated by the human zzso of zzso zzso however, no evidence for the involvement of zzso and zzso has been zzso Here, we show novel evidence that zzso is also zzso zzso in zzso together with zzso zzso zzso zzso and that Sonic zzso was expressed in only some zzso Our data, therefore, indicate that such zzso of zzso may be associated with zzso or zzso of zzso and that this zzso subsequently stimulates the zzso signaling zzso In an investigation of a possible regulation of zzso and zzso we demonstrated that expression of zzso zzso in immortalized zzso zzso both zzso and zzso and that the zzso is accompanied by growth arrest, which suggests the involvement of zzso in regulation of the zzso signaling zzso
