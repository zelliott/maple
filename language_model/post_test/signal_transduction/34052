The expression of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso in zzso zzso This regulation involves several zzso including one that is similar to zzso in zzso zzso We have identified missing key components of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso by comparison to the same zzso of zzso zzso We characterized a new zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso identical to the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso and is able to complement an zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso we identified a single zzso zzso (for similar to zzso and zzso that encodes a protein showing an average of 50% identity with zzso and zzso regulators of the zzso zzso The suppression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso together with the restoration of zzso zzso in the double zzso demonstrates that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso expression and is acting downstream of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso We report that zzso regulates zzso zzso activity by preventing its zzso in the absence of zzso and that zzso is regulated by zzso both at the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso interactions of zzso with the zzso sensor and zzso zzso suggest that zzso mediates the zzso signal from the plasma membrane to the zzso All of these data demonstrated that zzso was the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso were unable to complement a zzso zzso
