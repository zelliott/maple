We find that calcium influx through zzso calcium channels causes extensive zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso The calcium signal zzso zzso promoting zzso outgrowth causes the rapid zzso of protein zzso zzso which include zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the formation of an zzso complex, leading to Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent induction of the immediate early gene zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso outgrowth are inhibited by the expression of dominant negative forms of both zzso and zzso indicating a requirement for both zzso in calcium zzso Our results suggest that a signaling cassette which includes zzso and Ras is likely to zzso a broad range of calcium of actions in the nervous zzso
