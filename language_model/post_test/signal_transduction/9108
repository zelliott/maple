zzso zzso zzso basket cells are thought to play key roles in network functions related to precise time keeping during zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso Although they express relatively few receptors for zzso the highly abundant and functionally important zzso zzso zzso is able to selectively zzso zzso basket cells, making these cells sensitive zzso for zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso selective and powerful zzso of zzso basket cells are not zzso We used single and paired zzso recordings in acute rat zzso zzso in combination with post hoc identification of the recorded zzso to demonstrate that zzso acts via zzso zzso receptors to engage sharply divergent zzso pathways to exert its zzso zzso In contrast to zzso receptors on zzso cells that signal through the zzso zzso zzso to trigger zzso signaling events, zzso receptors on neighboring zzso basket cells couple to an unusual, zzso zzso The latter zzso involves zzso receptors on zzso calcium stores that ultimately activate a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso basket zzso zzso has highly zzso effects even within the zzso cell population, as the zzso zzso zzso cells do not respond to zzso Together, these results demonstrate that an abundant zzso such as zzso can signal through the same zzso in different zzso to use zzso signaling pathways to provide divergence and specificity to its zzso
