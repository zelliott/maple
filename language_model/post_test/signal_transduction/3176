Although much recent work has zzso the zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of memory by zzso little is known about the signaling events through which zzso zzso regulates zzso We recently demonstrated that immediate zzso infusion of P into the zzso zzso enhances object recognition memory consolidation in young zzso female mice zzso et zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to identify the zzso zzso that might zzso this zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso enhancement of object recognition would be dependent on zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso In young zzso mice, we found that bilateral zzso zzso infusion of P significantly increased levels of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 5 zzso after zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso 15 zzso after infusion and returned to baseline 30 zzso after infusion, suggesting a zzso effect of P on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were necessary for P to facilitate memory consolidation, as suggested by the fact that zzso of both pathways infused into the zzso zzso immediately after training blocked the zzso enhancement of object zzso zzso these data provide the first demonstration that the ability of P to enhance memory consolidation depends on the rapid zzso of cell signaling and protein synthesis pathways in the zzso zzso
