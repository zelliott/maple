In zzso zzso the zzso zzso controls the timing of zzso events during the zzso zzso A component of this pathway, the zzso small regulatory zzso is expressed at the late stages of development and promotes the transition from zzso to adult zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso which is crucial for the proper timing of the zzso zzso transition, is zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso In zzso zzso of the steroid hormone zzso zzso control the timing of the transition from zzso to zzso to adult zzso To test whether zzso expression is regulated by zzso in zzso we used Northern zzso analysis to examine the effect of altered zzso levels on zzso expression in zzso animals, organ cultures, and zzso cultured zzso zzso were conducted to test the role of zzso zzso an essential component in the zzso pathway, in zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso regulates the zzso expression of zzso in zzso These results demonstrate an interaction between steroid hormone signaling and the zzso zzso in zzso
