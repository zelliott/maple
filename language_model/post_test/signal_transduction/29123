zzso zzso is a common pathological change accompanying cardiovascular zzso Recently, some evidence indicated that zzso zzso zzso expressed in the cardiovascular zzso However, the functional involvement of zzso in cardiac zzso remains zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso to increase the release of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso played a vital role in the development of cardiac zzso zzso we investigated the expression of zzso in cardiac zzso by zzso II zzso and the effects of zzso activated by zzso on the related signaling zzso zzso The results showed that zzso induced cardiac zzso and zzso the expression of zzso meanwhile increased the zzso calcium concentration zzso and activated zzso zzso signaling zzso Compared with zzso alone, the above changes were further obvious when adding zzso But the effects of zzso on the cardiac zzso were attenuated by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso is involved in cardiac zzso by zzso through zzso zzso in cultured zzso rat zzso
