Ras genes are commonly zzso in human zzso of the skin and other zzso zzso Ras signals through multiple zzso zzso including the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Ral zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso Ras zzso zzso and zzso zzso features characteristic of zzso cell zzso The downstream zzso pathways required for zzso Ras effects in zzso however, are zzso In this study, we investigated the direct contribution of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Ras zzso The response of zzso zzso to zzso active zzso Ras was zzso by deletion of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, Ras effects were entirely abolished by combined deletion of all zzso zzso whereas zzso retaining only one zzso of either zzso or zzso showed intermediate zzso Thus, the effects of zzso Ras on proliferation and differentiation in skin show a gene zzso requirement for the zzso zzso cascade at the level of zzso zzso
