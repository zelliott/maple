zzso zzso 4 zzso has been shown to play a role in cell signaling that results in zzso inflammation in response to zzso and respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso also interacts with zzso which upon complex formation triggers zzso signaling pathways to produce a zzso zzso This mechanism results in the zzso of zzso B and subsequent inflammatory gene zzso In order to determine the effect of combustion source particle matter zzso rich in zinc and zzso but with negligible zzso on a possible zzso of zzso cell signaling and zzso we zzso zzso instilled zzso zzso of PM into zzso healthy male zzso zzso zzso and susceptible spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso protein and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso B zzso in the lung were determined after 24 zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso were obtained as a marker of lung cell injury in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso were significantly increased in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats showed a greater zzso increase than zzso zzso Similarly, zzso protein and zzso levels were also increased following PM exposure but to a significantly greater extent in zzso zzso Plasma zzso was increased only in zzso rats exposed to zzso The increased inflammation seen in zzso zzso rats was accompanied by a significant increase in zzso protein in the lung zzso which was primarily localized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also increased by PM exposure in both zzso and zzso rats but was significantly greater in the zzso zzso These increases were associated with greater zzso of zzso B in the lungs of zzso rather than zzso zzso This was accompanied by increased zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression at 24 h of zzso These data suggest that the increased inflammation in the lungs of zzso zzso rats compared to zzso rats is accompanied by an increase in zzso cell zzso Thus, one of the mechanisms for greater zzso of zzso rats to PM exposure may involve an increased zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
