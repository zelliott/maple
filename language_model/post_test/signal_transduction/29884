zzso regulates zzso zzso through controlling zzso and zzso zzso production via the zzso zzso zzso The minimal promoter sufficient to drive zzso zzso reporter gene activity was mapped to zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site of the human zzso zzso zzso I zzso with nuclear extracts of zzso cell lines unveiled protection of zzso zzso to zzso zzso mobility shift zzso identified a single dominant zzso complex that was abolished by consensus sequence for zzso factor zzso or zzso of the zzso motif within the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso recognition zzso partially overlapping the zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity in zzso cells, without significant impact on zzso cells, which do not express zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was supported by zzso analysis of zzso cells where zzso may act as cell zzso zzso of zzso promoter zzso However, zzso of full-length zzso zzso or zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso or abolished zzso promoter activity, respectively, in zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso from the zzso core zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression correlated in 21 different human zzso and were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirm that zzso associates with the zzso promoter in zzso Thus, zzso plays a key role in zzso and zzso expression of zzso and regulation of the zzso network controlling cell survival and zzso
