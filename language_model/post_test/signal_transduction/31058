The zzso lie between the inner zzso and the retinal zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso by the zzso can signal changes in light levels to inner retinal zzso but the role of zzso in zzso with the zzso is zzso Since zzso cells are known to release zzso we asked whether zzso could trigger zzso release from zzso cells and whether this altered cell zzso zzso of the zzso face of fresh bovine zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso increased zzso levels more than zzso indicating that both receptors for zzso and release of zzso occurred across the zzso membrane of fresh zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels bathing cultured human zzso cells more than zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso preventing this zzso zzso the zzso site of the zzso zzso with zzso acid prevented zzso release from zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by channel blocker zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso blocker zzso or zzso release inhibitor zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso release of zzso from zzso cells that was substantially inhibited by zzso zzso triggered a rise in cell zzso that was blocked by zzso by the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by depletion of zzso zzso stores with zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulates zzso receptors on the zzso membrane of zzso cells to release zzso This secondary release can amplify the zzso signal by increasing zzso inside zzso cells, and might activate zzso zzso The interplay between zzso and zzso systems may thus be important for zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso
