In animal development, numerous zzso interactions are zzso by the zzso family of zzso zzso These proteins function in a signaling zzso that appears to be zzso from zzso to zzso We show here that the zzso gene is a new component of the zzso signaling zzso in the early zzso zzso zzso and that proteins with sequence similarity to the zzso protein are found in zzso and zzso During the zzso cell interactions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with the cell surfaces of both the zzso and the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso that are composed of zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso function may be provided by either the signaling or responding zzso
