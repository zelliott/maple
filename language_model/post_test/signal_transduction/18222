The zzso molecules zzso and zzso regulate T cell zzso by delivering zzso signals through zzso and zzso signals through zzso zzso disease zzso is caused by activated donor T zzso Previously, we showed that zzso donor T cells induced zzso zzso than zzso donor T cells, suggesting that zzso signals exacerbate zzso In this paper we demonstrate that zzso signals zzso the severity of zzso zzso the zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso donor T cell expansion, and prevents zzso zzso signaling was necessary for this effect because treatment with a soluble zzso that blocks binding of B7 to both zzso and zzso did not prevent zzso as effectively as zzso zzso These results support the current model of T cell zzso in which zzso signals amplify zzso while zzso signals inhibit zzso providing evidence that selective targeting of zzso might be a better therapeutic strategy for inducing zzso tolerance than blocking the zzso for both zzso and zzso
