zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The signaling zzso that mediates these events requires the zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso studies have suggested an involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso factor regulated by zzso We now demonstrate that insulin repression of zzso zzso gene zzso was blocked by zzso or by zzso acid zzso zzso inhibited the zzso target of zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by insulin, whereas zzso acid depletion prevented insulin induction of these signaling zzso zzso we demonstrate that insulin regulation of the zzso insulin response element of the zzso promoter was also inhibited by zzso However, sustained zzso of zzso did not repress this zzso In addition, zzso did not affect insulin regulation of zzso expression or zzso zzso We propose that these observations indicate that an zzso but zzso mechanism regulates the suppression of zzso (but not zzso gene expression by zzso zzso although the zzso sequence of the zzso gene promoter is related to that of the zzso promoter, the signaling pathways that mediate suppression of these genes are zzso
