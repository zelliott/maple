It is the purpose of this review to demonstrate that oral zzso treatment restores all major zzso factors of acne zzso by zzso of the nuclear zzso factor zzso which will be shown to be the major target of zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso is the result of increased growth factor signaling with activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso during growth hormone signaling of zzso and increased zzso signaling due to consumption of zzso zzso products as well as zzso carbohydrates of Western zzso Nuclear zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso and zzso the activity of important nuclear receptors and key genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso is proposed to be responsible for the mode of action of zzso on all major zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso can be explained at the zzso level of zzso zzso All major events in acne zzso as well as all major effects of zzso treatment appear to be related to modifications of the zzso signaling pathway, the well-known zzso zzso These insights extend our understanding of zzso zzso action in acne and other zzso skin diseases, cancer zzso and zzso immune zzso zzso zzso pivotal regulatory role in acne allows the development of novel treatment strategies and dietary interventions in acne which focus on the restoration of growth zzso and zzso imbalances of nuclear zzso protein zzso
