zzso is essential for protection from infection and for the repair of damaged zzso Much is now known about how inflammation is induced and zzso but the processes underlying the resolution of inflammation are often zzso However, resolution is an essential component of all successful inflammatory responses because it ensures the restoration of tissue zzso and prevents zzso of the type seen in chronic inflammatory diseases and zzso Small zzso proteins called zzso acting through zzso zzso are known to be critical regulators of zzso recruitment and function during the initiation and maintenance of zzso Thus, their efficient removal would seem to be a prerequisite for successful zzso In recent years, it has emerged that specialized zzso zzso receptors exist that actively participate in this zzso Moreover, other zzso receptors have been proposed to lead a double life and perform opposing roles during zzso zzso recruitment (by zzso and resolution (by zzso zzso A recent study provides further support for this theory by showing that zzso inflammatory zzso increase the number of surface zzso receptors and that these receptors can remove zzso from inflamed zzso zzso zzso is already known to aid resolution, not just because it eliminates zzso from inflamed zzso but also because their consumption by zzso leads to the production of zzso zzso The new work indicates that zzso zzso may be another mechanism exploited by dying cells to assist in the resolution of zzso
