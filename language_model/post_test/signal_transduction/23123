zzso 1 zzso is a member of zzso protein zzso implicated in a wide range of cellular functions and has beneficial properties in zzso including zzso processes and zzso However, no direct evidence has been reported on the direct implication of zzso in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish the role of zzso in stroke using an experimental model in zzso 

zzso and zzso mice were subjected to permanent focal zzso by permanent zzso In another set of experiments, zzso mice were treated zzso with vehicle, zzso 3 zzso zzso 10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso for 10 minutes, 24 hours, and 40 hours after zzso zzso were removed 48 hours after zzso for determining the zzso zzso Neurological outcome was evaluated using the modified neurological severity zzso 

Exposure to middle cerebral artery zzso increased zzso expression in zzso of the zzso mouse brain zzso Treatment of mice with zzso 3 reduced zzso volume, whereas zzso increased zzso zzso zzso mice displayed larger zzso volumes after zzso than their zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was zzso with increased zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso 

These results support the idea that zzso plays an important role in zzso against brain zzso by zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso inflammatory and zzso zzso
