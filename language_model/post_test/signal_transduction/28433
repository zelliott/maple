In zzso developing in the zzso zzso the transition from zzso zzso double negative zzso to zzso zzso double positive zzso is associated with several rounds of cell division and changes in the expression of multiple zzso This transition is induced by the formation of a zzso that includes a rearranged zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The mechanism by which the zzso influences both gene expression and proliferation has not been zzso We have evaluated the role played by early growth response gene 3 zzso in translating zzso signals into differentiation and zzso zzso is a zzso regulator that contains a zzso DNA binding zzso We find that zzso mice have a reduced number of zzso compared with zzso mice, and that this is due to poor proliferation during the zzso to zzso zzso Treatment of both zzso and zzso mice on the zzso background with zzso zzso in zzso results in similar differentiation events, but reduced cell recovery in the zzso zzso We have also generated transgenic mice that express high levels of zzso zzso and when these mice are bred onto a zzso background they exhibit increased proliferation in the absence of stimulation and have zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as increased zzso zzso The results show that zzso is an important regulator of proliferation in response to zzso signals, and that it also may regulate some specific aspects of zzso
