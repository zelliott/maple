Many zzso substances have zzso zzso Due to their ability to bind the zzso zzso zzso these compounds have the potential to counteract the deleterious effects of zzso zzso on zzso In this study, we investigated the in zzso effect of two widespread zzso zzso and zzso on alkaline zzso zzso activity in zzso cultured human zzso We found that both zzso significantly increased zzso zzso This effect was markedly reduced by zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso regulated zzso zzso pathway, and by zzso zzso an zzso of zzso Western zzso studies confirmed that zzso is rapidly activated in cells treated by both zzso Finally, zzso zzso markedly zzso the zzso zzso zzso The data presented in this study support the conclusion that, in zzso zzso zzso the increase in zzso activity by zzso involves a rapid stimulation of zzso zzso but also involves the zzso and that zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso occurs most likely downstream of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso derivatives as zzso and zzso can stimulate zzso zzso Such compounds may represent new pharmacological tools for the treatment of zzso
