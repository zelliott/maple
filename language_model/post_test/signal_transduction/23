zzso zzso zzso of rats is a model used to mimic the zzso fluid shift potentially involved in the zzso intolerance experienced by zzso Certain arteries in these rats exhibit a decreased zzso response to zzso zzso It was shown previously that this may be caused by changes in thick filament regulation zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, it was hypothesized that zzso also zzso thin filament regulation by effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso rings from zzso zzso rats and zzso controls were subjected to zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration response zzso in the presence and absence of two zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso decreased control sensitivity to both zzso but zzso sensitivity was not significantly zzso zzso which blocks zzso immediately upstream of zzso affected sensitivity to both zzso equally between control and zzso Western zzso analysis revealed no change in total levels of zzso and its downstream target heat shock protein 27 but did reveal a decrease in zzso levels of both after stimulation with zzso and zzso after zzso zzso Neither total zzso nor zzso levels after stimulation were affected by zzso Total levels of zzso a zzso downstream of both zzso were zzso but zzso levels after stimulation were decreased by roughly twice as zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In turn, this may decrease zzso availability for zzso
