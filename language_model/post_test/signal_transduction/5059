zzso zzso zzso zzso have changed the concepts of systemic therapy for a variety of advanced solid and zzso zzso However, their toxicity can be zzso and includes both cardiac and zzso zzso 

The authors evaluate zzso the adverse cardiovascular portfolio of small zzso zzso zzso their underlying mechanisms and offer recommendations regarding prevention and therapy of these zzso 

For most zzso zzso there might not be a clear-cut relationship between specific patterns of zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso side effects are likely due to zzso of multiple zzso regulated zzso The cardiovascular effects of small zzso zzso include peripheral zzso and zzso heart failure, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, acute coronary syndromes and cardiac arrest due to zzso zzso zzso should be sought in patients with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction before initiating any of these zzso It is hoped that newer zzso generations will display minimal if any cardiovascular zzso while maintaining their zzso zzso As of today, the high likelihood of morbidity without treatment mandates that cardiovascular toxicity of zzso be carefully assessed and balanced with the known benefits of administering these zzso
