The effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso binding on cells in suspension and on membrane preparation, and by in zzso zzso zzso The estimated zzso for intact cells was zzso zzso and about zzso binding sites per cell were found in cells constantly grown in the presence of zzso Three days deprivation of zzso decreased the number of zzso binding sites without any significant effect of zzso zzso of zzso to the cells returned the higher level of zzso receptors both in suspension binding studies on whole cells and on membrane zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso evoked an increase in the number of cells densely zzso with a probe against zzso zzso zzso The potency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an inhibitor of zzso zzso formation induced by zzso was increased in zzso cells, with a shift in the zzso from zzso zzso in zzso cells to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Since the zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results suggest a regulatory feedback mechanism between zzso via zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso
