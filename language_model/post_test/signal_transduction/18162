We have investigated the interaction of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso human leukemia cell line, zzso using zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and dose response on zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso were similar to those in direct zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso appeared to be zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso cells in the absence of zzso and without zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Competition studies with zzso zzso and zzso peptides decreased the amounts of zzso and zzso detected in zzso supporting the specific zzso of zzso and zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso protein containing both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the fusion protein but not cellular zzso These studies suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso associated in zzso zzso The association is not dependent upon zzso and is not zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso demonstrated that only a small portion of zzso zzso and zzso molecules are zzso zzso This partial association pattern may allow a more flexible and diverse regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Whether zzso and zzso are directly associated with each other or are part of a larger complex needs further zzso
