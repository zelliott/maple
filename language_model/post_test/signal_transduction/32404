The responsiveness of the rat zzso system to zzso zzso changes during zzso zzso recordings in the zzso zzso indicate that a) the taste responses to zzso and zzso in early zzso rats are small relative to zzso b) both zzso become more potent stimuli as the animal zzso and c) the zzso increase is accompanied by an increase in sensitivity of the zzso response to the sodium transport blocker zzso We measured zzso transport properties of in zzso tongue zzso from zzso zzso When the tissue is mounted in an zzso chamber, the zzso current responses to zzso and zzso are small in the zzso rat and increase during development in zzso and adult zzso zzso sensitivity of the zzso response also increases with zzso This study confirms that increased sensitivity of the rat zzso system to zzso with age reflects changes in the peripheral zzso The results support hypothesis that the increased sensitivity is due to zzso membrane components being added or becoming zzso
