zzso zzso possess an amazing zzso capacity that requires the zzso of cellular plasticity in differentiated cells and zzso zzso Many aspects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso development, making it unlikely that gene regulatory pathways which are essential for development are mutually exclusive from those necessary for zzso One such zzso gene regulatory pathway, which has been previously shown to be essential for functional zzso development, is zzso zzso zzso editing zzso discrete zzso changes in zzso zzso creating a molecular diversity that could create an enticing connection to the activated cellular plasticity found in zzso during zzso To assess whether zzso editing occurs during zzso we demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso transcripts are edited in zzso and zzso zzso Full zzso frame sequences for zzso and zzso two zzso responsible for zzso zzso editing, were cloned from zzso brain zzso and exhibited a strong resemblance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso discovered in zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso expression levels are zzso expressed during different zzso of zzso in multiple zzso whereas protein expression levels remain zzso In addition, we have characterized a fascinating zzso shuttling of zzso in a variety of different cell types during zzso which could provide a mechanism for controlling zzso editing, without altering zzso output of the editing zzso The link between zzso editing and zzso provides further insights into how lower organisms, such as the zzso can activate essential molecular pathways via the discrete zzso of zzso zzso
