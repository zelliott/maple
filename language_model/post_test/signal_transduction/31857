zzso cancer is the third most common zzso around the zzso zzso chemotherapy, and zzso are generally used to treat colon cancer, but no effective therapy for advanced colon zzso is zzso zzso there is a need to identify other therapeutic agents against this zzso zzso a zzso zzso compound present in zzso zzso exerts zzso potential and low zzso Emerging evidence has suggested that zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso a potential cancer therapeutic target is involved in zzso in colon cancer zzso However, the effects of zzso on human colon cancer through zzso of zzso remain zzso In this study, we explored whether zzso exerts an zzso effect, and zzso zzso in zzso human colon cancer zzso zzso displayed several zzso features, including zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso induced the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The selective zzso inhibitor compound C zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso suppression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso expression of zzso protein zzso and zzso and caused the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was abolished in the presence of compound zzso zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso cells through zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso mediates the zzso effects of zzso through zzso in zzso zzso
