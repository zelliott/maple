zzso acid zzso has been proposed to play a role in the induction of zzso zzso proteins and systemic acquired resistance zzso in zzso Since zzso is rapidly converted to salicylic acid zzso zzso in zzso we have attempted to assess the role of zzso in zzso by application of chemically zzso zzso to tobacco zzso zzso was as active as zzso in induction of zzso gene zzso This induction was preceded by a transient release of zzso which occurred in the zzso zzso The existence of a mechanism that releases zzso from zzso suggests a possible role for zzso in zzso
