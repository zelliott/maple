zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso which ultimately leads to kidney zzso This may occur due to excessive synthesis of zzso components or reduced degradation, a process primarily zzso by zzso zzso zzso The direct effect of insulin on zzso synthesis and degradation in zzso zzso cells zzso is zzso Here, we show an increased zzso activity in zzso media from zzso rat zzso determined by gelatin zzso Furthermore, we show using the specific zzso zzso and zzso that insulin induced increased zzso activity via an zzso zzso mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are activated by insulin in zzso The appearance of zzso activity at approximately 72 zzso suggested that zzso activity may be induced by insulin, however, we did not detect an increase in zzso expression by Western zzso In zzso our results suggest that insulin can induce zzso activity in zzso and it is possible that loss of this input in zzso type 2 diabetic individuals may contribute to zzso zzso and the development of zzso
