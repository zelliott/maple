In vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso exchange zzso plays an important role in zzso pH zzso zzso Recently, zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso activity has been suggested in zzso However, the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on zzso and the zzso signaling mechanisms for these effects have not fully been determined in zzso 

The effects of zzso (3 zzso and long- (24 zzso term exposure to zzso on zzso activity were examined in cultured zzso from rat zzso zzso by using zzso zzso measurement with the zzso dye zzso The zzso activity was calculated from the initial rate of zzso zzso recovery after acid zzso 

The zzso activity significantly increased after zzso and long-term exposure of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of gene zzso zzso zzso and of protein synthesis zzso had no effect on the short-term zzso effect, but inhibited the long-term zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused no effect on the short-term zzso effect, but inhibited the long-term zzso zzso Two protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso and zzso zzso (24 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both the zzso and long-term zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso for 3 hours zzso the short-term effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso activity in zzso The short-term zzso effect was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The short-term effect of zzso on zzso activity is not zzso through either MR or zzso occurs independent of gene zzso and protein zzso and occurs through a mechanism involving the structural elements of zzso The long-term effect of zzso on zzso activity occurs through both MR and zzso and requires gene zzso and protein zzso Both zzso and long-term effects of zzso are zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso by zzso and zzso mechanisms in zzso
