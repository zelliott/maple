zzso contributes to zzso zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is expressed by zzso but not zzso zzso cell zzso We hypothesized that in zzso zzso an activated ARE zzso zzso expression but in zzso zzso this repression is lost and zzso is zzso through zzso zzso signaling zzso To determine whether binding of the zzso complex to zzso in the zzso promoter region zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we studied 2 zzso zzso human zzso cell lines zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and 1 zzso cell line zzso In the presence of the synthetic zzso zzso both zzso and zzso but not zzso cells showed decreased zzso expression as zzso by Western and Northern zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of a second zzso zzso was also demonstrated in the zzso cell zzso To explore the zzso stimulating zzso expression in zzso we performed transient zzso in zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Compared to full-length zzso zzso zzso either deletion or zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso site reduced zzso zzso The location of zzso responsiveness in the zzso promoter was not identified through the combination of promoter search and transient zzso zzso indicating that a more complicated mechanism is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
