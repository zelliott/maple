Maintenance of adult zzso is carried out by stem cells and is sustained throughout life in a highly ordered zzso zzso within the stem-cell compartment is governed by zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for maintenance of the zzso zzso following injury and zzso zzso As zzso zzso and receptors are highly expressed within the stem-cell zzso we zzso that strong zzso regulators must control the zzso in the stem-cell zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso regulator of the zzso zzso family, is highly expressed by zzso stem cells and controls the size of the zzso stem-cell niche by regulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso stem-cell maintenance has so far been attributed to a combination of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings reveal zzso zzso as a strong zzso signal for stem-cell zzso This has implications for our understanding of zzso zzso in tissue development and maintenance and the progression of zzso zzso
