To investigate the relationship between the zzso gene zzso 1 involving the zzso signaling zzso and the zzso development of zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso 1, Class I zzso zzso Class III zzso zzso or zzso was, by zzso detected respectively in 25 normal zzso zzso 25 benign zzso zzso 19 borderline zzso and 69 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The higher expressions of zzso 1 and zzso were found in normal and benign zzso zzso zzso the expressions were reduced in the borderline zzso zzso and the lowest level of expressions could be detected in the zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso increased slightly in borderline zzso zzso and were higher in the zzso zzso zzso tissue than other three groups zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 expressions in the zzso zzso cancer zzso with stage I - II, zzso grade differentiation and negative zzso zzso zzso were higher than those with stage III - IV, low grade differentiation and positive zzso zzso zzso but the expressions of zzso and zzso in were lower zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 1 expression is zzso in zzso zzso cancer tissue while the zzso zzso and zzso are having the abnormal expressions on zzso signaling pathway, which may be correlated with the occurrence and development of zzso zzso zzso
