zzso 1 zzso is a zzso gene for major mental zzso including bipolar disorder and zzso Although the roles of zzso in nervous system development and functions are increasingly zzso zzso mechanisms underlying a range of zzso symptoms caused by zzso zzso remain zzso Here we show that zzso enhances synaptic zzso transport along zzso zzso down zzso expression results in attenuated zzso transport in primary cortical zzso Likewise, expressing the zzso zzso zzso version of zzso causes defective zzso zzso by zzso the assembly between the zzso zzso zzso and the cargo protein zzso zzso In addition, lithium, a zzso agent used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, can restore the assembly of zzso and zzso and zzso the defective transport caused by the zzso zzso Thus, this study addresses a new role of zzso in zzso transport in zzso and suggests that this cellular zzso could be zzso targeted for the treatment against zzso zzso
