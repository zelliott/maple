The zzso zzso of zzso coli contains four zzso zzso sites for sensory adaptation that lie near zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso An unexplored fifth zzso site, zzso lies at an zzso zzso interface closest to the zzso domain that controls zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso We zzso with in zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso zzso the zzso thresholds and response zzso of zzso receptors with different zzso imposed modifications at sites 1 to 4 and/or at site zzso zzso zzso carrying E or Q at zzso zzso in combination with zzso D and N replacements at adaptation sites 1 to 4, underwent both zzso and zzso although detection of the latter modifications required elevated zzso levels of zzso These zzso zzso could not mediate a zzso response to zzso spatial zzso demonstrating that zzso modifications at zzso alone are not sufficient for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is not critical for zzso function, because only two zzso acid replacements at this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had extreme zzso output and zzso had extreme zzso zzso These large threshold shifts are probably due to the unique zzso location of zzso site zzso However, a zzso zzso at any zzso modification site raised the zzso response zzso suggesting that all sites influence signaling by the same general zzso presumably through changes in packing stability of the zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with control of zzso signaling in zzso through dynamic interplay of the structural zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
