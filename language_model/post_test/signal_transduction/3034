Previously we demonstrated that zzso mouse zzso zzso cells induced the zzso zzso factor zzso either when zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or when treated with zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso or zzso but was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso We therefore hypothesized that zzso signaling to zzso acts through the zzso zzso zzso zzso we confirm that transcripts for zzso a zzso zzso Type I, are zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso 8, known zzso for zzso and other zzso Type I zzso was observed as was their zzso to the nucleus in zzso zzso Analysis also showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to be zzso in zzso zzso When an zzso zzso construct containing a zzso site was zzso into zzso cells, its expression was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso results in increased zzso activity, increased zzso of zzso zzso and ultimately zzso of zzso These studies imply that zzso of the zzso gene could be helpful in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso breast zzso
