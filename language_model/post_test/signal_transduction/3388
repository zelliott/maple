zzso sample storage can affect the intensity of the zzso signals provided by molecular diagnostic methods that use zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different storage times on the zzso signals of 13 bacterial species detected by the zzso zzso zzso method using zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were collected from 36 healthy subjects, and the intensity of zzso signals was evaluated at 4 different time zzso zzso immediately after collecting zzso 24) and zzso after storage at zzso for 6 months zzso 24), zzso for 12 months zzso 24), and zzso for 24 months zzso zzso The intensity of zzso signals obtained from groups 1 and 2 were significantly higher than in the other groups zzso zzso No differences were found between groups 1 and 2 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso method was suitable to detect zzso signals from all groups zzso and the intensity of signals decreased significantly after long periods of sample zzso
