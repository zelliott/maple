Evidence suggests that zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso may be abnormal in irritable zzso syndrome zzso However, interpretation of the data has been hampered by the variable methodology and rather small numbers used in previous zzso zzso the aim of this study was to measure zzso of zzso plasma zzso and its zzso zzso under zzso and fed conditions in a large group of patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso The ratio of plasma zzso and zzso stores was also zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and 35 healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso had zzso plasma zzso zzso measured using zzso zzso liquid zzso with zzso detection before and after a standard zzso 

zzso patients had raised zzso plasma zzso zzso under zzso and fed conditions zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso relative to zzso concentration was similar to zzso In contrast, zzso patients failed to show an increase in zzso plasma zzso concentration with meal zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso but normal zzso ratio and zzso with normal zzso zzso but reduced zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso patients had increased zzso zzso 

These results support the concept that zzso is characterized by reduced zzso zzso whereas impaired release may be a feature of zzso These results also provide a rational basis for current zzso approaches involving zzso of different zzso receptors in zzso and zzso
