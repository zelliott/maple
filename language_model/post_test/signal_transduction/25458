zzso zzso leukemia zzso an incurable zzso of mature B zzso involves blood, bone zzso and secondary zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso A role of the tissue zzso in the zzso of zzso is hypothesized based on in zzso zzso but its contribution in zzso remains zzso To zzso the effects of zzso interactions in zzso we zzso tumor cells from 24 zzso zzso zzso were obtained zzso from blood, bone zzso and/or zzso and analyzed by gene expression zzso We identified the zzso as a key site in zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso showed zzso of gene signatures, indicating zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso signaling and zzso nuclear zzso zzso we detected zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso target genes was stronger in clinically more aggressive zzso indicating more effective zzso signaling in this zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso by the expression of the zzso and zzso target genes and verified with zzso zzso by flow zzso was highest in the zzso and was correlated with clinical disease zzso These data identify the disruption of tumor zzso interactions and the zzso of zzso signaling as promising therapeutic strategies in zzso This study is registered at zzso as zzso
