zzso of activated and zzso growth factor zzso receptors by zzso and subsequent zzso degradation ensures zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso of such zzso Here, we identify an zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate its expression in human cells and conservation across zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso interact with the zzso sorting protein zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we find that zzso specifically binds zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso interacts with zzso Although zzso mainly zzso to zzso pits at the plasma zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso similarly to zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso whereas zzso is without zzso Similarly, depletion of zzso but not zzso delays degradation and promotes recycling of zzso These results indicate that zzso is an zzso localized zzso of zzso that is present in the zzso complex via direct zzso interaction and important for the sorting function of this zzso
