zzso signals spread along zzso outer segments away from the site of zzso capture because of zzso diffusion of zzso a zzso second zzso The quantitative features of zzso diffusion reflect the anatomical structure of the outer segment, known to be profoundly different in rod and cone zzso To explore how structural differences affect zzso diffusion and to assess whether zzso diffusion may contribute to the difference in signal zzso between zzso types, we investigated, both theoretically and zzso the zzso diffusion of small, zzso molecules in outer zzso We developed a new theoretical analysis to explicitly zzso the zzso diffusion constant, zzso in terms of outer segment zzso Using zzso zzso imaging we measured zzso of zzso and zzso yellow in intact, single cones and validated the theoretical zzso We used zzso simulations of the theoretical model to investigate zzso diffusion in outer segments of various zzso At a given time zzso zzso spreads further in rod than in cone outer segments of the same zzso Across all species, the spatial spread of zzso at the peak of the dim light zzso is 3-5 zzso in rod outer zzso regardless of their absolute zzso zzso the zzso spatial spread is zzso zzso in cone outer zzso independently of their zzso
