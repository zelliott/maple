After zzso laser surgery, zzso growth factor zzso plays an important role in injured zzso zzso cell on zzso cell formation in zzso zzso The purpose of the study is to investigate the precise mechanism of zzso on zzso wound healing, particularly on zzso proliferation and zzso 

In this study we applied small interference zzso zzso to knock down the expression of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The relative zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso 9 zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso was determined via real-time zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso potential of zzso was evaluated via a proliferation zzso using the measurement of zzso incorporation zzso zzso zzso was subjected to flow zzso zzso 

The results showed zzso expression was enhanced and there was a statistically significant increase in zzso treatment compared to the control zzso zzso zzso western zzso analysis, and the proliferation zzso demonstrated significantly lower zzso and zzso expression and proliferation cell counts in zzso zzso groups versus significantly higher levels in zzso plus zzso zzso zzso The data analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso expression decreased as a result of the inhibitor zzso zzso cells were increased in the zzso plus zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso plus zzso groups as compared with the zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso stimulates zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso proliferation was through the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso
