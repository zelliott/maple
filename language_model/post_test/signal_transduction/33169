The choice between the zzso or zzso T cell fates is influenced by the production of functional, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but the mechanism that controls the lineage choice is not zzso Here, we show that T cells that are zzso for a zzso of the zzso gene are more likely to develop as zzso T cells than as zzso T cells, zzso that reduced zzso activity favors the zzso T cell fate over the zzso T cell zzso A zzso activated form of zzso produces a zzso zzso and zzso zzso that have functional zzso gene zzso to adopt the zzso T cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso acts together with the newly formed T cell zzso zzso to direct the zzso versus zzso T cell lineage zzso
