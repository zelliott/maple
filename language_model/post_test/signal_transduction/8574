zzso a novel fusion zzso zzso zzso resulting from a zzso zzso was recently identified in a poorly understood subset of peripheral zzso zzso However, the zzso and functional properties of zzso are zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso active zzso zzso that is sensitive to an established inhibitor of zzso The expression of zzso but not zzso transformed zzso cells, inducing loss of contact zzso and formation of zzso colonies in soft zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is unusual among zzso in having an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a well characterized zzso zzso zzso into the zzso domain of zzso inhibited its zzso markedly reduced its zzso activity, and zzso its ability to activate the zzso signaling zzso and to transform zzso zzso Although zzso was zzso zzso was zzso However, each of these properties could be recovered by zzso zzso back to the plasma membrane by the addition of an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a model in which zzso requires zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced by pharmacological zzso of zzso and increased by zzso with a zzso active form of zzso Together, these findings identify zzso as an active, transforming zzso dependent upon zzso zzso membrane zzso identify a novel mechanism for zzso of an zzso zzso and suggest zzso as a rational therapeutic target for zzso zzso
