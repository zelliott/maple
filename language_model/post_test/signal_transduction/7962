The major event that triggers osteogenesis is the transition of zzso stem cells into bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation is the primary component of bone formation, exemplified by the zzso deposition and zzso of zzso zzso Although not well zzso zzso differentiation from zzso stem cells is a zzso zzso Recent advances in molecular and genetic studies using gene targeting in mouse enable a better understanding of the multiple factors and signaling networks that control the differentiation process at a molecular zzso zzso commitment and differentiation are controlled by complex activities involving signal zzso and zzso regulation of gene zzso We review zzso signaling zzso and zzso regulation network, which are critical for zzso zzso Many other factors and signaling pathways have been implicated in regulation of zzso differentiation in a network manner, such as the factors zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and sympathetic signaling zzso This review summarizes the recent advances in the studies of signaling zzso pathways and zzso regulation of zzso cell lineage commitment and zzso The knowledge of zzso commitment and differentiation should be applied towards the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives for human bone zzso
