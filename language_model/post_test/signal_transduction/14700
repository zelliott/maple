We define the dynamics of spatial and zzso reorganization of the team of proteins and lipids serving zzso zzso The zzso becomes competent for division only after it acquires the complete set of zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso the zzso with zzso proteins promotes the relocation of zzso zzso zzso an zzso of fatty acid zzso from the zzso to the zzso The binding of zzso to zzso a zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid and zzso zzso in the zzso The formation of these two lipids and the subsequent zzso movement of zzso initiate the assembly of a complex between the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso proteins on the zzso zzso This protein team promotes membrane zzso thereby executing the terminal step of zzso zzso
