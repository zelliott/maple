The zzso hormone zzso binds to its zzso receptors to regulate zzso zzso zzso is also zzso in the stomach and subsequently binds to its receptors expressed in the zzso although the functional relevance of such zzso remains largely zzso We report here that zzso zzso administration activates zzso zzso receptors and signals through a zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso signaling zzso to lower zzso production in healthy zzso zzso zzso action is sufficient to lower zzso production in uncontrolled diabetic and zzso zzso and contributes to the early zzso effect of zzso bypass zzso These data unveil a zzso site of zzso action and suggest that enhancing zzso signaling in the zzso lowers plasma zzso zzso in zzso
