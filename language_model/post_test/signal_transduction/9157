Nuclear zzso essential zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso complex, is a critical component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso gene cause various forms of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso All known zzso zzso zzso impair zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso We describe here 2 zzso zzso zzso that affect the same zzso in the zzso domain zzso and zzso that do not impair zzso production or zzso zzso studies based on pull-down experiments showed a zzso in zzso interaction with zzso and linear zzso chains for these zzso zzso zzso studies on the patients' cells showed an impairment of the classic zzso signaling pathways after zzso of 2 zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso We report the first human zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso found to affect the zzso binding of zzso rather than its expression and zzso These experiments demonstrate that the binding of human zzso to zzso is essential for zzso zzso They also demonstrate that the normal expression and folding of zzso do not exclude a zzso role for zzso zzso in patients with zzso
