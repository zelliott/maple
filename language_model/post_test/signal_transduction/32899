The need for new zzso comes from the widespread resistance to those in current zzso New zzso targets are required to allow the discovery of chemically diverse, effective zzso The search for such new targets and new drug zzso will likely be helped by the advent of functional zzso and zzso drug zzso After validation of the putative targets as those capable of providing effective and safe drugs, targets can be used as the basis for screening compounds in order to identify new zzso which, in turn, will qualify for lead zzso zzso The combined use of zzso zzso generate large numbers of structurally diverse zzso of high zzso screening zzso speed up the testing of zzso will help to zzso the zzso Potential zzso targets in the malaria zzso can be broadly classified into three zzso those involved in processes occurring in the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso and those responsible for membrane processes and zzso The processes occurring in the zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso processes and free radical formation, and reactions accompanying zzso release followed by its zzso into zzso Many zzso in zzso and zzso synthesis are promising potential targets, some of which have been established in other zzso although not yet validated for zzso with very few exceptions (such as zzso zzso zzso responsible for membrane zzso including trafficking and drug transport and zzso are potentially important also to identify compounds to be used in combination with zzso drugs to combat zzso
