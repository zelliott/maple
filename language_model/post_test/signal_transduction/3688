zzso zzso is a zzso that regulates both the growth and differentiation of zzso zzso Its zzso binding specificity and important signal zzso mechanisms are zzso by the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso The zzso is a zzso motif within zzso that is critical for zzso responses to zzso Although the zzso also contributes to gene regulation, nuclear targets directly regulated by this motif have not been zzso It is shown here that the zzso at position 497 in the zzso is critical for regulation of the zzso status of a set of nuclear proteins that includes zzso small zzso zzso proteins involved in the control of gene expression in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso is unable to induce zzso zzso in insulin zzso zzso cells, and the inhibitor zzso completely blocks zzso regulation of zzso zzso status but not zzso of an zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is a nuclear target whose zzso status is regulated through the zzso motif via insulin zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso of the zzso zzso
