zzso zzso proteins zzso serve as both a structural support for cells and a dynamic zzso network that directs cellular zzso zzso proteins such as those of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso could possess inherent growth factor zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso 5 of zzso zzso protein 3 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso protein family member, zzso zzso marker genes in primary human adult zzso stem cells zzso a mouse zzso cell line zzso and a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso real-time zzso technology was used to zzso gene expression levels of bone markers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso increased zzso protein production in zzso and zzso zzso activity and calcium deposition was increased by zzso in zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso suggesting that signaling by zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso was also shown to activate zzso zzso and zzso three components of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate a novel signaling function for zzso in cell differentiation beyond the hypothesized role of zzso in zzso
