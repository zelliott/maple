The majority of bone cell biology focuses on activity on the surface of the bone with little attention paid to the activity that occurs below the zzso However, with recent new zzso zzso cells embedded within the zzso zzso of bone, are becoming the target of intensive zzso In this article, the distinctions between zzso and their descendants, zzso are zzso zzso are defined as cells that make bone zzso and zzso are thought to translate mechanical loading into zzso signals that affect bone zzso zzso and zzso should have similarities as would be expected of cells of the same zzso yet these cells also have distinct differences, particularly in their responses to mechanical loading and zzso of the various zzso pathways to accomplish their respective zzso For example, the zzso signaling zzso is now recognized as an important regulator of bone mass and bone cell zzso This zzso is important in zzso for zzso proliferation and the synthesis bone zzso whereas zzso appear to use the zzso zzso to transmit signals of mechanical loading to cells on the bone zzso New emerging evidence suggests that the zzso zzso in zzso may be triggered by zzso with the zzso zzso in response to loading which then leads to a decrease in expression of negative regulators of the zzso such as zzso and zzso The study of zzso biology is becoming an intense area of research interest and this review will examine some of the recent findings that are zzso our understanding of zzso cell zzso
