Recently, zzso from children with active zzso zzso zzso have been found to enhance zzso zzso production by human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso To further determine the possible factor with the ability to enhance zzso zzso production in zzso from acute stage of zzso 10 children with zzso at the acute stage and 10 healthy controls were zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso Active zzso with or without zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of controls, and zzso A zzso derived from zzso were used to stimulate the zzso The ability of these factors to enhance zzso zzso production was zzso Furthermore, zzso pathways were also zzso by different zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso in zzso patients at the acute stage were significantly higher than in controls zzso zzso zzso The active zzso could enhance zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso and the ability of these zzso was mostly abolished when zzso with fixed zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels of zzso cells zzso by zzso derived from acute stage of zzso were statistically higher than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced the zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso Together with these findings, it is concluded that zzso zzso derived from acute stage of zzso may bind to zzso and enhance zzso cells to produce zzso via zzso zzso zzso
