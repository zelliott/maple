zzso cells zzso are potent initiators of T zzso immunity that undergo maturation during viral zzso However, few reports describing the interactions of zzso with Japanese encephalitis virus zzso which remains the most frequent cause of acute and epidemic viral encephalitis, are zzso In this study, we investigated the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso its viral zzso in both cells with different efficiency, and zzso infection of zzso followed the classical zzso zzso of zzso of tested zzso molecules and zzso zzso production zzso zzso and zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso class zzso Of more interest, along with production of zzso zzso zzso infected by zzso released zzso zzso zzso which was not detected in zzso Moreover, signaling through zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was found to play a role in the production of zzso and zzso of primary zzso and zzso T cell zzso We also found that zzso released from zzso zzso led to a reduction in the zzso of zzso T cells, but not zzso T zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso functional impairment of zzso through zzso and zzso zzso which subsequently leads to poor zzso and zzso T cell responses, resulting in boosting viral survival and dissemination in the zzso
