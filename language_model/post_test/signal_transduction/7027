The gain of function zzso zzso is very frequently found in zzso zzso zzso and is strongly implicated in zzso of these and other zzso zzso Here we report establishment of a new leukemia cell line, zzso zzso for zzso from a zzso female patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso transformed from zzso zzso is positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and has complex zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed only the zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited and zzso was induced by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or zzso which zzso the zzso family zzso as well as zzso zzso the zzso family zzso Lyn was zzso activated with zzso of zzso in the zzso loop, which was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso Further analyses with zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso while Lyn zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to induce the zzso and zzso complex zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and reduced the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which correlated with their effects on proliferation and survival of these zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by its inhibitor zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso but not by zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso may be suppressed in zzso cells through zzso of zzso by Lyn as well as zzso and additionally through zzso of zzso by zzso It is also speculated that zzso of the zzso zzso may mediate proliferation signaling from zzso and zzso zzso cells may provide a valuable model system to zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in evolution of zzso zzso to zzso and to develop novel therapies against this intractable zzso
