zzso effects of beta zzso zzso zzso stimulation have been classically shown to result from zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate a novel signaling mechanism wherein zzso mediate zzso signaling to zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso zzso independent of G protein zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso expressed in zzso cells was resolved into two components dependent, respectively, on zzso zzso A zzso or zzso G zzso activity was zzso zzso within zzso zzso was quite zzso was blocked by zzso toxin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was insensitive to depletion of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was slower in onset zzso zzso zzso less zzso but more sustained and showed little zzso over 30 zzso It was insensitive to zzso toxin and zzso and sensitive to depletion of either zzso or zzso by small interfering zzso In zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso recruited zzso fluorescent protein and activated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a novel zzso zzso zzso or zzso rationally designed based on zzso Trace analysis, was incapable of G protein zzso but could recruit zzso undergo zzso zzso and activate zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso or zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to the formation of stable zzso complexes on zzso and increased zzso zzso In contrast, zzso membrane zzso of which requires zzso release upon G protein zzso was ineffective unless it was zzso targeted to the plasma membrane by a zzso signal zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso can signal to zzso via a zzso pathway, which is independent of G protein zzso
