zzso restriction zzso produces a number of health benefits and ameliorates diseases of aging such as type 2 zzso The components of the pathways downstream of zzso may provide intervention points for developing zzso for treating diseases of zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso has been implicated as one of the key downstream regulators of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Small zzso zzso of zzso have been identified that exhibit efficacy in animal models of diseases typically associated with aging including type 2 zzso To identify molecular processes induced in the liver of mice treated with two structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for three days, we zzso a systems biology approach and applied zzso Network Modeling zzso on gene expression data to zzso downstream effects of zzso zzso 

Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso many of the molecular events downstream of zzso in zzso such as enhancing zzso zzso improving zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso pathways in mice fed a high fat, high calorie zzso 

zzso of gene expression data from mice treated with zzso or zzso in combination with supporting in zzso and in zzso data demonstrates that zzso and zzso produce a signaling profile that mirrors zzso improves zzso and insulin zzso and acts via zzso zzso in zzso Taken together these results are encouraging regarding the use of small zzso zzso of zzso for therapeutic intervention into type 2 diabetes, a strategy which is currently being investigated in multiple clinical zzso
