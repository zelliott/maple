Human heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by extensive abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso consistently ameliorates cardiac dysfunction and survival in heart failure, suggesting that zzso dysfunction may be zzso linked to the deterioration of cardiac zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso the processes of zzso and zzso hallmarks of heart zzso Our recent studies have shown that zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane also promotes the zzso of zzso At the plasma zzso the generation of zzso zzso by zzso is required in the process of zzso a zzso to zzso zzso A large body of data now indicates that zzso of zzso is consistently associated with abnormalities of zzso zzso under pathological conditions, including zzso zzso and heart failure from different zzso In this review we will discuss the role of zzso zzso activity and novel experimental strategies to disrupt the zzso complex and in turn zzso zzso dysfunction and the progression of heart zzso
