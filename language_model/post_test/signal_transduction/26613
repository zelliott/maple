Multiple cell types in the vascular wall rely upon the zzso zzso signaling zzso for zzso function and response to zzso These cell types include zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells, and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binding protein that activates its downstream target zzso in response to zzso of a variety of zzso coupled zzso When zzso ROCK zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso family of zzso In zzso zzso of these signaling zzso results in zzso of multiple cellular zzso including enhanced zzso zzso impaired zzso response to zzso chronic pulmonary zzso and zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso ROCK activity has also been linked specifically to a number of known zzso of pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso among zzso Recently, elevated ROCK activity has been demonstrated in various animal models of zzso with ROCK zzso associated with pulmonary zzso and zzso of zzso ROCK zzso are a new class of agents which may be beneficial in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso Chemical and zzso Company, zzso zzso a first generation ROCK zzso has been widely zzso Emerging evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that zzso can promote zzso independent of the mechanism that zzso zzso and will be useful in conditions in which zzso function is impaired including zzso Several recent patents have described zzso as a potential therapeutic option in zzso This article provides an overview of the role of ROCK in the zzso of zzso and discusses the clinical efficacy of zzso as a therapeutic option for treating zzso
