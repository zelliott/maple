A major problem in sensory motor integration is to delineate how forces acting upon a leg are zzso and regulated in the control of posture and zzso We have studied responses of the zzso zzso zzso the largest array of force detecting zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from two groups of zzso zzso 3 and 4) zzso forces applied to the leg in the plane of joint movement of the zzso zzso The receptors within Group 3 exhibit fixed patterns of recruitment that could zzso indicate when force levels are adequate to provide support and propulsion during zzso
