zzso hormone zzso can trigger a massive differentiation of cultured zzso precursor cells zzso by binding the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso Whether this reflects a zzso function of zzso remains zzso Using a recently generated mouse model, in which zzso zzso is used to block its function, we show that zzso acts at two levels for the in zzso differentiation of zzso in mouse zzso At the early zzso stage, it promotes the zzso of several zzso factors by acting in zzso zzso and zzso defining an environment suitable for zzso zzso At later zzso zzso acts in a zzso manner to ensure the complete arrest of zzso zzso These data explain contradictory observations made on various models and outline the importance of zzso signaling both for zzso zzso zzso and restraining zzso proliferation in adult zzso
