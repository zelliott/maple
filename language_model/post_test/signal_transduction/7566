In a previous study, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso screening as a gene whose depletion restricted zzso zzso In the current study, we show that zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that depletion of zzso results in a robust decrease of zzso zzso virus zzso infection and a corresponding enhancement of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso type I zzso induction by altering both the expression and signaling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso of zzso that abolish its zzso zzso zzso and its participation in zzso degradation zzso lost their ability to degrade zzso but surprisingly maintained their ability to repress zzso zzso In contrast, zzso lacking its entire C zzso lost both its ability to degrade zzso and repress zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts with both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso via its zzso zzso domain, and that this interaction is required to abrogate zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data thus zzso two parallel pathways by which zzso regulates zzso zzso one zzso requires its zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity to directly degrade zzso whereas the other zzso occurs independently of these activities, but requires the zzso zzso domain and occurs via a direct association between this region and zzso
