zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso differentiated zzso known as leafy zzso on a wide variety of plants, employing zzso genes located on a linear zzso The zzso strategy consists of the production of a mixture of six zzso acting zzso that overwhelm the plant's zzso mechanisms, ensuring the zzso of a signaling cascade that targets the plant cell cycle and directs the newly formed cells to differentiate into shoot zzso The shoots that are formed upon infection remain immature and never convert to source zzso resulting in the establishment of a zzso sink that is a niche for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is accompanied by modifications of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of both host and zzso Here, we review a decade of research and set the outlines of the molecular basis of the leafy zzso zzso
