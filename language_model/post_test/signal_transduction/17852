The zzso zzso within the zzso family is a growing group of zzso receptors that have within their zzso tails a characteristic signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso switch zzso enables these receptors to bind to and be regulated by small zzso domain zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso protein zzso domain protein zzso and zzso zzso transcript zzso A major signaling zzso through the zzso zzso in this zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso a key zzso for viral zzso As a result, many viruses have designed strategies to zzso or alter zzso zzso zzso virus uses zzso as a zzso and zzso zzso virus encodes proteins that are zzso to zzso Thus, viruses use zzso zzso receptors to create a favorable environment to elude detection and zzso zzso the zzso zzso may lead to new strategies for vaccine development and zzso zzso
