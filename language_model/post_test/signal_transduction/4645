T zzso zzso responses decline with age, suggesting defective zzso zzso zzso zzso memory T cells from individuals older than 65 y displayed increased and sustained zzso of the zzso zzso 4 zzso that shortened expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (both P zzso zzso and decreased production of zzso zzso and zzso (all P zzso zzso after in zzso zzso In zzso after influenza zzso activated zzso T cells from elderly individuals had increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso correlated with the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso T cells, zzso had a negative effect on the expansion of zzso B cells zzso zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso of zzso in memory zzso T cells improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression significantly more in the elderly than young zzso zzso the ability of zzso memory T cells to support zzso differentiation that was impaired in the elderly zzso zzso zzso was zzso Our data suggest that increased zzso expression in activated T cells in the elderly in part accounts for defective zzso immune zzso
