zzso are abundant in neural tissue and play important roles in zzso zzso signal zzso and cell zzso zzso are divided into 4 groups: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on their zzso zzso zzso knockout mice, which lack zzso and zzso zzso exhibit altered zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this zzso however, remains zzso To address this issue, we first investigated the possibility that zzso in peripheral zzso endings are involved in zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso such as zzso produced zzso responses and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and type I zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis revealed elevated zzso content in zzso zzso due to zzso injection of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso attenuated zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso induced zzso zzso to accumulate in zzso zzso thereafter zzso zzso zzso which in turn resulted in zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso injection of zzso which zzso zzso zzso from zzso such as zzso attenuated the late phase of zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso effects of zzso and the zzso effects of zzso indicated that zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso play important roles in zzso responses originating in peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso to accumulate in zzso zzso thereafter zzso zzso zzso which in turn resulted in zzso and zzso
