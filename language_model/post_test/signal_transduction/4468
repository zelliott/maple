zzso zzso zzso ensure specific zzso outcomes by zzso both proper zzso gene expression patterns and appropriate zzso zzso In zzso the precise zzso control of the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso signaling to specify distinct cell zzso Recently, we identified a zzso that activates zzso expression and thereby zzso zzso from a subset of abdominal sensory organ precursor cells zzso to induce an appropriate number of zzso cells called zzso Here, we use scanning zzso coupled with reporter zzso zzso and zzso to dissect the zzso mechanisms regulating zzso zzso zzso Our results show that proper spatial activity of the zzso zzso is dependent upon direct integration of the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso integrated on the zzso zzso by abdominal versus zzso zzso proteins in the presence of zzso zzso we show that zzso uses both zzso and zzso mechanisms to stimulate zzso zzso activity to induce proper zzso zzso Thus, these data demonstrate how a zzso zzso zzso and neural zzso zzso to regulate the appropriate spatial pattern and levels of zzso zzso to specify an essential cell zzso
