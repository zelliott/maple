The current paper focuses on a relatively new and promising area of the study of zzso transformations during brain information processing based on the reduction of the signal to the discrete zzso segment sequences which may reflect individual brain zzso or discrete zzso In this zzso the complex brain functions require integration of several operations throughout the whole zzso However, the role of zzso brain systems in such processes is still zzso The effects of a single dose (30 zzso of zzso on the operational activity of zzso populations and on the zzso binding between them were examined in a zzso zzso crossover zzso study with eight healthy zzso zzso measures at 20 channels were evaluated on two zzso zzso eyes closed, zzso eyes zzso In short, we conducted a zzso zzso study where one factor manipulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other factor was simply brain state zzso closed zzso eyes zzso We were primarily interested in the main effect of zzso In the present study, a connection between the zzso level, described by the local functional processes zzso zzso or zzso and the zzso level, described as a sequence of zzso brain states zzso functionally synchronized zzso zzso was zzso The role of zzso brain systems facilitated by zzso in the operational dynamics of zzso populations and in the process of zzso structural zzso zzso zzso zzso was addressed for the first zzso It was shown that zzso signaling reorganized the dynamics of local zzso populations and the remote functional connectivity between zzso
