zzso A and zzso Growth zzso zzso are members of a common family of zzso that bind to and stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso are important during embryonic development exerting both positive and negative effects on cell zzso In the adult zzso they function in processes such as tissue repair, cellular zzso and zzso Although zzso A and zzso often induce opposite functional outcomes in specific zzso proliferation or zzso both were found to stimulate the formation of zzso stress fibers and focal zzso in zzso rat zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso These structural changes were accompanied by zzso of the focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similar zzso and zzso changes were observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the migration in certain cell zzso However, while zzso A, zzso and zzso II all zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, only zzso A and zzso II zzso zzso zzso failed to illicit a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso activity failed to block migration in response to zzso A and zzso II, indicating zzso migration can occur independent of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso A share several signaling pathways with zzso II leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso but there are distinct differences regarding the effect of these zzso on cellular zzso
