While vitamin A has been implicated in host resistance to infectious disease, little is known about the role of vitamin A and its active zzso zzso acid zzso in host defenses against zzso Here, we show that local zzso production within the tumor zzso zzso is increased up to zzso as compared with zzso surrounding zzso with a commensurate increase in zzso signaling to regionally zzso zzso T zzso zzso disruption of zzso signaling in zzso T cells using a dominant negative zzso acid zzso zzso zzso established that zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and protective zzso zzso In zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso responses revealed that early zzso expansion was zzso however, late zzso expansion and zzso zzso was suppressed strongly in the absence of zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso function is essential for the survival of zzso zzso T cells within the zzso
