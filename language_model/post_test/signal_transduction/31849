zzso zzso generated by new technologies are increasingly prevalent in disparate areas of biological zzso While many studies have sought to characterize relationships among zzso features, commensurate efforts to characterize relationships among biological samples have been less zzso zzso the full extent of sample variation in zzso studies is often zzso complicating downstream zzso tasks such as gene zzso network zzso 

Here we demonstrate the use of network methods for characterizing sample relationships in zzso data generated from human brain zzso We describe an approach for identifying outlying samples that does not depend on the choice or use of zzso zzso We introduce a battery of measures for zzso the consistency and integrity of sample zzso which can be compared across disparate studies, technology platforms, and biological zzso Among these measures, we provide evidence that the correlation between the connectivity and the zzso zzso zzso important network zzso is a sensitive indicator of zzso among biological zzso We also show that this measure, which we refer to as zzso can distinguish biologically meaningful relationships among zzso of zzso Specifically, we find that zzso reveals the profound effect of zzso disease on samples from the zzso nucleus relative to other brain zzso Furthermore, we find that this effect is concentrated in specific zzso of genes that are naturally zzso in human zzso nucleus, highlighting a new strategy for exploring the effects of disease on sets of zzso 

These results underscore the importance of systematically exploring sample relationships in large zzso zzso before seeking to analyze zzso feature zzso We introduce a standardized platform for this purpose using freely available R software that has been designed to enable zzso and interactive exploration of sample zzso
