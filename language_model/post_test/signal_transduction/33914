The most frequent site of zzso in human prostate cancer zzso is the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso factors may facilitate the selective zzso of the zzso The most abundant protein within the skeleton is type I zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso cells selected in zzso for collagen I binding zzso are highly zzso and acquired the capacity to grow within the bone compared to zzso zzso parental zzso Treatment with zzso zzso selectively blocked zzso migration, suggesting that zzso signaling mediates zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism of zzso migration, we evaluated zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso parental cells and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso was increased five- to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively, compared to parental zzso zzso zzso zzso was selectively blocked with zzso to zzso where treatment with a small hairpin zzso specific for zzso suppressed zzso invasion without altering the zzso zzso affinity for collagen zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso by collagen I activates zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso invasion, and suggests a mechanism for the preferential zzso of zzso cells within the zzso
