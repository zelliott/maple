Increased zzso results in a heightened zzso of immune cells into fat zzso which in turn generates a zzso zzso in obese zzso To better understand the zzso factors that establish this zzso profile, we examined events leading to zzso between zzso and immune zzso Using isolated zzso immune cells, zzso with zzso together with cultured zzso we differentiated the effects of zzso factors and zzso contact on zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso without direct zzso permitting only zzso communication, zzso of zzso and zzso were increased by 3- and zzso respectively, over what was zzso by individual cultures, whereas zzso zzso was reduced by zzso When cells were zzso with direct zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased by an additional zzso and zzso respectively, over that measured from just zzso stimulation alone, indicating that cell contact provides a synergistic signal that zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso from zzso mice showed that the absence of zzso has little effect on zzso stimulation of zzso zzso but zzso cell zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso supports cell zzso signaling in part, but not exclusively, through Nuclear zzso zzso These findings indicate that engagement of cell contact between immune cells and zzso in conjunction with locally zzso zzso factors, activates a unique signaling zzso that mediates zzso between these cell types leading to marked effects on zzso zzso and zzso
