Because DNA zzso cell cycle checkpoints are thought to protect cells from the lethal effects of zzso radiation, a better understanding of the zzso functions of cell cycle regulatory proteins may reveal new molecular targets for cancer zzso The two major regulatory proteins of zzso arrest are zzso and zzso Yet, it is unclear how these two proteins interact and coordinate their functional roles during zzso zzso zzso To determine zzso role in zzso zzso arrest, we used zzso zzso cells and examined expression of zzso arrest proteins under conditions in which zzso arrest was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso arrest in zzso zzso zzso zzso The arrest zzso was associated with suppression of zzso expression of both zzso and zzso zzso -- two known zzso zzso arrest zzso The suppression occurred despite normal induction of zzso and normal zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso -- the two known zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, we showed that zzso zzso of zzso at zzso was associated with binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso inhibited zzso zzso We suggest that DNA zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and subsequent zzso zzso links zzso with zzso downstream responses and may provide a coordinated interaction between DNA damage responses and cell cycle arrest zzso
