zzso zzso zzso is a basement zzso zzso zzso usually considered in the context of muscle and nerve zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso can additionally zzso zzso cell biology, an analysis of the role of zzso in cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and proliferation was zzso A zzso transformed human zzso zzso cell line zzso was zzso in this zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is essential for the rapid attachment of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso incorporation analyses revealed that, compared with zzso or zzso zzso significantly promotes zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed within 15 zzso of cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso function decreased total cellular zzso levels, specifically inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso and dampened the proliferation response of zzso cells adherent to zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation in a zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso resulted in a stronger suppression of proliferation compared with zzso zzso From these results, it is concluded that human zzso zzso cells adhere to immobilized zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily through an zzso pathway, enhances zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso can impact on zzso cell biology in addition to nerve and muscle, and provide information regarding the role of this zzso in zzso surface zzso zzso
