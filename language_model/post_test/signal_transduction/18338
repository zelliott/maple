The recent identification of two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso led us to re-examine the basis for zzso cell responses to zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso are known to express zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Northern blots detected both of those receptors and, to a lesser extent, zzso but zzso message was zzso and there was no response to zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso or any other zzso contributes to zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso was blocked with two selective zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited with the zzso zzso The zzso completely inhibited zzso responses to zzso but zzso was only partly effective, even though separate studies established that the zzso completely zzso zzso signaling at the zzso zzso Since peptides mimicking the zzso zzso zzso domain can also activate zzso we asked whether the remaining zzso response in the presence of the zzso could be due in part to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Evidence that zzso can occur was obtained in zzso cells zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso that can be zzso but not zzso There was a substantial response to zzso only in cells expressing both zzso zzso in zzso complete blockade of the zzso response by the zzso zzso occurred only when signaling through zzso was also zzso From these observations we conclude that 1) zzso is the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso of zzso is required for zzso cell responses to zzso 2) although zzso may be zzso there is still no evidence that it mediates zzso zzso 3) zzso is not expressed on zzso and 4) zzso of zzso by zzso zzso can contribute to zzso cell responses to zzso particularly when signaling through zzso is zzso Such zzso may limit the effectiveness of zzso antagonists, which compete with the zzso zzso domain rather than preventing zzso zzso
