The absence of zzso zzso protects zzso mice from the development of zzso Although the effects of zzso on T cell zzso are well known, its impact on the function of zzso is not fully zzso We tested zzso function and survival in mice lacking zzso A significant reduction in the zzso ability was observed in both zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice exhibited enhanced zzso to death, which was reflected by their reduced total cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso in zzso mice revealed a significantly decreased proportion of zzso zzso Interestingly, an enhanced proportion of zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso Lastly, we found that zzso zzso significantly diminished the zzso response in zzso upon zzso zzso In conclusion our data suggests that zzso promotes the generation of a mature zzso repertoire and promotes zzso function and zzso
