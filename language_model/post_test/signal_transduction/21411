Although the natural history and zzso characteristics of human zzso zzso zzso are well zzso the molecular zzso of zzso remains poorly zzso Here, we define the role for Ras and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathways in human zzso 

zzso and zzso status of Ras and zzso zzso were assessed in 80 zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso of Ras and zzso signaling pathways was determined by DNA sequencing, Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso of Ras and zzso pathways in zzso cell lines was evaluated by viability and zzso zzso 

zzso of Ras and zzso pathways was enhanced in all zzso when compared with zzso surrounding and normal zzso zzso with the suppression of at least 1 Ras zzso and/or zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso 2, 3; and zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso showed significantly higher frequency of zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso than zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso promoters was observed only in a zzso of zzso with poor survival, suggesting that zzso of these 2 genes might be involved in zzso zzso Combined treatment of zzso cell lines with Ras and zzso zzso as well as with the zzso agent zzso induced a strong zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate the ubiquitous zzso of Ras and zzso pathways in zzso and suggest the potential use of Ras and zzso zzso and zzso agents as therapeutic zzso for human liver zzso
