The influences of zzso drugs on zzso cells remain incompletely zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso agents in experimental zzso models and analyzed vessel zzso in clinical zzso tumor zzso zzso (20 to 500 zzso zzso (4 to 100 zzso and zzso zzso to 4 zzso drugs commonly involved in zzso therapy zzso induced zzso effects in different zzso zzso They enhanced zzso cell tube formation, zzso cell zzso from zzso formation of tip cells in the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso All three drugs increased global cellular zzso zzso levels, including the zzso molecules protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso or zzso upstream of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso cell tube zzso Moreover, the investigated zzso dose zzso induced vessel formation in the chick zzso membrane zzso zzso samples from seven high-risk patients with zzso were analyzed for vessel density by zzso zzso revealed that zzso samples taken after chemotherapy consistently showed an enhanced zzso density compared with the corresponding samples taken before zzso In conclusion, our data show that chemotherapy can activate zzso cells by inducing multiple zzso signaling pathways and exert zzso effects in zzso and in zzso Moreover, we report a previously zzso clinical phenomenon that might, in part, be explained by our experimental zzso zzso enhanced vessel formation in tumors from patients with zzso
