zzso levels of fatty acids extracted from zzso zzso zzso free fatty acids zzso and zzso were measured after central fluid percussion traumatic brain injury zzso in zzso At 5 zzso after injury, there was a decrease in fatty acids extracted from zzso suggesting a decrease in zzso At the same time point, total zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid were significantly decreased in zzso while at the same time zzso and zzso acids increased in zzso in zzso zzso zzso No significant zzso in zzso fatty acids or zzso were observed at 20 zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso were significantly elevated at 5 and 20 zzso after injury in zzso zzso In general, these zzso were blunted by zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso signal zzso zzso is activated in the zzso at the onset of central fluid percussion zzso and that the enhanced zzso zzso zzso breakdown of zzso is a major mechanism of liberation of zzso in these sites immediately after such zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in animals treated with zzso suggests that zzso of zzso receptors significantly contributes to the zzso C zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso rats suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributes to increased zzso metabolism and/or zzso zzso
