zzso is the primary zzso of bone that is characterized by a potent capacity to invade locally and cause distant zzso and is therefore associated with poor zzso zzso further shows a zzso for zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is a small zzso in the zzso family of growth factors that is associated with the disease status and outcome of zzso However, the effect of zzso on cell zzso in human zzso cells is mostly zzso Here, we found that human zzso cell lines had significantly higher cell zzso and zzso expression compared to normal zzso We also found that zzso increased cell zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso also promoted zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso enhances the migration and invasion activity of zzso cells by increasing zzso expression through a signal zzso zzso that involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus represents a promising new target for treating zzso zzso
