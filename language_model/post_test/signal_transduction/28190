zzso receptors zzso play a fundamental role in the recognition of bacteria and zzso zzso is activated by viral zzso and zzso acid zzso a synthetic zzso of viral zzso We show that zzso cells, known for their capacity to eliminate zzso infected cells, express zzso and zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Treatment of highly zzso zzso cells with zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation also leads to zzso of zzso marker zzso on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells respond to zzso by producing zzso zzso like zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso production by zzso cells was preceded by zzso of zzso We conclude that the ability of zzso cells to directly recognize and respond to viral products is important in mounting effective zzso zzso
