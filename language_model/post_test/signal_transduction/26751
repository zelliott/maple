Although our recent report demonstrates the essential involvement of zzso of a regulator of zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation in the zzso psychological zzso the exact mechanisms of regulation of zzso zzso expression by zzso have not yet been zzso This study attempted to clarify these mechanisms using mouse cerebral cortical zzso An zzso for zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso following its zzso increase without zzso zzso zzso (a zzso C zzso zzso (an zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso (a zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso examinations showed that zzso increased expression of both zzso and zzso in nucleus as well as enhanced zzso of both zzso and zzso complex to nucleus from zzso In addition, zzso directly recruited binding of both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso promoter zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via increased zzso of zzso as well as zzso in zzso zzso calcium signaling zzso zzso
