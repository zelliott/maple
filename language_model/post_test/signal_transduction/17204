The zzso growth zzso zzso and its receptors play an important role in transformation and progression of several zzso zzso of this zzso have been developed and evaluated but generally performed poorly in clinical trials, and several drug candidates have been zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been described as a potent and selective zzso inhibitor and is currently undergoing clinical zzso We investigated zzso activity in panels of human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso but found no effects on the zzso or expression of zzso Nor was the zzso activity of zzso related to the presence or spontaneous zzso of zzso However, its activity correlated with that of known zzso zzso and it zzso zzso assembly at zzso zzso also achievable in zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso and an equilibrium between the two has previously been zzso zzso could thus potentially act as a zzso for the continuous generation of low doses of zzso Interestingly, zzso also inhibited downstream signaling from zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso This effect is associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rather than the zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso observed following treatment with the zzso zzso in zzso result from zzso zzso zzso or indirectly by spontaneous zzso zzso rather than any effect on zzso It is also suggested that zzso should be used as a reference compound in all future studies on zzso
