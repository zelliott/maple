zzso zzso is activated by transforming growth zzso zzso in diabetic zzso and has important roles in fibrosis, zzso and cell survival in zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso zzso by zzso are not fully zzso Here we show that zzso activates zzso in zzso zzso cells by inducing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which target zzso zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso These zzso are located within the second zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter was activated by zzso and zzso through zzso mechanisms, as shown zzso zzso zzso by these zzso led to zzso zzso cell survival and zzso which were similar to the effects of zzso by zzso These studies reveal a mechanism of zzso zzso through zzso zzso by two zzso which are regulated by upstream zzso and zzso Due to the diversity of zzso function, this zzso circuit may have key roles, not only in kidney disorders, but also in other zzso
