Previously, we found that zzso zzso promoted zzso of human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso deprived of growth zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of zzso and its mechanism of action on zzso and zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso growth zzso zzso which promotes zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso tube formation by promoting zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso elevated the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso oxide zzso and increased the activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in promoting zzso under this zzso Moreover, when zzso zzso was inhibited by its specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not elevate zzso and NO levels in zzso The data suggest that zzso is a new zzso of zzso in zzso and it might function by increasing the activity of zzso zzso and zzso subsequently zzso the levels of zzso and NO in zzso The findings of this study provide a new small zzso for investigating the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso
