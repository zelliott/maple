One of the proposed functions of zzso acid zzso formation from zzso D zzso zzso in zzso is to promote zzso induced by zzso zzso The present study shows that the time course and dose response of PA formation and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also exhibited different dose response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity with an zzso value of zzso zzso in zzso and 107 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It required higher zzso of zzso to inhibit zzso than to inhibit zzso activity induced by zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso activity but it inhibited the release of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso These results demonstrate differential regulation of zzso activity and zzso of primary zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
