zzso diabetes is one of the fastest growing public health problems worldwide resulting from both environmental and genetic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso could result in reversal of the impairment of zzso zzso disposal in genetically obese zzso rats via exercise zzso This improvement of insulin resistance was associated with an zzso of circulating zzso to zzso the zzso insulin signaling zzso including downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In insulin resistant rats, zzso treatment zzso on the insulin zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade and subsequent zzso zzso transport trafficking on skeletal muscle, which were all suppressed by zzso zzso In addition, induction of insulin resistance by the intake of high zzso is more rapid in zzso knockout mice than in zzso zzso zzso in insulin sensitivity through the peripheral zzso zzso overcoming defects related to the zzso in zzso zzso step have been zzso zzso zzso zzso especially of the zzso may provide merits in the zzso of defective insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C serves as a factor that zzso with peripheral zzso zzso and insulin signals for zzso zzso The developments call new insights into the chemical compounds and/or herbal products that might enhance zzso zzso zzso and/or stimulate zzso in peripheral zzso zzso to serve as potential agents or zzso for helping the zzso zzso In the present review, we update these topics and discuss the concept of targeting peripheral zzso zzso for the treatment of insulin zzso
