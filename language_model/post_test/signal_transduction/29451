zzso analysis of zzso networks is a growing field in zzso and systems zzso The availability of an increasing amount of biological data from molecular biological networks promises a deeper understanding but confronts researchers with the problem of zzso zzso The amount of qualitative network data is growing much faster than the amount of quantitative data, such as zzso zzso In many cases it is even impossible to measure quantitative data because of limitations of experimental methods, or for ethical zzso Thus, a huge amount of qualitative data, such as interaction data, is available, but it was not sufficiently used for modeling purposes, until zzso New approaches have been developed, but the complexity of data often limits the application of many of the zzso zzso zzso nets make it possible to explore zzso and dynamic qualitative system zzso One zzso net approach is model validation based on the zzso of the system's zzso properties, focusing on zzso zzso zzso to zzso which describe the basic system zzso increasing system complexity, the basic behavior can only be expressed by a huge number of zzso According to our validation criteria for zzso zzso zzso the necessary zzso of the biological meaning, by interpreting each zzso zzso zzso is not possible zzso Thus, an zzso biologically meaningful zzso would be helpful in analyzing zzso and supporting the understanding of the basic behavior of the considered biological zzso 

Here, we introduce a new approach to automatically zzso zzso to cope with network zzso We apply zzso techniques such as zzso Complete zzso Single zzso and zzso Joining in combination with different distance measures to get biologically meaningful clusters zzso which can be interpreted as zzso To find the optimal number of zzso to consider for zzso the cluster zzso measure, zzso zzso is zzso 

We considered two different case studies as examples: a small signal zzso zzso zzso response zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso gene regulatory network zzso regulation of zzso muscular zzso We automatically classified the zzso into functionally distinct zzso which could be interpreted biologically as functional zzso in the zzso We found differences in the suitability of the various distance measures as well as the zzso zzso In terms of a biologically meaningful zzso of zzso the best results are obtained using the zzso distance zzso Considering zzso methods, the obtained results suggest that zzso and Complete zzso are suitable for zzso zzso with respect to the biological zzso 

We propose a new approach for the biological zzso of zzso net zzso based on cluster zzso Due to the biologically meaningful data reduction and structuring of network zzso large sets of zzso can be zzso allowing for model validation of qualitative zzso zzso zzso This approach can also be applied to elementary mode zzso
