Although recent studies indicate that zzso zzso factor zzso plays an important role in zzso synaptic zzso the underlying signaling mechanisms remain largely zzso Here, we have characterized the signaling events that mediate the zzso zzso of zzso synaptic zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the three signaling pathways known to mediate zzso signaling in other zzso In zzso zzso zzso application of zzso rapidly activated zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso greatly attenuated synaptic fatigue at zzso zzso induced by a train of zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso but not zzso prevented the zzso zzso of zzso synaptic zzso zzso zzso a close relative of zzso did not activate zzso or zzso and had no effect on synaptic fatigue in the zzso zzso Neither zzso which activated zzso but not zzso zzso nor zzso zzso factor zzso which activated zzso but not zzso affected zzso synaptic zzso Treatment of the slices with zzso together with zzso still had no effect on synaptic zzso Thus, although the zzso of zzso and zzso is required, the two together are not sufficient to mediate the zzso zzso zzso of new protein synthesis by zzso or zzso did not prevent the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso transmission is independent of protein synthesis but requires zzso and zzso and yet another signaling zzso to act together in the zzso
