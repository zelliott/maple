In the search of zzso zzso zzso fragments were examined for both zzso and zzso actions on zzso zzso zzso In a zzso cell culture system from the embryonic zzso zzso zzso was capable of inducing cell proliferation in a similar manner to zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso Near zzso zzso were needed for the zzso action of zzso which seems to argue against a role for zzso as a main zzso for growth zzso In the zzso organ culture system of embryonic chick zzso stimulation and calcium zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso produced, at a concentration of zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso synthesis and an zzso increase in calcium zzso and was zzso less active than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no significant zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso retains the ability to induce cell proliferation and exhibits partial zzso activity in the zzso signal zzso zzso
