The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the inflamed gut has mainly been associated with zzso degradation and zzso However, their in zzso capacity to specifically cleave inflammatory zzso indicates that zzso may have a profound zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso modify zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells were exposed zzso to zzso zzso of activated zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso media were subjected to zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells from patients with colitis were examined by real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso induced the zzso (up to zzso but not zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso A similar zzso zzso response was obtained in the zzso zzso The principal zzso of these zzso effects was identified as the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso product of zzso zzso zzso basic protein zzso not previously identified in the zzso zzso against zzso inhibited the zzso zzso response by zzso and zzso zzso and protein were detected in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transcript and protein levels were low in the zzso and in isolated zzso cells from patients with Crohn's disease and from normal zzso but increased up to zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

These findings identify a novel zzso action of zzso in inflammation and suggest that zzso zzso zzso are required to achieve zzso zzso zzso immune zzso
