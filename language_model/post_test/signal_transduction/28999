The zzso gene encodes a family of peptides called zzso which are the natural zzso for the zzso zzso In humans and mice, zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso zzso indicating that zzso play a vital role in the regulation of zzso zzso In many species, centrally administered zzso stimulate zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, virtually all zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso the vast majority of zzso producing cells also express sex steroid zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso Thus, sex steroids are able to directly regulate the expression of zzso zzso implicating zzso as the zzso zzso between sex steroid feedback and zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso to various regions of the zzso in zzso primates and zzso In the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso and the zzso sex steroids inhibit the expression of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso here are the zzso for the negative feedback regulation of zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso sex steroids induce the expression of zzso zzso that these zzso zzso play a role in the positive feedback regulation of zzso zzso In zzso there are no zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso expression in the ARC is zzso immediately prior to the zzso zzso hormone zzso Thus, zzso zzso in the ARC of the zzso appear well placed to play a role in the negative and positive feedback regulation of zzso exerted by sex zzso
