The human zzso is unique in its capacity to zzso constantly throughout adult zzso zzso Although the processes of tissue damage and breakdown in the zzso have been well zzso little is known of how zzso zzso is achieved after zzso zzso a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso regulates the processes of pattern formation and differentiation that occur during early zzso zzso 

In this study, the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso was examined by zzso and zzso across the zzso cycle and in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were found to be expressed at high levels in both zzso and zzso cells during the zzso phase of the zzso zzso Although zzso for both proteins in surface and zzso zzso was maintained at relatively zzso levels across the cycle, their expression was significantly decreased within the zzso compartment by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as has previously been reported, was primarily restricted to zzso zzso and surrounding zzso during the late zzso and zzso zzso In line with recent studies that have shown that zzso zzso activity is zzso in many human zzso we found that zzso and zzso zzso increased dramatically in the transition from zzso Grade 1 to zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was low or absent in all cancer zzso 

The expression of zzso in normal and zzso zzso cells that lack zzso strongly supports an important role for this embryonic zzso in the tissue zzso events that occur across the zzso cycle and in zzso
