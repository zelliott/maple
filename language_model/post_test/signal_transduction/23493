The restoration of the zzso functions and the zzso zzso may be achieved in old mice by some zzso zzso or nutritional interventions zzso or zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso in old age is a phenomenon secondary to age-related zzso occurring in zzso zzso The targets for the zzso restoration may be hormone receptors and zzso strictly related to the presence of two nutritional factors, such as zzso and zzso which are in turn essential for the efficiency of zzso network both in zzso and zzso The effect of zzso is largely due to the presence of its specific receptors on cell membrane of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is required for zzso differentiation and maturation within the zzso zzso In this context, the role of zinc is pivotal because it is involved, through zzso finger zzso in the gene expression of zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also required for the biological action of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso the beneficial effect of zzso or zzso on zzso interaction in zzso can also occur via a better zinc pool zzso within the body where the capability of the zzso proteins zzso zzso in zinc release has a key zzso These findings suggest that zzso via zzso zzso can be a single zzso in modulating zzso interaction in zzso
