The novel zzso disease zzso drug, zzso zzso is a second generation of irreversible selective inhibitor of zzso zzso follows zzso In light of the recent large clinical study zzso III zzso reporting benefits in zzso patients, it has been suggested that zzso could be the first zzso treatment to receive the label zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso has been shown to have a broad zzso activity against a variety of zzso in zzso models of neurodegenerative diseases and in cultured zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the status of various molecular and zzso markers in the rat zzso following chronic treatments with zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated significant molecular changes induced by both drugs, at the protein and zzso levels, associated with zzso zzso cell survival and death zzso zzso stress, signaling system, and zzso of neurodegenerative disorders, which may be reflected in the clinical zzso
