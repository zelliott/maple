The conventional paradigm of T cell zzso through the zzso states that zzso plays a critical zzso role in this signaling zzso However, the T cell response to bacterial zzso does not require zzso In this study we report that not only is zzso zzso for T cell zzso by zzso but it actively zzso this signaling zzso zzso of zzso function, either by repression of zzso gene expression or by selective zzso zzso of zzso led to increased zzso production in response to zzso zzso This negative regulatory effect of zzso on zzso T cell responses required the zzso activity of zzso and correlated with early zzso zzso but was independent of zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso role of zzso in T cell signaling includes the zzso of a negative regulatory zzso of T cell zzso
