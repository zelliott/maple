To form the zzso axis of the zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso precursor cells, zzso and zzso divide zzso to generate one daughter with a zzso fate and one with a zzso zzso Genes governing this process include the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Normally, all of these regulators promote the zzso zzso Here we show that nuclear levels of a zzso zzso fusion protein are less abundant in the zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso asymmetry is lost in zzso zzso zzso regulation, but retained in zzso zzso We find that zzso is zzso for zzso defects and that zzso and zzso zzso display a strong genetic interaction in double zzso zzso zzso is a zzso locus and may function together with zzso to control zzso zzso To identify other regulatory genes in this process, we screened for zzso resembling zzso Four such genes were identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso and shown to interact genetically with zzso However, only zzso promotes the zzso fate at the expense of the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso is a new key gene in this zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso may cooperate with zzso and zzso at multiple stages of zzso zzso
