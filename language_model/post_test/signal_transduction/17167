The current study sought to delineate the gene expression profile of the host response in the zzso and colon during acute infection with zzso zzso in a mouse model of infection, and to investigate the nature of the unfolded protein response in this zzso The infected mice displayed a significant zzso in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso numerous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and a number of zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso of zzso This was accompanied by a significant influx of zzso zzso cells, cells of the zzso lineage and all major zzso of zzso to these zzso However, zzso T cells of the zzso and zzso mice expressed similar levels of zzso and zzso Neither tissue had zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso and zzso of the infected mice showed a significant increase in zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso but neither the zzso of zzso nor the zzso of zzso zzso zzso casting doubt on the full-fledged induction of the unfolded protein response by zzso They also displayed significantly higher zzso of zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso an indication of zzso zzso These data underscore the local, zzso zzso nature of the response to zzso and highlight zzso zzso and the zzso axis as two of the pathways that could be used to contain and counteract the damage inflicted on the zzso zzso
