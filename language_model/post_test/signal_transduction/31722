The zzso zzso is activated in many zzso therefore, we investigated zzso a dual zzso zzso zzso was more potent than either the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso in blocking zzso zzso zzso decreases protein translation, and zzso zzso zzso showed that the drug induced robust recruitment of zzso to zzso and a near absence of binding of zzso zzso also decreased expression of other proteins known to be regulated by zzso including zzso B1 and D1 and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso also decreased the level of zzso but not zzso As zzso has been associated with adaptation to hypoxic stress, we examined the effect of the drug on cell survival in low zzso zzso zzso increased killing of cells under zzso measured by short-term zzso and long-term zzso zzso To understand the underlying zzso we examined zzso effect on the expression of factors associated with cell zzso Under zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased within an hour of zzso treatment, but then increased by 24 zzso In contrast, under zzso zzso caused prolonged suppression of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, there was greater zzso zzso in hypoxic cells than in zzso cells, consistent with increased zzso zzso increased zzso as measured by zzso to zzso conversion under both zzso and hypoxic conditions, but our data indicate that this is actually a zzso zzso In conclusion, we have found that zzso blocks zzso induction by decreasing protein translation and increases cell killing under zzso likely by increasing zzso
