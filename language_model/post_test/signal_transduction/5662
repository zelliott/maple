zzso has recently emerged as an important zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso and a variety of other benefits in the cardiovascular system and zzso The mechanisms by which it accomplishes these functions remain largely zzso To characterize the dose response and corresponding cardiac zzso of transient systemic zzso of zzso we assessed the time course of zzso as well as the zzso zzso and associated functional changes in rat hearts following acute exposure to zzso in zzso zzso systemic zzso zzso resulted in: zzso rapid formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso moderate short-term changes in cardiac zzso zzso zzso a pronounced increase in selective manifestations of long-term zzso stress as evidenced by cardiac zzso zzso zzso long after changes in zzso zzso had zzso zzso lasting reductions in zzso zzso zzso and remarkably zzso zzso zzso which both followed a complex zzso zzso and zzso significant zzso protein modifications (including zzso revealed by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins included those involved in metabolism zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso B), zzso regulation zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso function zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso protein zzso A zzso protein zzso 2A A zzso Thus, brief zzso in plasma zzso trigger a concerted zzso response characterized by persistent changes in cardiac zzso zzso stress, and zzso in zzso zzso These findings help zzso possible mechanisms of zzso zzso and have implications for zzso dosing in therapeutic zzso
