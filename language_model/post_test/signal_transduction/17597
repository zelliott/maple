The zzso mating zzso a and alpha factors, bind to specific G zzso receptors in zzso cells and bring about both growth arrest in the early zzso phase of the cell cycle and differentiation into mating capable zzso This zzso an increase in zzso influx leading to elevated zzso calcium zzso which has been shown to be essential for subsequent downstream events and the mating process itself zzso We have characterized the alpha factor induced increase in cellular zzso in wild type zzso zzso and in the zzso cell division cycle zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso at the zzso border at the zzso zzso We observed a 2-4 fold increase in the initial zzso of zzso influx in alpha zzso zzso cells and in zzso and zzso cells grown at the zzso zzso zzso influx was energy dependent, inhibited by membrane zzso and slightly increased by zzso Furthermore, zzso influx was sensitive to both zzso and zzso zzso but was unaffected by zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that budding zzso possesses a regulated zzso transport zzso the zzso of which is dependent upon exit out of the cell cycle and growth zzso This transport mechanism has many similarities to that observed in zzso zzso zzso
