zzso zzso receptors zzso from group III reduce zzso zzso Because these receptors reduce zzso levels, we explored whether this signaling zzso contributes to release zzso caused by zzso with low affinity for zzso zzso In zzso experiments with the population of zzso nerve terminals we find that zzso (1 zzso inhibited the zzso release of zzso by zzso This zzso effect was largely prevented by the zzso toxin but was insensitive to zzso of protein zzso C zzso and protein zzso A zzso Furthermore, this zzso was associated with reduction in zzso zzso channel activity in the absence of any zzso change in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso however, zzso decreased the levels of zzso The zzso of this additional signaling zzso was very efficient in zzso the zzso of zzso release induced either by zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging experiments to measure zzso dynamics in single nerve terminals showed that zzso strongly reduced the zzso response in zzso of the nerve zzso Moreover, zzso experiments showed that zzso of the nerve terminals that were zzso to zzso were also zzso to the low affinity zzso zzso Then, zzso mediates the zzso of zzso release caused by 1 zzso zzso primarily by a strong zzso of zzso channels, although high zzso zzso the zzso ability to decrease zzso
