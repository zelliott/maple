The zzso protein is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in the early zzso specifically zzso signaling by the zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso This occurs by a failure to activate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which codes for a zzso that generates active zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso directly regulates this gene by binding to the zzso zzso and that zzso expression can be partially rescued with a zzso zzso At a slightly later stage of development, zzso signaling recovers in zzso zzso but is unable to turn on expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso and zzso gene expression to an extent comparable to the zzso zzso whereas a zzso containing a 130 zzso acid deletion rescued zzso but not late zzso zzso A zzso zzso caused by the reduced zzso levels was also rescued more efficiently with the zzso zzso zzso than with this zzso zzso Our results indicate that separate parts of the zzso protein are required on different zzso and that the AT activity of zzso is zzso for certain aspects of zzso zzso We discuss the similarity of these results to the role of zzso in zzso signaling in the zzso
