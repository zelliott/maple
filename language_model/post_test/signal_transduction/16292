As early as 1964 it was suggested that simple diffusion of zzso away from their zzso source did not provide an adequate explanation for the formation and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso distribution models provides an explanation for the slow, directional movement of zzso as well as their ability to form zzso and zzso zzso independent of zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form stable, steep, long-range zzso that specify the polarity of the wing zzso The process of zzso is imperative to the two central themes in zzso zzso active transport zzso long-range signaling and degradation of zzso to sustain zzso zzso This review investigates the zzso processes of zzso degradation and zzso transport of zzso and zzso in the hope that a better understanding of the zzso system will contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive model for zzso zzso formation and zzso
