Our group has shown that the zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso are zzso for retinal zzso cells zzso in different animal zzso Protecting zzso from secondary zzso is a promising direction for therapy in glaucoma zzso The complete zzso nerve zzso zzso model can be used to study primary zzso of zzso while the partial zzso nerve zzso zzso model can be used to study secondary zzso of zzso because primary zzso of zzso and secondary zzso can be separated in location in the same zzso in this zzso in other situations, these types of zzso can be difficult to zzso In order to examine which kind of zzso zzso could zzso both zzso and zzso models were used in this zzso zzso were fed with zzso or vehicle daily from 7 days before surgery until sacrifice at different zzso and the surviving numbers of zzso were zzso The expression of several proteins related to zzso zzso stress, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways were detected with zzso zzso zzso did not delay primary zzso of zzso after either zzso or zzso but it did delay secondary zzso of zzso after zzso We found that zzso appeared to exert these protective effects by zzso zzso stress and the zzso zzso and by zzso increasing production of zzso growth zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso can delay secondary zzso of zzso and this effect may be linked to zzso of zzso stress and the zzso zzso in the zzso
