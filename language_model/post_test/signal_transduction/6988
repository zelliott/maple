zzso cell migration is critical for normal development, tissue repair and cancer zzso zzso of the zzso lateral line zzso zzso generates the zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso This migration is promoted by the leader cells at the leading edge of the zzso which express the G zzso zzso zzso zzso and respond to the zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso signaling regulates zzso migration remains zzso Here we report that signal zzso by the zzso G protein zzso zzso is essential for proper zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso and zzso depletion of zzso but not zzso resulted in an arrest of zzso zzso In zzso deficient for zzso the zzso cells migrated in an zzso fashion and were unable to extend zzso at the leading front, zzso those in zzso deficient for zzso or zzso A transplantation zzso showed that, like zzso zzso is required only in the leader cells of the zzso Analysis of zzso dynamics in the zzso revealed that whereas zzso leader cells display extensive zzso zzso in the direction of zzso migration, counterparts defective for zzso zzso or zzso do zzso Finally, zzso experiments revealed that zzso and zzso interact genetically in regulating zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso controls migration of the zzso likely by acting downstream of the zzso zzso This study also provides compelling evidence for functional specificity among zzso zzso in zzso
