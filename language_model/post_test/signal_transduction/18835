zzso was originally identified as a potential Ras zzso and zzso is an alternatively spliced zzso Both share a zzso association domain zzso zzso but only zzso contains sequence motifs that predict zzso domain binding and zzso zzso binding in the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso binds to zzso and zzso through the zzso domain and that zzso interacts with active Ras in the presence of zzso zzso interference against zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by T cell zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso is also required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter activity in T zzso We also provide evidence that zzso of zzso also zzso polarized zzso of Ras at the B zzso cell immune zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso recruits active Ras to the zzso cell interface and mediates the interaction between Ras and zzso
