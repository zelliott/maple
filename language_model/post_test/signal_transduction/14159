zzso cell lung cancer zzso is the leading cause of zzso deaths zzso Within the molecular scope of zzso a complex landscape of zzso cellular signaling has emerged, defined largely by zzso in select zzso of signal zzso including the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso become zzso activated and targets for zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso of these pathways have shown promise in clinical trials or are approved for clinical zzso However, many protein zzso are zzso in zzso without genetic zzso To zzso differences in tumor cell signaling that are transparent to zzso methods, we established a zzso internal standard derived from zzso cell lines grown in zzso and labeled with heavy zzso and zzso and deployed them in a zzso zzso We identified zzso and zzso zzso sites in two separate zzso Relative zzso of zzso abundance between tumor samples allowed for the determination of specific hubs and pathways differing between each zzso Sites downstream of Ras showed decreased zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso in one tumor versus zzso In this way, we were able to zzso access zzso zzso signaling in primary human zzso 

Through the use of quantitative zzso we demonstrated the feasibility and coverage that large scale mass zzso can leverage for understanding zzso networks in zzso By incorporating zzso based zzso into a typical pathology zzso we were able to access and compare tumors from multiple patients in this analysis with high accuracy and dynamic zzso We analyzed tumors from patients diagnosed with zzso cell lung cancer and were able to detect comprehensive zzso networks relaying through known hubs of zzso in lung zzso We hereby show that it is possible to track changes to zzso networks across multiple tumors, opening up the possibility that drug zzso and zzso zzso can be implemented downstream of classical zzso
