zzso zzso cells in the anterior zzso zzso appear to have zzso zzso zzso cells connect to each other at gap junctions and thereby form a zzso and functional zzso We have performed a series of studies on network formation in zzso cells and recently reported that zzso cells markedly prolong their zzso processes and form numerous zzso with neighboring zzso cells in the presence of zzso an zzso zzso zzso component of the basement zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this extension of zzso cell zzso processes under the influence of zzso and found that zzso promoted stress fiber formation within zzso zzso Next, we noted that formation of stress fibers in zzso cells was zzso by zzso a zzso zzso that binds zzso and soluble factors via their zzso zzso zzso We then observed that expressions of zzso and zzso (a zzso bundling protein that zzso zzso stress fibers in zzso zzso were zzso by zzso Using specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso Our findings suggest that zzso cells received a signal from zzso interaction, which resulted in zzso changes, and that the formation of a zzso and functional network in zzso cells was zzso by a zzso mechanism in the presence of zzso
