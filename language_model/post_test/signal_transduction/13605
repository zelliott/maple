zzso responses to motion can be to the onset zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are critical for achieving zzso zzso zzso of On zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both On and Off zzso however, zzso zzso is expressed in On zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso exhibit decreased tuning of On directional motion zzso These results correlate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses to motion, shedding light on the development of visual pathways that use the same cell types for divergent zzso
