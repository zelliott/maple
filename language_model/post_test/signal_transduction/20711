B cells get help from T cells by acting as zzso zzso A signal from the B cell zzso zzso is not required for efficient zzso presentation or for the B cell response to T cell zzso T cells provide help by making zzso some of which, like zzso zzso remain T zzso and require cell contact for zzso The function of class II zzso is to induce help in the T cell, rather than to deliver help to the B zzso T cell help uses different zzso signaling pathways from those engaged by the B cell zzso zzso
