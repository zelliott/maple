In our continuing search to discover zzso compounds from natural products, we isolated six new zzso zzso zzso A to zzso from zzso zzso and examined their zzso activities in human zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso All of these compounds displayed effective zzso activity using zzso B zzso and induced cell zzso by a terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso The data demonstrated that zzso C was the most effective compound among these zzso zzso zzso C induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso while zzso of zzso protein zzso (short zzso suggesting that these zzso family member proteins may play a role on zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso C also induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Bid zzso and zzso of executor zzso However, zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso almost completely inhibited zzso zzso Bid zzso without any modification of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso cascade only played a minor role in the zzso zzso Taken together, it is suggested that zzso zzso zzso is predominantly through the zzso of intrinsic zzso pathways by causing the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein and zzso of zzso and zzso
