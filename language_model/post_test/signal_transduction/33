zzso growth zzso domain 7 zzso is a zzso factor implicated in cellular responses such as cell migration and blood vessel zzso however the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso are largely zzso Here we have identified zzso receptors of the zzso family as zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to a region in zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso thus acting as an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in neural stem cells zzso in zzso decreased zzso zzso and consequently, reduced proliferation and zzso of zzso Such altered zzso zzso caused a shift in the differentiation pattern of cultured zzso towards an excess of zzso and zzso We identified zzso as a source of zzso in the brain, suggesting that zzso zzso acts as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso that regulates proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso adult zzso
