The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in growth factor and zzso signaling zzso Previous studies revealed that a fraction of zzso moves to focal contacts upon zzso engagement and that zzso binds to zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso characteristics zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we asked whether zzso complexes participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased upon zzso of zzso zzso onto specific zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso family protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso required functional zzso To further explore the role of zzso in zzso zzso we analyzed the responses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines to being zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso family zzso zzso zzso of several focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ability to spread on zzso were defective in zzso zzso zzso but were restored upon zzso zzso Our data suggest a zzso model in which, upon zzso engagement, zzso levels of zzso activity catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso thereby recruiting zzso to the plasma zzso where, perhaps by further zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive signals for downstream events such as zzso zzso and cell shape zzso
