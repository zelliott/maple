Recently, it has been shown that brain topical zzso of zzso zzso at zzso around 100 zzso zzso repetitive cortical spreading depressions zzso in zzso It has remained unclear whether this effect of zzso is related to a primary zzso effect, such as an increase in zzso zzso or induction of zzso calcium waves, or a zzso condition after zzso In zzso zzso regulates zzso communication via combined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso whereas it zzso zzso via single zzso of zzso zzso We have determined the zzso zzso profile and zzso signaling zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and concentration zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocked the occurrence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not increase the efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso receptors with the selective zzso zzso zzso did not trigger zzso The zzso C zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso occurrence in contrast to the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the induction of zzso calcium waves is unlikely the primary cause of zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso profile, likely primary targets of zzso zzso zzso are either zzso or vascular smooth muscle zzso
