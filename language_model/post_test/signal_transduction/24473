zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma is an important signaling zzso in cells of zzso origin, inducing differentiation and regulating cell proliferation in several cell types such as vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso arise from smooth muscle cells of the zzso zzso with an zzso rate as high as zzso in women of zzso zzso zzso signaling has not been characterized in these tumors, although zzso natural zzso zzso are known zzso of key biological functions in the normal zzso zzso and zzso cells isolated from a rat model for this disease were characterized by Western analysis and found to express all three zzso zzso suggesting that signaling pathways zzso by these receptors were intact in this tumor zzso In zzso experiments with a zzso cell line demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso This zzso effect was not observed with zzso or zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways were intact in zzso cells, in addition to growth zzso stimulation of zzso signaling also inhibited zzso gene zzso Human zzso were also found to express all three zzso zzso and primary cultures of these cells were sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso zzso is growth zzso and that this zzso is zzso at least in part by negative zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso
