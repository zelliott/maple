We studied the effects of zzso and zzso in smooth muscle cells from rat zzso zzso and human zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation in a zzso manner at zzso in the range from 10 to 50 zzso zzso added simultaneously with zzso prevented growth zzso The earliest event brought about by zzso in the signal zzso cascade controlling zzso cell growth was the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso alone was without effect but in combination with zzso prevented the zzso zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso C was inhibited by zzso and not by zzso which also in this case prevented the effect of zzso zzso A, a protein zzso zzso prevented the effect of zzso on protein zzso zzso The data can be rationalized by a model in which a zzso protein discriminates between zzso and zzso and zzso a cascade of events at the level of cell signal zzso that leads to the zzso of cell zzso
