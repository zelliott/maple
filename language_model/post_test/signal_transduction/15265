While zzso buffers are widely used to study calcium zzso no such tool exists for the other major second messenger, zzso zzso zzso 

Here we describe a genetically zzso buffer for zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso of targeting sequences permitted zzso of this zzso to the zzso zzso while tagging with zzso allowed zzso of its expression at the single cell zzso This construct (named zzso zzso was shown to selectively bind zzso in zzso Its expression significantly suppressed zzso zzso signals and the downstream zzso of zzso within the zzso as measured by zzso sensors in single living zzso Point zzso in the zzso zzso of the construct rendered the zzso unable to bind zzso in zzso or in zzso zzso zzso sponge was fruitfully applied to examine feedback regulation of gap zzso transfer of zzso in zzso cell zzso 

This newest member of the zzso zzso has the potential to reveal unique biological functions of zzso including insight into the functional significance of zzso signaling zzso
