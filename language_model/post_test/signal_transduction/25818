zzso is a well-established regulator of zzso activities; however, the role of its associated zzso is relatively zzso Previously, we have shown that human fetal zzso and zzso cells highly express zzso and that zzso I and IV significantly enhance their survival and zzso in addition, blocking zzso function in the fetal zzso cells decreased zzso on collagen I and increased zzso The present study investigates the effect of blocking zzso Using zzso blocking zzso or small interfering zzso the effects of zzso blockade were examined in isolated human fetal or adult zzso cells or zzso cells, cultured on zzso I or zzso In zzso zzso blockade was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso zzso function in human zzso or zzso cells resulted in significant decreases in cell function zzso zzso proliferation and zzso and insulin zzso primarily on collagen zzso A significant decrease in focal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso were observed on both zzso These effects were similar to changes after zzso zzso Interestingly, only zzso blockade reduced expression of zzso and members of its downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso demonstrating a specific effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso as well as zzso zzso interactions are critical for modulating zzso survival and function through specialized signaling zzso and enhance our understanding of how to improve zzso zzso for zzso treatments of zzso
