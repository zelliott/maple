Human zzso stem cells are primary zzso cells capable of zzso into several cell types including zzso when cultured under defined in zzso zzso In the present study we investigated the role of zzso signaling and its downstream zzso protein zzso A zzso and exchange protein directly activated by zzso zzso in zzso conversion of human zzso stem cells derived from zzso tissue zzso We show that zzso signaling involving the simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso signaling is critical for this process even in the presence of the strong zzso zzso insulin, zzso and zzso thereby clearly distinguishing the zzso cells from zzso zzso cell lines, where zzso together with zzso and insulin strongly promotes zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso may fully substitute for the zzso agent zzso zzso Moreover, selective zzso of zzso signaling promoted zzso differentiation when the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Unlike the case for zzso zzso cell lines, zzso fatty zzso like zzso acid, did not promote zzso differentiation of zzso cells in the absence of a zzso zzso However, prolonged treatment with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso differentiation of zzso cells in the presence of zzso Taken together our results emphasize the need for zzso signaling in concert with treatment with a zzso or zzso zzso to secure efficient zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso stem zzso
