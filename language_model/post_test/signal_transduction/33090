A significant increase in the expression and activity of tissue zzso zzso one of the zzso elements of zzso was observed during zzso of zzso zzso by treatment with either zzso zzso or zzso or by zzso The blood plasma concentration of zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also elevated in each of these zzso zzso was localized in cells of the cortical layer of the zzso and zzso double zzso revealed that the zzso appeared in the zzso zzso None of these observations could be made when zzso was induced by zzso zzso The lack of zzso activity in zzso cells was accompanied with a less organized zzso zzso Our data suggest that distinct zzso zzso which induce zzso within the same cell type, can zzso regulate the expression of zzso and this zzso may be involved in structural stabilization of the zzso zzso
