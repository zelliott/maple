Recovery of brain zzso has been associated with increased zzso and migration of zzso neural stem cells, zzso and zzso To understand the role of zzso signaling in these phenomena we studied zzso zzso of mouse brain zzso Our specific aims were to: zzso describe the zzso cell zzso appearing within the zzso and zzso evaluate the effect of zzso blockade on the injured zzso 

zzso mice were zzso and submitted to zzso zzso of the right zzso cortical zzso A group of mice was daily treated with zzso a dual zzso zzso zzso Mice were zzso 5 days after surgery and the injured area was studied with zzso for zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The injured zzso exhibited a large increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These markers appeared in different zzso zzso treatment reduced the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso protein and decreased the number of zzso cell zzso displaying zzso zzso 

Our observations suggest that zzso cells surrounding the zzso belong to a mixed population including zzso zzso and neural zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice probably reflect a decrease of zzso zzso with a still unknown effect on neural zzso zzso
