In zzso commitment of a cell to a sense organ precursor zzso fate requires zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a process that depends in most cases on the interplay of zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso A subset of zzso are selected by a recruitment zzso involving zzso signaling to zzso cells expressing the zzso gene zzso We show that zzso signaling drives recruitment by directly zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor that mediates zzso zzso and zzso protein itself bind zzso to adjacent zzso binding sites in an zzso zzso zzso is therefore contingent on the combined presence of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso Thus, zzso is the zzso control point targeted by zzso This exemplifies a simple and general mechanism for regulating the transition from competence to cell fate commitment zzso a cell signal directly targets the zzso of a zzso zzso
