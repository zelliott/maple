In cycling cells, the zzso protein zzso is zzso and/or zzso in early zzso and becomes zzso in late zzso The role of zzso and identity of the relevant zzso remains zzso We show here that zzso zzso associates with zzso in zzso and is therefore zzso zzso the zzso concentration of the zzso specific inhibitor zzso by transforming growth factor beta treatment of zzso results in zzso arrest and loss of zzso zzso with an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso arrest of zzso zzso cells results in loss of zzso zzso activity with continued zzso zzso activity and zzso remains only zzso Introduction of the zzso inhibitor zzso protein into cells by fusion to a protein zzso domain also prevents zzso zzso with an increase in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso in early zzso allowing continued zzso zzso
