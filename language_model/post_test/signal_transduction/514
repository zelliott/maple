zzso stress followed by abnormal zzso can play a critical role in the development of zzso high blood zzso cardiac zzso in heart failure zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell death have been observed in several experimental models, we investigated the possibility that zzso of nuclear zzso improves cardiac performance and delays transition from zzso zzso to zzso in a spontaneously zzso rat zzso model of zzso 

zzso were divided into two groups: one received no treatment zzso and the other zzso received 5 zzso zzso zzso orally for 46 zzso A third group was a zzso zzso control group zzso and a fourth was a zzso zzso group receiving zzso treatment 5 zzso zzso At the beginning of the study, zzso function was similar in both zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group at the end of the study, eccentric zzso with poor left zzso zzso zzso function was observed, while zzso inhibitor treatment preserved zzso zzso zzso Due to these zzso changes, the survival rate of zzso was significantly improved zzso zzso zzso by the administration of the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso inhibitor used did not affect the elevated blood pressure of zzso rats, but moderated the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso influenced all the measured zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pan zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that chronic zzso of zzso zzso long-term zzso changes in the most important zzso pathways related to zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevents zzso preserves zzso function, and delays transition of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso
