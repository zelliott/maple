Metal zzso in the brain helps promote zzso zzso deposition in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso targeting the interactions between metal and zzso is a potential therapeutic approach for zzso The metal zzso zzso zzso is thought to reduce zzso deposits in the zzso transgenic mouse brain, and zzso the clinical symptoms of zzso zzso However, whether oral administration of zzso reduces zinc zzso in zzso plaques and zzso the zzso zzso have not been properly established in zzso transgenic zzso By means of zzso analysis, we show for the first time that both the number and size of the zzso plaques were significantly reduced in the brain of zzso protein precursor zzso 1 zzso double transgenic mice treated with zzso (30 zzso orally for 2 zzso This was accompanied by a reduction in zzso burden in the zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment markedly reduced the expression levels of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso The present data indicate that zzso is able to reduce zinc zzso in the zzso plaques and inhibit zzso zzso processing in the zzso mouse zzso
