Protection of zzso zzso of the oral zzso zzso respiratory zzso and zzso tract from the constant challenge of pathogens is achieved by the combined barrier function of the lining zzso and specialized immune zzso Recent studies have indicated that zzso zzso has a pivotal role in the development of immune responses and in the tissue destruction and the subsequent repair processes associated with inflammatory zzso While expression of zzso is increased in immune zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells of inflamed zzso deciphering the specific functions of zzso has been zzso In part, this is due to the broad range of biological activities of zzso that are zzso by multiple receptors which recognize several signaling motifs whose activities are influenced by zzso modifications and zzso processing of zzso zzso the role of zzso in zzso inflammation is further complicated by its contributions to the barrier function of the lining zzso and the complexity of the specialized zzso immune zzso In an attempt to provide some insights into the involvement of zzso in zzso diseases, this review summarizes current knowledge of the biological activities of zzso involved in the development of inflammatory responses and in wound healing, and indicates how these activities may affect the protection of zzso zzso
