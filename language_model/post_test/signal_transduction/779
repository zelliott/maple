We have examined zzso zzso cell death in zzso cells and evaluated the relationships that exist between zzso of zzso activity and the signaling mechanisms and pathways of zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso light, either with or without zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the more selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine zzso in zzso cell size, plasma membrane potential zzso zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso of zzso 3, 8, and 9 and the zzso protein Bid was determined by Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in characteristic zzso within 6 h after treatment and zzso of cells with zzso blocked these zzso In contrast, zzso of the cells with the more selective zzso zzso under conditions that effectively blocked DNA degradation and inhibited zzso 3 and 8 processing as well as Bid zzso had little protective effect on the other zzso characteristics zzso Thus, both intrinsic and zzso pathways are activated during zzso zzso in zzso cells and this zzso appears to assure cell death during selective zzso zzso
