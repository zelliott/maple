zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been frequently employed in Traditional Chinese Medicine zzso as and zzso therapy to enhance blood circulation and zzso zzso 

Previously, we identified a novel zzso action of a crude extract from zzso zzso zzso which also suppressed zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso the current investigation intended to zzso potential active zzso of this herb and mechanisms of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso the zzso zzso zzso level, zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding were evaluated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, while efficacy of agents was assessed in a stable cell line containing a green fluorescent protein zzso reporter driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis were employed for chemical characterization zzso 

An extract of zzso zzso zzso lacking the insulin zzso compound, zzso zzso and termed the zzso fraction zzso consisting of zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression in the presence of an insulin zzso zzso zzso suggesting the action of this fraction is independent of the insulin zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso were prevented by the zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding were also inhibited by the zzso in zzso zzso Hence zzso zzso both signaling pathways that induce zzso gene zzso 

In conclusion, the current study proposes that the potent zzso activity on zzso gene zzso observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to at least two distinct zzso namely zzso and zzso
