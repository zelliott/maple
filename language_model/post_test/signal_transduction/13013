The combined effects of increased zzso signaling by zzso Y zzso and decreased signaling by zzso are hypothesized to stimulate food intake when body fat stores are zzso To investigate zzso role in the zzso response to uncontrolled diabetes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline vehicle was given to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso diabetes increased mean daily food intake to plateau values 50% above baseline intake zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso an effect that was not seen in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso despite comparably elevated levels of plasma zzso and comparably decreased levels of body weight, fat content, and plasma zzso Unlike the impaired feeding response to uncontrolled diabetes, zzso mice exhibit intact zzso responses to zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso To investigate whether differences in zzso zzso signaling can explain this zzso we used in zzso zzso to compare the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased by both zzso and zzso but the increase in zzso was small zzso compared with the effect of zzso zzso zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso also lowered zzso zzso levels by zzso in the ARC of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso but by only zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso significantly lowered zzso zzso levels in both zzso We conclude that zzso is required for both the increase of food intake and the decrease of zzso zzso gene expression induced by uncontrolled zzso In contrast, zzso is not required for either of these responses when the stimulus is food zzso Moreover, zzso is a more potent stimulus to zzso zzso gene expression than is zzso zzso central nervous system zzso signaling appears to be suppressed more effectively by zzso than by uncontrolled diabetes, which provides a plausible explanation for differences in the feeding response to these two stimuli in mice lacking zzso
