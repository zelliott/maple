zzso are important zzso cellular components and are classically considered as zzso of cell growth and zzso Recently zzso have been also implicated in cell zzso Now it appears that zzso are zzso regulators of cellular functions, promoting proliferation or cell death depending on the cell type and on environmental zzso This review draws a picture about the role of zzso in zzso pathways related to zzso cell death and the proposed molecular targets of these zzso at the level of the zzso zzso Solid evidence indicates that zzso may affect the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by modulating zzso c release from zzso and zzso of zzso Recently, zzso have been also implicated in the regulation of the zzso phase of zzso during which upstream zzso signal zzso pathways are zzso The studies reviewed here suggest that zzso may participate in zzso involving interaction with signal zzso pathways and zzso of proteins that may control cell death or cell zzso
