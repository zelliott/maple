The functional activity of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso zzso stimulation and zzso zzso It was of interest to determine if functionally active zzso could be zzso on a zzso zzso cell zzso We report the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha beta zzso on the cell surface of a zzso cell line, zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the alpha and beta zzso was expressed in zzso The alpha or beta zzso was expressed at lower levels after zzso with the alpha or beta zzso zzso zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso zzso but not zzso of alpha or beta alone, was sufficient to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso with this zzso zzso on the zzso cells possesses the zzso zzso defined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso marks the conversion of zzso from the low to high zzso state on peripheral blood T zzso zzso and is zzso present on activated cell zzso In contrast to zzso on zzso the functional activity of zzso on zzso cells was not influenced by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the use of agents that interfere with zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso or the combination of a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso did not affect the binding of zzso cells expressing zzso to zzso zzso
