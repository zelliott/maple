In order to probe the events which couple zzso occupancy to zzso of zzso free zzso fast laser scanning of zzso zzso was used to determine the timing of the initial phase of the zzso zzso This approach demonstrated that there was a measurable delay between the addition of stimulus and the onset of the zzso free zzso signal which varied from cell to cell variable from 75 zzso to greater than zzso zzso The distribution of lag times was similar to that expected if the delay resulted from a series of obligatory zzso zzso From the zzso zzso a probability density function for the delays was generated which depended on zzso the number of zzso events in the series, and zzso the zzso rate for the zzso The best fit between the data and theory was found to be for six zzso steps in the series occurring with a zzso rate similar to that expected for diffusion of known small molecular weight zzso molecules within the zzso zzso therefore, propose that the delays in onset of the zzso response in zzso were the result of sequence of diffusion steps, each with sufficiently small numbers of zzso zzso molecules to generate zzso zzso
