The zzso segments of classic zzso molecules such as zzso do not show structural similarity to any known signaling zzso This suggests that their effects on signaling responses must be exerted indirectly through associated zzso In contrast, many zzso protein zzso zzso zzso possess zzso segments with zzso to cell zzso molecules linked directly to zzso segments zzso one or two protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso have the potential for direct zzso of zzso function through engagement of the zzso segment, suggesting they could be direct signal zzso of cell contact zzso In the past few years, some zzso have been shown to effect zzso zzso directly via zzso binding or indirectly by association with known cell zzso zzso In addition, zzso have been localized to points of zzso or zzso zzso indicating their potential to regulate these zzso
