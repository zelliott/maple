zzso stress is a threat to our zzso zzso zzso Failure to repair DNA zzso properly after the induction of cell proliferation arrest can lead to zzso or large-scale zzso zzso Because such changes may have zzso potential, damaged cells are often eliminated via zzso Loss of this zzso response is actually one of the hallmarks of zzso zzso the effort to zzso the DNA zzso signaling steps leading to these biological events, an easily accessible model system is required, where the acquired knowledge can reveal the mechanisms underlying more complex zzso zzso evidence coming from studies in zzso zzso point to its usefulness as zzso In the zzso zzso DNA damage can induce both cell cycle arrest and zzso two responses that are zzso zzso The latter is a tightly controlled process that is genetically indistinguishable from zzso programmed cell zzso zzso of the central death machinery, components of the DNA damage signaling cascade lie and act either as sensors of the zzso or as zzso of the initial signal zzso This review summarizes the findings of several studies that specify the elements of the DNA zzso responses, as components of the cell cycle control machinery, the repairing process or the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso as a tool to further dissect the complex signaling network of these responses and the high potential for it to reveal important links to cancer and other genetic abnormalities are zzso
