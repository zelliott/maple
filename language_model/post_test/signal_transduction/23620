In recent years, targeted agents have rapidly evolved as effective tools in the clinical management of a broad range of zzso zzso These agents disrupt molecular mechanisms and signaling zzso that drive the zzso zzso in defined zzso of zzso Beyond the intended cellular targets crucial to tumor growth and zzso these agents also affect signal zzso in normal cells and zzso The resulting adverse events and their clinical management continue to change, as newer agents with an ever-increasing target spectrum are zzso We provide a zzso overview of zzso zzso arising from the targeting of zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso insights into the zzso involved and the use of this knowledge base to alleviate zzso adverse events are zzso
