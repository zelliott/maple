Previous studies have shown that transforming growth zzso zzso stimulates protein zzso C zzso via a mechanism that is independent of zzso C or zzso zzso but involves a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs at 12 h and requires new gene zzso To understand the signaling pathways involved, resting zone zzso were incubated with zzso and zzso activity was inhibited with zzso zzso or zzso zzso incorporation was zzso indicating that zzso mediates the effects of zzso on zzso zzso However, there was little, if any, effect on zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso alkaline zzso was zzso indicating that these responses to the growth factor are not regulated via zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso production which was further increased by zzso zzso The increase was regulated by zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso effects on zzso and zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso acid also inhibited zzso increases in zzso The effects of zzso on zzso involve zzso mechanisms, but not regulation of existing zzso zzso since no direct effect of the growth factor on plasma membrane or zzso zzso zzso was zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso its effects on zzso production through zzso but its effects on alkaline zzso are zzso by production of zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso also decreases zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso stimulates alkaline zzso through its zzso zzso whereas zzso signaling causes a decrease in zzso Thus, there is zzso between the two zzso
