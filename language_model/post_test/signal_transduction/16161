The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated by means of infrared zzso zzso zzso and zzso infrared zzso zzso under different conditions in an attempt to mimic biological situations encountered in communication between bacteria for zzso zzso The zzso molecular zzso was studied in the zzso that zzso to a zzso situation somewhat analogous to that encountered in the zzso The simulation of the zzso spectrum of the isolated zzso was then conducted by means of quantum chemistry calculations in zzso In the case of the neutral species, the zzso zzso were recorded in zzso mimicking the zzso and zzso media as well as in zzso that is often used for simulation of cell zzso The interpretation was conducted by considering a zzso zzso in its zzso or zzso zzso zzso to, respectively, six zzso and four zzso zzso A satisfying agreement with the experimental zzso studies conducted in solution at room temperature was obtained as long as a zzso zzso model was added to the explicit zzso zzso
