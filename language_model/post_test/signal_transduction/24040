The tumor zzso gene zzso which is frequently zzso in human zzso encodes a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso germ cells zzso which are the embryonic precursors of zzso are the source of zzso zzso To zzso the zzso signaling mechanisms that zzso germ cell differentiation and zzso we have generated mice with a zzso deletion of the zzso zzso Male mice that lacked zzso exhibited bilateral zzso zzso which resulted from impaired zzso arrest and outgrowth of cells with immature zzso zzso with zzso zzso in culture revealed that these cells had greater zzso capacity and enhanced zzso embryonic germ zzso cell colony zzso zzso appears to be essential for germ cell differentiation and an important factor in zzso germ cell tumor zzso
