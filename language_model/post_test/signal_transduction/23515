zzso resistance remains to be a huge obstacle in the treatment of zzso breast cancer, and this therefore highlights the dire need to explore the underlying zzso The zzso transition zzso is a molecular process through which an zzso cell transfers into a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso development, cancer invasion and zzso have been extensively zzso zzso we established zzso zzso breast cancer cells and showed that zzso cells underwent zzso driven by enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso supplement of zzso promoted in zzso cells a zzso and resistant zzso In zzso we demonstrated that zzso was capable of zzso with tamoxifen and triggering zzso in zzso zzso Further Western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso effects of zzso were zzso with its zzso on zzso zzso production and zzso zzso In particular, 50 zzso zzso had minor effects on zzso cell zzso but could significantly zzso zzso zzso production and the zzso pathway, ultimately leading to zzso of zzso zzso our study highlighted distinct roles of zzso in tamoxifen resistance and zzso as a potential agent to overcome acquired tamoxifen zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso zzso effects is, at least in part, zzso
