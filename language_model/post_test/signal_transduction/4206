Recent investigations have suggested that zzso zzso of second zzso responsive zzso systems may be responsible for specific patterns of cellular zzso The type II zzso zzso zzso is localized to particular zzso zzso through the binding of the regulatory zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins zzso Using a zzso overlay zzso we have investigated the presence of zzso throughout the gastrointestinal zzso with specific emphasis focused on the gastric zzso zzso All gastrointestinal zzso contained at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso with five zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso contained four zzso Two zzso zzso and 78 zzso were detected in zzso zzso cells, with the 78 zzso zzso zzso specific to zzso cell enriched zzso zzso to all of these zzso was abolished by zzso of zzso with a synthetic zzso representing the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was distributed throughout all membrane zzso of zzso zzso cells, with the largest amount of zzso detected in the light membrane zzso Identification of zzso regulatory zzso by zzso labeling with zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso into the same zzso cell zzso as zzso A majority zzso zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this protein resides in a zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso the type II zzso to specific zzso locations in the zzso zzso
