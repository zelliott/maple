zzso analyses and gene targeting have recently enhanced the understanding of factors involved in normal plasma cells and multiple zzso Plasma cells develop from marginal zone or zzso center B cells following stimulation by zzso microbial products, zzso family signals and zzso zzso factors, zzso maturation protein 1 zzso and zzso binding protein 1 zzso are required for plasma cell zzso They regulate sets of genes that induce zzso zzso halt proliferation and block alternative zzso zzso In multiple zzso transforming events lead to proliferation and survival, but programs for plasma cell differentiation and the zzso of zzso genes appear to be largely zzso
