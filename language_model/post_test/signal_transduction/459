Our previous zzso disease zzso association study zzso implicated risk zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso region and eight novel risk zzso To identify more zzso disease zzso we selected zzso single zzso zzso zzso that showed more modest association in the zzso for zzso and analysis in four independent zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cases and zzso controls from three populations zzso Irish and zzso We combined the results with the original zzso cohort zzso UK cases and zzso zzso six zzso showed association with zzso zzso zzso and were then zzso in an independent Italian zzso cohort zzso cases and zzso zzso 

We identified two novel zzso disease risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which reached zzso significance in the combined analysis of all zzso cases and zzso controls zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the expression of these genes in the zzso isolated from zzso and from whole blood zzso We did not observe any changes in gene zzso nor in the correlation of zzso with gene zzso 

Both zzso zzso at the protein zzso and zzso are key zzso in the nuclear factor zzso B zzso inflammatory zzso zzso For the first time, a role for primary zzso variation in this important biological zzso zzso to zzso disease has been zzso Currently, the zzso risk factors and the 10 established zzso risk factors explain approximately zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso
