The zzso zzso zzso is zzso associated with the T cell zzso zzso in plasma cell zzso but the zzso role of this interaction has not been zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso can directly associate with zzso soluble fragments of the zzso portion of zzso We further demonstrate that the physical association of zzso and zzso in membrane zzso results in the formation of a zzso complex that exhibits zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso binding properties that are distinct from zzso The affinity of the zzso complex for zzso was zzso lower than for zzso but the interaction of zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso complex that exhibited enhanced zzso signaling as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was further increased by simultaneous stimulation of zzso with its natural zzso zzso Thus, the physical association of zzso and zzso results in zzso zzso with zzso zzso regulation of the binding and signaling properties of zzso Although the precise zzso role of the zzso effects on zzso signaling remains unknown, one can speculate that the zzso is a component of mechanisms involved in the fine tuning of immune system cell zzso
