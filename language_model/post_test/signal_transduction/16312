zzso smoke is the major risk factor associated with the development of chronic zzso pulmonary disease and alters expression of zzso zzso that contribute to disease zzso Previously, we reported that smoke exposure leads to the induction of zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso which is critical to the development of zzso To date, the upstream signaling zzso by which cigarette smoke zzso zzso expression has been zzso This study demonstrates that cigarette smoke mediates zzso expression via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In zzso cell culture studies demonstrated that cigarette zzso zzso was regulated by zzso via zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso prevented cigarette smoke induction of zzso Mice exposed to acute levels of cigarette smoke exhibited increased zzso zzso To further confirm the in zzso relevance of this signaling pathway, rabbits exposed to acute cigarette smoke were found to have elevated zzso signaling and subsequent zzso zzso Additionally, lungs from smokers exhibited elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso zzso through zzso and zzso plays a zzso role in zzso induction by cigarette zzso The identification of the zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso production presents a series of novel targets for future therapy in chronic zzso pulmonary zzso
