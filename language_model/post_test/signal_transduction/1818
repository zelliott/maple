zzso performs a critical function in the recognition, zzso and transport of zzso proteins across the zzso membrane of zzso zzso In this study we investigate the zzso specificity of zzso including the influence of the early mature region of the zzso on zzso zzso and the extent to which zzso recognizes targeting signals from different transport zzso A series of fusion proteins were generated which involved the tandem expression of zzso signal zzso and the first 30 zzso from alkaline zzso These were zzso and evaluated for their ability to promote zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in the stimulation of zzso zzso activity between the synthetic zzso alkaline zzso signal zzso and a fusion that also contains the first 30 zzso of alkaline zzso was zzso The incorporation of sequence motifs in the mature region, which zzso zzso dependence in zzso had no impact on zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that the early mature region of alkaline zzso does not affect the interactions between zzso and the signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso were also zzso for their ability to stimulate zzso zzso activity in zzso and further analyzed in zzso for the zzso dependence of the transport of the corresponding signal zzso zzso of alkaline zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso coli zzso signals give the highest level of zzso zzso however, zzso zzso interactions in zzso are not the only zzso of whether the zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso
