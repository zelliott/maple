zzso and its major zzso zzso zzso are required for zzso These zzso have similar zzso although, defects in zzso zzso mice are zzso In this paper, we examined heart development in those zzso in which the heart is formed, and discovered that both zzso and zzso zzso were required for cardiac zzso and in particular, for the formation of the cardiac zzso zzso We found that zzso precursors are specified and migrate into the heart in zzso or zzso zzso zzso however, the hearts in these zzso are of zzso shape, and the cardiac zzso tracts are short and zzso We show that these defects are likely due to the requirement for cell zzso to zzso for proliferation of zzso zzso and for zzso signaling in the zzso zzso
