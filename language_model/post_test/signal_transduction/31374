Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso which mediates biological actions in many zzso zzso is activated by zzso and growth factors, and has been reported to be zzso activated in numerous cancer zzso In this study, we examined whether low molecular zzso specificity zzso two zzso is involved in the regulation of the zzso 6 zzso zzso factor zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso or zzso cell lines, while zzso zzso in zzso cells suppressed zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso reduction of zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso bound to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso acts as a negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso
