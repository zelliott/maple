It has recently been shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to mediate neural cell death during development of the nervous system and in a range of adult neurodegenerative conditions, zzso a regulated process of cell surface zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso death signaling occurs only following zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso fragment, causing its zzso to zzso zzso of the plasma zzso Furthermore, death signaling is promoted by zzso of zzso zzso zzso a process which also occurs within the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso is zzso thereby blocking zzso zzso Thus zzso activates zzso death pathways in conditions where the balance of normal zzso is shifted toward zzso domain zzso due to increased zzso activity, decreased zzso activity or compromised zzso activity, all of which are features of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's zzso
