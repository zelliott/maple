zzso is associated with an increase in various zzso and zzso zzso but the interplay of these zzso is incompletely zzso We conducted experiments to test a broader hypothesis that a dynamic interplay of zzso and zzso zzso controls zzso storage in zzso 

Three experiments were designed to test the overall hypothesis that zzso zzso (for example, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (for example, zzso activity in an attempt to limit excess zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso one showed that in zzso animal models zzso zzso and high-fat zzso obese zzso the increase in zzso expression was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso two showed that in zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso and increased zzso zzso three showed that in zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso stability were both reduced by zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso gene promoter, was reduced by zzso The zzso activity of zzso was blocked by the chemical zzso of zzso and super zzso zzso 

zzso opposes the action of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression at zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso in zzso to reduce zzso zzso This suggests a potential role of zzso zzso in the control of zzso tissue zzso
