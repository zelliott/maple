A comparative study of real-time zzso of respiratory burst, monitored by zzso zzso and zzso D zzso zzso breakdown has been undertaken on human zzso zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso acid zzso production by zzso at a concentration of 1 zzso Higher zzso (10 zzso zzso inhibit PA formation zzso by 50% as compared with zzso In all cases, the zzso is delayed by zzso s after addition of the zzso Thus the full PA generation is actually the result of an early zzso and a late zzso zzso zzso However, under all conditions, zzso remains at the zzso zzso zzso activity is dependent on zzso influx, but is fully inhibited in cells depleted of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the respiratory burst was investigated by measuring the zzso of zzso zzso This method allows to distinguish various zzso of zzso zzso production: a lag, an increase in zzso formation zzso zzso the duration of zzso production zzso zzso and the termination of the zzso zzso The lag remains constant for all zzso zzso A concentration of 10 zzso which fully zzso the zzso part of PA production, decreases zzso zzso production with a delay of about 20 s after addition of the zzso Higher zzso zzso which have no additional effect on zzso zzso equally affect an early and a late phase of the zzso Thus high doses of zzso have a site of action which decreases the whole burst but does not affect the zzso any zzso Therefore zzso and zzso provide evidence for a zzso process for zzso zzso Only the delayed PA generation is functionally linked to a late phase of the zzso zzso
