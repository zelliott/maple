Although zzso is involved in a number of zzso functions, its role in zzso cell fate decision remains poorly zzso We have recently demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso agents prevent zzso In this study we addressed the question of whether zzso also regulates survival of their zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and detection of zzso or zzso zzso cells by flow zzso zzso membrane potential and zzso or zzso expression were assessed by flow zzso zzso units were studied by zzso zzso in zzso 

We found that two different zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso promoted survival of human zzso zzso zzso cells by suppressing zzso induced by either zzso oxide zzso or serum zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was demonstrated by the ability of their specific zzso zzso and zzso or zzso respectively to reverse the zzso effect of zzso Treatment of zzso cell with zzso not only restrained the zzso zzso but also suppressed the loss of zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso induced by serum zzso While zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or stem cell factor zzso were not able to increase zzso levels, the zzso activity exerted by these growth factors was blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the decreased colony formation in cells exposed to NO or serum zzso 

Altogether, our results strongly suggest that zzso appears to be not only a key zzso controlling zzso survival, but also a zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
