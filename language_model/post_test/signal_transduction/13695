zzso of T cells through the zzso is zzso by the zzso signaling zzso Cross linking of this complex with zzso directed against zzso leads to potent zzso of T zzso However, such zzso is not zzso We exploited the observation that the zzso complex is clustered on T cells that have been activated by zzso by using zzso zzso to selectively activate zzso mouse T zzso We find that constraining zzso on the surface of a zzso markedly and selectively enhances proliferation and zzso production of zzso T cells but does not activate zzso T zzso This effect was zzso in zzso cultures containing zzso of zzso zzso or zzso T cells and bystander T zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso increased the expansion of zzso T cells following zzso Overall, these findings indicate that zzso zzso could be use to enhance the efficacy of vaccines and zzso The results also suggest constraining a zzso on the surface of a zzso might as general strategy for selectively targeting clustered zzso
