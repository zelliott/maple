zzso chamber formation involves dynamic changes in zzso organization, including zzso and expansion of the compact zzso The zzso cues that regulate zzso zzso however, remain zzso Through zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of either zzso or zzso leads to the generation of a small, thin zzso compact layer and to defective zzso In the heart, expression of the zzso zzso domain alone can rescue the defective zzso induced by suppression of zzso but not that resulting from defective zzso zzso This indicates that reverse zzso by zzso occurs within the zzso In a zzso manner, zzso zzso is recruited to the zzso tail of zzso and zzso resulting in zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhances the migration of zzso cells into the zzso whereas zzso arrests cells within the compact zzso Thus, zzso coordinates both zzso expansion and zzso functioning as both a zzso and a zzso for zzso
