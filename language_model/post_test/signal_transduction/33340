We constructed a zzso zzso which expresses zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso treatment, and zzso it into zzso human zzso leukemia cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression diminished the amounts of zzso and its protein zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The declines in zzso and its zzso activity subsequently reduced the proliferation of zzso zzso To zzso the growth signal zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was examined in zzso cells treated with zzso The decline in zzso by induction of zzso zzso zzso expression decreased the level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso The amounts of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso were decreased after zzso zzso However, the amount of zzso zzso with zzso was apparently not affected by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso associate with each other in zzso zzso Furthermore, the level of zzso on zzso zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso was decreased after zzso zzso Taken together with all these findings, it is suggested that zzso directly zzso zzso on zzso zzso which in turn binds to zzso zzso associated with zzso to form a zzso complex, and that the complex formation is coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso by Ras zzso in zzso zzso
