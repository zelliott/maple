In development and in the adult, complex signaling pathways operate within and between cells to coordinate proliferation and cell zzso These networks can be viewed as zzso devices that link engines driving the cell cycle and the initiation of zzso We propose three simple zzso for modeling the effects of zzso drive on zzso zzso This perspective offers a potentially useful foundation for predicting group behaviors of cells in normal and pathological zzso
