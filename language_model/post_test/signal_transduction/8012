zzso in partnership with zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso growth zzso zzso pathways essential for early mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso die shortly after zzso due to severe defects in cell proliferation and visceral zzso zzso In the zzso state, zzso zzso continuous shuttling between the zzso and the nucleus due to the combined activities of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso export zzso located in its zzso zzso Cell culture experiments suggest that zzso zzso shuttling plays an important role in zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated the role of zzso shuttling in zzso using gene targeting to engineer two independent zzso designed to eliminate zzso nuclear zzso As predicted this results in increased levels of zzso in the nucleus of zzso zzso cells zzso stem zzso and primary zzso in the presence or absence of zzso Neither zzso affects zzso expression levels nor its ability to mediate zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso Remarkably mouse zzso lacking the zzso zzso develop zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying one copy of a zzso zzso zzso also fail to display zzso zzso The present study clearly demonstrates that zzso zzso shuttling is not required for embryonic development or tissue zzso in normal, healthy adult zzso
