In the zzso nucleus zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso sympathetic zzso through increased zzso zzso However, the signal zzso pathways involved in its action remain zzso In the present study, we determined the role of zzso soluble zzso zzso and protein zzso G in the zzso effect of NO on synaptic zzso release to zzso projecting zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso by a fluorescent zzso injected into the zzso spinal zzso of zzso zzso zzso recordings were performed on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Bath application of the NO zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the frequency of miniature zzso zzso zzso currents zzso without changing the zzso and the zzso time zzso Neither replacement of zzso with zzso nor application of zzso to block the zzso channel altered the effect of zzso on zzso Also, the effect of zzso on zzso was not significantly affected by zzso a zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso and the specific protein zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the effect of zzso on zzso Thus, these data provide substantial new information that NO zzso zzso synaptic zzso to zzso projecting zzso zzso through a zzso zzso G zzso
