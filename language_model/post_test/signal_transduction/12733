Numerous and extensive functional, zzso and zzso changes characterize intact aged peripheral nervous zzso zzso recovery after peripheral nerve injury depends on survival of injured zzso and functional zzso of target tissue by zzso of injured zzso and collateral zzso of zzso zzso adjacent zzso The rate of zzso zzso becomes slower and its extent zzso and number of zzso zzso decreases in aged zzso Aging also zzso terminal zzso of zzso zzso and collateral zzso of intact adjacent zzso thus further limiting target zzso and its functional zzso zzso survival of aged zzso and injured zzso limited intrinsic growth potential of zzso zzso in its responsiveness to zzso or zzso environmental factors, and changes in the peripheral neural pathways and target zzso are possible reasons for impaired zzso after peripheral nerve injury in old zzso The review of present data suggests that this impairment is mostly due to the age-related changes in the peripheral neural pathways and target zzso and not due to the limited intrinsic growth capacity of zzso or their reduced responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the soluble target derived zzso factors, like nerve growth factor, and zzso zzso zzso components of neural zzso like zzso might be important in this zzso
