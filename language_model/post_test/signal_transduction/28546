One of the most significant challenges in zzso is to identify the cellular and molecular processes that zzso learning and memory zzso The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding changes that accompany certain forms of acquisition and recall, particularly those forms which require zzso of zzso pathways in the zzso This progress can be attributed to a number of factors including zzso animal models, zzso zzso for analysis of cell signaling events and changes in gene transcription, and technology which has allowed gene knockout and zzso in cells and zzso Of the several animal models used in identifying the changes which accompany plasticity in synaptic connections, long-term zzso zzso has received most attention, and although it is not yet clear whether the changes that zzso maintenance of zzso also zzso memory consolidation, significant advances have been made in understanding cell signaling events that contribute to this form of synaptic zzso In this review, emphasis is focused on analysis of changes that occur after learning, especially spatial learning, and zzso and the value of assessing these changes in parallel is zzso The effect of different zzso on spatial zzso and zzso is emphasized, and the review concludes with a brief analysis of the contribution of studies, in which transgenic animals were used, to the literature on zzso and zzso
