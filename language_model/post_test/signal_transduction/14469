zzso stimulation of cut peripheral nerves at the time of their surgical repair results in an enhancement of zzso zzso zzso of zzso through nerve zzso was used to evaluate whether this effect is due to an zzso of cell autonomous zzso signaling in the zzso or signaling from zzso produced in the surrounding zzso In the zzso zzso a single 1 h application of electrical stimulation at the time of surgical repair of the cut common zzso nerve results in a significant increase in the proportion of zzso zzso root zzso zzso which were zzso for zzso or zzso as well as an increase in the length of zzso zzso through zzso from wild type litter zzso both 1 and 2 weeks zzso zzso growth through zzso from zzso knockout mice or zzso made zzso by repeated cycles of freezing and zzso is normally very poor, but electrical stimulation results in a growth of zzso through these zzso which is similar to that observed through zzso from wild type mice after electrical zzso When cut nerves in zzso knockout mice were zzso zzso no enhancement of zzso zzso was zzso zzso stimulation thus produces a potent enhancement of the zzso of zzso in cut peripheral nerves, which is independent of zzso production by cells in their surrounding environment but is dependent on stimulation of zzso and its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
