A permanent increase in zzso serum zzso A zzso level is observed in obesity and insulin zzso Recently, zzso has been shown to correlate with obesity and insulin resistance in zzso However, what triggers zzso zzso is poorly zzso and the mechanism of elevated zzso to insulin resistance has not been zzso In this study, we used two cellular models of insulin resistance, one induced by treatment with tumor necrosis zzso zzso and the other with the zzso zzso Gene expression analysis showed that zzso zzso levels were increased in both models of insulin resistance, and zzso showed that zzso levels were increased in both models zzso To assess the potential impact of zzso on insulin resistance, we treated zzso zzso with zzso human zzso zzso and found that zzso attenuated cellular insulin sensitivity, zzso the level of zzso and zzso the level of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor brought about partial restoration of zzso insulin zzso In sum, our findings suggest that serum zzso A might be a marker of insulin resistance, and it might play a major role in the development of zzso insulin zzso Moreover, in our study it has been proved that zzso is indeed a crucial component of the zzso responsible for zzso insulin resistance in zzso zzso which suggests that a selective interference with zzso activity might be a useful strategy in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other zzso zzso
