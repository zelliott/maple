The zzso and zzso zzso pathways are two distinct pathways in zzso zzso that rely on a zzso zzso process in zzso external stimuli zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso pair involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso system involved in resistance to zzso zzso zzso Both systems are implicated in zzso zzso zzso and resistance to zzso zzso Our study shows that the response regulator protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso at three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso depends on the structural integrity of zzso as well as the zzso acid sequences zzso the zzso zzso Its zzso in zzso zzso , zzso which harbors two of the three zzso sites in zzso does not undergo zzso zzso zzso is involved in regulation of the zzso zzso the gene products of which add the zzso on wall zzso acid zzso Investigation of zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain by zzso zzso showed a clear negative effect that zzso deletion has on the zzso content of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso lacking the zzso zzso sites mirrors this zzso These findings provide evidence that zzso is a target of zzso in zzso and suggest that modification of zzso by zzso is modulated by zzso The zzso between these two otherwise independent signaling pathways may facilitate zzso zzso interaction with its environment to zzso processes such as cell growth and division and zzso
