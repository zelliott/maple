Adult human zzso zzso cells zzso have the potential to differentiate into zzso zzso or zzso zzso providing a potential source for tissue zzso An important issue for efficient bone zzso is to identify factors that can be targeted to promote the zzso potential of zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso studies showed that zzso promotes the expression of zzso zzso markers and in zzso osteogenesis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso using specific zzso blunted zzso marker gene expression and zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the enhanced zzso differentiation induced by zzso was zzso by zzso of focal zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso such as a specific zzso that zzso the zzso or a zzso that specifically activates zzso was sufficient to enhance zzso and zzso signaling and to promote zzso differentiation and zzso capacity of zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso engineered to zzso zzso exhibited a marked increase in their zzso potential in zzso Taken together, these findings not only reveal that zzso is required for zzso differentiation of adult zzso but also provide a targeted strategy using zzso zzso to promote the zzso capacity of zzso This may be used for tissue zzso in bone disorders where the recruitment or capacity of zzso is zzso
