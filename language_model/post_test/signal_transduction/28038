Growth signaling is instrumental in tumor zzso Insight into signaling pathways by molecular and cellular biology has changed the development of new zzso zzso Outside the field of zzso specifically targeted drugs such as zzso zzso and zzso showed impressive zzso activity in chronic zzso leukemia and zzso cell lung cancer, zzso 

Literature search of zzso documented publications and abstracts from zzso 

zzso data in prostate cancer shows zzso of a wide variety of growth factors and their receptors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting efficacy of agents targeting these zzso Here the zzso evidence and first clinical data on the use of growth signal targeting in prostate cancer is zzso Although some zzso efficacy of signal zzso zzso zzso was reported, combination with chemotherapy and zzso seemed most promising in prostate zzso 

zzso smart drugs are small molecules targeted at specific growth signaling zzso These new drugs will dominate clinical trials in the years to come either as zzso zzso but more likely as combination zzso
