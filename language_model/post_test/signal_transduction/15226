zzso zzso occurs in peripheral zzso such as zzso and produces many types of zzso cells with diverse functions in response to inflammation and zzso It is increased during immune responses and chronic inflammation and is a significant factor in regulating inflammatory diseases and zzso Increased zzso cells are found in zzso mice but the mechanism has been zzso We investigated the mechanism by which zzso regulatory T cells regulate the zzso zzso We found that zzso or genetic depletion of zzso regulatory T cells greatly increased the number of the zzso zzso in zzso during immune zzso zzso the zzso zzso was effectively suppressed by increased numbers of natural or induced zzso regulatory T zzso We demonstrated that zzso is positively regulated by zzso zzso T cells that produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso and these zzso zzso T cells are induced from zzso zzso T cells in response to zzso zzso zzso regulatory T cells were able to effectively suppress the differentiation of zzso T cells into zzso zzso T zzso This suppression was found to be dependent on cell contact but independent of zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso is not significantly affected by zzso regulatory T zzso We conclude that zzso T cells can zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso by suppressing the zzso T cell differentiation into zzso zzso zzso T zzso Our results provide new insights into regulation of zzso zzso
