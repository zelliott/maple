A major protective mechanism against zzso substances capable of damaging DNA integrity and initiating zzso is the induction of phase II zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso A key finding in the field of zzso has been the discovery that the induction of these zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso stress system zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, zzso anchors the zzso zzso factor within the zzso targeting it for zzso and zzso degradation, thus zzso its ability to induce phase II zzso When cells are exposed to zzso agents and zzso stress, however, a signal involving zzso and/or zzso modification is transmitted to the zzso complex, leading to its zzso and the nuclear zzso of zzso which, after zzso zzso with other zzso factors, binds to the zzso present within phase II gene zzso increasing their zzso These data should assist in developing new phase II zzso zzso zzso as cancer zzso agents within the clinical zzso
