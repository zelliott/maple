zzso acid zzso is a zzso zzso zzso store zzso which raises zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on membrane currents in isolated inner hair cells zzso from guinea-pig zzso was investigated by the zzso technique in the zzso zzso Four out of eight zzso showed an zzso of the currents and the other four cells showed an zzso of the currents by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of outward currents were not changed by zzso Three out of four zzso obtained from the zzso part of the zzso demonstrated zzso whereas three out of four zzso from the zzso part demonstrated zzso of the zzso This result suggests that zzso currents were dominant in the zzso zzso of the zzso
