zzso zzso signaling due to deregulation of zzso regulators is implicated in the development and progression of numerous zzso zzso This study addresses the questions if zzso of zzso signaling in germ cell tumors zzso arising during childhood and adolescence is associated with aberrations of the tumor zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and whether zzso aberrations might be responsible for progression from benign zzso to zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso 

Forty-eight zzso were zzso including mature zzso zzso 5) and immature zzso zzso 7) zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso 17) as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso To screen zzso for genetic zzso we conducted direct sequencing of the zzso cluster region zzso loss of zzso analyses zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso analyses included zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time zzso 

zzso promoter zzso was detected in zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso with a pronounced zzso exclusively in zzso zzso while zzso were not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show zzso at the zzso zzso However, neither zzso within the zzso nor truncated protein were zzso zzso expression did not significantly vary between the different zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso provide evidence for involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Our additional analyses suggest that zzso is unlikely to be solely responsible for the formation and progression of childhood zzso
