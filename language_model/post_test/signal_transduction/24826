The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can bind to cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso when it forms a complex with the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have assessed the contribution of this system to the increased resistance of zzso T cells against zzso in zzso disease zzso a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal zzso A zzso zzso against zzso suppressed established experimental colitis in various animal models of CD zzso by type 1 zzso cells, by inducing zzso of zzso zzso T zzso Similarly, specific zzso of zzso in zzso by a newly designed zzso fusion protein caused suppression of colitis activity and induction of zzso indicating that zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso In patients with CD, zzso T cells showed strong evidence for zzso trans zzso with zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso trans signaling caused zzso zzso indicating that the zzso system mediates the resistance of T cells to zzso in zzso These data indicate that a zzso of zzso zzso driven by zzso contributes to the perpetuation of chronic zzso zzso zzso targeting of this zzso may be a promising new approach for the treatment of zzso
