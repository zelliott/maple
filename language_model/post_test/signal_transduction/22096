Despite its zzso role as a serum growth factor during fetal liver development and zzso zzso the biological significance of zzso zzso zzso remains incompletely zzso Here, we provide evidence to illustrate that zzso zzso may function as a regulator in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated zzso and interaction of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, with an interaction distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined with the zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso expression by all zzso acid resulted in enhancement of the zzso level with a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene into zzso cells zzso zzso zzso led to a significant zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso was simultaneously reversed by zzso accompanied by diminution of all zzso zzso zzso of zzso and enhancement of cell zzso In conclusion, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso is involved in regulation of zzso growth and zzso
