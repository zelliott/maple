A major theme driving research in biology is the relationship between form and zzso In particular, a longstanding goal has been to understand how the evolution of zzso zzso fitness zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produce structures that maximize cellular zzso Specifically, we develop a mathematical model of resource availability and zzso response within colony zzso This analysis accurately predicts the measured distribution of two types of electron zzso zzso which is available from the atmosphere, and zzso zzso antibiotics produced by the zzso Using this model, we demonstrate that the geometry of colony structures is optimal with respect to growth zzso Because our model is based on resource zzso we also can anticipate shifts in feature geometry based on changes to the availability of electron zzso including variations in the external availability of oxygen and genetic manipulation that renders the cells incapable of zzso zzso
