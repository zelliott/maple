zzso zzso is a widespread phenomenon in zzso cells that affects many important signaling zzso We describe the zzso design of engineered protein zzso and their universal synthetic zzso zzso These new tools allowed us to detect zzso amounts of zzso proteins in cells and zzso and to identify their zzso protein zzso Using this approach, we analyzed the in zzso effects of protein zzso zzso Whereas some of the zzso displayed the expected activities, others lacked in zzso activity or targeted a broader spectrum of zzso than previously zzso To zzso the in zzso effect of the zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso across the zzso by mass zzso We also demonstrate that sites of active zzso transport carry most of the zzso This approach enables a quantitative zzso analysis of the regulation of protein zzso and its zzso by therapeutic zzso
