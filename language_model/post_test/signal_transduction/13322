zzso transformation of tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants with a construct containing the zzso sequence for the receiver domain and zzso portion of the tomato zzso zzso zzso under the control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter resulted in some expected and unexpected zzso In addition to reduced zzso transcript levels, the two most consistently observed zzso in the transgenic lines were delayed zzso and reduced plant zzso Fruit zzso and softening were essentially zzso and all the zzso from first generation seed displayed a normal triple response to zzso Two independent lines with a single copy of the zzso and reduced zzso transcript zzso were selected for detailed zzso analysis of second generation zzso zzso Delayed zzso shorter zzso zzso and reduced zzso movement all correlated with the presence of the zzso and the degree of reduced zzso transcript zzso No significant differences were noted for fruit zzso or fruit softening on zzso plants and all zzso from zzso and zzso seed displayed a normal triple zzso zzso transcript zzso was only slightly reduced in the zzso plants compared with zzso plants, and zzso zzso transcript levels appeared to be unaffected by the zzso We propose that zzso signal zzso occurs through parallel paths that partially intersect to regulate shared zzso zzso
