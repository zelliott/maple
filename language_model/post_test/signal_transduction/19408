zzso signaling has a critical function in maintaining a balance among cell zzso zzso and zzso Our earlier work showed that the zzso zzso domain interferes with the scaffolding function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yet the effect of zzso for zzso binding protein zzso of zzso zzso signaling remains zzso Here, we show that zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso was found to physically associate with either zzso domain of zzso or zzso and interfere with the interaction between zzso Furthermore, we zzso that zzso caused the zzso retention of zzso through an interaction between the zzso region of zzso including zzso zzso 3 domain and the zzso domain of zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling cascade and cell zzso Our results suggest that direct zzso interactions coordinate zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
