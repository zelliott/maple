Genome integrity is frequently challenged by DNA zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso A single DNA zzso break zzso is lethal if zzso and may lead to loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso loss if repaired zzso Such genetic zzso are the main causes of cancer and other genetic zzso zzso DNA zzso break repair zzso is an important process in all living zzso zzso is also the driving mechanism in most strategies of gene zzso which has applications in both genetic and clinical zzso Here we review the cell biological response to zzso in zzso growing cells with an emphasis on zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso
