zzso zzso pulmonary hypertension zzso is a life-threatening complication that affects a small but appreciable percentage of patients after acute pulmonary zzso The cause of zzso is under investigation, but no single zzso mechanism has yet been zzso 

zzso is likely a complication of residual zzso material in the pulmonary arteries that becomes transformed into zzso zzso Pulmonary artery zzso are relatively common after acute pulmonary zzso and zzso may be an extreme manifestation of this zzso Several intriguing observations have been made in patients with zzso that give insights into the mechanisms responsible for its zzso Two general pathways have been zzso resistance of zzso to zzso and zzso of cellular processes involved in zzso zzso This review discusses the evidence supporting each zzso as a mechanism for zzso formation, as well as the interaction between the zzso 

zzso may be due to a complex interaction between zzso processes and zzso cellular zzso of organized zzso The factors involved may, in fact, vary among zzso zzso An understanding of the interplay between the factors that cause zzso may help zzso the risk of its occurrence and provide insights into how it can be zzso
