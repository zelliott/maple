We have previously demonstrated that zzso gene transfer of the zzso inhibitor zzso to human zzso results in protection from zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso Here we report that human and mouse zzso can be efficiently zzso by a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso without impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery of a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and completely blocked the zzso effects of zzso on zzso function and zzso activity, in a similar manner to zzso We also demonstrate that mouse zzso can be zzso in zzso by infusion of the zzso zzso through the zzso duct prior to isolation, resulting in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso fusion zzso zzso in zzso to mouse zzso resulted in improved zzso function and viability after zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso delivery to zzso modify zzso in zzso to improve their viability and function during isolation, prior to zzso
