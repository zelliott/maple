A number of proteins produced by certain bacteria and plants are zzso toxic to zzso zzso This toxicity results from their ability to zzso modify zzso that are required for essential cellular functions such as zzso trafficking, zzso zzso zzso or protein zzso To reach their targets, these proteins bind specific surface receptors before zzso and zzso across an internal zzso The surface receptors exploited by different toxins include a range of proteins and zzso Here we focus on specific zzso receptors and two zzso zzso of toxins that exploit them for surface zzso zzso trafficking, and zzso zzso
