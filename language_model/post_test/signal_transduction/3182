zzso of the zzso junction zzso is a common zzso anomaly frequently associated with zzso zzso To study the molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso development, we zzso zzso the common zzso critical for zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso during zzso Loss of zzso zzso signaling in these zzso caused bilateral zzso obstruction and severe zzso beginning at embryonic day zzso Despite a reduction in quantity of zzso smooth muscle, differentiation proceeded without zzso producing a less severe zzso than zzso zzso this finding suggests that at least some zzso functions in zzso smooth muscle may be zzso The absence of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso itself, led to zzso zzso highlighting the importance of zzso support for zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed altered expression in known zzso targets, smooth zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso before the onset of zzso zzso of the zzso target zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso consistent with the observation that zzso zzso develop zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso reduces the number and zzso of zzso smooth muscle cells, leading to abnormal zzso zzso and functional zzso The subsequent zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso at the zzso marks the transition from a functional obstruction to a more intractable physical zzso suggesting that early intervention for this disease may prevent more irreversible damage to the urinary zzso
