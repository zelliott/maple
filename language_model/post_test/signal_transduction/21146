The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso that is part of a zzso signaling mechanism that is used throughout the development of the fly to regulate a wide variety of cell fate decisions, including some zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso play roles that are similar to that of zzso and studies of this signaling zzso in both organisms have led to models of how the zzso might zzso Recent developments in the study of zzso signaling include the isolation of zzso zzso from a variety of zzso zzso Here we compare what has been learned from studies of zzso genes in zzso to what is known about zzso signaling in zzso and we discuss the implications of these data for existing models of zzso zzso zzso
