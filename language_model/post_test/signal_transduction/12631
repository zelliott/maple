zzso of zzso zzso receptors on zzso cells of the cerebral zzso zzso the appearance of a slow zzso that can sustain autonomous zzso after a brief zzso zzso zzso this phenomenon has been hypothesized to allow for the transient storage of memory traces in zzso zzso Here we investigated the molecular basis underlying the zzso zzso zzso using molecular biological and zzso zzso We find that the ability of zzso receptors to induce the inward zzso underlying the slow zzso is inhibited by expression of a zzso dominant negative and is also markedly reduced in a zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show, using a genetically zzso zzso that zzso of zzso zzso zzso the breakdown of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso cascade plays a key role in the ability of zzso receptors to signal the inward zzso We have shown previously that the zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the possible involvement of zzso zzso We find that expression of a zzso dominant negative zzso and zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso inward zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso of zzso and zzso calcium channels is sufficient to zzso a zzso zzso inward zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso channels mediate the zzso zzso slow zzso seen in zzso cells of the cerebral zzso and suggest a possible role for zzso channels in zzso zzso
