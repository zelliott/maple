zzso factor zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which plays crucial roles in the zzso of tumors and zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso expressed zzso zzso and one of three zzso zzso zzso or zzso The stability and activity of zzso are regulated by various zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interacts with several protein factors including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Under zzso the zzso zzso is rapidly zzso via the von zzso tumor zzso gene product zzso zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso and zzso under zzso conditions is triggered by the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso within a zzso segment known as the zzso degradation zzso zzso On the contrary, in the zzso condition, zzso zzso becomes stable and interacts with zzso such as zzso to zzso its zzso zzso Eventually, zzso acts as a master regulator of numerous zzso genes under hypoxic zzso The target genes of zzso are especially related to zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, it was reported that the zzso of zzso is closely associated with a variety of tumors and zzso zzso zzso the blocking of zzso itself or zzso interacting proteins inhibit tumor zzso Based on these findings, zzso can be a prime target for zzso zzso This review summarizes the molecular mechanism of zzso stability, the biological functions of zzso and its potential applications of cancer zzso
