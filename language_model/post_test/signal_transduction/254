zzso zzso signaling is crucial for many aspects of embryonic development, whereas zzso of this zzso is associated with several types of zzso zzso protein zzso is a surface zzso zzso that is zzso against all three zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of human zzso alone and bound to Sonic zzso zzso now reveal that zzso is comprised of two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso In the complex structure, a critical loop from zzso binds the zzso active site groove of zzso and directly coordinates its zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons of this zzso binding loop with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso binding studies suggest a zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso active zzso thus, we propose a role for zzso as a structural decoy zzso for zzso zzso
