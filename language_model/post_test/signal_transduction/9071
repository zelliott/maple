We have previously demonstrated that expression of the novel gene zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso cell differentiation zzso zzso Yu Y, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso zzso The present investigation was undertaken to examine whether zzso plays a role in regulating differentiation of zzso zzso + zzso colon cancer cells that are highly enriched in cancer stem cells zzso zzso of zzso in zzso colon cancer zzso cells resulted in increase of alkaline zzso activity, a marker of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso resulted in reduction of zzso and protein levels of the zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was accompanied by decreased formation of zzso (an in zzso model of tumor zzso in stem cell medium and zzso of expression of the zzso drug zzso protein zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells reduced zzso zzso dye zzso Finally, zzso zzso inhibited the expression of transforming growth zzso in both zzso colon cancer cells, but zzso zzso in response to additional zzso zzso In zzso our data demonstrate that zzso expression zzso multiple characteristics of zzso zzso colon cancer cells, including induction of differentiation and reduction in zzso formation, drug zzso activity, and zzso stimulation of zzso Thus zzso expression may render colon zzso more susceptible to cancer zzso
