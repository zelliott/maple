The involvement of signal zzso systems in the initial attachment of two zzso zzso melanoma clones of differing zzso potential to zzso zzso components was examined to learn more of the early events in zzso zzso zzso of high and low zzso capacity attached similarly in the absence of any zzso exhibiting a two phase time course of attachment with zzso attachment by 60 zzso A slight difference in attachment characteristics between the clones was seen in response to zzso zzso zzso which significantly inhibited attachment of the low zzso clone but which had no effect on the highly zzso zzso Total protein zzso C activity and distribution was similar for both zzso zzso of both clones was severely reduced, however, if zzso calcium was elevated or zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that signal zzso mechanisms are involved in melanoma cell attachment to zzso proteins and offers an approach to pharmacological manipulation of these zzso interactions which may be relevant to reducing zzso zzso
