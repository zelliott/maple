The zzso zzso of an early zzso zzso contains zzso of zzso cells and vascular zzso zzso We established a cell line, zzso from zzso embryonic zzso zzso 10 years zzso The line has been successfully cultured since zzso To determine whether these long-term cultured zzso zzso cells still have the potential to differentiate into zzso cells, an in zzso model of zzso zzso cell differentiation into zzso zzso cells was established in the present study by zzso the zzso zzso cells on basement membrane proteins zzso The results indicate that upon zzso onto zzso zzso cells attach quickly, align in tandem, and form a complete network of zzso structures within 12 zzso By using zzso against the known components of zzso in a tube formation zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso proteins such as zzso collagen IV, zzso and zzso are the most important components in the zzso which induce the zzso zzso cells to undergo zzso zzso New basement membrane proteins are also required for the zzso differentiation process, as indicated by the fact that base membrane protein synthesis zzso zzso can block the differentiation zzso Furthermore, our experiments revealed the involvement of several signal zzso zzso such as protein zzso A, C and protein zzso zzso in this differentiation zzso
