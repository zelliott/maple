zzso factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that stimulates tumor cell invasion and zzso We recently reported that zzso protects zzso and zzso cells against zzso from zzso agents and that zzso zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso protein zzso in cells exposed to zzso We now report that in addition to blocking zzso zzso markedly enhances the repair of DNA strand breaks caused by zzso or gamma zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells not only simulated the zzso zzso but also enhanced the repair of DNA strand zzso The ability of zzso to induce both zzso and DNA repair was inhibited by zzso suggesting that these activities of zzso are due, in part, to a zzso zzso dependent signaling zzso zzso with this finding, zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso and an expression zzso zzso a dominant negative zzso inactive zzso partially but significantly inhibited zzso cell protection and DNA zzso These findings suggest that zzso activates a cell survival and DNA repair zzso that involves signaling through zzso and zzso and stabilization of the expression of zzso and they zzso zzso in the DNA repair zzso
