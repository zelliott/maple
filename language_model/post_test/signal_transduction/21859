The earliest fossil bats resemble their modern counterparts in possessing greatly zzso digits to support the wing zzso which is an anatomical hallmark of powered zzso To zzso confirm these similarities, we performed a zzso analysis of wing bones from fossil and modern zzso We found that the lengths of the third, fourth, and fifth digits (the primary supportive elements of the zzso have remained constant relative to body size over the last 50 million zzso This absence of transitional forms in the fossil record led us to look elsewhere to understand bat wing zzso zzso embryonic development, we found that the digits in bats zzso zzso are initially similar in size to those of mice zzso zzso but that, zzso bat digits greatly zzso The zzso timing of the change in wing zzso length points to a change in zzso cartilage growth, a process that depends on the relative proliferation and differentiation of zzso We found that bat zzso digits exhibit relatively high rates of zzso proliferation and zzso We show that bone zzso protein 2 zzso can stimulate cartilage proliferation and differentiation and increase zzso length in the bat embryonic zzso Also, we show that zzso expression and zzso signaling are increased in bat zzso embryonic digits relative to mouse or bat hind limb zzso Together, our results suggest that an zzso of the zzso zzso is one of the major factors in the zzso zzso of bat zzso digits, and it is potentially a key mechanism in their evolutionary zzso as zzso
