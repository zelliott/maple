zzso resistance zzso increased pulse pressure zzso zzso dysfunction zzso and reduced zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso The genetic background of these 3 cardiovascular risk factors might be partly zzso The zzso zzso zzso is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular zzso 

We investigated whether the zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso in white Caucasians and with zzso in zzso In zzso individuals, zzso unrelated and zzso from 248 zzso the zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso In the families, the zzso zzso accounted for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This association was formally zzso in a second sample of 475 individuals zzso zzso zzso but not in 2 smaller samples of zzso and 236 individuals zzso and zzso zzso In the individual patients' data zzso zzso 1985 individuals, zzso was associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso cells carrying the zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso cells, reduced zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO zzso activity zzso 

Our data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso in zzso and reduced insulin signaling and zzso in zzso thus indicating a possible zzso mechanism for the increased cardiovascular risk observed in zzso zzso zzso
