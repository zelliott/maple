The regulator of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be crucial in the regulation of vascular tone and blood zzso The vascular activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two natural zzso are dependent upon the zzso of zzso zzso However, the effects and pathways involved in their zzso remain zzso This study aimed to observe the changes of zzso expression in response to zzso and zzso in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and to clarify the potential signaling pathways zzso In the present study, vascular smooth muscle cells zzso were cultured with zzso and zzso of various zzso for different time zzso and the gene expression of zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso significantly increased the gene expression at zzso to zzso of that at zzso whereas zzso marginally increased the expression after zzso zzso and zzso were used to block the protein zzso zzso and zzso pathways activated by incubation with zzso The gene expression of zzso was reduced by zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso and zzso were added to the cells incubated with zzso the gene expression was markedly reduced by both zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso immediately showed a marked increase in the gene expression of zzso in cultured zzso via a zzso zzso and zzso gradually showed a marginal increase in the gene expression via a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso
