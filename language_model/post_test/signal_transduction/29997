The zzso zzso open reading frame zzso encodes a predicted protein displaying similarity in organization to zzso a scaffolding protein that organizes signaling and zzso zzso regulating activities in many higher zzso cell zzso We found that zzso functions in a manner analogous to zzso as a zzso of polarized cell zzso thus, we have named this gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso strains show that zzso is required for the selection and maintenance of polarized growth sites during zzso growth and zzso zzso analyses of strains lacking both zzso and the zzso GAP zzso demonstrate that such cells display pronounced growth defects in response to different conditions causing zzso zzso zzso zzso also displays genetic interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso may therefore function as a zzso of zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein zzso to sites of polarized cell zzso zzso mapping the zzso zzso of zzso demonstrate the existence of zzso mechanisms zzso between zzso and zzso and indicate an zzso ancient and zzso role for zzso domain proteins in acting to zzso cell signaling and zzso organization during polarized zzso
