Although zzso 1 zzso receptors contribute to zzso and their expression is increased in the spinal zzso during peripheral zzso little is known regarding the signaling molecules and the second zzso pathways that they activate in regulating the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Because the promoter region of the zzso zzso contains a zzso response element zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of zzso receptors via a zzso involving zzso of the zzso factor zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso were conducted on primary cultures of zzso rat spinal zzso Treatment of cultures with zzso for zzso zzso increased zzso P binding on spinal zzso the increase in binding was preceded by an zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso change in zzso P binding was zzso and was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso indicating the involvement of the zzso factor zzso Evidence that zzso increased zzso levels in spinal zzso and that the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso leads to zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso these data define a role for zzso as a signaling zzso that zzso expression of zzso receptors in spinal zzso The data provide evidence that a zzso zzso controls gene expression in the zzso and add another dimension to understanding the zzso of substance P and zzso by primary zzso zzso
