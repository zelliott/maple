zzso signals orchestrate cell fate and behavior throughout the animal zzso zzso zzso signaling impacts nearly the entire spectrum of human disease, including birth zzso cancer, and zzso If zzso signaling is to be effectively manipulated for therapeutic advantage, we first must understand how zzso signals are normally zzso Naked zzso zzso is a novel and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling that is crucial for zzso in the model genetic zzso the fruit fly zzso zzso zzso can bind and inhibit the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism by which zzso limits zzso signaling in the fly zzso is not zzso Here we show that zzso zzso exhibit elevated levels of the zzso zzso zzso but no zzso in zzso abundance or zzso In the fly zzso zzso and zzso are predominantly zzso although a recent report suggests that zzso zzso requires nuclear zzso for activity in zzso zzso While zzso regions of zzso contribute to its activity, we identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso regions, that is essential for zzso function and nuclear zzso Replacement of the zzso motif with a conventional nuclear zzso sequence rescued a small fraction of zzso zzso animals to zzso Our studies suggest that zzso targets zzso signal zzso steps in both zzso and nuclear compartments of cells receiving the zzso zzso
