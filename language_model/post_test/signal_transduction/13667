zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulate several zzso processes by limited zzso of different zzso The role of zzso in zzso is not clear with conflicting evidence from a number of mouse zzso Here we report the zzso and spatial expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and address its role in zzso zzso We show that zzso is expressed zzso with elevated expression in neural zzso and that zzso activity is zzso and temporally zzso Using a zzso zzso a dominant negative and a zzso zzso we demonstrate that impaired zzso activity results in defective zzso extension both in zzso and neural zzso Specifically, zzso zzso results in loss of tissue polarity and zzso of zzso zzso in Keller zzso without affecting zzso junction zzso We further show that zzso is activated in response to zzso and that the zzso effect of zzso expression on animal cap zzso can be rescued by blocking zzso zzso This suggests that zzso activity needs to be tightly regulated during zzso zzso Finally we show that expression of zzso blocks the membrane zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is downstream of zzso zzso our data show that zzso zzso through the zzso zzso and zzso can zzso zzso extension zzso
