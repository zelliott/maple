One characteristic of B cells that accumulate during chronic zzso leukemia zzso is their highly zzso functional responses to B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells with very poor responses have defective rapid zzso zzso of numerous zzso especially zzso C zzso as well as a defective calcium zzso on zzso zzso This points to a zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether a zzso in zzso a zzso that is pivotal in zzso zzso to downstream signaling events, could account for these zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso was severely impaired in zzso cells with low calcium responses to zzso zzso zzso associations were also zzso as zzso zzso zzso of a zzso 145 zzso protein zzso with zzso was only detected in responding zzso zzso By contrast, we found similar expression of the zzso regardless of zzso cell zzso These results are consistent with the possibility that very zzso zzso signaling elements in some zzso cells are unable to connect with downstream zzso events dominated by zzso zzso and the potential zzso function of zzso zzso
