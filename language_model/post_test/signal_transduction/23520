zzso regulates several zzso processes in zzso including the promotion of growth, an anabolic process, and the zzso of stored zzso a zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso isolated from rainbow trout zzso zzso as a model to examine the mechanism of zzso action on zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured by increased zzso release in both a zzso and a zzso zzso The promotion of zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso by an increased expression of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The signaling pathways that zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso C zzso zzso C zzso and the zzso pathway, whereas zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso The blockade of zzso and the zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the blockade of zzso or the zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso or the expression of zzso zzso by zzso These results indicate that zzso promotes zzso by zzso zzso and by enhancing the de zzso expression of zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso and zzso These findings also suggest molecular mechanisms for zzso the zzso zzso actions of zzso while simultaneously zzso anabolic processes such as zzso and the zzso actions of zzso
