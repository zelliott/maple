zzso is a member of the family of zzso proteins that are known to be zzso in zzso following injury and/or zzso zzso zzso has been linked to zzso in multiple models, including neurodegenerative zzso In contrast, less is known about the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso and with regard to zzso of programmed cell death zzso mechanisms in zzso We examined the effects of zzso zzso by zzso with zzso plasmids in primary cortical zzso and the zzso zzso cell line using four independent models of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In these zzso models, zzso zzso with the zzso construct showed significantly reduced induction of nuclear zzso markers and/or cell zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso binds and potentially zzso zzso zzso factor 1, as well as zzso factor, key molecules involved in development of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso including active zzso zzso and zzso zzso were attenuated in zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso protects against zzso zzso and suggest that these effects zzso at least in part, to zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
