Spinal zzso injury zzso is a devastating zzso injury with functional zzso In the acute phase, which starts at the moment of the injury and extends over the first few days, numerous pathological processes zzso In this study, we made several additional advances to broaden our understanding of zzso gene expression zzso We examined changes at multiple time zzso 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after injury, with the latter time period being zzso Also, we zzso multiple analysis methods such as real-time zzso Western zzso and zzso to increase confidence in our candidate gene and molecular zzso From the pool of information, we generated profiles of expression changes and molecular mechanisms of several injury zzso Early stages after the injury are characterized by the strong zzso of genes involved in transcription, zzso and signaling zzso and a general zzso of neural zzso zzso In addition, zzso of the spinal zzso develops, and zzso disturbances involving zzso zzso zzso zzso This translates into a general failure of normal neural functions and a stage of signal shock that lasts for a few days in experimental rat zzso zzso injury to the spinal zzso also leads to a strong inflammatory response with the recruitment of peripherally derived immature cells, such as zzso zzso After the zzso zzso cell death continues, and zzso and zzso accompany zzso zzso Strong expression of zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso family represents an early attempt of spinal zzso repair and zzso Our study allowed us to conclude that combined therapeutic strategies for enhanced recovery should be performed until the chronic phase of the injury in areas zzso to the zzso epicenter of spinal zzso
