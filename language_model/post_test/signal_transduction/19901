The release of signaling molecules from zzso must be zzso to accommodate their highly polarized zzso In the developing zzso visual system, zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso from their cell bodies, as well as from their zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso which process zzso determines the site of zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3 is essential for its ability to promote zzso zzso from zzso but not from cell zzso We demonstrate that the zzso extends throughout zzso zzso and show that this feature zzso the trafficking of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso Star, and zzso 3 to zzso zzso Following this trafficking step, zzso from the zzso is regulated in a manner similar to zzso from cell zzso These findings uncover a role for the zzso in trafficking proteins from the zzso cell body to zzso zzso
