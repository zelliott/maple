In this work, the effect of zzso on flower opening of cut rose zzso zzso zzso Samantha was zzso However, although zzso hastened the process of flower zzso zzso zzso an zzso action zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso production in zzso but zzso did not inhibit this zzso Of the four zzso zzso genes tested, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso expression was enhanced by zzso slightly and zzso zzso However, their zzso amounts were not inhibited by zzso compared with zzso zzso of seven zzso component genes was also zzso including three zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were accumulated in a zzso manner and had no or little response to zzso or zzso while transcript levels of zzso and zzso were substantially elevated by zzso and those of zzso and zzso were greatly enhanced by zzso zzso reduced all the four genes to levels much less than those in control zzso These results show that zzso triggers zzso responses related to flower opening in cut rose zzso Samantha, and that continued zzso perception results in flower zzso zzso may regulate flower opening mainly through expression of two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso
