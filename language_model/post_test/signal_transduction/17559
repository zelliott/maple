We used computerized zzso zzso flash to study 12 zzso five zzso zzso and seven chronic idiopathic retinal zzso zzso compared with 12 healthy zzso We found a moderate correlation in controls between white computer averaged zzso zzso and zzso obtained with other zzso (over 600 zzso red, over 550 zzso orange, and under 500 zzso zzso in zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso conditions zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso For zzso there was a highly significant correlation between white and all zzso in zzso zzso r zzso 1, zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso conditions zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso In zzso as in controls, we found no zzso correlation and only in zzso we could not find a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that these situations are zzso zzso The closer correlation in zzso suggests more efficient zzso and in zzso there may also be a zzso zzso
