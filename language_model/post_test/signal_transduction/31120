zzso cells, which have a zzso zzso when cultured in zzso zzso extend zzso when zzso for 3 d with zzso II zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether growth factor receptors are necessary for zzso the effects of zzso zzso A zzso treatment with zzso an inhibitor of nerve growth factor zzso zzso strongly affected zzso outgrowth and zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso zzso slightly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of both zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso zzso on its own, without affecting further stimulation with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso II induced the zzso of zzso zzso at 5 zzso of incubation in the presence of serum or at 20 zzso in cells depleted in serum for 2 zzso and a rapid increase in zzso activity, both effects abolished in cells zzso with 10 zzso zzso In zzso the present results demonstrate that zzso zzso sustained zzso of zzso and corresponding zzso outgrowth are zzso by zzso of the nerve growth factor zzso zzso However, the results also point out that the presence of other growth factors, such as zzso or zzso may interfere with the effect of zzso zzso Altogether, the current findings clearly indicate that the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso outgrowth dynamics are modulated by the presence of growth factors in the culture zzso
