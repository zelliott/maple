zzso a regulator of Ras zzso family members, is zzso at low levels of zzso activity into an zzso zzso zzso N) that generates potent zzso zzso At higher levels of zzso activity, zzso N is further zzso into two fragments that strongly zzso zzso zzso could thus function as a sensor of zzso activity to determine whether a cell should survive or zzso Here we show that zzso N protects cells by zzso the zzso zzso Surprisingly, even though nuclear factor zzso zzso can be activated by zzso it plays no role in the zzso functions of zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso are zzso regulated when zzso N is zzso
