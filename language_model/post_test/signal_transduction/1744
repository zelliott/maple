zzso cell zzso of the head and neck are considered to be highly aggressive zzso The zzso survival rate of patients with this disease depends on whether a zzso zzso occurs and if so, how early after the initial zzso Disease was found to zzso more frequently in patients suffering from zzso with an invasive growth zzso It was therefore concluded that cancer cell invasion influences the patient's zzso While considerable efforts are made to develop treatment regimens for zzso disease, a novel approach consists of the prevention of the disease recurrence through the zzso of cancer cell zzso 

Literature zzso 

We zzso in this article the mechanisms of tumor invasion, focusing on the regulation of tumor zzso which are essential for cancer invasion, and provide an overview of preliminary results with novel zzso treatment zzso 

Novel zzso treatment regimens based on an understanding of molecular cancer invasion mechanisms may be used in the future to treat patients with head and neck zzso
