Alzheimer's disease zzso is the most common cause of zzso worldwide and mainly characterized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a novel synthetic zzso of natural zzso and has been proved to improve memory deficits in zzso animal zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of zzso zzso effect in zzso double transgenic mice and zzso zzso zzso The results showed that treatment with zzso significantly improved the memory deficits of zzso transgenic mice and decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso study showed that zzso zzso zzso processing, zzso zzso decreased zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and zzso precursor protein zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso reduced zzso production through zzso zzso zzso The zzso study about zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso revealed zzso the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso activity and inhibited zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso activity and zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso activity, indicating that zzso zzso might be the possible mechanism involved in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso These results suggested zzso might be a potential zzso drug as it not only reduced zzso production via zzso zzso zzso processing pathway, but also attenuated zzso zzso zzso by zzso
