To gain a better insight into zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso composition analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso carried out with zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso was found only in the zzso that formed less zzso compared to its zzso The influence of zzso on zzso formation was then studied by adding this substance gradually to six different zzso bacteria associated with various zzso Four bacterial species known to use the zzso zzso signaling system produced less zzso in the presence of zzso No significant zzso of zzso formation was observed in bacteria that produce zzso zzso signal zzso zzso was also immobilized on zzso zzso to determine its zzso for the study of zzso zzso The immobilized zzso retained zzso of its initial zzso activity after 10 repeated zzso The results of this study suggest the zzso role of zzso for bacteria that produce zzso
