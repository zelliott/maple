zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates a variety of cellular processes including zzso zzso survival, zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been observed in approximately one-third of zzso and this subset has very poor prognosis suggesting that targeting zzso signaling could be a promising strategy against this zzso Mel zzso and Mel zzso melanoma cells representative of cells with zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso and Mel 1011 representative of cells that lack this zzso were treated with a dietary zzso zzso and its effects on growth, zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso target genes were determined both in zzso and in zzso zzso treatment to Mel zzso and Mel zzso but not Mel 1011 cells resulted in a zzso zzso decrease in cell zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso decrease in zzso potential, zzso decrease in zzso zzso activity and zzso decrease in the expression of zzso target zzso Most importantly, zzso restricted the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso also decreased the growth of Mel zzso but not Mel zzso tumors implanted in the zzso nude zzso The decrease in Mel zzso tumor growth was associated with a decrease in the expression of zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso proliferation markers zzso cell nuclear zzso and zzso and invasion marker zzso We suggest that zzso alone or as an zzso to current therapies could be developed as an agent for the management of human zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso
