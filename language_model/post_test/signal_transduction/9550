zzso of zzso zzso is a major cause of vision impairment in low birth weight zzso While previous work has focused on defining the mechanisms of vascular injury leading to retinal zzso recent studies show that zzso are also zzso This study was undertaken to determine the role of the zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso 2 zzso in retinal zzso cell injury in the mouse model of zzso 

Studies were performed using wild type zzso and zzso knockout zzso mice exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injury and zzso were assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling and Western zzso zzso zzso was used to assess retinal zzso zzso injury in zzso zzso mice was evident by zzso zzso retinal zzso decreases in number of rod bipolar cells and zzso cell zzso as compared with room air zzso zzso reduction in numbers of zzso positive cells, zzso of retinal zzso preservation of the rod bipolar cells and prevention of zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso zzso function was markedly impaired in the zzso zzso mice as shown by decreases in zzso of the zzso of the zzso This zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso C and the zzso protein zzso were markedly increased in zzso zzso zzso compared to controls, whereas the zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso These zzso were largely blocked in the zzso zzso zzso 

Our data zzso zzso in zzso during zzso zzso of zzso significantly improves zzso survival and function, possibly through the regulation of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso during retinal zzso These molecular events are associated with decreased zzso of zzso cells, suggesting a rescue effect on zzso as zzso
