zzso analysis has established that the zzso tail of the zzso beta 3 zzso binds zzso zzso as zzso in this zzso and is critical for zzso zzso zzso Here we show in washed human zzso that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso beta 3 zzso sequence zzso inhibited stable zzso zzso and spreading on immobilized zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and zzso second wave of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso soluble zzso binding to zzso that is dependent on zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso from zzso beta 3 and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso beta 3 zzso domain binding to zzso In addition, zzso of the beta 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso These data indicate an important role for beta zzso interaction in zzso zzso Thus, in intact human zzso disruption of the association of zzso with beta 3 and selective blockade of zzso alpha zzso beta 3 zzso signaling by zzso suggest a potential new zzso zzso
