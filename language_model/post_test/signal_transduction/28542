zzso synaptic transmission is depressed by moderate rises in the zzso zzso concentration zzso Previous reports have indicated that depression of action potential signaling may zzso the synaptic zzso Here, we investigated the specific contribution of zzso action potential changes to synaptic zzso We found that zzso transmission in the zzso area zzso was significantly depressed by 8-10 zzso zzso but that zzso transmission remained zzso zzso a drug that slows recovery from zzso of zzso sodium channels zzso interacts with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, elevated zzso likely zzso zzso by slowing zzso recovery from zzso It is unclear from previous studies whether zzso action potential depression is caused by changes in zzso zzso or zzso We investigated these possibilities zzso zzso zzso zzso depression was independent of stimulus strength, suggesting that changes in action potential initiation do not explain zzso zzso zzso of action zzso from single zzso revealed that 8 zzso zzso increased zzso failures in a zzso of fibers and depressed action potential zzso in all zzso Together, these changes zzso account for the zzso zzso zzso We estimate that zzso failure explains more than half of the synaptic depression observed at 8 zzso zzso with the remaining depression likely explained by zzso zzso These mechanisms of selective sensitivity of zzso release to zzso zzso represent a unique zzso mechanism and a brake on runaway zzso
