Members of the zzso zzso of zzso and their upstream zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso , have emerged as key regulators of zzso and zzso zzso In their zzso bound form, these proteins interact with downstream zzso molecules that alter zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso have been implicated in the dramatic zzso shape changes that occur during zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells as a model system, we show that zzso zzso zzso cell shape changes by stimulating zzso II via the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso travels to the cell zzso on the tips of growing zzso by interaction with the zzso zzso tracking protein zzso The upstream zzso zzso in its zzso but not zzso bound form, zzso zzso from zzso tips and also causes cellular zzso We propose that zzso uses zzso dynamics to search for cortical zzso of zzso zzso zzso which in turn causes localized zzso contraction associated with zzso movements during zzso
