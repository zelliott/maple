Secondary zzso fusion requires zzso and zzso transition zzso of the zzso layers on opposing zzso zzso This zzso requires transforming growth factor zzso zzso and its failure results in zzso zzso zzso and their zzso the zzso are responsible for migration, zzso and zzso closure events throughout zzso zzso can also act as zzso receptors in these zzso with the zzso serving as zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso reverse signaling in chicken zzso induced fusion in the absence of zzso and that zzso zzso zzso this zzso Further, zzso of reverse signaling inhibited zzso fusion in the chicken and natural fusion in the zzso Thus, zzso reverse signaling is necessary and sufficient to induce zzso fusion independent of zzso These data describe both a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso and a previously unknown mechanism of zzso zzso
