zzso bone development is orchestrated by the zzso and temporally coordinated differentiation of zzso along the zzso axis of the cartilage zzso Initially, the slowly proliferating, zzso zzso give rise to the pool of rapidly dividing zzso zzso whose expansion determines the length of the long zzso The Indian zzso zzso zzso regulates both the proliferation of zzso zzso and their differentiation into zzso zzso zzso in concert with zzso one of the main zzso zzso of zzso signal zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso is zzso We now show that the zzso of limb long bones in zzso mouse zzso is aggravated by additional zzso of zzso Our analysis establishes that zzso and zzso zzso to control the zzso zzso of zzso differentiation during long bone zzso Whereas differentiation of limb zzso zzso into zzso and the initial formation of the cartilage zzso of the limb skeleton are not altered, zzso and zzso are required for the temporally coordinated differentiation of zzso into zzso and ultimately zzso zzso in long zzso In limbs lacking both zzso and zzso the appearance of zzso and zzso zzso is severely delayed and zones of zzso distinct zzso are not established until zzso At the molecular level, these zzso zzso are reflected by delayed zzso and lowered expression of zzso zzso and zzso in long bone rudiments of double zzso zzso In zzso our genetic analysis establishes that zzso plays a role in the zzso interactions and that zzso and zzso cooperate to regulate long bone development by modulating the zzso zzso of establishing zzso and zzso zzso zzso
