zzso a newly discovered zzso hormone that is produced by the stomach, and synthetic peptides have been identified recently as potent zzso zzso This effect is exerted through interaction with a specific zzso zzso zzso which is expressed mainly in the zzso zzso A study of the peripheral distribution of zzso receptors has shown that it is also present in cardiovascular zzso which has led to the exploration of the cardiovascular functions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso have several cardiovascular activities, including a zzso effect against zzso zzso and zzso and zzso effects in both experimental models and zzso These effects are zzso by the interaction of these zzso with binding sites, including zzso for which the zzso pathways are not documented zzso Identification of the cardiac and vascular binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso peptides will provide new perspectives for treating cardiovascular diseases with these zzso
