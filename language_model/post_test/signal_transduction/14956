The C zzso of the zzso zzso interacts with G zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso manner, suggesting that zzso changes induced by zzso in the zzso zzso are transmitted to the C zzso We used zzso resonance energy transfer zzso to examine zzso structural changes in the distance between two positions on the zzso C zzso and zzso 265 zzso at the zzso end of zzso domain zzso The donor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was attached to a zzso motif introduced at position zzso in the zzso C zzso or at the zzso C zzso An zzso zzso Alexa zzso zzso was attached to zzso zzso analyses revealed that the average distances between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso sites were 57 and zzso zzso These relatively large distances suggest that the C zzso is in an extended, relatively zzso zzso Nevertheless, we observed zzso changes in zzso All zzso induced an increase in zzso between the zzso zzso zzso site and zzso zzso that have been shown to induce zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and the inverse zzso zzso led to a decrease in zzso between the zzso zzso site and zzso whereas other zzso had no effect or induced a small increase in zzso Taken together the results provide new insight into the structure of the C zzso of the zzso as well as zzso zzso changes that may be relevant to zzso regulation and zzso
