The zzso zzso and its zzso are key components in a core zzso signaling zzso that regulates the spatial zzso timing and outcome of many zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso domain required for zzso zzso or zzso Here we report the X-ray structure of a zzso binding region of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso The structure reveals a highly zzso face of the zzso domain, and we show, by functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso that this surface is required for both zzso and zzso interactions with zzso We also zzso using zzso a surface of zzso involved in zzso zzso Our data imply that zzso and zzso may occur through the formation of structurally distinct complexes that, unexpectedly, involve the same surfaces on both zzso and zzso
