It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso have various reverse effects on zzso however, the molecular mechanism of this difference has not been fully zzso In this study, we analyzed the binding activity of zzso and zzso zzso molecules to two kinds of zzso zzso zzso zzso could bind to the zzso sequence in the promoter region of the zzso zzso but not to that in the promoter region of the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso could bind to both zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso without newly zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso but not zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso has a specificity in binding to the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso have a broader spectrum in binding to the zzso zzso This may explain the difference between zzso and zzso in biological activity, and the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso
