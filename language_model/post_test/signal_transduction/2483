zzso The role of zzso oxide zzso in the control of cell growth is controversial since both stimulation and (more zzso zzso have been demonstrated in various cell zzso In order to zzso the problem and identify the sites of NO action, we have employed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The effects of four zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso (10 zzso cell growth were estimated by both zzso incorporation and the zzso zzso zzso while those of a zzso generated in response to zzso zzso zzso were revealed by the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies were focused on: zzso multiple zzso events, including zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso the progression through the cell cycle, dissected out by the use of zzso (1 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso NO was found to have no effects on the zzso events of the growth factor zzso In contrast, later processes were modified by the zzso but with opposite zzso zzso A zzso zzso stimulation of growth was shown to be sustained in part by the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, while a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso by both the negative regulation of zzso zzso and the marked slowing down of the cell cycle occurring at early and late zzso and during the S zzso zzso Although multiple and apparently zzso the effects of NO here described could work zzso in a general zzso of cell growth zzso In particular, the zzso zzso actions might function as rapid zzso events, while the effects on cell cycle might operate collectively as a zzso process whenever growth zzso is zzso
