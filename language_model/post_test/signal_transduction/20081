The zzso of the small zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso and airway smooth muscle zzso contraction, but the mechanism by which it regulates these events is zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso by the zzso filament nucleation zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso and tension zzso We assessed the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso dynamics and smooth muscle contraction by expressing the dominant negative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deletion zzso in zzso zzso Their effects were evaluated in muscle tissue extracts and freshly zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions and cellular zzso were analyzed using proximity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the interaction of zzso with the zzso complex at the cell zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and its association with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso were zzso and were required for zzso zzso The zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso to the cell membrane was dependent on zzso We conclude that zzso regulates the contraction of zzso by catalyzing the assembly and zzso of zzso signaling zzso at membrane zzso that initiate signaling zzso that regulate zzso zzso and tension development in response to zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso assembly of zzso complexes is a fundamental step in the signal zzso process in response to zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso
