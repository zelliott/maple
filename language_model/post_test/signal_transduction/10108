In this communication, we present a genetic analysis of the zzso promoter region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were used to characterize the zzso promoter by deletion and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression analysis was performed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains to reveal the role of the global nitrogen responsive zzso factor zzso and of the zzso zzso protein on regulation of zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso motif is responsible for zzso zzso regulation of zzso The zzso zzso protein has opposing effects on zzso zzso zzso Under conditions of zzso it zzso zzso whereas under conditions of combined nitrogen zzso it is required for full zzso Furthermore, sequences upstream of the zzso site have repressive effect on zzso promoter zzso
