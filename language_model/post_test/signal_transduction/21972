In zzso the zzso family of zzso factors activates or zzso zzso depending on the cellular zzso In the current study, we explored the interaction between zzso and zzso signaling in zzso cells using zzso cells and the zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in each cell line and the small zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso expression was increased in both whole cell and nuclear zzso by zzso and in zzso in zzso mice, indicating a potential interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso of a zzso reporter in both zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of truncated zzso zzso revealed a 155 zzso acid, zzso sequence between zzso acids 106 and 261 that was required for enhancement of zzso zzso zzso experiments with nuclear extracts from zzso zzso cells revealed an association between zzso and the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso decreased the association between the zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso Ski and zzso indicating a possible mechanism for the enhancement of zzso by zzso zzso These observations were confirmed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in Ski and zzso Finally, zzso zzso enhanced the zzso induction of zzso muscle zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso plays a functional role in zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified an interaction between zzso and zzso proteins that enhances zzso zzso Since zzso signaling is primarily known as a zzso regulated pathway, the enhancement of signaling by zzso has novel implications for understanding zzso zzso
