The association between zzso states and numerous diseases is widely zzso but our understanding of the molecular strategies that have evolved to prevent uncontrolled zzso of inflammatory responses remains zzso Here, we report a critical, zzso role of zzso as a zzso against zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso actions are required to specifically zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso relevance of zzso zzso role is confirmed by zzso of zzso target genes in zzso and by improved insulin signaling in the zzso tissue of zzso transgenic zzso As the zzso role is zzso by zzso functioning as positive and negative zzso for nuclear zzso in zzso zzso also results in elevated circulating level of zzso and development of zzso zzso Together, these studies define zzso as a molecular zzso required for precise control of inflammatory responses involved in immunity and zzso
