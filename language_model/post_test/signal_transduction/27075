An zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso cotton zzso and wheat zzso genes was cloned and its expression zzso at two zzso stages in zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso lines of zzso zzso zzso of this gene was reduced slightly in seeds of zzso zzso and approximately zzso in zzso zzso but seed expression was not decreased in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso showed a very slight reduction of zzso zzso in zzso plants, while the responses of zzso and zzso zzso were comparable to that of wild zzso Although previous studies have shown that none of the zzso zzso show completely zzso effects, the results reported here indicate that the importance of each of the zzso zzso in regulating this single gene is zzso Furthermore, the fact that none of the zzso zzso show more than minor effects on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in young plants suggests that an additional zzso zzso zzso may be operating during zzso zzso
