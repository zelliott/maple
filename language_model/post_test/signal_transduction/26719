As embryonic zzso for the zzso zzso zzso germ zzso zzso and develop under strict regulation of numerous intrinsic and external zzso As the most active natural zzso of vitamin A, zzso zzso zzso zzso plays pivotal roles in regulating development of various zzso The zzso action of zzso on zzso was investigated along with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso significantly promoted zzso proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner, confirmed by zzso zzso incorporation and cell cycle zzso However, this promoting effect was attenuated by sequential zzso of zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso after stimulation with zzso but this was abolished by zzso or zzso Treatment with zzso increased expression of zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso which were inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso activity inhibited zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso Finally, zzso expression of cell cycle regulating genes zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso This stimulation was also markedly retarded by combined treatment with zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso activates the zzso and zzso zzso cascade to promote proliferation of the cultured chicken zzso
