Our previous work demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso regulatory factor 4 binding protein zzso was correlated with the zzso zzso of human breast cancer zzso The mechanisms controlling differential expression of zzso in breast cancer still remain zzso 

To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso in breast cancer, we identified zzso was a novel zzso target zzso zzso expression was zzso regulated by zzso zzso and was zzso zzso suppressed by DNA damage agent zzso Furthermore, high levels of zzso were found to decrease zzso growth suppression and zzso cell death, which was associated with decreased zzso activity and zzso zzso family member zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso target gene which suppresses zzso zzso of breast cancer cells via negative feedback regulation of the zzso zzso pathway, suggesting zzso may serve as a target for zzso intervention of breast cancer resistant to zzso zzso
