We evaluated the role of the activated Ras and zzso zzso Middle zzso signaling pathways on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso in human zzso zzso cell zzso Control zzso zzso cell zzso preparations zzso responded to zzso with an increase in short circuit current zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso cells responded to zzso a reported zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a potential source of zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso showed no sustained zzso response to zzso or zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso effectively zzso zzso activity and restored expression of zzso zzso but failed to re-establish functional zzso These data suggest that, stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the Ras or zzso zzso leads to an absence of zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line is zzso primarily by zzso and an alternate zzso zzso channel is not functional in these zzso
