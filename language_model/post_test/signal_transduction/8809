Use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to treat asthma zzso an increased risk of asthma morbidity with impaired zzso and heightened zzso reflecting the adverse effects of prolonged zzso zzso zzso on airway smooth muscle zzso zzso Since zzso 4 zzso regulates zzso relaxation and zzso we examined whether the changes in zzso function induced by prolonged zzso zzso zzso are attributed to altered expression and action of zzso zzso human zzso cells and isolated rabbit zzso zzso exposed for 24 h to the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited impaired acute zzso zzso zzso and relaxation, respectively, together with zzso zzso zzso These zzso changes in zzso function were associated with zzso zzso activity due to enhanced expression of the zzso zzso and were prevented by zzso the zzso preparations with the zzso inhibitor zzso or with zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso studies using gene zzso and pharmacological approaches demonstrated that: 1) the mechanism underlying zzso zzso expression following prolonged zzso zzso exposure involves zzso zzso of zzso protein signaling via its zzso which elicits downstream zzso of zzso and its induction of zzso zzso and 2) the induction of zzso activity and zzso changes in zzso responsiveness are prevented by zzso the zzso zzso zzso preparations with zzso of zzso zzso zzso these findings identify that the zzso changes in zzso function resulting from prolonged zzso zzso zzso are attributed to zzso zzso expression induced by zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
