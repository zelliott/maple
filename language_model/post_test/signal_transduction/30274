Cell zzso during zzso development is zzso regulated by light and zzso zzso Light zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso growth, whereas zzso promote zzso growth, characterized by increased zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this zzso interaction remains zzso Here we report on the central role of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 4) in the positive control of genes zzso cell zzso and show that this factor is zzso regulated by the light zzso zzso zzso 4) and by zzso proteins that have a key zzso function in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is zzso by zzso in the light and that zzso block zzso zzso activity by binding the zzso domain of this zzso We show that zzso abrogate such repression by promoting zzso zzso and therefore cause a zzso zzso of free zzso in the zzso zzso with this model, intermediate zzso lengths were observed in transgenic plants zzso both zzso and zzso zzso of this factor by zzso together with its zzso by zzso constitutes a protein interaction framework that explains how plants integrate both light and zzso signals to zzso growth and development in response to changing zzso
