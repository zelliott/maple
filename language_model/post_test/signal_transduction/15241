zzso a zzso zzso is a critical regulator in many cellular processes including cell growth, zzso and zzso In this study, we found that zzso a typical zzso existing in many fruits and vegetables, could directly target zzso to inhibit cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso bound to zzso directly by competing with zzso In zzso and ex zzso data confirmed that zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso modeling suggested that zzso easily zzso to the zzso site of zzso with hydrogen zzso Signaling analysis data further demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 expression and cell zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso is a direct target for zzso to inhibit cell zzso
