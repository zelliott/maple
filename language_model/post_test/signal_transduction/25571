The Crohn's disease and early onset zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates innate immune signaling zzso Because zzso of this coordination can lead to inflammatory disease, maintaining appropriate zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is paramount in zzso zzso In this work, we identify the zzso tumor necrosis zzso factor zzso family member, zzso as a key negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and directly binds to zzso to inhibit zzso bacterial zzso We find that two consecutive zzso zzso in zzso are required for interaction with zzso and zzso of zzso signaling because zzso of these zzso zzso both zzso binding and zzso of zzso This work identifies a novel negative regulator of zzso zzso Additionally, it defines a zzso binding motif within zzso involved in termination of innate immune signaling zzso
