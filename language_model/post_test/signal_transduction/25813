The understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has come from studies carried out in the zzso zzso model of MN in the zzso which closely resembles the clinical and zzso features of the human zzso MN involves the in zzso formation of zzso immune deposits as a result of circulating zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to assembly of zzso on zzso plasma zzso and results in zzso zzso injury and zzso The zzso responds to zzso zzso attack by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, growth factors, zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso These signals impact on cell zzso zzso the zzso of lipids and key proteins in the zzso and slit zzso and on the turnover of zzso zzso zzso Some effects of zzso including dissolution of the zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso and loss of slit zzso integrity, affect zzso zzso Other effects of complement, such as zzso zzso stress, may limit injury or promote zzso A number of studies have confirmed the relevance of several experimental insights to the zzso of human zzso including the presence of zzso directed to zzso zzso in human zzso Increased understanding of zzso zzso complement zzso and the cellular signaling pathways and targets of zzso will facilitate the design of new approaches to therapy of this important zzso zzso
