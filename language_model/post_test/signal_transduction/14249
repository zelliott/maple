The maintenance of sexual reproduction in zzso is still a major zzso in evolutionary zzso zzso represents the only common feature of sex in all zzso zzso and thus, we regard it a key issue for discussing its zzso Almost all zzso modes maintain zzso either in a modified form or as an alternative pathway, and zzso zzso plants increase zzso of sexuality relative to zzso after zzso zzso On the zzso level, zzso stress causes zzso zzso We zzso that repair of zzso damage on nuclear DNA could be a major driving force in the evolution of zzso We present a hypothetical model for the possible zzso chemistry that zzso the binding of the zzso protein zzso to zzso During zzso of zzso I, oxidized sites at the DNA zzso are being targeted by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which acts like an zzso reducing the oxidized zzso The oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso attack the zzso bonds of the DNA backbone causing DNA double strand breaks that can be repaired by various zzso zzso in zzso plants could mitigate zzso DNA damage and decrease zzso zzso Our hypothesis may contribute to explaining various enigmatic zzso first, zzso formation zzso crossovers and, thus, effective zzso events by far because the target of zzso may be the removal of zzso zzso second, it offers an argument for why expression of sexuality is responsive to stress in many zzso and third, repair of zzso DNA damage turns zzso into an essential characteristic of zzso zzso
