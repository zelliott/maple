Small zzso zzso of type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso signals, have been employed extensively to assess their zzso roles in cells and zzso While all of these zzso have been reported as zzso zzso of specific zzso extensive specificity tests against a wide array of protein zzso have not been zzso In this study, we examine the zzso and zzso of the most frequently used small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso against a panel of up to 123 protein zzso covering a broad spectrum of the human zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso zzso are relatively more selective than the zzso of the zzso zzso Based on our specificity and potency profile and published data, we recommend zzso as the most suitable zzso for use as an inhibitor of zzso 4, 5 and 7 and the zzso zzso We do not recommend zzso also called zzso C, for use as an inhibitor of the zzso zzso Although zzso a zzso zzso is a very potent inhibitor of zzso and the zzso we found that it zzso inhibited a number of other protein zzso at zzso sufficient to inhibit zzso and its use as a selective zzso inhibitor has to be considered zzso Our observations have highlighted the need for caution when using these small zzso zzso to assess the zzso roles of zzso and zzso zzso
