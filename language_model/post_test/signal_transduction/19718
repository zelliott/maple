zzso the primary zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that zzso by acting on zzso zzso is also involved in airway inflammation and zzso The zzso by which zzso receptors regulate inflammatory responses are, however, still zzso 

The present study was aimed at characterizing the effect of zzso zzso stimulation on zzso zzso by human airway smooth muscle cells zzso and to dissect the zzso zzso mechanisms zzso zzso expressing functional zzso zzso and zzso receptors were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone, and in combination with cigarette smoke extract zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso stimulation induced modest zzso zzso by itself, yet zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso or zzso but not with zzso zzso with zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso completely zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso a zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso inducing zzso zzso and zzso the effects of zzso Similar zzso was observed using zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both downstream zzso of zzso zzso western zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso the degradation of zzso and the zzso of zzso in combination with zzso but not with zzso in zzso 

We conclude that zzso receptors facilitate zzso zzso zzso by zzso via zzso dependent zzso of zzso and zzso This mechanism could be of importance for COPD patients using zzso
