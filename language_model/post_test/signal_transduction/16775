A novel class of low molecular weight zzso of zzso and zzso zzso that possess a zzso acid as zzso constrained core, linked to the zzso zzso mimicking the zzso recognition zzso have been zzso through a very simple zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso experiments suggested a good affinity of these compounds toward both zzso zzso Moreover, further zzso with two zzso units allowed to obtain an excellent dual zzso zzso models for zzso zzso binding confirmed that the zzso derivatives are able to act as an zzso clamp by establishing several stabilizing interactions with the zzso
