zzso control analysis zzso was developed to zzso how system variables are affected by zzso variations in a zzso In addition, zzso can express the global properties of a system in terms of the individual zzso steps, using connectivity and zzso zzso to link the control zzso to the elasticity zzso zzso was originally developed for zzso analysis and not all zzso zzso have been derived for dynamic zzso A method to determine zzso flux and concentration control zzso for dynamic systems by expressing the time domain as a function of percentage progression through any arbitrary fixed zzso of time is zzso zzso flux and concentration control zzso of dynamic systems, provided that they are evaluated in this novel way, obey the same zzso zzso as zzso flux and concentration control zzso zzso
