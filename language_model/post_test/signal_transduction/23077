The effect of the zzso virus zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso on the zzso and differentiation of normal B cells was zzso B cells of transgenic mice expressing zzso under the control of zzso zzso displayed enhanced expression of zzso zzso and spontaneously proliferated and produced zzso zzso immune responses of zzso transgenic mice in zzso or normal backgrounds revealed that zzso mimics zzso signals to induce zzso B cell differentiation but, unlike zzso blocks zzso center zzso Thus, these specific properties of zzso may determine the site of primary B cell infection and the state of infection in the natural course of zzso infection, whereas subsequent loss of zzso expression may affect the site of persistent zzso zzso
