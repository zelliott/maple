The initiation of programmed cell death at zzso zzso zzso is achieved by forming a zzso signaling complex zzso at the zzso membrane zzso Assembly of the zzso has been proposed to occur via zzso interactions between the death domain zzso of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso Previous analysis of the zzso interaction led to the identification of a putative zzso binding surface within zzso zzso formed by alpha zzso 2 and zzso More detailed analysis of the zzso zzso interaction now demonstrates that a zzso surface exists in the zzso zzso for interaction with zzso An expansive surface on one side of the domain is composed of elements in alpha zzso 1, 2, 3, 5, and zzso This major surface is common to many proteins harboring this zzso whether or not they are associated with programmed cell zzso A secondary surface resides on the opposite face of the domain and involves zzso in zzso 3 and zzso The major surface is zzso similar to the protein interaction surface identified in zzso zzso zzso and the death zzso domain of zzso zzso two zzso unrelated proteins which interact with structurally unrelated binding zzso These results demonstrate the presence of a structurally zzso surface within the zzso which can mediate protein recognition with zzso and zzso binding partners, whereas a second surface may be responsible for stabilizing the higher order complex in the zzso
