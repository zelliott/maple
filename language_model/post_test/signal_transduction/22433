An overwhelming immune response, particularly from zzso with zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in survival of and organ damage in infected zzso zzso zzso a major structure protein of zzso regulates many cellular zzso We examined the vital role of zzso in the response of zzso and mice to bacteria or zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the expression of zzso and zzso during zzso differentiation and suppressed their zzso zzso As well, the ability to kill bacteria was inhibited in zzso zzso and mice zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was partly attributed to hindered expression of zzso induced by bacteria or zzso Furthermore, deletion of zzso attenuated the expression of zzso zzso 4 and zzso differentiation factor 88 and the zzso of nuclear factor zzso all of which zzso the production of inflammatory zzso in response to bacterial exposure in zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 and zzso differentiation factor 88 protein expression and is crucial for the immune response of zzso to bacterial zzso zzso may be a therapeutic target in the treatment of zzso
