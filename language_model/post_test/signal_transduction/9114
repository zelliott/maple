zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the cardiac mechanical stretch sensor and is bound in a protein complex with zzso and zzso zzso the so-called zzso zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso of zzso or zzso activity leads to heart failure in zzso via reduced protein zzso B zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso proteins zzso at zzso Z disks and zzso in the zzso heart and skeletal zzso To investigate the in zzso role of zzso proteins for zzso complex stability and zzso signaling within the zzso heart, we zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of either zzso zzso independently leads to instability of zzso loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and progressive heart zzso The zzso cause of heart failure in zzso zzso seems to be loss of zzso activity, since zzso zzso at zzso zzso is significantly reduced in zzso hearts and zzso of zzso active zzso zzso cardiac function in zzso zzso These findings highlight the essential function of zzso proteins in controlling cardiac zzso by granting zzso zzso
