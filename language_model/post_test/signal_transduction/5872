In this review we discuss current findings in the human skeletal muscle literature describing the acute influence of nutrients zzso essential zzso acids in zzso and resistance exercise on muscle protein synthesis and zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso We show that essential zzso acids and an acute bout of resistance exercise independently stimulate human skeletal muscle protein zzso It also appears that zzso of essential zzso acids following resistance exercise leads to an even larger increase in the rate of muscle protein synthesis compared with the independent effects of nutrients or muscle zzso Until recently the cellular mechanisms responsible for controlling the rate of muscle protein synthesis in humans were zzso In this review, we highlight new studies in humans that have clearly shown the zzso signaling zzso is playing an important regulatory role in controlling muscle protein synthesis in response to nutrients and/or muscle zzso We propose that essential zzso acid zzso shortly following a bout of resistance exercise is beneficial in promoting skeletal muscle growth and may be useful in zzso muscle wasting in a variety of conditions such as aging, cancer zzso physical zzso and perhaps during rehabilitation following trauma or zzso
