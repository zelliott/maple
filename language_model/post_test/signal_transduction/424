zzso zzso protein zzso has been suggested to be a central player regulating zzso zzso zzso metabolism through its ability to regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, its involvement in insulin zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso remains zzso In the present study, we employed the zzso zzso zzso a well-established model of insulin resistance and zzso in order to appreciate the contribution of the zzso zzso to the abnormal zzso zzso synthesis and increased zzso zzso in the zzso Our investigation provided evidence that the development of insulin zzso state in zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso body weight gain and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso a rise in the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso zzso and protein expression without any modification in the calculated ratio of zzso to total zzso zzso a stimulation in zzso activity despite increased zzso zzso and protein zzso and zzso a trend of increase in zzso levels of key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso Altogether, our findings suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso seems to be a natural response in order to reduce zzso metabolism zzso thus supporting the role of zzso as a promising target for the treatment of zzso zzso
