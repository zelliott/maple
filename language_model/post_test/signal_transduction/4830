zzso is the common hair loss problem that can affect many zzso However, current therapies for treatment of zzso are limited by low efficacy and potentially zzso side zzso We have identified a new function for zzso acid zzso a zzso inhibitor that activates the zzso pathway, to promote hair zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso application of zzso to male zzso mice critically zzso hair zzso and induced terminally differentiated zzso markers such as zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso marker alkaline zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in human zzso zzso cells by zzso the zzso pathway, whereas zzso zzso a drug commonly used to treat zzso did not significantly affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso that activate the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso also exhibited hair zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso successfully stimulate hair growth in the wounds of zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that small molecules that activate the zzso pathway, such as zzso can potentially be developed as drugs to stimulate hair zzso
