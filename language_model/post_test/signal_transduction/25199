zzso stimulates zzso release and zzso zzso zzso channels in rat superior cervical zzso zzso via G zzso zzso zzso To investigate the underlying signaling mechanisms, we treated the zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso neither treatment altered the zzso of zzso zzso channels by 10 zzso zzso However, zzso toxin reduced zzso zzso release by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso release (by zzso of zzso C, of zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso of M currents but failed to alter zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso acid also reduced the zzso of M currents by zzso In addition, all these zzso attenuated the zzso of M currents by zzso but hardly affected the zzso action of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso channels via an zzso zzso signaling cascade that is also used by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso action of zzso is largely independent of this signaling cascade but involves zzso zzso G zzso Thus, zzso zzso receptors zzso sympathetic zzso via at least two different signal zzso zzso
