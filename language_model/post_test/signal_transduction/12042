zzso zzso develop from limb zzso which emerge as paired zzso in the lateral plate zzso zzso buds are located zzso and zzso buds are positioned zzso The zzso of the limb requires coordinated actions of several organizing centers, among which the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays crucial roles in limb zzso Recent studies have shown how the life of the zzso zzso zzso maintenance and zzso is zzso This regulation includes cell zzso and zzso specific roles of previously identified zzso such as zzso growth factors zzso zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso The studies have also revealed several new players, such as zzso zzso 2 and zzso These advances have enhanced the understanding of how the zzso is regulated from its emergence to its zzso Progress has also been made in understanding zzso function in relation to processes critical for limb development: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By focusing on two major model systems, chick and mouse zzso we will review recent advances in combination with relevant previous studies in the development and function of the zzso
