Cellular processes are regulated by signals generated by zzso receptors and growth factor zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso which may affect the both signaling pathways through zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and binding to zzso region of zzso zzso Whether this phenomenon is important in communication between zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso in regulation of zzso activity and collagen zzso is the aim of this zzso 

We studied the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso on zzso activity, collagen zzso and expression of proteins participating in pathways generated by these zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso receptors by standard zzso was proved to zzso collagen synthesis in cultured zzso zzso similarly as zzso and studied zzso contributed to zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso It was accompanied by parallel decrease in zzso activity and collagen zzso 

The data suggest that zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso may play important role in regulation of zzso activity and collagen zzso
