The major forms of diabetes are characterized by pancreatic zzso zzso dysfunction and decreased zzso numbers, raising hope for cell replacement zzso Although human zzso transplantation is a zzso therapy under clinical investigation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, the limited availability of human zzso zzso for transplantation will zzso its widespread therapeutic zzso The result has been an intense focus on the development of alternate sources of beta cells, such as through the guided differentiation of stem or precursor cell populations or the zzso of more plentiful mature cell zzso Realizing the potential for zzso therapies, however, requires a thorough understanding of zzso development and zzso zzso zzso development is coordinated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways and zzso factors that determine early pancreatic zzso as well as the later differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso This review describes the current knowledge of these factors as they relate specifically to the emergence of zzso beta cells from pancreatic zzso Current therapeutic efforts to generate zzso zzso cells from embryonic stem cells have already capitalized on recent advances in our understanding of the embryonic signals and zzso factors that dictate lineage zzso and will most certainly be further enhanced by a continuing emphasis on the identification of novel factors and regulatory zzso
