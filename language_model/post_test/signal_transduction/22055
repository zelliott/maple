zzso is highly prevalent in the general population and is one of the most common side effects of cancer zzso There is growing evidence that zzso zzso play a role in zzso fatigue, although the molecular mechanisms for chronic inflammation and fatigue have not been zzso The current study zzso zzso expression zzso to identify differences in gene expression and associated zzso in zzso activity in zzso from breast cancer survivors with persistent fatigue zzso and zzso controls zzso We focused on zzso of zzso zzso particularly those responsive to the zzso zzso zzso control zzso Further, given the role of zzso as key regulators of inflammatory zzso we examined zzso of zzso genes indicative of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma levels of cortisol were also zzso zzso with zzso results showed increased expression of transcripts with response elements for zzso and reduced expression of transcripts with response elements for zzso zzso in fatigued breast cancer zzso No differences in plasma levels of cortisol were zzso These data indicate that increased activity of zzso zzso factors may contribute to persistent zzso fatigue and provide insight into potential mechanisms for zzso increases in zzso activity, specifically decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso
