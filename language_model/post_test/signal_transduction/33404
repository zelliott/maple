zzso of zzso zzso on cerebral cortical zzso were examined by patch clamp zzso zzso produced a variety of responses such as outward zzso zzso slow inward zzso zzso fast inward zzso zzso and mixed currents zzso fast inward zzso followed by an outward response: zzso zzso with a zzso of 12 zzso 15 zzso 0 zzso and 0 zzso respectively, at a holding potential of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The fast inward currents were again evoked by a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso patch clamp zzso zzso inside the patch zzso zzso single channel currents with slope zzso of 42 zzso and 132 zzso zzso zzso zzso inside the patch zzso evoked inward single channel currents with a lower slope zzso of 41 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, application of zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso outside the patch zzso induced outward single channel currents with a major slope zzso of 140 zzso zzso zzso or 135 zzso zzso patches zzso zzso These results indicate that the outward and fast inward currents may be zzso respectively by the zzso zzso which is coupled to a zzso and by the zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso channel, and that the mixed type may be caused by both the zzso and zzso zzso
