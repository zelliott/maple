In mouse zzso lacking sonic zzso zzso zzso polarity within the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including the cochlear duct and zzso fail to form, and zzso zzso zzso including the semicircular canals, zzso duct and zzso are zzso or zzso Since inner ear patterning and zzso are heavily dependent on zzso signals derived from zzso that are also compromised by the loss of zzso the extent to which zzso signaling acts directly on the inner ear for its development is zzso To address this question, we generated zzso in which zzso zzso an essential zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives failed to form in zzso zzso whereas zzso structures developed zzso zzso with these findings, we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso zzso identity is directly dependent on zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso formation is more complex, as both direct and indirect signaling mechanisms are zzso Our data suggest that the loss of zzso zzso in zzso animals is due, in part, to an increase in zzso responsiveness in the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso expression of zzso in the zzso domain and subsequent repression of zzso zzso A zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso proliferation was also revealed in our analysis of zzso zzso Taken together, these data contribute to a better understanding of the intrinsic and zzso signaling properties of zzso during inner ear zzso
