Recently, we identified a novel zzso between insulin and G zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso enhanced zzso signaling through a zzso zzso zzso zzso the most widely used drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, activates zzso zzso zzso which zzso regulates zzso Here, we determined whether zzso zzso the zzso between insulin zzso and zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso Treatment of human pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso with insulin (10 zzso for 5 minutes markedly enhanced the increase in zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling but did not interfere with the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso growth, measured by DNA zzso and the number of cells cultured in adherent or zzso zzso Low doses of zzso zzso zzso blocked the stimulation of DNA zzso and the zzso and zzso growth induced by insulin and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso induced striking and sustained increase in the zzso of zzso at zzso and a selective zzso inhibitor zzso C, at 5 zzso reversed the effects of zzso on zzso and DNA zzso indicating that zzso acts through zzso zzso In view of these results, we tested whether zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso Administration of zzso significantly decreased the growth of zzso and zzso cells zzso on the flank of nude zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso could be a potential candidate in novel treatment strategies for human pancreatic zzso
