A recent analysis of the zzso zzso gene family from zzso revealed that three zzso zzso proteins lack zzso activity, but share about 50% identity with the primary zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Since the zzso protein is predicted to bind zzso although with a relatively decreased zzso a reverse zzso approach was used to test whether zzso might have a related regulatory function in plant zzso By comparing zzso of an zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and transgenic lines that zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso genetic backgrounds, it is shown that zzso is a negative zzso of plant zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso lines are generally very similar to those of zzso These are zzso in part, as reduced zzso sensitivity to high zzso zzso and reduced zzso sensitivity to zzso lateral root zzso However, commonly recognized targets of zzso zzso are not apparently altered in any of the zzso zzso or transgenic zzso In fact, most, but not all, of the observed zzso associated with zzso zzso occur independently of the presence of zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso mediates zzso between zzso and other plant hormone response zzso It is also considered Whether a possibly decreased zzso binding affinity of zzso could possibly be a feedback mechanism to limit plant growth in the presence of excessive zzso availability is further zzso
