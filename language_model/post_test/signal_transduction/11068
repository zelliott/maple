We previously reported that the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso expresses at least three zzso alpha zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is essential for regulated growth, zzso zzso and zzso We now report the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso regulator of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationship of zzso to zzso from other zzso was zzso and found to be generally zzso with species relationships based on zzso zzso sequences and on zzso However, zzso zzso branch lengths in particular were longer than for their zzso sequence counterparts, which zzso with functional diversification in the signaling zzso zzso of zzso resulted in reduced growth, sparse aerial zzso and loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was also accompanied by a severe zzso reduction in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and severely reduced expression of the zzso gene zzso The changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting from zzso gene deletion were also observed in a strain containing a zzso activated copy of zzso but not in strains containing zzso activated zzso zzso of the other two identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso transcript levels were increased in the activated zzso strain but were zzso in activated zzso and zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that zzso is involved in regulation of zzso zzso zzso signaling and establish a role for a zzso protein in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in a plant zzso zzso
