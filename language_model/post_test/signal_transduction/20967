The zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line represents a well-established system for the study of zzso signaling in zzso We have investigated the functional specificity of different zzso X zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs for the control of expression of zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that in these cells the control of expression of different sets of zzso genes is zzso zzso by distinct zzso zzso zzso Our data support the conclusion that zzso zzso are the functional units zzso the zzso signal and indicate in addition that these zzso exert both specific and redundant functions on the expression of particular sets of zzso zzso We also show that the presence of a given zzso zzso can hinder the activity of another zzso and therefore that functional zzso between zzso zzso zzso can be zzso generated by gene zzso
