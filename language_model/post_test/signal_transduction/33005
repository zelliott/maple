zzso zzso is a zzso protein that displays both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso mediates most high affinity binding of soluble zzso to zzso cells, but attachment and spreading of these cells on immobilized zzso is primarily zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the major zzso of breast zzso cell zzso and zzso to zzso This zzso is partially active in zzso cells but is mostly inactive in zzso and zzso cells, which require zzso zzso zzso to induce spreading on zzso zzso cell spreading on zzso is accompanied by extension of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso binding activity of the zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso peptides from zzso or by protein zzso C zzso which activate zzso zzso function in the same zzso In zzso but not zzso cells, this zzso is activated by zzso zzso whereas serum, insulin, zzso growth zzso and zzso of zzso increase activity of this zzso in both cell zzso zzso stimulation is accompanied by increased surface expression of zzso whereas zzso growth zzso does not increase zzso zzso Thus, the zzso activity of zzso for breast zzso cells is controlled by several signals that regulate activity of the zzso zzso
