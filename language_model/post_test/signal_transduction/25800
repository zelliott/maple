zzso of cellular zzso via initiation at Internal zzso zzso Sites zzso has received increased attention during recent years due to its emerging significance for many zzso and pathological stress conditions in zzso zzso zzso of genes bearing zzso elements in their zzso is controlled by multiple molecular mechanisms, with zzso translation favored under conditions when zzso translation is zzso In this review, we discuss recent advances in the field and future directions that may bring us closer to understanding the complex mechanisms that guide cellular zzso zzso We present examples in which the competitive action of zzso factors zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso translation and thereby controls zzso decisions leading to either zzso stress adaptation or cell zzso
