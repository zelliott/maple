Little is known about plant zzso zzso in spite of how important they are to zzso plants, which require accurate zzso that enable the plants to respond to their zzso Previously, we identified a zzso zzso zzso gene that encodes an zzso protein that is associated with zzso control and zzso regulation in zzso To understand the role zzso plays in zzso and zzso regulation, we have isolated an zzso line with a T DNA zzso that results in the loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of an zzso binding zzso This zzso affects the zzso expression of all four zzso genes that we zzso The results show that, despite their zzso zzso and zzso are only partially zzso The lack of zzso also affects the zzso regulation of gene zzso suggesting that zzso has an additional role in a signal zzso zzso from light, possibly acting at the point of integration between zzso and the zzso Our results indicate that zzso is an important zzso protein involved in zzso regulation of gene zzso
