zzso formation is a process characterized by smooth muscle cell zzso proliferation and zzso zzso deposition in the vascular zzso zzso Here, we critically evaluate the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are particularly abundant in zzso where they are thought to function in membrane trafficking and signal zzso zzso To directly evaluate the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso mice as a model zzso The right common carotid artery of zzso and zzso zzso mice was zzso just zzso to its zzso zzso were then harvested zzso zzso and processed for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice showed significantly more zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso These zzso zzso consisted mainly of zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso mice exhibited higher levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso consistent with the idea that zzso functions as a negative regulator of signal zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso zzso was also observed, in line with the zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, using a carotid artery zzso zzso model, we show that genetic zzso of zzso in mice stimulates zzso proliferation zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cascade and zzso of zzso zzso zzso our current study is the first to investigate the role of zzso in zzso proliferation in the vascular system using zzso zzso zzso
