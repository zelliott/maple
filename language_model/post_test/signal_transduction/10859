The zzso zzso zzso signal zzso network, which regulates the cellular response to zzso zzso zzso the activity of three signal zzso systems to regulate the level of the zzso zzso This signal zzso network includes a positive feedback loop between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within this network, zzso is responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso To date, the role of zzso in the generation of the zzso response has not been zzso zzso of two terminal zzso requires zzso function, and expression of at least one terminal zzso is needed for the zzso zzso zzso Previously, our investigators have shown that strains bearing zzso in zzso are impaired for growth and acquire secondary zzso which compensate for the loss of the zzso terminal zzso by allowing production of zzso zzso We report here that the expression of zzso zzso in a zzso background is sufficient to compensate for the loss of zzso for full zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain, deficient in the production of zzso A, has the same zzso induction zzso as a zzso zzso This demonstrates that the production of zzso terminal zzso is the basis for the role of zzso in zzso zzso Terminal zzso affect the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso in zzso consistent with a requirement for terminal zzso for full zzso induction in zzso
