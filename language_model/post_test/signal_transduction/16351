zzso 71 zzso a single, zzso zzso virus, has been regarded as the most important zzso zzso after the zzso of the zzso zzso infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease or zzso zzso storm with elevated levels of zzso and inflammatory zzso including zzso has been proposed to explain the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a key role in inflammatory zzso We hypothesized that zzso might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this zzso In this study, we tested this hypothesis and identified zzso zzso protein as an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso protein significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells as measured by gene reporter and gel mobility shift zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not zzso active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso These data together suggested that the zzso of zzso is most likely targeted by zzso this notion was further strengthened by zzso detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cells provided compelling evidence that zzso interacts with zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and thus blocks zzso zzso
