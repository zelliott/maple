Gene expression technology has become a routine application in many laboratories and has provided large amounts of gene expression signatures that have been identified in a variety of cancer zzso zzso of gene expression signatures would profit from the availability of a procedure capable of assigning zzso regulated genes or entire gene signatures to defined cancer signaling zzso Here we describe a zzso approach that identifies cancer signaling pathways from published gene expression zzso Published gene expression signatures are collected in a database zzso Published zzso of zzso zzso enabled for zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of up to 10 genes in different gene expression signatures are zzso zzso zzso genes are linked by an edge in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso combined with graph zzso as a quality measure are used to identify communities in the resulting zzso The identified communities consist of cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso extra cellular zzso zzso and immune response regulators as well as communities of unknown zzso The genes zzso different communities are characterized by common zzso features and strongly enriched zzso zzso in their upstream regulatory regions that are consistent with zzso assignment of those zzso
