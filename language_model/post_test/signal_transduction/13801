zzso zzso zzso is important in development, stem cell biology and zzso In a variety of zzso zzso acts as a zzso to regulate growth and cell fate zzso Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain zzso movement, one of which is transport along zzso zzso called zzso Here, we zzso the mechanism underlying zzso movement in the wing disc and the abdominal zzso of zzso We show that, in both zzso cells generate zzso in regions of zzso zzso These zzso are zzso and span several cell zzso Various zzso zzso components zzso to zzso as well as to zzso structures that move along zzso and are probably zzso Using in zzso imaging, we show that zzso are dynamic structures and that zzso zzso establishment zzso with zzso formation in space and zzso Indeed, zzso conditions that affect zzso formation reduce both zzso length and zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso transport is the zzso basis for zzso zzso zzso
