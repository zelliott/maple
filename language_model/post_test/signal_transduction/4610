zzso zzso is clinically important in gut zzso and zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso is as zzso cells, are the 1st zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We set out to investigate if this zzso effect is zzso by zzso and to identify the zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso that are involved in this zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso preparation of rat zzso and cultured for zzso h before zzso recording in whole cell mode and zzso cells identified by their zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration zzso ) of isolated zzso was measured using calcium zzso The concentration of zzso in the zzso and the OT zzso from the zzso were measured using zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, as well as the expression of OT and the zzso marker zzso 28 K, on the zzso zzso zzso were localized using zzso zzso We found that administration of OT zzso to zzso zzso dose zzso zzso the resting membrane potential and increased the total outward zzso The zzso zzso zzso or the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso blocked the effects of OT suggesting that the increased outward current resulted from zzso channel zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso on a subset of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso M, a zzso channel zzso increased the outward current similar to the effect of zzso OT administration also increased zzso and the zzso outward current was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso The effect of OT on the zzso current was also blocked by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso OT zzso zzso also increased the zzso concentration within the zzso Both of the spontaneous and zzso zzso of OT was enhanced by zzso Most of zzso cells are also zzso for zzso 28 zzso In zzso we concluded that OT zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso channels via the zzso signal zzso OT might zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso and negative feedback zzso
