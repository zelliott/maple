zzso of many genes is regulated by combinations of multiple zzso In zzso coli, zzso control is typical in the case of zzso related to zzso of different zzso in the absence of zzso To understand regulation of the transport and zzso pathways in the zzso system, we measured activities of the six gal zzso promoters zzso using an in zzso zzso system containing zzso zzso zzso functions were zzso on the basis of the experimental zzso We observed four different shapes of input zzso From the results, we can conclude that the structure of the regulatory network is insufficient for the determination of signal zzso It is the actual structure of the promoter and regulatory region, the mechanism of zzso regulation, and the interplay between zzso factors that shape the input function to be suitable for zzso
