The contribution of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of solid tumors is appreciated although not completely understood; however, the contribution of the zzso to the development of zzso tumors has not been investigated in zzso A new study by zzso and colleagues demonstrates that faulty zzso signaling can facilitate zzso zzso in mice predisposed to zzso Similar changes in zzso construction, consistent with a loss of zzso zzso zzso were identified in the transition from zzso zzso zzso to zzso chronic zzso leukemia in zzso These results reveal a critical contribution of reduced collagen signaling in zzso and highlight the importance of appropriate zzso construction for maintenance of tissue zzso
