Cellular signal zzso pathways are usually studied following administration of an external zzso However, zzso zzso activity of the zzso is often due to zzso of the equilibrium zzso The zzso factor zzso is typically described as being held inactive in the zzso by binding its zzso zzso until an external stimulus triggers zzso degradation through an zzso zzso degradation zzso Combining zzso zzso and zzso tools, we investigate zzso regulation of the zzso signaling module and its impact on stimulus zzso We present newly measured in zzso degradation rate zzso for zzso and zzso zzso proteins that are critical for accurate zzso predictions of zzso zzso protein levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal a zzso zzso signaling module in which differential degradation rates of free and bound pools of zzso represent a novel zzso mechanism that zzso functional zzso to the signaling zzso
