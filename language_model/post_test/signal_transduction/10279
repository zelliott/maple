The zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene is commonly amplified and rearranged in zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as transforming growth zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is also often increased in zzso resulting in an zzso loop that contributes to the growth autonomy of zzso zzso zzso zzso express a characteristic zzso zzso zzso de zzso that does not bind zzso signals zzso and is more zzso than the zzso zzso However, the downstream signals that mediate this increased zzso are not well zzso We hypothesized that signals induced specifically by zzso and not the zzso zzso are more likely to mediate its increased zzso activity and examined the gene expression profiles resulting from zzso expression of comparable levels of either zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso resulted in specific zzso of a small group of zzso zzso all these zzso which include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso influence signaling pathways known to play a key role in zzso and function in interconnected zzso Increased expression of zzso genes was validated by real-time zzso The zzso zzso does not bind zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso suggests that zzso plays a role in generating an zzso loop using the zzso zzso in zzso It also raises the possibility that zzso may zzso at least in part, through the zzso zzso Indeed, we show that zzso the activity of zzso a potent zzso with zzso zzso reduces cell proliferation induced by expression of zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso zzso loop plays an important role in signal zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We also show by zzso that zzso expression zzso with the presence of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, our study provides a new insight into zzso signaling by zzso and improves our understanding of how zzso zzso are generated in zzso
