To zzso the mechanism of cell growth regulation by zzso oxide zzso and the role played in it by zzso we studied the relationship among zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and proliferation in cell lines exposed to different levels of zzso Data showed that NO released by low zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso determined a zzso moderate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso over zzso which paralleled zzso of zzso and zzso of cell zzso zzso blocking zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activities prevented zzso zzso and antagonized the zzso effect of zzso Experimental conditions zzso zzso entry into cells led to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso NO zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to expression of zzso and zzso of cell zzso Furthermore, functionally blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso and reversed the zzso effect of zzso Both the zzso and zzso responses induced by NO were zzso by a zzso analogue whereas they were completely antagonized by selective zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that regulation of cell proliferation by low NO levels is zzso dependent and occurs via the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this effect the zzso of zzso zzso determines the specificity of the zzso response to NO possibly by modulating the strength of zzso zzso In contrast to the low level, the high levels zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulated cell proliferation via a zzso zzso
