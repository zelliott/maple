zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by many growth factor receptors and is thought to exert its cellular functions through the zzso of zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso induced changes of the zzso zzso which are zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso Recently, a role for zzso and zzso in regulating gene zzso has become zzso 

Here, we show that membrane targeting of the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso generates a zzso active zzso that allows us to assess the relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso to a particular cellular zzso zzso of this active zzso zzso induced zzso reorganization in the form of zzso zzso and focal complexes, and zzso stress zzso and focal zzso However, expression of active zzso zzso did not induce the zzso zzso pathways that regulate gene zzso controlled by the zzso promoter, the zzso serum response element or the zzso factors zzso and zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso a selective subset of cellular responses, but is not sufficient to stimulate the full repertoire of zzso or zzso zzso
