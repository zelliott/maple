The formation of peripheral zzso zzso is indispensable for the efficient recognition and elimination of external zzso by zzso and accessory cells of the zzso immune zzso The zzso is structurally arranged around various vascular beds with distinct zzso zzso Using zzso we investigated the zzso zzso characteristics of the marginal zzso and its relationship with various zzso zzso zzso We also determined the importance of the zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso and the role of the zzso zzso factor for the formation of the zzso zzso Both the administration of soluble zzso beta zzso fusion protein to zzso and the deletion of zzso beta R or downstream signaling components zzso and zzso of the zzso family inhibited the zzso maturation of marginal zzso but had no effect on the vascular zzso of the red zzso The integrity of the marginal zzso and the proper vascular segregation of the red pulp appeared to be controlled by zzso as zzso mice exhibited an abnormal distribution of zzso zzso and a lack of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso among different vascular elements within distinct anatomical regions of the zzso zzso depends on zzso factors such as zzso signaling or zzso whereas the marginal zzso is controlled by both zzso
