For a given cell type, particular zzso signals generate characteristic patterns of activity in zzso zzso networks that lead to distinctive zzso specific zzso Here, we report the first known occurrence of a zzso switch in the zzso zzso network required for an identical cellular response to the same zzso signal in the same cell zzso We show that although zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso growth from both zzso and zzso mouse sensory zzso there is a zzso switch between these stages in the zzso zzso mechanism and the zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso Shortly before birth, zzso activates zzso by an zzso mechanism that involves zzso zzso of zzso by zzso family zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso Immediately after birth, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at zzso 536 are required for zzso zzso zzso This abrupt zzso switch in zzso zzso in a highly differentiated cell type illustrates an zzso plasticity in zzso networks in the generation of identical cellular responses to the same zzso zzso
