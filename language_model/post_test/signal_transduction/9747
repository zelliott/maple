zzso zzso is a zzso zzso reported to play an important role in induction of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso are known to act as signal zzso receptors of zzso the former as an zzso and the latter as an zzso However, there have been no reports concerning regulation of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso fluid zzso after zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were measured serially until day 14 in zzso from nine patients with zzso zzso samples obtained from patients suffering from zzso aneurysm were used as zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso on day 1 was further examined by zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso increased immediately after the onset of zzso and remained chronically elevated over control zzso Both zzso and zzso also exhibited increased on day 1, followed by a decrease limited to the zzso case after day zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso on day 1 after zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso as an zzso in zzso immediately after zzso As the concentration of zzso decreases after day 5, zzso signals might then be more easily zzso presumably resulting in cerebral zzso
