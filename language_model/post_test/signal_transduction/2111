The zzso zzso zzso has a zzso function that is modulated by zzso modification of its four zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso Without zzso zzso zzso has no zzso zzso When zzso and zzso are zzso to zzso the zzso and heavily zzso forms function as warm and cold sensors, zzso In this study, we carried out zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso influenced the signaling bias and the zzso level, all of the zzso retained zzso zzso Those with single zzso had almost normal zzso properties, indicating that zzso at any particular zzso site do not seriously impair zzso zzso In the zzso zzso background, some of the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso Warm sensors were found among zzso retaining two zzso zzso and cold sensors were found among those with one or no zzso zzso This result suggests that the negative charge at the zzso sites is one factor that determines zzso zzso although the size and shape of the side chain may also be zzso The warm, cold, and zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso and no intermediate zzso were zzso Thus, the different zzso zzso that result from zzso modification of the zzso sites may reflect distinct structural zzso Broader implications for the zzso mechanism are also zzso
