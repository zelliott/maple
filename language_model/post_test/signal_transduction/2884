The alpha zzso of the zzso for human zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso containing 11 potential zzso sites in the zzso zzso We examined the role of zzso on alpha zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso in zzso cells but did not affect cell surface expression of the alpha zzso as detected by an zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells expressing the alpha zzso and treated with zzso zzso alpha zzso was expressed and transported to the cell surface but was not capable of binding zzso High affinity binding in zzso cells expressing both alpha and beta zzso was also blocked by zzso zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso are essential for alpha zzso zzso binding and signaling by the human zzso zzso
