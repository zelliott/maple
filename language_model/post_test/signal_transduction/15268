The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in vascular biology, modulating zzso function and zzso zzso Recently, we have described the beneficial effect of combined zzso of the zzso zzso and the scavenger zzso zzso to induce zzso cholesterol release through zzso zzso of zzso Although the interplay between zzso and zzso in zzso is well zzso the contribution of the zzso zzso to regulate zzso remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso triggers zzso zzso through a concerted signaling cascade involving zzso and zzso zzso resulting in enhanced expression of downstream zzso zzso and ABC zzso zzso in human zzso These effects were associated with enhanced zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as being recruited to zzso in response to zzso but failure of activated zzso to enhance zzso zzso specific zzso relied on the zzso recruitment of zzso protein zzso which prevented optimal zzso of the zzso zzso Also, substitution of zzso preserved the zzso zzso activity and responsiveness to zzso zzso supporting a mechanism independent of zzso in zzso response to zzso zzso with this, we found that zzso promoted the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, resulting in zzso recruitment to zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso independently of zzso and increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso these results illustrate a complex interplay involving zzso and zzso pathways to zzso in a concerted manner responsiveness of zzso to zzso in zzso
