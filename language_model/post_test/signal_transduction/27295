While changes in gene expression are critical for many brain functions, including long-term memory, little is known about the cellular processes that mediate zzso zzso at central zzso In studying the signaling pathways by which synaptic zzso control the zzso state of zzso zzso element binding protein zzso and determine expression of zzso zzso we found two important zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso a zzso zzso cascade involving nuclear zzso and a zzso regulation of nuclear protein zzso 1 zzso zzso of the synaptic input on the time scale of minutes, in part by an zzso zzso of zzso greatly extends the period over which zzso levels are zzso thus affecting induction of downstream zzso
