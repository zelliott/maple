The zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to many zzso and pathological processes in the zzso A subset of zzso spines on zzso zzso contains zzso that may contribute to zzso zzso zzso Distribution of zzso to spines is zzso but knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms is zzso In live cell imaging experiments we now show that cultured zzso zzso rapidly lost zzso from spines after zzso zzso zzso zzso loss was reduced by zzso zzso zzso at 2 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso at 4 zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C also diminished loss of zzso by preventing exit of zzso from zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso triggered a dramatic increase in spine zzso zzso zzso and zzso cleave several zzso zzso Many of these zzso are known to zzso to zzso zzso a structural specialization with which spine zzso zzso One interesting possibility is thus that zzso content within spines may be regulated by zzso activity affecting zzso zzso Our data demonstrate a zzso unknown role for these two zzso activities in regulating dynamic aspects of cellular zzso which is potentially important for cellular calcium zzso and several zzso signaling zzso
