The transforming growth zzso zzso family of zzso signaling molecules is heavily involved in zzso events, including zzso formation, zzso and closure of the zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that zzso are temporally and zzso localized to the zzso and play a pivotal role in zzso zzso These signals are translated into zzso activity through a family of proteins known as zzso There are 8 known zzso with zzso 1, 5, and 8 zzso zzso signals and zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso of any of these zzso and zzso 4 is necessary for zzso and zzso Although many studies have delineated the presence of zzso during zzso closure, no studies have determined zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso activity would change during zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to determine whether zzso zzso were present in the zzso at which point they were zzso zzso A rat model was used in which the zzso zzso zzso fused during zzso days 16 to zzso Time points before and after this event were analyzed for changes in zzso expression and zzso It was determined from these experiments that zzso the zzso zzso 2, 3, and 4 are all present in the zzso zzso zzso 2 and 4 are distributed in the region of the zzso front of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity decreases in areas in which zzso bone will zzso These results add to the knowledge present about zzso development and may provide news targets to which zzso can be zzso
