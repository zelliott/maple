Mechanical stretch plays a crucial role in zzso zzso In zzso arthritis zzso it is well known that zzso zzso zzso produce zzso zzso zzso resulting in local invasion into and degradation of bone and zzso We sought to examine whether mechanical stretch regulates the expression and underlying signal pathways of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were grown on elastic silicone membrane in an zzso strain apparatus and were exposed to zzso mechanical stretch zzso to gentle stretch zzso for 15 zzso and 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso were used to measure and analyze gene zzso zzso levels were determined by Western zzso The results showed that 15 zzso of mechanical stretch inhibited zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso However, the degree of zzso by 75 zzso of stretch in expression of zzso and zzso was lower compared with 15 zzso stretch zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso were increased by zzso mechanical stretch under both time points, however zzso and zzso zzso level were affected differently after 15 zzso and 75 zzso mechanical stretch compared to control zzso There were no significant changes on zzso and zzso zzso level under both zzso mechanical stretch time zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the stretch also reduced the zzso expression of zzso and zzso In short, our results showed that gentle mechanical strain affects zzso and zzso zzso potentially through the zzso signaling zzso
