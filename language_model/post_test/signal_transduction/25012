To understand gene expression changes zzso by a zzso repeat expansion in the human zzso zzso we used zzso DNA zzso to profile approximately zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a transgenic zzso disease zzso zzso We found diminished levels of zzso zzso components of the zzso calcium and zzso signaling pathways at both early and late symptomatic time points (6 and 12 weeks of zzso We observed similar changes in gene expression in another HD mouse model zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso directly or indirectly reduces the expression of a distinct set of genes involved in signaling pathways known to be critical to zzso zzso zzso
