The present study investigated the effects of zzso a second generation selective zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Following 10 weeks of zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso administration, serum total cholesterol, zzso low density zzso were significantly decreased in the drug groups compared to the zzso zzso zzso with serum zzso results, the total zzso area for each zzso of the drug groups decreased significantly as compared to the zzso zzso HE zzso of zzso zzso section showed that in the drug groups the zzso zzso was almost zzso While in zzso zzso HE zzso of zzso sections indicated the zzso of zzso cells (in zzso zzso was obviously inhibited in zzso plus zzso zzso In cultured vascular smooth muscle cell zzso the results of zzso and zzso incorporation showed that the drug groups could inhibit zzso proliferation of zzso Western zzso proved that zzso plus zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso but different from zzso This effect was inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that zzso zzso plus zzso improves the zzso metabolism and zzso the zzso changes of female experimental zzso zzso which are partly implemented by the zzso of zzso growth through zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells could be significantly inhibited by zzso plus zzso
