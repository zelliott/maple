zzso stimulates expression of zzso in various cells, including zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso exerts this effect is not fully zzso We investigated the involvement of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso increased zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3 zzso activity also prevented zzso expression induced by zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso active zzso 3 zzso by zzso gene transfer increased zzso expression similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso expression of a zzso zzso of zzso abolished expression of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso or zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso In contrast, and similarly to zzso expression of zzso active zzso 3 zzso or zzso active zzso increased zzso of zzso confirming a prominent role of these zzso in expression of zzso These data provide the evidence that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso 3 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner and define a role for the same signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
