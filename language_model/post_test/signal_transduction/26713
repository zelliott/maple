zzso has been shown to increase bone mass and promote bone cell proliferation and zzso zzso therefore, hypothesized that zinc might be zzso for bone cells during zzso zzso The cells were divided into zzso zinc and zzso zzso In the present study, zinc was found to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso cells, as shown by analysis of zzso zzso double zzso Western zzso data showed that in zzso cells, zinc decreased the levels of zzso zzso and active zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso And zinc inhibited release of zzso c from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Further investigation shows that protection is via zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Protecting zzso cells from zzso damage presents a potential application in the treatment of zzso
