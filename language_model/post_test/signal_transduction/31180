Although prominent zzso exhibits a limited degree of zzso to zzso the binding sites on zzso for zzso and zzso may overlap to prevent the effect of zzso in stabilizing zzso in the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, we identified a novel zzso zzso interaction protein zzso which binds to zzso We have defined a zzso acid region in the zzso of zzso that is highly similar to the zzso interaction domain zzso of zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is a good zzso zzso and both the full-length protein and a zzso zzso of zzso can block zzso of primed and zzso zzso in different zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also shown to compete with and/or block the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and nucleus as zzso by zzso A functional zzso also demonstrates that zzso cells have a significant effect on the zzso of zzso zzso we define zzso as a naturally occurring protein that is zzso with the zzso interaction domain of zzso and is able to zzso regulate zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
