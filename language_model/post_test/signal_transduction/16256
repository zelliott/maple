zzso of the zzso zzso factor and its associated gene expression in zzso is a key component in the response to brain zzso Its zzso is dynamic and is part of a network of zzso species with multiple feedback regulatory zzso zzso zzso which has been instrumental for understanding the zzso response in other cell types, offers a valuable tool to investigate the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso at a systems zzso 

We zzso the dynamic response of zzso zzso and zzso of the upstream zzso zzso using zzso zzso of a zzso cell line following treatment with the zzso zzso zzso A new mathematical model is developed based on these data sets using a modular procedure that exploits the feedback structure of the zzso We show that the new model requires previously zzso dynamics involved in the zzso degradation of the inhibitor zzso in order to properly describe zzso zzso zzso in a statistically consistent zzso This suggests a more prominent role for the zzso system in regulating the zzso of zzso to inflammatory zzso We also find that the introduction of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is essential for proper characterization of transient zzso activity and zzso to known biological zzso zzso analyses of the model highlight key regulators of the zzso zzso response, as well as those governing zzso zzso zzso illustrate the dynamic regulatory mechanisms and the robust yet fragile nature of the negative feedback regulated zzso 

We have developed a new mathematical model that incorporates previously zzso dynamics to characterize the dynamic response of the zzso signaling network in zzso This model is the first of its kind for zzso and provides a tool for the zzso systems level study the dynamic cellular response to inflammatory zzso
