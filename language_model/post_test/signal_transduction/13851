A pool of zzso zzso to the zzso However, the exact mechanism of action of nuclear zzso remains poorly zzso We have investigated zzso role during DNA damage zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso after DNA damage, and that its zzso is closely associated with its zzso on zzso but not on zzso zzso analysis reveals that the C2 domain of zzso is responsible for its nuclear zzso after exposure to zzso Both zzso zzso 2 and zzso are involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso as well as zzso association with zzso after DNA zzso zzso zzso specifically interacts with zzso and zzso with zzso as well as zzso after zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso zzso our studies strongly suggest that zzso zzso mediates DNA damage repair through interacting with and modulating the activity of zzso
