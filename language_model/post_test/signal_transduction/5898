zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tight junction protein that has been shown to regulate barrier function and cell migration through incompletely understood zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso regulates cell migration by zzso of the zzso zzso loop and a zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso resulted in decreased zzso cell migration secondary to diminished levels of zzso zzso and active zzso Here, we report that zzso is physically and functionally associated with the zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso exchange factor zzso 2, but not zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and these interactions mediate zzso signaling zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso Furthermore, association of zzso with zzso was dependent on the expression of zzso Loss of zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso or zzso similarly decreased cellular levels of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The functional effects observed were secondary to decreased levels of zzso because zzso of zzso but not zzso resulted in decreased zzso zzso levels and reduced cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso formation of a complex with zzso and zzso that activates zzso which regulates zzso zzso levels and cell zzso
