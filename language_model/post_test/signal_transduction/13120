zzso II zzso zzso acting through zzso type I zzso receptors on zzso and zzso surfaces of zzso zzso zzso cells, increases sodium zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso after exposure to zzso II, but the role of zzso in zzso signaling and transport is not well zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling and sodium zzso we zzso expressed full-length and truncated zzso receptors in zzso kidney zzso After stimulation with zzso II, zzso receptors on zzso and zzso surfaces rapidly zzso inhibited zzso zzso and increased zzso sodium zzso zzso of the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in receptors that were expressed on zzso and zzso surfaces but did not zzso inhibit zzso zzso or increase sodium zzso Because the zzso tail contains putative G protein zzso sites, zzso receptors that leave G protein interaction sites intact were zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso or deletion zzso zzso also failed to zzso When zzso II was added to zzso surfaces of zzso or Del zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited and sodium transport was zzso In contrast, zzso addition of zzso II was not associated with decreases in zzso zzso or increases in sodium zzso In conclusion, zzso pathways are important for zzso zzso function in polarized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso before they interact with G proteins and signal zzso In contrast, zzso zzso receptors interact with G proteins and signal zzso without zzso
