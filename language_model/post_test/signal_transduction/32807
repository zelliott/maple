zzso is a zzso zzso complex of alpha and beta zzso that links the zzso zzso to the cell zzso It was originally identified in skeletal muscle, where it anchors zzso to the zzso zzso is also highly expressed in zzso zzso including zzso To investigate the molecular interactions of zzso in the zzso we zzso a zzso extract from bovine brain zzso by zzso zzso and characterized the protein zzso The zzso zzso was the major zzso protein detected by overlay zzso This complex, in addition to zzso was also found to contain zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso However, no direct interaction between zzso and zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein involved in signal zzso and zzso organization, has been shown to bind zzso We isolated both zzso and zzso from zzso extracts by zzso on immobilized zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso has been linked to membrane zzso and neurotransmitter zzso zzso At the zzso the zzso protein zzso may mediate zzso interaction, and it may play a role in transferring information between the zzso complex and other signaling zzso
