The zzso protein zzso (also known as zzso and zzso is expressed abundantly in lens zzso That zzso mice exhibit early zzso indicates a role for zzso in the maintenance of lens zzso zzso of cultured zzso and zzso lens zzso cells revealed significant changes in zzso to different zzso zzso lens cells displayed enhanced attachment and zzso focal zzso formation, and resistance to zzso detachment in comparison to zzso zzso In the absence of zzso there was increased deposition of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso associated with focal zzso were increased in zzso versus zzso lens zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso were enhanced significantly, as was the association of zzso with zzso and zzso Restoration of the zzso zzso in zzso cultures was accomplished through genetic rescue by stable zzso of zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is zzso for zzso lens zzso cells and demonstrate that multiple factors contribute to this zzso We also identify zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso and deposition by these cells, an activity important in zzso zzso interactions in the zzso zzso
