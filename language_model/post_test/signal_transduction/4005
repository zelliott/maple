zzso stimulates zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene through binding to the zzso zzso zzso We have explored the possibility that zzso protein zzso zzso play a role in zzso the effects of zzso on zzso in a gastric cancer zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells was found to increase the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and increase zzso activity as determined by the in zzso zzso of zzso basic zzso zzso gene zzso also demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consistent with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of wild type zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso zzso using activated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using expression zzso for zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using an interfering dominant negative zzso zzso protein zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins and association with zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was not influenced by expression of dominant negative Ras zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso of the zzso promoter was blocked by zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso Overall, these data demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso zzso in a zzso zzso fashion predominantly through zzso of the zzso zzso
