zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso that zzso nuclear proteins serving as zzso zzso zzso of zzso family zzso usually by genetic damage with the consequence of enhanced expression of a zzso zzso has been found to participate in human and animal zzso While zzso of the zzso zzso does not show an association with a particular cancer type, genetic damage involving zzso has high preference for zzso of zzso zzso In the vast majority of cases, the zzso mechanism involves the increase of the zzso gene zzso either by amplification resulting in up to several hundred gene copies or by more subtle mechanisms, like zzso or zzso In zzso amplified zzso is a strong zzso indicator of poor zzso particularly in localized tumors where patients with normal zzso gene dosage fare quite zzso Identification of amplified zzso in zzso has marked the clinical debut of zzso and zzso status now is being used world wide as a standard marker for zzso zzso
