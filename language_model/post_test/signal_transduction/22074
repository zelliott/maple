The ability of transforming growth factor zzso zzso to induce zzso transition zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso pathways such as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso stimulates the ROCK zzso which in turn zzso numerous zzso including the zzso zzso zzso The net result of ROCK zzso is increased zzso zzso force generation, with a contribution from zzso zzso filament zzso In this study, we made use of zzso zzso and selective zzso to determine the contributions of ROCK and zzso to zzso zzso We find that both ROCK and zzso are required for zzso stimulation of zzso factor zzso zzso activity and zzso stress zzso formation during zzso In contrast, although zzso zzso had little effect on cell zzso in scratch wound and zzso migration zzso ROCK zzso actually promoted zzso cell zzso by helping individual cells to break free from the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective zzso of zzso but not zzso effectively blocked zzso driven invasion through a layer of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the roles of zzso and ROCK in the zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso are not identical and suggest that zzso represents an attractive therapeutic target in zzso driven organ zzso and zzso cancer zzso
