Cellular responses initiated by tumor necrosis factor zzso are zzso by two different cell surface receptors with respective molecular masses of 55 zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso zzso is functional in almost every cell type and can independently transmit most biological activities of zzso In contrast, zzso signaling via zzso seems so far largely restricted to cells of zzso origin, where it can induce zzso zzso production, and/or zzso The mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso activity are largely zzso Here we report that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells is zzso on zzso by a zzso activity present in zzso immune zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that the latter zzso is zzso zzso zzso Previous results have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso Our data show that the latter in zzso zzso is also at least partially due to zzso zzso of cells with zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso in zzso or in zzso However, a specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso suggesting an zzso role for zzso by zzso Although in zzso zzso zzso could be seen in both zzso and zzso cell lines, in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso could not be observed in cell lines that were biologically unresponsive to zzso zzso The latter observation further indicates a regulatory role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and associated with zzso which zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso
