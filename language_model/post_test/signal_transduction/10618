Many zzso cells are polarized along the plane of the zzso a property termed zzso cell zzso The zzso wing and eye zzso discs are the premier models of this zzso Many proteins required for polarity establishment and its translation into zzso polarity were identified from studies of those zzso More recently, several zzso zzso have been shown to exhibit zzso cell zzso zzso similarities and differences have been observed when different zzso exhibiting zzso cell polarity are zzso Here we describe a new tissue exhibiting zzso cell polarity - the zzso zzso projections of the zzso embryonic zzso We describe in real time the changes in the zzso zzso that zzso zzso development, and compare this with the zzso of zzso revealing new aspects of zzso dynamics that may have more general zzso We present an initial characterization of the zzso of several zzso regulators during zzso zzso We find that several core zzso cell polarity proteins are zzso localized during the zzso Finally, we define roles for the zzso zzso and zzso pathways and for core zzso cell polarity proteins in zzso zzso
