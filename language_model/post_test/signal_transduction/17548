zzso zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso release were compared between zzso which were freshly isolated, incubated for 3 h in suspension or cultivated for 4 or 24 h in plastic culture zzso in the presence and absence of the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the absence of an zzso effect in freshly isolated zzso an increased sensitivity of zzso liberation towards zzso could be observed 4 h after the start of culture, whereas the zzso number was not found to be increased before 24 zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso release at all investigated zzso The zzso responses tested by using the zzso zzso zzso is blocked completely in freshly isolated zzso zzso with zzso M zzso However, after 3 h incubation of zzso in suspension or in primary culture, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso M zzso on zzso release from freshly isolated zzso was not influenced by zzso whereas after 90 and 180 zzso incubation a significant decrease could be zzso On the other hand, zzso inhibited stimulation of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso of zzso M in freshly isolated zzso but no effect was found in zzso incubated for 3 h in suspension or maintained for 24 h in primary zzso The different zzso effects may be an expression of changes of the accessibility of protein zzso C to zzso caused by zzso and/or zzso zzso of this zzso at the tested experimental zzso
