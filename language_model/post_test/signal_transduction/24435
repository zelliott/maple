zzso receptors zzso are key zzso of the innate immune response to microbial zzso We investigated the role of zzso in the recognition of zzso zzso and the significance of zzso a recently discovered human zzso that is associated with zzso zzso In mice, zzso production in response to zzso zzso was essentially absent in zzso zzso Similarly, human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells, with enhancement of this signaling in the presence of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso by human zzso was abolished in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The impaired function of this zzso zzso provides a molecular mechanism for the poor cellular immune response associated with zzso zzso and may have important implications for understanding the zzso of other zzso zzso
