zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from zzso zzso metabolize zzso to zzso and zzso and these zzso are converted to zzso that zzso zzso zzso proliferation via zzso zzso The goal of this study was to test whether this mechanism also exists in zzso from zzso arteries and whether it is similarly expressed in human zzso rat zzso zzso of rat and human zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso with a similar absolute increase in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in human coronary zzso zzso increased zzso levels yet had little effect on zzso zzso In all cell types, zzso increased levels of zzso but not zzso and zzso inhibited cell zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso In all cell types, zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso levels, and zzso of zzso blocked this effect of zzso but not that of zzso nor zzso Also, zzso zzso and zzso like zzso exerted zzso effects that were abolished by antagonism of zzso receptors with zzso In conclusion, zzso from zzso arteries metabolize zzso to zzso which are zzso to zzso In rat and human zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are involved in this process, zzso in human coronary zzso zzso is mainly converted to zzso Because zzso zzso zzso proliferation via zzso zzso local vascular production of zzso may protect zzso arteries from zzso
