A novel insight into zzso zzso function was revealed from a large experimental zzso derived by liquid zzso mass zzso Within the experimental set of 416 identified zzso a significant number of zzso proteins involved in DNA zzso zzso regulation, protein complex zzso and cellular signaling were zzso Nearly zzso of the zzso identified proteins are of unknown function, suggesting a wealth of undiscovered zzso functions in zzso Only approximately half of the experimental set is predicted to be zzso by targeting prediction programs, allowing an assessment of the benefits and limitations of these programs in determining plant zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso networks between zzso human, and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso provide detailed insights into the divergence of the plant zzso zzso from those of other zzso These show a clear set of putative zzso zzso in the core zzso functions of zzso whereas considerable diversity exists in many signaling and regulatory zzso
