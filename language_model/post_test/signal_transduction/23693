zzso zzso is an important industrial zzso Accidental full body exposure to zzso poses an zzso zzso and public health hazard characterized mainly by injury to the zzso skin, and zzso zzso The cellular mechanisms underlying its acute toxicity are incompletely zzso This study examined whether whole body exposure of zzso mice to zzso in environmental chambers leads to the zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso in their lungs and zzso zzso zzso mice were exposed to a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso and returned to room air for 1 or 6 hours and zzso zzso and zzso were increased significantly at 1 and 6 hours after zzso exposure in the lungs and at 6 hours in the zzso These changes were accompanied by increased zzso signaling zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso at these time zzso The expression of zzso which regulates tissue zzso and zzso of iron, was increased in the skin and lungs of zzso zzso The data shown zzso indicate for the first time the zzso of zzso signaling and zzso in the skin and lungs of zzso mice, which persisted when the mice were returned to room air for 6 zzso
