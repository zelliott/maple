The development of highly active zzso therapy zzso to treat individuals infected with zzso has dramatically improved patient zzso but zzso still fails to cure the zzso The zzso viral zzso in resting zzso T cells is a major barrier to virus zzso zzso of this zzso requires zzso of the zzso zzso However, strategies for zzso zzso through zzso T cell zzso have clinically unacceptable zzso We describe here the development of what we believe to be a novel in zzso model of zzso zzso that we used to search for compounds that can reverse zzso Human primary zzso T cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and the resulting cells were shown to zzso the zzso state of resting zzso T cells in zzso Using this model system, we screened zzso libraries and identified a compound that zzso zzso zzso without inducing global T cell zzso zzso zzso Unlike previously described zzso agents, zzso activated zzso zzso through zzso and zzso without affecting nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso pathways can be dissected and zzso to purge zzso zzso Our study expands the number of classes of zzso zzso and demonstrates the utility of this in zzso model for finding strategies to eradicate zzso zzso
