zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso during zzso wound zzso However, the factors that zzso zzso activity in this process are not completely zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso in regulating zzso and found an increase in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso exposed to various zzso zzso zzso This occurs through an zzso zzso zzso The zzso role of this mechanism was demonstrated during wound repair in extra domain zzso mice, which exhibited decreased zzso signaling during the zzso phase of zzso Extra domain zzso mice have wounds that fail at a lower zzso strength and contain fewer zzso compared with wild type zzso This zzso was rescued by genetic or zzso zzso of zzso zzso Because zzso is a zzso target of zzso this suggests the existence of a feedback loop between these two molecules that regulates zzso zzso cell behavior during wound zzso
