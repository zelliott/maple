zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to increase plasma zzso zzso zzso level for controlling zzso zzso zzso A prominent zzso level in zzso rats contributed to the resistance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the capability against zzso stress in zzso However, long term effect of loss zzso activity on cardiac performance remained zzso We used abdominal zzso zzso zzso to induce pressure overload in zzso and zzso rats, and investigated the progression of heart zzso zzso zzso and function were zzso Blood sample was collected for the plasma zzso marker zzso Heart weight to body weight ratio increased zzso after 6 weeks of zzso zzso zzso function was compensated against pressure overload after 6 weeks of zzso surgery, but progressed to deterioration after 10 weeks of zzso zzso zzso induced cardiac dysfunction was alleviated in zzso zzso zzso activity increased significantly in zzso rats after 10 weeks of zzso surgery, but remained unchanged in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso concentration was elevated by zzso after 6 weeks of surgery in zzso rats, and remained high after 10 weeks of zzso zzso II level markedly increased after 6 weeks of zzso surgery, but were less in zzso zzso zzso collagen deposits in zzso rat hearts appeared after 10 weeks of zzso surgery, which were alleviated in zzso zzso Long term zzso of zzso activity improved cardiac performance against pressure overload in zzso which may be attributed to a great quantity of zzso zzso during zzso
