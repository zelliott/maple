zzso zzso a zzso and its specific zzso zzso have recently been shown to be involved in zzso proliferation and zzso zzso we zzso zzso expression and function in four human kidney cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 freshly harvested human zzso samples and corresponding normal kidney zzso While none of the zzso zzso cell lines expressed zzso zzso cells were found to express zzso More importantly, real-time zzso analysis of 10 zzso samples and respective adjacent normal kidney tissue disclosed a distinct and divergent zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in primary zzso zzso To prove that the zzso protein is functionally active, zzso was investigated for its ability to induce changes of zzso calcium levels in zzso zzso Moreover, we used zzso expression zzso to evaluate the biological influence of zzso Comparing gene expression profiles in zzso zzso vs zzso zzso kidney cancer cells revealed specific regulation of 31 out of zzso genes tested on a selected human cancer zzso with a prominent stimulation of genes involved in zzso regulation and zzso The genetic changes reported here should provide new insights into the zzso paths leading to zzso progression and may also aid the design of new approaches to therapeutic zzso
