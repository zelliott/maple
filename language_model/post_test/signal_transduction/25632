zzso acid zzso controls plant development and regulates plant responses to environmental zzso A role for zzso in sugar regulation of plant development has also been well documented although the molecular mechanisms connecting the hormone with sugar signal zzso pathways are not well zzso In this work it is shown that zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso insensitive in growth, zzso closure, and zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso were normal, suggesting that the zzso signal zzso zzso is impaired in the zzso zzso modified zzso gene zzso but the zzso response to the hormone differed from that observed in zzso zzso The gene expression of the zzso factor zzso involved in both sugar and zzso zzso was altered in zzso suggesting that their zzso zzso is zzso at least zzso through this zzso zzso zzso supplementation was able partly to restore the zzso sensitivity of zzso indicating that zzso acid zzso and/or zzso metabolism may also be important zzso in the connections of zzso with primary zzso Overall, these studies provide new insights into the links between plant primary metabolism and zzso zzso and demonstrate the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso
