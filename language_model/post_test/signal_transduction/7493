Cellular zzso of zzso proteins zzso are essential regulators of cell death and zzso The corresponding contributions of zzso to infectious disease outcomes are relatively zzso We find that mice deficient in zzso exhibit increased zzso and mortality to influenza A virus zzso The zzso was not due to impaired zzso immune functions, but rather because of zzso programmed necrosis of airway zzso cells that led to severe zzso zzso zzso despite control of viral zzso zzso zzso of zzso or genetic deletion of zzso both zzso involved in programmed zzso rescued zzso mice from zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or TRAIL from the zzso compartment also reversed the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso antagonism of zzso programmed necrosis critically protects the host from influenza infection through maintenance of pulmonary tissue zzso rather than through pathogen control by the immune zzso
