zzso effects of zzso are partially zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) zzso The authors tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso channels to a zzso channel opener, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso by zzso of the K zzso current (I zzso ) was monitored in guinea pig zzso zzso at zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso in the whole cell zzso of the patch clamp zzso The zzso effect was evaluated by zzso each zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before application of zzso (5 zzso zzso in the continued presence of the zzso To investigate whether zzso signaling pathways may be involved in zzso zzso the authors used the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The density of zzso I zzso was higher at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than at 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso caused an increase in density of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accelerated the rate of current zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated current zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abolished the zzso effect of zzso on I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso of I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but prevented zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso increases sensitivity of cardiac zzso zzso channels to the zzso channel opener zzso zzso of zzso receptors or zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect, suggesting that the zzso and zzso signaling pathways may be involved in the actions by zzso
