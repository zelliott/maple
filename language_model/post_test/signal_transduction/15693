zzso birth is a growing and significant public health problem because of the large number of infants that survive with zzso zzso from brain zzso Recent advances in zzso have shown that although some zzso structures are altered, others improve over zzso This review outlines recent insights into brain structure and function in these zzso infants at school age and relevant animal zzso These animal models have provided scientists with an opportunity to explore in depth the molecular and cellular mechanisms of injury as well as the potential of the brain for zzso The zzso potential that the brain has for zzso and zzso and how environment contributes to recovery, are also zzso These zzso models will provide important insights into the genetic and zzso mechanisms responsible for variable degrees of injury and recovery, permitting the exploration of targeted therapies to facilitate recovery in the developing zzso zzso
