In recent years the interest in zzso proteins and peptides and their mode of action has been rapidly increasing due to their potential to prevent and combat microbial infections in all areas of zzso A detailed knowledge about the function of such proteins is the most important requirement to consider them for future zzso Our research in recent years has been focused on the low molecular weight, zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso which zzso the growth of opportunistic zzso including zzso zzso numerous zzso zzso and the model zzso zzso zzso So far, the experimental results indicate that zzso elicits zzso of the plasma membrane and the zzso of zzso channels, followed by an increase in zzso oxygen species in the cell and the induction of an zzso zzso zzso knowledge about the molecular mechanism of action of zzso proteins such as zzso contributes to the development of new zzso strategies that are urgently zzso
