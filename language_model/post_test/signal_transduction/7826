The progression through the zzso of cell division cycle is regulated by different zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to their key function, the activity of zzso complexes is controlled by several mechanisms, including the zzso by a number of proteins collectively defined zzso zzso or zzso Among the zzso zzso represents a protein of central activity for the control of several zzso including zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso belongs to the growing family of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The disorder proteins present a very large number of possible zzso that, after the zzso zzso to a zzso structure with an extraordinary affinity for the zzso As matter of fact, the absence of a pre-existing folding strongly zzso zzso interaction with a number of zzso Until recently, zzso has been solely viewed as a nuclear protein with the function of modulating zzso activity and zzso cell cycle zzso However, exhaustive studies have now demonstrated that the protein plays additional roles outside of the nucleus, including, particularly, the control of cell zzso Thus, the cellular zzso is of fundamental importance in zzso zzso zzso at least two different mechanisms of degradation, occurring either in the nucleus or in the zzso have been zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated that zzso is a zzso showing at least six to eight zzso zzso However, the precise functional roles of the zzso and the identification of the zzso responsible for the zzso modifications are still zzso In this brief review, we will report the Literature data that connect the zzso modifications of zzso with its function, zzso and zzso The picture that emerges demonstrates that several of the pieces of the zzso metabolism are still zzso
