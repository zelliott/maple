A major factor underlying compulsive tobacco use is zzso zzso of zzso release in the zzso reward zzso zzso and zzso zzso An established zzso mechanism for zzso zzso release is by zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso to zzso m nicotine to zzso zzso promoted a sustained zzso of zzso This nicotine effect was zzso by zzso zzso because it was blocked by 5 zzso zzso but was resistant to 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso release was diminished by omitting zzso or by applying zzso calcium channel blockers, indicating that zzso trigger release by zzso the nerve zzso However, because zzso receptors rapidly zzso in the continuous presence of zzso a repetitive stimulation protocol was used to evaluate the possible significance of zzso This protocol produced a transient increase in zzso released by zzso and a significant increase in the response to zzso solutions that measure the size of the readily zzso pool zzso of synaptic zzso The zzso increase in the size of the readily zzso pool was blocked by zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso entry through zzso zzso specifically enhances synaptic zzso zzso at zzso zzso Thus, nicotine enhances zzso release by two complementary actions zzso by discrete zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is tightly and specifically coupled to zzso of the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
