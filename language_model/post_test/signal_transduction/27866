To determine the role played by zzso zzso domain in the mediation of basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso immortalized human cells zzso were used to generate cell lines expressing zzso zzso full-length sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins consisting of the zzso domain of zzso linked to the zzso domain of zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso linked to the zzso zzso zzso anchor sequence zzso zzso cells zzso were used as zzso zzso of all these zzso (except for the zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso mass and the number of low affinity zzso zzso However, in low serum zzso the addition of zzso zzso growth and migration of cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso S1, zzso or VC zzso Similar results were obtained using zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso attachment sites on zzso construct abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso tail of zzso plays an important role in zzso signal zzso
