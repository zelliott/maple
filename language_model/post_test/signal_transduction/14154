Iron zzso zzso is essential for life and has been zzso investigated for zzso while our knowledge for species in the zzso is zzso This study presents the first zzso analysis zzso of plasma zzso isolated from roots of zzso old zzso zzso zzso zzso Plants were grown under low and high zzso conditions in zzso zzso In total, 227 proteins were identified in control plants, whereas 204 proteins were identified in zzso deficient plants and 251 proteins in plants grown under high zzso zzso zzso were sorted by functional classes, and most of the identified proteins were classified as signaling zzso A significant number of zzso zzso proteins could be identified including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of these components were zzso and others could hint at an involvement of zzso signaling and zzso zzso by change in zzso Energy metabolism and translation seem to be crucial in zzso zzso The response to zzso zzso includes proteins involved in development, whereas membrane zzso and assembly and/or repair of zzso clusters is discussed for zzso zzso The general stress response appears to involve proteins related to zzso stress, growth regulation, an increased rigidity and synthesis of cell walls and zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso Plant zzso in zzso
