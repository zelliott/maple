After zzso by zzso zzso zzso III, nascent Pol III transcripts pass through zzso processing, zzso and transport zzso as part of their zzso maturation zzso The first factor to interact with Pol III transcripts is La zzso which binds principally via its zzso zzso domain zzso to the zzso motif that results from zzso zzso This review includes a sequence zzso of the most zzso region of La and its refined modeling as an zzso recognition motif zzso La protects zzso from 3' zzso zzso and also contributes to their nuclear zzso The variety of modifications found on zzso zzso is reviewed in detail and considered in the contexts of how La may bind the zzso of structured zzso without interfering with recognition by modification zzso and its ability to zzso zzso through multiple parts of their maturation zzso The zzso of human La recognizes the zzso end region of nascent zzso in a manner that is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso can control zzso zzso by zzso zzso a zzso step in zzso zzso the extent to which it acts in the maturation zzso of other transcripts is unknown but considered zzso Evidence that a fraction of La resides in the zzso together with recent findings that several Pol III transcripts pass through the zzso is also zzso An imminent goal is to understand how the zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking, and signal zzso activities of La are integrated with the maturation pathways of the various zzso with which it zzso
