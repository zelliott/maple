During the zzso period, the zzso zzso triggers major changes in both the zzso and germ cell compartments of the zzso zzso The zzso completes the zzso cell cycle to become a zzso egg, and dramatic changes in gene expression and zzso take place in the zzso compartment of the zzso in preparation for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The concerted changes are regulated by zzso of zzso signaling pathways as well as zzso and zzso regulatory zzso This review will provide a summary of the current knowledge of the molecular events triggered by zzso focusing mostly on the signaling pathways required for zzso zzso
