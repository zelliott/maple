It has been demonstrated that a short zzso event zzso zzso zzso results in a subsequent resistance to severe zzso zzso zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated the role of innate immunity and in particular of zzso zzso zzso 4 in brain zzso Several zzso suggest that zzso might also be involved in zzso zzso we have now used an in zzso model of zzso to investigate whether zzso is involved in zzso A zzso temporary bilateral common carotid arteries zzso was used for focal zzso and it was performed on zzso mice zzso and animals that express zzso normally zzso To assess the ability of zzso to induce zzso permanent middle cerebral artery zzso was performed 48 h after zzso Stroke outcome was evaluated by determination of zzso volume and assessment of neurological zzso zzso caused zzso as shown by a reduction in zzso volume and better outcome in mice expressing zzso zzso zzso mice showed less zzso zzso than zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed an zzso in the expression of these proteins in both zzso of mice measured 18, 24 and 48 h after zzso being higher in mice with zzso Similarly, nuclear zzso B zzso zzso was observed 18, 24 and 48 h after zzso being more intense in zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso is involved in brain tolerance as shown by the difference in the percentage of zzso produced by zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The higher expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in mice expressing zzso is likely to participate in this zzso zzso zzso
