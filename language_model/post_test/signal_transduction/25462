zzso forces at zzso zzso borders maintain vascular zzso zzso enhances barrier properties and controls cellular processes through protein zzso A bound to zzso zzso proteins zzso It also activates exchange protein directly activated by zzso zzso an exchange factor for zzso protein 1 zzso zzso that promotes zzso and zzso zzso through effects on the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso rate in zzso cells, interacts with zzso and is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required for maintaining barrier properties under zzso zzso Rather, it is essential when the cell is challenged to make new adhesive zzso as is the case when zzso zzso enhances barrier function through a mechanism that, surprisingly, requires zzso zzso at zzso zzso In the present study, defects in zzso responses in zzso cells were evident despite an intact zzso increase in zzso zzso cortical zzso and vascular zzso zzso We describe a zzso that zzso zzso signals with zzso zzso dynamics to coordinate zzso at lateral zzso
