zzso zzso is a prominent tumor growth factor for zzso multiple myeloma zzso In addition to its known zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recent work suggests that zzso can also activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in myeloma zzso Because zzso of the zzso as well as zzso pathways may result in downstream stimulation of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we assessed these potential molecular targets in zzso myeloma zzso zzso rapidly activated zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as by a dominant negative zzso of zzso The concurrent requirements for both zzso and zzso appeared to be a result of their ability to zzso zzso on different zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso but zzso zzso had no effect, indicating zzso function was zzso In keeping with these data, a dominant active zzso zzso was sufficient to induce zzso zzso but could not by itself activate zzso zzso zzso Prevention of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso of zzso myeloma cell zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso pathways are required for optimal zzso zzso activity, but zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso Both effects are zzso via zzso target of zzso function, and, zzso these effects are critical for zzso tumor cell zzso
