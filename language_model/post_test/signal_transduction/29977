The molecular zzso underlying innate immunity is constructed of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso with distinct regulatory zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso B molecules play important roles in the initiation of immune zzso zzso We have found that the zzso zzso B protein zzso plays a crucial role in limiting the duration of zzso zzso and output in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso is linked to zzso degradation of zzso the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a rapid termination of zzso zzso resulting in a transient zzso response that precedes the sustained induction of zzso innate immune zzso Because the zzso B module also zzso regulates zzso zzso in zzso thereby controlling zzso zzso the regulatory zzso between the zzso and zzso B pathways appears to be broadly zzso
