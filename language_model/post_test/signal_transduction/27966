Bone formation around implants is influenced by surface zzso Since zzso interactions associated with cell signaling occur in the zzso dimension, we have evaluated the influence of zzso of zzso surfaces on the expression of zzso proteins by cultured zzso cells at initial time zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso of newborn rat zzso and grown on titanium and titanium zzso discs with zzso or zzso surfaces, and on glass zzso for periods of 6 zzso 1 day, and 3 days, under standard culture zzso zzso were processed for single or dual zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso against bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso followed by corresponding zzso secondary zzso Some samples were processed for scanning electron microscope analysis of zzso and zzso zzso After 6 zzso zzso surfaces exhibited up to a zzso increase in the proportion of cells with peripheral zzso zzso At day 3, the proportion of zzso and zzso labeled cells was higher, and the intensity of zzso dramatically zzso No significant differences were observed in the expression pattern and the proportion of cells zzso for zzso or zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso surfaces zzso the early expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso
