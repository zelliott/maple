There is controversy about the origin of the zzso in T helper 1 zzso cell activity after major surgical procedures such as zzso cardiac zzso We hypothesized that a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity may be the sole cause of this zzso shift and that the addition of zzso zzso can reverse zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cell zzso from 20 low-risk zzso cardiac surgery patients were analyzed preoperatively zzso and on the first zzso third zzso and sixth zzso zzso zzso We determined the absolute numbers of T helper zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells after stimulation and measured zzso and zzso levels in the zzso of zzso peripheral blood zzso cell cultures, absolute zzso counts, human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis under comparable zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with a zzso zzso was zzso T helper zzso counts were reduced zzso from zzso to d6 zzso zzso zzso Absolute zzso and zzso T helper zzso counts were reduced on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in T helper zzso remained zzso zzso zzso gamma synthesis was significantly reduced until zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly increased after zzso addition zzso zzso zzso This effect was reversed by the addition of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso shift after cardiac surgery seems to be caused primarily by a decrease in cellular zzso synthesis in zzso zzso Because zzso suppression can be reversed by zzso it is more likely to be the result of altered stimulation pathways than cellular zzso
