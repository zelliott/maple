The zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso production of zzso a zzso form of the nuclear architectural protein zzso zzso zzso is also expressed sporadically in zzso cells and has been linked to zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients exhibit extensive nuclear zzso including abnormal zzso structure and increased DNA zzso At the zzso level, zzso affects several zzso particularly those of zzso zzso How the cellular defects of zzso cells lead to the zzso defects has been zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso interferes with the function of human zzso stem cells zzso We find that expression of zzso activates major downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso changes their molecular identity and differentiation zzso Our results support a model in which accelerated zzso in zzso patients, and possibly also zzso zzso is the result of adult stem cell dysfunction and progressive deterioration of tissue zzso
