zzso zzso is one of the most widespread zzso zzso chemicals zzso used as the base compound in the manufacture of zzso zzso Although evidence points to consider exposure to zzso as a risk factor for insulin resistance, its actions on whole body metabolism and on zzso zzso are still zzso The aim of the present work was to study the effects of low doses of zzso in zzso peripheral zzso and whole body metabolism in adult zzso Adult mice were treated with subcutaneous injection of 100 zzso zzso or vehicle for 8 zzso Whole body energy zzso was assessed with in zzso indirect zzso zzso signaling zzso were conducted by western zzso zzso Mice treated with zzso were insulin resistant and had increased zzso insulin zzso zzso mice had decreased food zzso lower body temperature and locomotor activity compared to zzso In skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso was impaired in zzso zzso This impairment was associated with a reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Both skeletal muscle and liver displayed an zzso of zzso protein by zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso was also impaired in the skeletal muscle from zzso zzso In the liver, zzso effects were of lesser intensity with decreased zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso conclusion, short-term treatment with low doses of zzso slows down whole body energy metabolism and zzso insulin signaling in peripheral zzso Thus, our findings support the notion that zzso can be considered a risk factor for the development of type 2 zzso
