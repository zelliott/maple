zzso zzso is a species of rare edible mushroom whose multiple medicinal functions have been zzso However, reports barely mention the mechanisms of these zzso In this study, the effects of two zzso from zzso zzso zzso on zzso oxide zzso production in zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results showed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited NO zzso zzso the signal mechanisms were also zzso It was found that 100 zzso of zzso and 25 zzso of zzso could efficiently zzso the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression and nuclear zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Moreover, by using a zzso inhibitor zzso to treat the cells, the zzso NO production and zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso were released zzso indicating that zzso probably zzso the zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso Besides, zzso also significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 4, and expression of zzso inducing zzso while zzso seemed to show no regular effect on zzso In conclusion, zzso inhibited NO production in zzso zzso through regulating a series of signal zzso suggesting that zzso play a potential role on zzso and treating related zzso
