Once thought to function only in the zzso of seven membrane spanning receptors zzso the ubiquitous zzso molecules are increasingly appreciated to play important roles in the zzso and signaling of these zzso These functions reflect the ability of the zzso to bind an ever-growing list of signaling and zzso zzso often in an zzso zzso One heavily studied system is that leading to zzso zzso zzso via zzso scaffolding of these pathways in a zzso zzso The zzso are also found to be involved in the regulation of novel zzso systems, such as zzso and zzso zzso
