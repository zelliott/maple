It is well documented that zzso and zzso zzso receptors play a pivotal role in zzso brain zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso receptors are involved in zzso cell death induced by seizure, which is zzso by the zzso zzso module and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with zzso brain zzso Our results show that cerebral zzso followed by zzso can enhance the assembly of the zzso zzso module and zzso zzso As a result, activated zzso can not only zzso the zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso L expression but can also zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso to zzso increase the release of zzso c and increase zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso ultimately results in zzso cell death via nuclear and zzso zzso Furthermore, the peptides we constructed, zzso show a protective role against zzso death induced by cerebral zzso through zzso the zzso zzso signal zzso In zzso our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso brain injury and provides a new approach for stroke zzso
