Although well characterized in the zzso the role of zzso signaling in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso lineage decision is still zzso Although it is clear in the mouse that zzso development is less zzso dependent compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in human have suggested an opposing role for zzso during human zzso zzso Using the zzso system, we demonstrate that changes in zzso zzso are zzso required during human zzso zzso High zzso zzso promotes the generation of zzso precursors and zzso T cells but zzso differentiation toward the zzso zzso zzso the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also at the zzso zzso Gene expression analysis suggests that this is zzso by differential sensitivities of zzso target genes in response to changes in zzso zzso High zzso activity increases zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes that are zzso during zzso zzso Furthermore, increased zzso levels cannot compensate for the zzso dependent zzso zzso Our results reveal zzso molecular changes in zzso signaling that are critical for normal human zzso development and reveal fundamental molecular differences between mouse and zzso
