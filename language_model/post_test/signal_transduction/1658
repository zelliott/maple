Genes zzso proteins for ammonium zzso zzso and the nitrogen regulatory system in zzso zzso were studied on basis of zzso searches using zzso zzso genes as query zzso zzso of zzso of these genes in response to nitrogen zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso were generated to verify the function of distinct zzso In this communication, we were able to identify the key components of ammonium zzso pathways and nitrogen regulation in zzso zzso Moreover, we show in this study that molecular biology methods and zzso developed for zzso zzso can be applied in zzso zzso The results obtained strengthens the role of zzso zzso as a model zzso for zzso zzso zzso
