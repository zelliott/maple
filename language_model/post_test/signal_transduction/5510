zzso zzso level is clinically known to correlate with body weight and insulin zzso Because the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso signaling leading to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduced the amounts of insulin zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso were zzso zzso of zzso was effectively prevented by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso Because zzso induced zzso of zzso at zzso responsible zzso were investigated, and we revealed that zzso and zzso but neither zzso nor zzso C, zzso for degradation of zzso Although zzso prevented the degradation of zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction analysis revealed that zzso did not effectively restore the reduction of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso important for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso action of insulin by zzso the degradation of zzso and zzso via zzso zzso production of zzso oxygen species, and zzso of zzso zzso beta and target of zzso complex zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a novel key factor in the development of insulin resistance in visceral zzso
