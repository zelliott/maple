zzso c is one of the central zzso of the zzso or the intrinsic zzso zzso Mice harboring a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso only its zzso function, have permitted studies on the essential role of zzso zzso zzso in various tissue zzso To this end, we examined the role of zzso c in pancreatic zzso under zzso conditions and in diabetes models, including those induced by zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies have shown that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso however, the precise mechanism in these modes of cell death was not zzso The results of our study show that lack of functional zzso c does not affect zzso zzso or pancreatic zzso mass under zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso intrinsic zzso zzso is required for neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso We also observed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso was not essential in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso c is not required for zzso zzso zzso and, together with the zzso zzso pathway, plays a redundant role in zzso zzso zzso
