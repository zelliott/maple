Loss of zzso zzso results in the rapid onset of zzso in zzso B zzso This observation implies that a competent B cell zzso zzso is not only required for zzso zzso but also for continued survival in the peripheral immune zzso zzso of the B cell zzso zzso is likewise essential for key B cell zzso events including the formation of zzso zzso center, and marginal zone zzso B zzso In this study, we report that zzso also exerts a role before zzso encounter by promoting the survival of zzso zzso B zzso This aspect of zzso signaling was first suggested by the analysis of mixed bone zzso zzso wherein zzso B cells fail to effectively compete with zzso B cells to zzso the peripheral B cell zzso zzso with this zzso zzso and zzso studies reveal a shorter in zzso life span for zzso B cells vs their zzso zzso Moreover, we find that zzso is necessary for propagation of zzso survival signals and thus may contribute to zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso To determine whether provision of a zzso survival signal could compensate for the loss of zzso in zzso zzso mice were bred onto the zzso zzso Here, we observe an increase in zzso B cell numbers and selective recovery of the zzso B cell zzso Together these findings suggest that maintenance of the zzso and zzso B cell compartments require zzso survival zzso
