The requirements of a zzso reference system based on two zzso zzso show a surprising correspondence with the evidence emerging from numerous experimental studies on zzso and zzso the zzso because of the zzso symmetry of its zzso their zzso arrangement and their zzso zzso may play the role of an zzso composed by two zzso zzso that recognizes and zzso zzso zzso or, more generally, geometric molecular signals and translates them into their expected real locations in the zzso The purpose of this study is to outline a theoretical model of the zzso and address the question on zzso the zzso works, rather than investigate zzso zzso might be or zzso might be their task, as many in-depth previous studies have zzso the present analysis looks for the correspondence between structure and function in the zzso zzso a link between zzso zzso instructions and their translation into actual locations into cells, zzso and zzso and finally analyzes zzso behavior in many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, zzso zzso zzso extension, zzso bilateral symmetry and asymmetry zzso
