zzso encephalitis virus zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is indispensable for viral zzso zzso is considered to be highly zzso and can cause lethal zzso In this study, we demonstrate a novel interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso type I and II zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso interacting with zzso was identified using extensive zzso zzso zzso Two consecutive zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso were found to disrupt binding to zzso zzso studies with zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso was present at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso To address the role of viral interference with the zzso response, zzso proteins were expressed in zzso zzso While zzso zzso substantially blocked zzso of zzso a zzso zzso protein defective in zzso binding failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso to zzso locations and zzso the impaired zzso zzso These results define the zzso zzso protein in concert with zzso as an zzso of the zzso response, by demonstrating a correlation between the association and zzso zzso
