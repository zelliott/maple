zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso human zzso cells results in late zzso cell cycle arrest and terminal zzso zzso The zzso zzso arrest involves a marked decrease in zzso activity, which zzso with total zzso zzso Here, we show that the levels of zzso A zzso and protein markedly decrease during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In contrast, the level of zzso E protein remains unchanged and in a complex with zzso during the entire course of zzso zzso During the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity drops zzso Furthermore, the amount of zzso protein associated with zzso zzso greatly increases 24 to 72 hours after zzso zzso The absence of changes in zzso zzso levels by Northern zzso suggest that the levels of this protein are controlled by zzso or zzso zzso These results show that the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso arrest are zzso The zzso of zzso activity is associated with zzso a decrease in zzso A protein levels, zzso zzso of zzso complexes, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
