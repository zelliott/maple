A wide and still rapidly increasing range of zzso sensor proteins has been discovered over the last two zzso At the molecular level, these proteins function as zzso switches in which the zzso activity of an zzso domain is altered mostly by binding or zzso of small gaseous zzso zzso NO or zzso to the zzso in a sensor zzso The initial zzso at the zzso level is subsequently transmitted within the protein to the zzso site, ultimately leading to adapted expression levels of specific zzso Making use of the zzso of the zzso bond that mimics zzso zzso early processes in this zzso signaling zzso can be followed using zzso optical zzso zzso they also occur on zzso accessible to molecular dynamics zzso Experimental studies performed over the last decade on proteins including the sensors zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso are reviewed with an emphasis on emerging general zzso After zzso bond breaking, the zzso can escape from the zzso pocket and eventually from the zzso or zzso directly to the zzso zzso in all sensor proteins the zzso specifically of the sensed zzso is highly zzso This zzso zzso property possibly provides means to zzso the effects of fast environmental fluctuations on the switching zzso For zzso zzso where exchange between an internal zzso zzso and external gaseous zzso occurs, the study of early processes starting from the zzso form indicates that mobility of the internal zzso may facilitate signal zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
