zzso zzso express zzso an zzso zzso which generates zzso oxygen species zzso and is involved in zzso zzso zzso metabolism generates abundant zzso which binds to its receptors and plays important roles in cardiac zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to be expressed in cardiac zzso and coronary zzso zzso However, the role of the zzso in the regulation of cardiac zzso production remains zzso We found that knockout of zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso production in mouse hearts compared to age (10 zzso zzso zzso This was accompanied by a significant decrease in zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso (all zzso In zzso mice, zzso injection of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body weight for 90 zzso inhibited zzso of zzso (a regulatory zzso of zzso which was accompanied by a zzso cardiac zzso production zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso by zzso (all zzso In conclusion, zzso through zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso and cardiac zzso production by zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity may have potential therapeutic applications in controlling zzso production by zzso zzso in the zzso
