In response to traumatic brain injury zzso zzso initiate zzso processes through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso after zzso are poorly zzso To study this, we zzso the zzso brain injury zzso model to investigate zzso in the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling pathways in response to zzso zzso target of zzso stimulates zzso translation through zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso These pathways coordinate cell growth and zzso via zzso protein zzso zzso received sham surgery or moderate zzso zzso on the right side of the zzso cortex, followed by 15 zzso 30 zzso 4 zzso 24 zzso or 72 h of zzso Using Western zzso analysis, we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 30 zzso to 24 h after zzso whereas total protein levels were zzso Using zzso zzso to zzso these changes, we found that zzso zzso was increased in the zzso zzso and all zzso of the zzso In accordance with these results, zzso a key, zzso zzso translation factor, was also zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso 15 zzso after zzso Together, these results suggest that changes in zzso translation may be one mechanism that zzso use to respond to trauma and may contribute to the zzso changes observed after zzso
