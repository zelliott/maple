During development and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso are set up to facilitate cell zzso gene zzso zzso in the establishment or the maintenance of the correct zzso zzso have been associated with diseases ranging from leukemia to muscular zzso The heart expresses many zzso factors, and we are only beginning to understand their roles in heart development and zzso We have previously shown that the zzso regulator zzso is highly expressed in the zzso heart both during development and zzso In the absence of zzso there is a significant reduction in zzso of zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso a zzso mark associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we present evidence that zzso is required for the long-term maintenance of zzso function and for the maintenance of normal cardiac gene zzso zzso hearts displayed progressive deterioration of zzso zzso By 10 months of age, there was zzso reduction in fractional zzso in zzso hearts compared to zzso Analysis of the expression of zzso proteins suggests that zzso is required for the repression of zzso zzso hearts did not exhibit zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso was not the result of zzso zzso Instead, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso promoter, suggesting that zzso directly zzso zzso zzso of the zzso database revealed that zzso is zzso in the hearts of patients with zzso or idiopathic zzso zzso We propose that zzso factors like zzso function in the adult heart to regulate cell zzso and zzso patterns of gene zzso and the disruption of such regulation may be involved in the zzso and/or development of certain forms of human heart zzso
