zzso is an important growth and survival factor for T zzso but also zzso these cells to zzso zzso cell death zzso The molecular basis of these different effects of zzso was studied by introducing zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso beta zzso chain that lacked specific signaling capacities into zzso T cells by zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was found to be involved in T cell proliferation and promoted zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso T cell survival was dependent on a zzso region that activated zzso and the expression of zzso Thus, distinct zzso chain signaling zzso regulate T cell fate by stimulating growth and survival or by promoting zzso
