It is well documented that zzso zzso exerts a cardiovascular protective zzso A possible role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso production has been zzso However, the complex mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso expression are not completely zzso The aims of this study were to examine whether zzso may alter zzso II zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso gene expression and to identify the putative underlying signaling pathways in rat zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso rat zzso smooth muscle cells were zzso with zzso then zzso with zzso II, and zzso incorporation and zzso gene expression were zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested to zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso in proliferation and zzso gene zzso zzso II increased DNA synthesis which was inhibited with zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso zzso gene expression as revealed by Northern zzso and promoter activity zzso This effect was prevented by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso as measured by a zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso cell zzso zzso promoter activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso In zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso gene zzso partially by interfering with the zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso Thus, this study provides important new insight regarding the molecular pathways that may contribute to the proposed beneficial effects of zzso on the cardiovascular zzso
