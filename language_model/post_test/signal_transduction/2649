zzso of zzso particles to zzso zzso receptors has previously been shown to trigger zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso processes in the signaling to zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso Also, the zzso dependence of zzso zzso in response to some soluble agents that directly alters zzso pH was zzso Signaling to zzso zzso zzso differs from that of many other zzso systems, because an zzso of zzso zzso did not trigger a large zzso response, nor did attempts to reduce zzso zzso affect the zzso zzso response to other zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was also a poor stimulus of zzso zzso However, when triggered by zzso or by soluble stimuli raising zzso zzso the zzso response could be zzso by a prior prolonged incubation with zzso zzso Such treatment also had marked effects on the binding and zzso of zzso zzso the study of which was made possible by a novel zzso Furthermore, a synergistic effect on zzso zzso was obtained when stimuli that elevated zzso pH and stimuli that activated zzso were zzso This is of likely relevance for the zzso response to zzso zzso a stimulus that both activates zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso was zzso shown to be inhibited by a reduction of zzso pH or zzso conditions that impair zzso zzso of acid zzso Earlier studies using soluble stimuli have shown a sensitivity of the zzso response to changes in zzso zzso We suggest a model in which the zzso zzso response to an zzso of zzso pH zzso is dependent on zzso zzso activity and zzso can be enhanced further by zzso of zzso We consider zzso activity and zzso of zzso pH as independent and necessary signals, while zzso pH has a zzso effect on some zzso in the signal zzso zzso or in the zzso apparatus zzso
