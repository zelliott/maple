The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso substances that mimic the activity of the zzso zzso zzso signal molecules used by many bacteria for zzso sensing regulation of gene zzso More than a dozen chemically zzso but unidentified substances capable of specifically stimulating the zzso or zzso but not the zzso zzso or zzso AHL bacterial zzso sensing reporter strains were detected in zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso culture zzso zzso of zzso zzso and Chlorella zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicating that these algae may produce compounds that affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensing system of zzso zzso Treatment of the soil zzso zzso zzso with a partially zzso zzso mimic from zzso zzso affected the zzso of 16 of the 25 proteins that were altered in response to the zzso own AHL signals, providing evidence that the zzso mimic affected zzso zzso functions in this zzso zzso zzso mass zzso identified 32 proteins affected by the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso the nitrogen regulatory protein zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso mimic was able to cancel the zzso effects of bacterial zzso on the zzso of seven of these zzso providing evidence that the zzso of AHL mimics by the zzso could be effective in disruption of zzso sensing in naturally encountered zzso
