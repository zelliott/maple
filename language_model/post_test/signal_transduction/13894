zzso acid B zzso zzso is a major water soluble component extracted from zzso zzso zzso a traditional Chinese herb widely used for treating cardiovascular and zzso zzso Sal B has been reported to inhibit transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and collagen type I zzso In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms of Sal B on liver zzso relating to zzso zzso pathway, especially to zzso zzso Liver zzso model was induced by zzso injection of zzso zzso for four zzso zzso were randomly divided into three groups: normal, model, and Sal B zzso zzso in Sal B group were treated by oral administration of Sal B for four weeks from the first day of zzso zzso zzso zzso content in liver tissue was zzso using zzso method and collagen deposition was zzso using Sirius red zzso zzso were isolated from normal rats, and were cultured primarily in zzso zzso At day 4 after isolation, cells were zzso with zzso zzso and treated with 1 and zzso Sal B and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Cell proliferation was examined with zzso zzso The expressions of alpha smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso stain and Western zzso The expression of zzso was zzso by Western zzso and real-time zzso chain zzso The activity of zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso The results showed that Sal B could inhibit collagen deposition and reduce zzso content significantly, and decrease expressions of zzso and zzso in zzso liver zzso Also, Sal B decreased the expressions of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity zzso These findings suggested that Sal B could prevent zzso zzso through zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
