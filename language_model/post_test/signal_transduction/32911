The protein C zzso plays a critical role in the negative regulation of the blood zzso zzso We recently identified an zzso cell zzso for protein zzso protein C zzso The zzso is localized almost exclusively on zzso cells of large vessels and is present at only trace levels or indeed absent from zzso in most zzso Patients with zzso or lupus zzso exhibit elevated levels of plasma zzso which zzso on gels as a single band and is fully capable of binding protein zzso There is no correlation with zzso levels, probably due to different vascular zzso and/or cellular release zzso To understand the mechanisms by which zzso plasma levels are zzso we examined zzso zzso expression in a rat zzso shock zzso The zzso zzso gene exhibited an early immediate gene response to zzso with the zzso levels increasing nearly 4 fold in the first 3-6 zzso before returning toward zzso Plasma levels of zzso also rose about 4 fold with little change in tissue zzso zzso Both processes were markedly attenuated by zzso suggesting that zzso was responsible for increases in zzso and plasma zzso zzso At the level of zzso the induction is zzso by a zzso response element in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso infusion and cell culture experiments support this zzso On zzso zzso is capable of releasing cell surface zzso and this process is blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together these studies indicate that zzso in soluble plasma zzso reflects zzso cell zzso in the larger vessels and is likely to be an indication of local zzso generation near these vessel zzso
