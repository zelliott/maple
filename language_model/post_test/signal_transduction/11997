We report a novel zzso system composed of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso necrosis zzso protein 8 zzso in human primary brain cancer, a zzso entity devoid of the classical zzso zzso zzso In structural zzso studies and zzso zzso experiments we delineated the zzso region of the zzso zzso region of zzso and the zzso repeat units 7 and 8 of zzso to mediate this new zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells, zzso human zzso zzso and short synthetic peptides derived from the zzso zzso domain of human zzso caused the zzso of zzso as determined by elevated zzso zzso levels and the induction of a marked zzso zzso in established zzso zzso cell lines and primary cells from zzso zzso zzso a small competitor zzso we were able to disrupt the zzso increased zzso zzso The zzso migration in zzso cells involves the zzso of zzso and specific protein zzso C pathways and the increased zzso of the potent zzso zzso zzso B zzso a known zzso marker of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity effectively blocked the ability of primary zzso to invade zzso zzso Finally, zzso studies revealed the direct interaction of human zzso with zzso Our results support a therapeutic approach in zzso aimed at targeting multiple steps of the zzso zzso zzso by a combined inhibitor and zzso strategy to block zzso dissemination within the zzso
