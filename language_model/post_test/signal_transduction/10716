zzso respond to a plethora of signals using a limited set of zzso signal zzso zzso Surprisingly, pathways that zzso distinct signals can share protein zzso yet avoid erroneous zzso A highly zzso model system in which to study this paradox is the zzso zzso zzso which harbors three zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso that share multiple signaling zzso In this review we first describe potential mechanisms by which specificity could be achieved by signaling pathways that share zzso Second, we zzso key features and components of the zzso zzso pathways that control the mating zzso response, zzso growth, and the response to high zzso Finally, we review zzso analyses in zzso of zzso that cause zzso between these three zzso pathways and their implications for the zzso bases for signaling zzso Although much remains to be learned, current data indicate that scaffolding and cross zzso zzso play key roles in the maintenance of zzso
