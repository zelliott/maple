zzso acid is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We previously reported a crucial role for zzso acid 1 zzso signaling in zzso pain zzso zzso administration of zzso acid (1 zzso induced abnormal pain behaviors, such as zzso zzso mechanical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which were also observed in partial zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso a zzso acid 1 zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso behaviors, when administered 30 zzso but not 90 zzso before zzso acid injection, suggesting that zzso is a short-lived zzso The blockade of nerve zzso zzso pain by zzso was maximum as late as 3 h after the injury but not after this critical zzso The administration of zzso at 3 h but not at 6 h after injury also blocked zzso changes, including zzso of zzso calcium channel zzso zzso expression in zzso root zzso and reduction of substance P expression in the spinal zzso zzso All of these results using zzso suggest that zzso acid 1 zzso signaling which zzso the development of zzso pain works at an early stage of the critical period after nerve zzso
