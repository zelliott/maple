We have examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso resistance and zzso zzso resistance zzso of zzso zzso against the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Compared to zzso plants, the zzso zzso displayed enhanced zzso resistance against zzso zzso which correlated with zzso expression of the zzso zzso Treating the zzso zzso with BABA zzso the already elevated levels of zzso gene zzso and further increased the level of zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso zzso plants showed enhanced zzso to zzso zzso and failed to show zzso zzso plants showing zzso against zzso zzso produced increased levels of zzso The zzso zzso produced less zzso upon zzso zzso infection than the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso restored zzso resistance, but not zzso against zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso enhanced zzso to zzso zzso is caused by zzso suppression of zzso whereas the lack of zzso is caused by its inability to produce zzso zzso zzso infection suppressed zzso zzso zzso with BABA antagonized this zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso BABA prevents zzso suppression of zzso zzso and zzso the tissue to zzso causing zzso deposition of zzso zzso
