The zzso salt export pump zzso is the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso leads to zzso liver zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by the nuclear zzso X zzso However, zzso zzso though reduced, is retained in the zzso of zzso mice, indicating that additional zzso factors may regulate its zzso Nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso plays a major role in response to zzso stress by binding to zzso elements that regulate many zzso phase I and II zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Computer software analysis of human zzso reveals two zzso zzso zzso recognition elements zzso from the sequence in the zzso promoter region where zzso may zzso In this study, we assessed whether zzso plays a role in human zzso expression and if this might be zzso by zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso zzso expression by approximately zzso in zzso cells and protein by approximately zzso in human zzso Small interfering zzso lowered zzso expression in zzso cells and prevented the zzso of zzso by zzso Human zzso promoter activity was zzso by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso reporter zzso zzso of the predicted zzso but not zzso abolished this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated that zzso specifically bound to zzso but not zzso regions in the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso further demonstrated direct binding of zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso is a positive zzso regulator of human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be beneficial for zzso liver zzso
