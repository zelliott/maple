The zzso facility for zzso humor across the zzso zzso zzso is enhanced by agents that oppose the zzso contraction of its resident zzso zzso of zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso complex of Type 1) at zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso leading to an increase in zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the relative zzso of the two sites of zzso using human TM cells zzso 

zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso was determined by western zzso analysis following exposure to selective zzso of zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and decreases in zzso contraction were assessed by western zzso analysis and collagen gel contraction zzso zzso Changes in the zzso zzso were measured in real time by electric zzso zzso sensing and also assessed by zzso for zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso 

Both ROCK zzso produced a zzso zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso in adherent zzso zzso zzso values for zzso were 15 zzso and 177 zzso for zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the same samples showed a decrease in zzso zzso with zzso values of 14 zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these changes, both zzso opposed contraction of collagen gels induced by TM zzso Exposure of cells to the zzso led to a decrease in the electrical zzso resistance, with the effect of zzso being more pronounced than zzso Treatment with these ROCK zzso also showed a loss of stress fibers and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso oppose zzso zzso of zzso predominantly at zzso with a corresponding decrease in zzso zzso A relatively low effect of both ROCK zzso at zzso suggests a role for other zzso zzso at this zzso zzso was zzso more potent when compared with zzso at zzso the zzso of zzso at either zzso or zzso commensurate with its greater potency at zzso the activity of human zzso and zzso zzso
