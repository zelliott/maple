The zzso properties of the inhibitor of zzso zzso family of proteins have been linked to zzso zzso We have previously described an alternative mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso that depends on the selective zzso of zzso Here we report that two other members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso both activate zzso zzso of zzso inactive zzso blocks zzso and zzso protection against zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso effect of these zzso The zzso zzso zzso appears to be an essential component of this zzso zzso since zzso zzso of zzso as well as protection against zzso and zzso zzso is inhibited when zzso inactive zzso is zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso zzso expression of zzso inactive zzso did not affect zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso activity is achieved by two separate zzso one requiring zzso zzso zzso and the second involving zzso zzso
