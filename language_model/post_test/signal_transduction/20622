The cell surface protein zzso is expressed on immature zzso cells and is zzso in many zzso zzso However the biological function of zzso in tissue maintenance and zzso remains zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso and zzso zzso controls these processes through a mechanism of regulated zzso zzso that leads to zzso of zzso creating two zzso the zzso domain and the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is released from the membrane and accumulates in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso domain promotes zzso zzso through signaling via zzso and is sufficient to initiate precursor zzso to prostate cancer in zzso zzso we demonstrate that loss of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso These findings suggest that heightened expression of zzso is selected for in zzso zzso to enhance the zzso properties of zzso and zzso Defining the mechanism of zzso function in zzso and transformation is essential to identify new therapeutic strategies to block zzso zzso in zzso
