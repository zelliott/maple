The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso still causes regulatory defects when rescued to the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso milieu might affect its ability to respond to zzso zzso We recently reported that zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso airway cell line zzso the functional expression of zzso by promoting zzso organization and formation of the zzso zzso Here, using real-time zzso reporters of both zzso activity and zzso levels, we find that lack of an organized zzso zzso in zzso causes both defective zzso of zzso in the zzso compartment and excessive zzso zzso of zzso This results in reduced zzso levels and increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso restores zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and local zzso activity, indicating that regulation of zzso function requires not only stable expression of the zzso zzso at the cell surface but also depends on both generation of local zzso signals of adequate zzso and zzso of zzso in proximity of its zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso results in both altered zzso organization and loss of zzso zzso whereas stable zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells restores zzso organization and zzso the zzso of zzso at the plasma zzso This suggests that the presence of zzso on the plasma membrane influences the zzso organizational state and, consequently, zzso zzso Our data show that a sufficiently high concentration of zzso in the zzso compartment is required to achieve zzso regulation of zzso zzso
