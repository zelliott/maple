The zzso and zzso growth factor zzso pathways both regulate cell fate zzso during zzso neural zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso This result, together with recent evidence that zzso zzso can be zzso suggested that zzso signaling might promote zzso and zzso zzso character zzso zzso with this idea, we found that in addition to promoting zzso zzso character in zzso activated zzso zzso increased the frequency of embryonic day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that grew into zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding factor zzso a zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso frequency in zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso on zzso responsiveness is zzso by zzso The observation that zzso promoted zzso responsiveness in zzso zzso prompted us to examine the effect of zzso zzso zzso in zzso We focused on zzso because it is expressed in zzso zzso in the zzso where zzso increases zzso zzso frequency, but not in the zzso where it does zzso Like zzso activated zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso character in zzso However, unlike zzso zzso did not enhance zzso frequency at zzso Additional analysis demonstrated that, unexpectedly, neither zzso nor zzso could replace the need for zzso in promoting zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso are maintained by interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso and that the mechanisms by which zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso character in zzso and zzso proliferation in zzso can be zzso
