zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso terminal zzso sequence activates zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain in a zzso that reveals the structural effects of zzso and a molecular mechanism for zzso Within a zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso near two putative zzso binding pockets of the neighboring zzso in a position ready to interact upon zzso The zzso domain zzso concerted zzso changes upon zzso which signal zzso zzso from the zzso zzso for subsequent zzso assembly with zzso zzso and modeling studies reveal unique favorable interactions within the zzso zzso zzso providing a structural basis for their association in zzso
