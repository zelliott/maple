Increased rates of zzso have been reported to play a role in the zzso of many disorders, including liver zzso zzso genetic zzso that result in impairment of programmed cell death have been associated with cancer zzso However, zzso resistance can also be the result of zzso stress adaptation, as seen in the zzso zzso liver disease zzso zzso To clarify whether zzso zzso resistance is a general feature of chronic liver diseases, an animal model of chronic zzso was zzso 

Studies were performed with mice before and 2 weeks following zzso duct zzso and with zzso and zzso mice before and after zzso zzso 

Here we show that zzso duct zzso induced profound resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso was blocked downstream of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso c zzso In controls, zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in rapid zzso of Bid and its subsequent zzso whereas Bid remained zzso and zzso in chronic zzso and other models of zzso zzso zzso 

We propose a model in which the zzso status of Bid determines the zzso threshold of zzso in zzso Furthermore, resistance to zzso in chronic zzso may contribute to the long-term risk of cancer in this zzso
