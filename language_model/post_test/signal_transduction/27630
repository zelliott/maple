In response to DNA damage and replication blocks, cells activate pathways that arrest the cell cycle and induce the zzso of genes that facilitate zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with other checkpoint zzso are important components in this zzso We have cloned the rat and human zzso of zzso zzso zzso 53 and zzso zzso zzso called checkpoint zzso 2 zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso can partially replace the function of the defective checkpoint zzso in the zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso was zzso and activated in response to DNA damage in an zzso dependent zzso Its zzso in response to replication blocks by zzso zzso treatment, however, was independent of zzso Using mass zzso we found that, similar to zzso zzso can zzso zzso 216 in zzso a site known to be involved in negative regulation of zzso These results suggest that zzso is a downstream zzso of the zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso of zzso might not only delay zzso entry, but also increase the capacity of cultured cells to survive after treatment with zzso or with the zzso inhibitor zzso
