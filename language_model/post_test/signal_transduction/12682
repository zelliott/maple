Although zzso draws increasing attention, not much is known about zzso zzso Here we argue that in all zzso zzso signals transmit through zzso pre-existing zzso which pathways dominate depend on protein zzso specific binding events, zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso Further, zzso events at any site on the protein surface (or in the zzso will not create new pathways but only shift the pre-existing ensemble of zzso Drugs binding at different sites or zzso events in disease shift the ensemble toward the same zzso however, the relative populations of the different states will zzso zzso the observed functional, zzso and dynamic effects will be zzso This is the origin of zzso functional zzso in dynamic zzso zzso does not necessarily need to invoke zzso zzso to control protein activity and pre-existing pathways are always defaulted to during zzso regardless of the stimulant and zzso site in the zzso
