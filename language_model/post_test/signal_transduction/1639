We previously reported that viral zzso expression was markedly zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso similar to the effects of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in model cells for zzso zzso In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of this novel zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed specific binding of zzso on the surface of zzso infected zzso Furthermore, zzso of Ras in the cells was detected after treatment with zzso indicating the involvement of Ras in zzso zzso of zzso from zzso This was also confirmed by the observations that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly zzso by introduction of the active Ras into zzso cells, and that zzso activity observed in zzso cells was specifically inhibited by introduction of a dominant negative zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso but not by zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso in zzso model cells occurs by signal zzso from Ras to zzso protein zzso zzso
