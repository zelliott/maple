zzso of brain zzso zzso in conscious zzso decreases heart rate zzso and mean zzso blood pressure zzso and increases urine output and urinary sodium zzso In zzso zzso zzso stimulation activates zzso , zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Here we have investigated whether these same zzso zzso pathways mediate the cardiovascular and zzso zzso responses to central zzso zzso zzso in conscious zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso by zzso injection zzso with an zzso zzso targeted to a zzso , zzso , zzso , zzso , zzso or a scrambled zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso 24 zzso On the day of study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline vehicle, was injected zzso into zzso conscious zzso zzso and zzso were recorded, and urine was collected for 150 zzso 

In zzso and zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso decreased zzso and HR, and produced marked zzso and zzso zzso Selective zzso zzso of brain zzso zzso proteins abolished the central zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, following selective zzso zzso the characteristic zzso response to zzso zzso was converted to an immediate increase in zzso The zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso were not blocked by zzso with any zzso 

There was functional selectivity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso the zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso responses evoked by central zzso zzso zzso in zzso
