zzso protein zzso zzso represent a burgeoning concept in zzso signaling and have been implicated in a range of control zzso This paper describes the zzso and molecular characterization of zzso a zzso zzso After cloning and expression as a zzso fusion protein in zzso coli, zzso was found to zzso itself and zzso zzso like zzso basic protein and zzso The zzso activity of zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results confirmed that zzso is a zzso protein and is restricted to members of the zzso tuberculosis zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso in zzso tuberculosis under various stress conditions revealed that exposure to low pH and heat shock decreased the level of zzso zzso zzso This is the first report describing differential expression of a zzso zzso in response to stress conditions which can indicate its ability to regulate cellular events promoting bacterial adaptation to environmental zzso
