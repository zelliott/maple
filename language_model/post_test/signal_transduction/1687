Several zzso channels and pumps are regulated by zzso zzso a component of the synaptic zzso zzso and fusion zzso One such regulated protein is the rat brain zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso this interaction zzso a decrease in the rate at which zzso and associated zzso are zzso zzso function also is regulated by zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso mediate at least some of their effects by regulating the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso In zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases the zzso transport zzso The zzso rate change zzso is prevented by zzso of zzso antagonists, zzso does not occur in zzso expressing zzso alone, and zzso does not occur in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso that zzso express both zzso and zzso zzso zzso application results in a decrease in the fraction of zzso zzso that is bound to zzso on a zzso comparable to the zzso change in transport zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso interactions and provide a mechanism by which zzso transport can be increased during times of rising synaptic zzso zzso
