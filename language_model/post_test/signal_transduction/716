Growth and differentiation factor 5 zzso member of zzso zzso has been implicated in limb development, and is known to play an important role in joint zzso Its absence leads to zzso in mice and a number of skeletal zzso syndromes in zzso Recently, an association was shown between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the role of zzso may reach beyond the musculoskeletal zzso zzso appears present in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may limit the response to zzso This may have consequences for immune responses and zzso function in general, and for arthritis in zzso Here we compared the sensitivity of zzso mice and wild type zzso mice to zzso 

zzso zzso from zzso mice and zzso mice were zzso for zzso with zzso zzso 10 or 100 zzso The zzso was collected and zzso release was measured by zzso and by an indirect zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso (30 zzso and zzso induced zzso was checked every 3 hours for 36 zzso 

zzso zzso showed no difference in zzso expression upon zzso stimulation measured by zzso and by indirect zzso zzso zzso mice died upon a lethal dose of zzso as is seen in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso appears not to affect the zzso zzso Mice with a reduced expression of zzso can be used in disease models which are dependent on zzso zzso
