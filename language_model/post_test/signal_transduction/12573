zzso is a major active component of ginger and a natural zzso zzso The present study investigated whether zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in human airway zzso cells and, if so, examined whether the suppression of zzso gene expression is zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and protein were measured using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso analysis in cultured zzso human airway zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were analyzed by Western zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso increased in zzso cells upon treatment with 10 zzso of zzso beta for 24 zzso When the cells were zzso with 10 zzso of zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein was significantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed in cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso operated via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso suppresses zzso beta zzso zzso gene expression in human airway zzso cells via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore, zzso may be considered a possible zzso zzso
