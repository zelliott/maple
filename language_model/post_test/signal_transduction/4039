Basic zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso for zzso smooth muscle cells, has been shown to play a fundamental role in the zzso of zzso and zzso by stimulating the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle zzso We found that partially zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso at zzso zzso block growth and division of cultured human and bovine coronary smooth muscle cells in a zzso zzso The effect is sequence specific at low zzso zzso nontoxic zzso It is associated with zzso of expression of zzso and zzso zzso with a decreased de zzso synthesis of zzso and is partly zzso by the addition of zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect lasts zzso h and diminishes zzso If the zzso zzso medium is replaced by an zzso medium after 24 zzso the zzso incorporation rate returns to control zzso Under the same conditions, the corresponding sense zzso exerts negligible zzso zzso zzso The zzso potency of the zzso zzso zzso is markedly enhanced by adding zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The data zzso zzso in the process of smooth muscle cell proliferation and an effective and specific zzso potency of zzso zzso zzso The results point to possible new therapeutic strategies for the use of zzso methodology in the suppression of zzso zzso
