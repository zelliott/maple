The common zzso zzso is at the core of zzso signaling between plants and soil zzso In this pathway, zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso the signals both in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in root zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which zzso coordinates zzso and zzso is largely zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso without the regulatory zzso activate both zzso and zzso signaling pathways in the absence of symbiotic zzso This zzso requires nuclear zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso by fusion with a zzso nuclear zzso signal enhances signaling activity of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso triggers formation of a structure similar to the zzso apparatus, which guides infection of zzso zzso zzso to host root zzso In addition, the zzso zzso without the regulatory zzso partly restore zzso but fail to support zzso infection in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso the more ancient type of zzso can be mainly regulated by the zzso activity of zzso whereas zzso which evolved more recently, requires complex regulation performed by the regulatory zzso of zzso
