Small zzso including the zzso Ras and zzso zzso are involved in various cellular signaling zzso Some of these small zzso are zzso sensitive, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso regulation of these zzso often determines the course of their cellular signaling zzso This article takes into consideration the application of Marcus theory to potential zzso molecular mechanisms in the regulation of these zzso zzso and the relevance of such mechanisms to a specific zzso zzso The discussion also takes into account various diseases, including zzso heart, and zzso disorders, that are often linked with the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso associated with these zzso zzso
