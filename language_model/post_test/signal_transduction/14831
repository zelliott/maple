The zzso transition zzso is crucial for the invasion and zzso of many zzso tumors including zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a scattering and zzso zzso with reduced zzso contacts was found in the zzso colon cancer cells zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso which was accompanied by a loss of zzso as well as a zzso zzso of zzso two most prominent markers of zzso Whereas zzso zzso was likely to be accounted by a zzso zzso repression, the zzso of zzso was a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and/or its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells seemed to be attributed mainly to a stabilization of this zzso by zzso with particularly interesting new zzso protein zzso more zzso In the meantime, a strong correlation between the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients was also revealed by zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest a novel role of zzso in promoting zzso progression by inducing an zzso in tumor cells via zzso zzso and zzso its signal zzso
