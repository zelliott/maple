zzso interactions within zzso zzso and zzso mosaics formed by different types of zzso represent an important zzso mechanism for signaling in brain networks at the level of the plasma zzso The malfunction of special zzso and zzso mosaics in the zzso zzso containing zzso receptors and zzso receptors in cortical networks may contribute to disturbances of key pathways involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prefrontal zzso zzso that may lead to the development of zzso The zzso zzso zzso emotional information to the cerebral zzso through a zzso regulated zzso zzso circuit which is of special interest to schizophrenia in view of the reduced number of zzso zzso projections associated with this zzso This circuit is especially vulnerable to zzso zzso activity in the nucleus zzso since it produces a reduction in the prefrontal zzso drive from the zzso zzso The following zzso zzso containing zzso mosaics are of special interest to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and are discussed in this zzso They may have a differential distribution pattern in the local circuits of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, predominantly located zzso Specifically, zzso zzso mosaics consisting of zzso and zzso may also exist in these local circuits and are zzso The integration of zzso signaling within assembled zzso mosaics is brought about by zzso and zzso zzso These cause the zzso zzso zzso via zzso mechanisms, to produce zzso changes that pass over the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is discussed as well as the role of the cortical zzso zzso mosaic in schizophrenia zzso et zzso zzso zzso interactions within zzso zzso mosaics of different receptors in the zzso zzso and cerebral zzso give novel strategies for treatment of schizophrenia zzso zzso zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or combined therapies with some of these zzso combined with zzso zzso that specifically target the zzso zzso In addition, a combined targeting of zzso mosaics in the zzso zzso and in the cerebral zzso should also be zzso
