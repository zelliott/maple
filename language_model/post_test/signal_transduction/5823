The zzso expressed G protein zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso responses and is an important regulator of energy and zzso zzso We have generated skeletal zzso zzso zzso mice zzso by mating zzso mice with muscle zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso mice had normal body weight and zzso and their serum zzso insulin, free fatty acid, and zzso levels were similar to that of zzso However, zzso mice were zzso intolerant despite the fact that insulin sensitivity and zzso insulin zzso were normal, suggesting an zzso zzso zzso muscles from zzso mice had increased zzso zzso zzso and normal responses to a zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso which indicates that zzso and its downstream pathways are zzso Compared with control mice, zzso mice had reduced muscle mass with decreased zzso area and force zzso In addition, adult zzso mice showed an increased proportion of type I zzso zzso fibers based on kinetic properties and zzso heavy chain zzso despite the fact that these muscles had reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso content and zzso zzso Therefore zzso zzso led to zzso zzso zzso which appeared to be zzso from the expected change in zzso zzso zzso mice are a valuable model for future studies of the role of zzso signaling pathways in skeletal muscle adaptation and their effects on whole body zzso
