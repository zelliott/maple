zzso precisely the functioning of zzso zzso channels and their zzso by signaling molecules will help clarifying the zzso mechanisms controlling zzso in zzso zzso In recent years, we have learned more about the various pathways through which zzso channels can be zzso or zzso by hormones and zzso and how these changes may condition zzso cell activity and zzso zzso Recently, the attention has been focused on the zzso of zzso zzso 1), which represent the major zzso current component in rat and human zzso zzso zzso are effectively inhibited by the released content of zzso zzso or by applying zzso of zzso zzso zzso and adrenaline through the zzso of zzso G zzso This unusual zzso persists in a wide range of zzso and results from a direct zzso interaction of G protein zzso with the zzso zzso in membrane zzso zzso of zzso can be reversed when the zzso zzso is activated by membrane permeable zzso analog or when cells are exposed to zzso zzso zzso suggesting the existence of parallel and opposite effects on zzso gating by distinctly activated membrane zzso Here, the authors review the molecular components underlying these two opposing signaling pathways and present new evidence supporting the presence of two zzso types in rat zzso cells zzso and zzso which open new interesting issues concerning zzso zzso In light of recent findings on the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso the authors explore the possible role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
