zzso species trigger host membrane zzso to force their zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso This requires bacterial zzso protein delivery into the target cell via a type III zzso zzso Six zzso zzso manipulate cellular zzso zzso but how their direct and indirect activities are zzso and temporally zzso to promote productive zzso zzso remains essentially zzso To gain further insight into this process, we applied mechanical cell zzso and zzso zzso to systematically investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cultured zzso Although five zzso contain no apparent zzso zzso all six localized exclusively in the target cell plasma membrane fraction and zzso were zzso at the cell zzso from where they induced distinct effects on the zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso pool was zzso in the cell zzso Using parallel in zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso cellular zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for membrane association of the zzso zzso exchange factor and zzso protein mimics zzso and zzso which have no intrinsic zzso zzso The data show that the host plasma membrane is a critical interface for zzso interaction, and establish versatile systems to further dissect zzso zzso
