It has long been known that zzso levels of zzso are implicated in the process of zzso resumption in bovine zzso The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of various zzso of zzso in a zzso system with zzso cell zzso that have been shown to promote zzso arrest zzso zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso were obtained from a zzso and zzso were collected by puncture of zzso to zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso were cultured for 18 h in tissue culture medium 199 supplemented with zzso fetal calf serum and various zzso When zzso zzso , a protein zzso A zzso was used alone, a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in the percentage of zzso maintained in zzso stage was zzso In the zzso system with zzso cell zzso that maintained zzso at the zzso stage, zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso decreased this zzso When zzso were zzso of their zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso alone did not significantly increase the percentage of zzso maintained at the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso were not significantly maintained at the zzso stage when zzso with zzso cell zzso In the absence of zzso cell zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso the percentage of zzso zzso maintained at the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso were not effective in maintaining zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso by zzso Using zzso cell zzso with zzso the percentage of zzso maintained at the zzso stage was not significantly zzso These results suggest that zzso were maintained in zzso arrest by zzso of zzso protein zzso by zzso in zzso zzso It seems that zzso factors originating from zzso cells are regulated by a zzso protein zzso In turn, zzso factors released from zzso cells may regulate a zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso
