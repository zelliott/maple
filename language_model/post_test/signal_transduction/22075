zzso stem cells zzso can be used as a delivery vehicle for gene therapy against brain tumors, because these cells have a migratory capacity toward zzso zzso zzso factors including zzso or growth factors expressed and released by zzso cells mediate the zzso of zzso for zzso Among them, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a key zzso related to the zzso of zzso in many zzso containing zzso In this study, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the migratory capacity of zzso toward zzso We showed that zzso have the migration ability toward the zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso zzso treatment increased the migration capacity of zzso in a zzso manner and zzso of zzso or zzso by treatment with the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso blocked the migration capacity of zzso toward zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso showed a stronger migration capacity toward zzso cells in zzso compared with control zzso and also exhibited enhanced migration to zzso cells in an zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso could be involved in recruitment of zzso to zzso cells and that zzso of zzso may be a useful tool for stem zzso zzso zzso
