zzso increases the volume of isolated zzso and cells in zzso zzso but effects of the hormone on the volume of fat or muscle cells have not been zzso zzso zzso acids may stimulate swelling of liver cells and induce zzso effects on zzso protein zzso however, swelling of liver cells can be induced by some treatment that do not induce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids also influence protein metabolism of fat and muscle cells, but no relationship with cell volume has been established and no corresponding effects on metabolism of carbohydrates or lipids have been zzso Three families of zzso protein zzso are activated after changes in zzso zzso but they appear to play little or no role in the zzso actions of zzso zzso evidence against a zzso role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso are strongly activated by environmental stresses associated with zzso zzso We conclude that cell volume and protein metabolism may be correlated in liver but there is no compelling evidence that the effects of insulin on metabolism of liver, fat, or muscle cells can be accounted for by changes in cell zzso The effects of insulin on cell volume may represent a discrete aspect of the complete zzso response rather than an obligatory intermediate step in zzso zzso
