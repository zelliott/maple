zzso heavy chain class switching is directed by zzso inducing zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso such primed cells can undergo switch zzso to express the selected new zzso In the case of zzso class zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso promoter by inducing the interaction of the zzso factor zzso zzso with a responsive DNA element in the zzso region of the zzso This study describes the characterization of two additional zzso elements that interact with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor family in an zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show that the zzso complex formed on the upstream site zzso zzso zzso contains the classical zzso zzso The complex on the zzso site zzso zzso zzso appears to be composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter reporter gene zzso carrying point zzso in the zzso zzso B2 site were largely unresponsive to zzso stimulation in transient zzso experiments, while plasmids with similar zzso in the zzso zzso B1 site responded to zzso stimulation better than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso B2 effect was dependent on the presence of the zzso binding site, demonstrating that the zzso zzso B2 motif is necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso In addition, the combination of a zzso zzso zzso binding site and the zzso response element zzso zzso zzso to a zzso minimal promoter, while the individual sites had no zzso The available data suggest that the zzso zzso B2 zzso complex may cooperate with zzso zzso to achieve zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso
