We zzso demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in the induction of not only acute contact hypersensitivity zzso but also chronic zzso in a mouse model using zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, determine whether synthetic zzso DNA with a high affinity for zzso can be introduced in zzso as a decoy zzso element to bind the zzso factor and block the induction of not only acute zzso but also chronic zzso Treatment by the zzso of zzso decoy zzso zzso after the induction of zzso or other zzso had a significant zzso effect on the induction of both acute zzso and chronic zzso We thus examined the mechanism of the in zzso effect of the zzso of zzso decoy zzso in both acute and chronic zzso In the zzso analysis, the zzso of zzso and zzso mast cells, and the production of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso in the extracts from challenged skin significantly decreased by the zzso of zzso decoy zzso We zzso report the first successful in zzso transfer of zzso decoy zzso to inhibit acute and chronic zzso thus providing a new therapeutic strategy not only for the treatment of zzso but also for zzso zzso
