zzso zzso zzso ex zzso an zzso medicinal plant, has been traditionally used for the treatment of zzso but its molecular mechanism remains zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso and to determine the effects of zzso zzso on insulin zzso in zzso cells for the treatment of type 2 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso leaf zzso Western zzso analysis, oil Red O zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate zzso zzso activity and insulin zzso effects of zzso zzso leaf extract zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced zzso and the expression of zzso target zzso including zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso as well as proteins involved in zzso including zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso led to significant induction of zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso but not to zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The enhanced zzso zzso by zzso were abolished by treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but not by compound C, an zzso zzso 

zzso with the high zzso zzso activity, zzso increased zzso zzso through zzso zzso and insulin zzso These results suggest that zzso could have pharmacological effects for the treatment of zzso and type 2 zzso
