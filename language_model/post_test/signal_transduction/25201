zzso were raised against the zzso of the putative zzso lateral membrane zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso In Western analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for a zzso zzso A protein of zzso zzso was also labeled by the affinity zzso zzso zzso label was diminished in the presence of excess zzso zzso The zzso zzso against the nuclear zzso zzso failed to detect an appropriate band in zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso cells with zzso zzso but not zzso affected the following two zzso signal zzso events: zzso zzso calcium and protein zzso C zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso by Western analyses and zzso zzso revealed the highest zzso in zzso followed by the zzso zzso Exposure of isolated zzso cells to zzso for 10 s or vascular zzso of zzso for 5 zzso resulted in a zzso increase in nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso as judged by electron zzso whereas 24, zzso zzso failed to increase zzso labeling in zzso zzso zzso of Western blots of zzso zzso prepared from isolated zzso cells treated with vehicle or zzso confirmed a zzso increase of putative zzso in the zzso It is concluded that a novel cell surface binding protein for zzso has been zzso
