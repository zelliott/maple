zzso zzso initiate fatty acid zzso in plant zzso with formation of zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which is deficient in zzso activity, and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso which are insensitive to zzso have been used to investigate zzso zzso zzso cloning indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso are located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In agreement, the zzso and zzso zzso renamed as zzso and zzso respectively, showed enhanced zzso zzso zzso The correlation between increased zzso production and reduced zzso sensitivity indicated by these results was supported by experiments in which zzso added zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso impaired the responses to zzso Moreover, a zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was indicated by results showing that the effect of zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso We found that the zzso and zzso pathways regulate the response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the massive zzso changes seen in zzso plants in response to zzso oxygen were greatly affected in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso displayed enhanced zzso to both zzso oxygen and zzso zzso zzso tomato, in the latter case leading to increased zzso of the zzso zzso product zzso These findings demonstrate an zzso relationship between products of the zzso and zzso zzso and suggest a role for the zzso zzso in modulating zzso stress, zzso zzso and plant zzso
