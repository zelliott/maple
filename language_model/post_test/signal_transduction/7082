Patients with age related zzso zzso zzso will develop vision loss in the center of the visual zzso zzso oxygen species zzso retinal zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is an important contributor of zzso In this study, we explored the zzso effect of zzso stimulating hormone zzso on zzso stressed zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso was functionally expressed in primary and transformed zzso zzso zzso cells were response to zzso zzso zzso activated zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, which were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso protected zzso cells from hydrogen zzso zzso zzso an effect that was almost abolished when zzso was depleted by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effect against zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, zzso zzso by zzso or by zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso effect in zzso zzso Thus, zzso and its downstream zzso signaling mediates zzso survival in zzso zzso In zzso we have identified a new zzso zzso zzso that reduces zzso zzso cell damage, and might minimize the risk of developing zzso
