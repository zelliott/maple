This study demonstrates that zzso receptors previously identified in the pregnant rat zzso are zzso They can be zzso zzso and zzso receptors on the basis of their affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Between Day 21 of pregnancy and term, the proportion of zzso binding sites with low affinity for zzso and sensitive to zzso by zzso M zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso remained zzso In contrast, the number of zzso binding sites with a high affinity for zzso and insensitive to zzso zzso zzso increased by zzso at zzso The effect of zzso zzso on competition of the zzso zzso for zzso binding in the presence of zzso or after zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso underwent zzso whereas the zzso zzso protein coupled state was increased zzso zzso zzso consistently zzso zzso C activity on membrane zzso prepared from term zzso This stimulation was completely inhibited after zzso M zzso but was not consistently decreased with zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also specifically blocked the zzso zzso C zzso zzso these results strongly suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the pregnant zzso at term may contribute to the stimulation of the G zzso zzso C signaling zzso
