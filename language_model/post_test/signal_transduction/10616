The major vault protein zzso is the main component of zzso large zzso particles implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling zzso and zzso zzso Here, we identify zzso as an zzso gamma zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso promoter activity as well as zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso involved zzso zzso through the zzso zzso based on an interaction of zzso with an zzso site zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this site distinctly reduced zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly enhanced the translation rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso lung cancer cell model zzso led to a zzso of three known zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, presence of zzso in zzso cells blocked both zzso and zzso zzso expression whereas zzso of zzso zzso levels by zzso enhanced zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by significantly reduced zzso zzso at zzso and diminished zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso we identify zzso as an zzso gene interfering with zzso zzso zzso These data further substantiate that the vault particle functions as a general interaction platform for cellular signaling zzso
