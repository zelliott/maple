zzso A and zzso are zzso compounds that have similar zzso effects on the expression of several zzso produced by T zzso Despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which raises the possibility that they have different modes of zzso Using zzso in which zzso production controlled by a specific zzso factor could be readily measured we found that both zzso A and zzso completely inhibited zzso activated by zzso zzso A, zzso B and partially inhibited zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso inhibited only zzso zzso that was dependent on zzso zzso However, zzso A and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso dependent expression of zzso zzso indicating that only a subset of zzso pathways regulated by zzso is sensitive to these zzso Furthermore, we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of zzso A and zzso on six different zzso factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel zzso dependent step that regulates several zzso zzso
