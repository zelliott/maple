An increase in cardiac zzso typically produces concentric zzso characterized by an increase in zzso zzso whereas volume overload or exercise results in eccentric growth characterized by cellular zzso and addition of zzso in zzso The signaling pathways that control eccentric versus concentric heart growth are not well zzso 

To determine the role of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso in regulating the cardiac zzso zzso 

Here, we used mice lacking all zzso protein in the heart zzso zzso and mice expressing activated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the heart to induce zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments in cultured zzso to assess cellular growth characteristics associated with this signaling zzso Although genetic deletion of all zzso from the mouse heart did not block the cardiac zzso response per se, meaning that the heart still increased in weight with both aging and pathological stress zzso it did dramatically alter how the heart zzso For example, adult zzso from hearts of zzso zzso mice showed preferential eccentric growth zzso whereas zzso from zzso transgenic hearts showed concentric growth zzso zzso zzso adult zzso acutely inhibited for zzso signaling by zzso gene transfer showed spontaneous zzso whereas infection with an activated zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso signaling and increased zzso zzso A similar effect was observed in engineered heart tissue under zzso zzso where zzso zzso led to preferential zzso 

Taken together, these data demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso uniquely regulates the balance between eccentric and concentric growth of the zzso
