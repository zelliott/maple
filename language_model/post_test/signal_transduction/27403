The molecular basis of the insulin resistance of zzso and skeletal muscle during zzso has been investigated in zzso The number of insulin receptors per zzso or per unit membrane protein for skeletal muscle is unchanged by zzso The ability of insulin to stimulate zzso of its zzso was enhanced in zzso but not in skeletal muscle during zzso This increased zzso was due, at least in part, to enhanced zzso zzso and was found when both zzso zzso insulin receptors and intact zzso were incubated with zzso The ability of the insulin zzso zzso to zzso other proteins did not appear to be altered by zzso this was shown with zzso insulin receptors using the artificial zzso zzso zzso and in intact zzso zzso had no effect on the ability of insulin to activate two key downstream zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The study thus shows that the insulin resistance of zzso in sheep is due to changes downstream of the zzso in both zzso and skeletal zzso
