Type I zzso are crucial zzso of innate immunity for combating viral zzso Signaling through type I zzso receptors triggers the zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Although an essential role of zzso and zzso for type I zzso zzso response has been well established by studies of zzso mice and human zzso the role of zzso for this response remains zzso Using zzso and zzso approaches, we demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates type I zzso zzso zzso zzso or knockout cells displayed enhanced gene expression and zzso activity in response to zzso Restoration of zzso to zzso cells resulted in zzso of the zzso Upon viral infection, increased type I zzso production in zzso cells resulted in enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso One mechanism for the enhanced zzso production and response in the absence of zzso might operate through an zzso zzso zzso also appeared to suppress zzso response directly in a manner dependent on its zzso domain and independent of its function as a zzso zzso Taken together, these results define zzso as a negative regulator of type I zzso response and provide a therapeutic target for viral zzso
