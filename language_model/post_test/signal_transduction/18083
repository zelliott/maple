zzso stimulation of zzso induced an increase in the specific activity of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The earliest time after collagen stimulation that an increase in zzso activity was observed was 30 zzso However, the maximum activity of zzso in the zzso fraction was observed 60 s after collagen zzso At this time an approximately twofold increase of zzso activity towards zzso of zzso specific zzso and zzso and a zzso increase towards zzso of zzso itself was zzso Furthermore, the majority of zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso fraction in resting zzso zzso zzso to different zzso and zzso zzso of all of these proteins from the zzso fraction to the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence that collagen stimulation of zzso increases the zzso zzso activity of zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso signal zzso by zzso signaling zzso
