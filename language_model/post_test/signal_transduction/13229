The complement zzso component zzso been demonstrated to be a key link between innate and zzso zzso The zzso complex of complement zzso type 2 zzso zzso and zzso is known to promote B cell zzso when zzso with the B cell zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed to zzso the role of human complement zzso type 1 zzso the other zzso on B zzso As zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are used, which bind to zzso but not to zzso In experiments studying the functional consequences of zzso the zzso zzso is shown to inhibit the proliferation of zzso B cells activated with a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso this zzso activity also occurs in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso transient increase in the concentration of zzso free zzso and zzso of several zzso proteins are strongly reduced in the presence of the zzso zzso Data presented indicate that zzso has a negative regulatory role in the B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of human B zzso
