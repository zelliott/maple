We investigated the roles of bare zzso protein zzso sonic zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso signaling centers in regulating the patterned outgrowth of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso beads in the anterior zzso of stage 10 chicken zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso mice leads to increased zzso signaling and loss of zzso expression in the zzso Increased zzso signaling and loss of zzso and zzso expression was correlated with decreased zzso increased cell death, and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso However, decreased zzso zzso through zzso expression of zzso a zzso zzso also caused decreased proliferation and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso but with maintenance of zzso and zzso zzso and no zzso increase in cell zzso These results suggest that optimal growth requires a balance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that the juxtaposition of zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso generate patterning centers that coordinate the growth of the zzso and zzso zzso similar to how zzso zzso and zzso regulate growth of the limb zzso Furthermore, these patterning centers regulate regional zzso within the zzso and eye, as exemplified by the regulation of zzso expression by different levels of zzso zzso In zzso we present evidence that there is zzso between zzso zzso and zzso signaling centers in the zzso which regulate zzso of, and regional zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso
