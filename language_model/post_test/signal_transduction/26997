Signaling via the zzso complex zzso programmed cell death zzso in immature zzso and transformed T zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso evidence indicates, however, that zzso can be triggered also in mature peripheral T zzso Here we show that a significant fraction of cells of a given zzso zzso beta + clone or zzso short term line is killed when cultured for 20 h in the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso can be triggered by these stimuli in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death (as zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is associated with fragmentation of DNA into zzso bands of approximately 200 zzso Although freshly isolated peripheral blood T cells are largely resistant to zzso the sensitivity to zzso zzso or zzso cell death gradually increases upon zzso and zzso culture of T cells, and reaches a plateau level after 15 to 20 zzso These data indicate that stimuli that activate resting T cells initiate death by zzso in activated T zzso The implications of these results for the regulation of cellular immune responses and the establishment of peripheral tolerance will be zzso
