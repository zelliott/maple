zzso is a genetic program for the removal of unwanted cells from an zzso which is distinct from necrosis by its characteristic volume loss or zzso volume zzso This cell shrinkage is the result of zzso zzso that is crucial for both the zzso and execution of zzso Here we report that zzso but not zzso zzso treatment results in a significant decrease in zzso zzso that can be abolished by zzso of zzso flux using either the zzso channel inhibitor zzso or medium with a reduced zzso zzso zzso downstream events are diminished during zzso zzso following zzso flux zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso characteristics are not zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso protein zzso signal zzso zzso early in the zzso signaling cascade was affected by zzso flux in zzso zzso Thus, an zzso of zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of signaling molecules upstream of the zzso specifically zzso the intrinsic but not zzso zzso zzso
