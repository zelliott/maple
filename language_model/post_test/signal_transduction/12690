zzso is often accompanied by zzso characterized by elevated levels of plasma zzso zzso zzso and associated with zzso zzso which could progress to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are the major zzso of zzso zzso This study aims to clarify effects of LDL on zzso of zzso to evaluate roles of zzso in suppressing these effects and to further zzso the underlying molecular zzso 

zzso were prepared from rats and cell proliferation was measured by cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate gene promoter zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso were used to zzso the expression of zzso 

LDL zzso zzso zzso in zzso which was attenuated by zzso zzso reduced the abundance of LDL zzso zzso in activated zzso decreasing cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated the expression of the zzso factors, zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso in activated zzso resulting in the suppression of zzso gene zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso gene expression in activated zzso in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso regulating gene expression of zzso reducing cellular cholesterol and attenuating the zzso effects of LDL on zzso zzso These results provide novel insights into the roles and mechanisms of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This zzso a constituent of zzso may be useful in preventing zzso zzso zzso
