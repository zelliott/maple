Early disruption of zzso signaling alters zzso zzso asymmetry throughout the zzso Here we uncover a role for zzso signaling that specifically zzso brain zzso independent of normal lateral plate zzso zzso zzso When zzso signaling is inhibited during zzso zzso expressed zzso markers zzso and zzso are not zzso However, zzso expressed brain markers zzso and zzso become zzso We show that zzso signaling controls expression of zzso and zzso two zzso factors required for repression of zzso zzso in the zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein distribution revealed a zzso structure in the zzso that is dependent on a balance of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling leads to zzso of zzso loss of organized zzso zzso junctions and bilateral loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling leads to a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso an increase in cell boundary formation in the brain zzso and bilateral expression of zzso Together, these results suggest a novel role for zzso signaling in the brain to control zzso zzso six zzso factor expressions, and a zzso barrier zzso
