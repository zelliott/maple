The zzso zzso provides a critical brake on tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is the principal cellular zzso of zzso zzso evidence has suggested that zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso for regulating zzso zzso However, the upstream regulators that mediate zzso circuits remain poorly zzso Here we identify human zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso as an interacting partner of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso stabilized and activated zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso More importantly, zzso was specifically modified with zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso by recruiting zzso zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso led to reduced stability and incorrect zzso of zzso thereby attenuating the interaction between zzso and zzso Free zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that zzso acts as a novel regulator of zzso by regulating the interaction between zzso and zzso through the control of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso and a potential zzso drug zzso
