While zzso zzso of zzso yielding zzso zzso and zzso that can zzso bind to cellular zzso has been recognized to be associated with its zzso the current consensus is that such zzso zzso modification of sensor proteins with zzso zzso is also involved in zzso of cellular signal zzso pathways for cellular protection against zzso zzso In the present study, we developed an zzso zzso to detect cellular proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso prepared against zzso recognized the zzso zzso with the zzso group, rather than with the zzso zzso Furthermore, little zzso of zzso with either a different number of aromatic rings zzso zzso 1) or zzso groups was zzso With this specific zzso against zzso we identified nine target proteins of zzso following exposure of human zzso zzso cell line zzso to zzso Among them, heat shock protein 90 zzso and zzso are of interest because zzso modification of these zzso causes zzso of heat shock zzso which plays a role in the cellular response against zzso such as zzso Thus, our method, which does not use zzso compounds, would be zzso for exploring zzso of zzso signal zzso pathways coupled to zzso modification of sensor proteins during exposure to zzso as well as zzso
