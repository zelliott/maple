zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso plant growth in response to blue zzso Much is known regarding their zzso zzso yet little progress has been made to identify downstream zzso zzso Here, we isolated several interacting proteins for zzso zzso 1 zzso by zzso zzso zzso These include members of the zzso zzso protein family, proteins associated with zzso trafficking, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso were found to zzso and interact in zzso Moreover, zzso binding to zzso was limited to zzso zzso zzso and was dependent on key sites of zzso zzso No zzso binding was detected for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso proteins are specific to zzso zzso
