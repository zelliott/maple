Plant hormones have pivotal roles in almost every aspect of plant zzso Over the past decades, zzso and genetic studies have revealed that hormone action in plants is determined by complex interactions between hormonal zzso zzso Evidence is accumulating for the existence of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso proteins have been identified as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show that expression of zzso is not solely zzso by zzso but that it is also an early zzso zzso Furthermore, we could show that the zzso expression of zzso is independent of the zzso zzso zzso but is controlled by the zzso zzso response zzso factor zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for the existence of at least two different input signals regarding zzso expression and thus support the idea of an intimate molecular interplay between zzso and zzso zzso
