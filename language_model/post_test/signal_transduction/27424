Ras proteins play an essential role in the zzso of signals from a wide range of zzso receptors to the zzso These signals may promote cellular proliferation or zzso depending on the cell zzso It is well established that Ras plays an important role in the zzso of zzso signals from activated zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso However, important questions remain as to whether Ras controls zzso events during zzso progression and, if so, at which point in the zzso it is zzso 

To address these questions we have developed a novel, functional zzso for the detection of cellular activated zzso Using this zzso we found that Ras was activated in zzso cells, following release from zzso and in zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso In each case, peak Ras zzso occurred in zzso zzso Ras zzso in zzso cells at zzso phase was dependent on zzso and protein synthesis and was not associated with zzso zzso of zzso proteins and their binding to zzso zzso zzso of Ras and the zzso regulated zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso were not temporally correlated during zzso zzso 

zzso of Ras during zzso phase appears to differ in many respects from its rapid zzso by growth factors, suggesting a novel mechanism of regulation that may be intrinsic to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso between Ras and zzso zzso suggests that Ras targets alternate zzso pathways during zzso zzso
