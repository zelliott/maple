The clinical usefulness of zzso zzso zzso San Francisco, zzso in breast cancer treatment is limited by the rapid development of zzso We previously reported that zzso signaling zzso resistance to the zzso actions of zzso in a model system, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains zzso We used zzso cells zzso few zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso as our experimental zzso zzso antagonized the zzso increase in the level of the zzso inhibitor zzso This resulted in decreased association of zzso with zzso restoration of zzso activity and zzso of zzso arrest in zzso phase, all of which had been induced by zzso treatment in zzso zzso We also found that the decrease in zzso induced by zzso was accompanied by an increase in expression of zzso which is a zzso zzso for zzso and by increased zzso association with zzso A specific zzso inhibitor zzso completely blocked the ability of zzso to reduce the zzso protein level, while zzso increased zzso zzso This suggests that the action of zzso in zzso resistance to zzso involves targeting of zzso to the zzso degradation zzso Finally, specific zzso of zzso and zzso suggest that the zzso reduction in zzso protein level by increased degradation predominantly involves the zzso zzso Our results provide an example of resistance to an zzso therapy that targets one zzso zzso zzso by increased signal zzso through an alternative zzso in a complex regulatory zzso
