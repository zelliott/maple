Model zzso of defined structure and limited zzso have been prepared by binding zzso zzso zzso of different lengths to the zzso binding sites of zzso These complexes have been characterized structurally by zzso methods and functionally by testing their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes to stimulate zzso of rat zzso leukemia zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso is shown to have only two tight binding sites per zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso zzso is found to stimulate substantial zzso Another zzso zzso that is approximately 10 A longer has four tight binding sites per zzso and, when bound to zzso has greater activity similar to a highly zzso zzso zzso These and other zzso complexes described here represent a new group of chemically zzso zzso that are useful for studying the binding to and functional zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
