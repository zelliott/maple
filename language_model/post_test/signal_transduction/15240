zzso how growth rates changes under different zzso is fundamental to many aspect of microbial zzso In this work, we zzso showed that zzso specific growth rate is a zzso function of the biomass yield, the zzso turnover number, and the maximum synthesis rate of the zzso zzso under that zzso We used zzso coli cultures in zzso minimal medium as a model system by introducing genetic zzso in zzso evolution, and ethanol stress to the zzso zzso of zzso affected all three parameters in different directions while deletion of zzso decreased only the biomass zzso Ethanol stress zzso impacted all three zzso while zzso decreased biomass yield and zzso synthesis zzso In addition, laboratory evolution increased the growth rate in zzso mostly through enhancing the expression rate of the zzso zzso Despite all these changes, the growth rate of the zzso strain was successfully related to the three parameters by the zzso zzso Thus, this zzso relationship provides insight into how growth rate is altered by different zzso zzso
