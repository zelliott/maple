zzso of non-native zzso bonds within or between proteins can lead to protein zzso and disruption to cellular zzso Such a process is defined as zzso zzso A marked effect of zzso stress in cells is the elevated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied by increased zzso To gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism for zzso zzso zzso zzso the complete set of zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso was screened in this study simultaneously with a combination of the two zzso zzso and zzso The combined treatment of a benign concentration of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso sensitive deletion zzso distinct from those found when either of the single zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses of the zzso zzso sensitive to the dual zzso indicated a significant enrichment in the genes involved in cell wall zzso signaling zzso zzso transport machinery and zzso The results highlight the process of maintaining cell wall integrity as the central response to the combined exposure of zzso and zzso which is zzso by the signaling pathways and zzso zzso via zzso and zzso for zzso of the essential cell wall components such as zzso and zzso zzso of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions demonstrates that zzso machinery is essential for surviving the stress conditions, probably due to their roles in transporting zzso to the cell wall and zzso of accumulated zzso Finally, the zzso of 100 previously zzso genes against the dual zzso will contribute to their eventual functional zzso
