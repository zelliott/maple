A new method is developed to construct a cochlear zzso function using zzso of the zzso potential zzso a zzso component of the electrical response of the zzso to a zzso It is zzso shown that the magnitude of the SP is determined by the zzso terms of the power series representing a zzso zzso The relationship between the SP zzso and the second zzso of the zzso function was determined by using a zzso bias tone to position a zzso probe tone at different places along the cochlear zzso zzso Two probe tones (6 zzso and 12 zzso ranging from 70 to 90 zzso zzso and a zzso bias tone at 130 zzso zzso were simultaneously zzso Electric responses from the zzso were recorded by an zzso placed at the round window to obtain the SP zzso The experimental results from eight animals demonstrated that the SP zzso as a function of bias levels are essentially zzso to the second zzso of a zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso modulated SP zzso can be used to construct a cochlear zzso zzso
