zzso has been reported to play a central role in growth and survival of multiple myeloma zzso zzso However, recently we have demonstrated that in the presence of bone zzso zzso cells, survival of zzso cells becomes independent of the zzso zzso questioning the singular role of zzso in zzso zzso it was the aim of this study to identify additional factors and signaling pathways that might contribute to the growth and survival of zzso zzso We found that in addition to zzso a number of bone zzso derived zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso and induce proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, these zzso independently zzso the zzso family member zzso via zzso and support survival of primary human zzso zzso zzso of these pathways zzso zzso in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso Thus, we provide evidence that in addition to zzso a number of different factors trigger important zzso pathways to support the proliferation and survival of zzso zzso zzso blocking such zzso rather than blocking a single factor, might be a promising approach for the development of novel treatment strategies in zzso
