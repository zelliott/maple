The aim of this study was to zzso the density of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso G alpha zzso zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G zzso in zzso of zzso depressed patients to assess the status of these signal zzso proteins in depression and the effects of zzso drug zzso Blood zzso were collected from 22 drug-free depressed patients and 22 zzso and zzso healthy zzso The levels of the various G protein zzso were assessed by zzso zzso The zzso of G alpha 12 was increased zzso and that of G alpha zzso decreased zzso in zzso of depressed zzso The levels of other G protein zzso zzso alpha zzso G alpha zzso G zzso did not change significantly with respect to those of control zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of the zzso G alpha zzso protein zzso Since zzso G alpha zzso is in line with the existence of zzso of these receptors in major zzso
