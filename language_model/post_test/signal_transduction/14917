zzso growth factor zzso signaling has been shown to be essential for many aspects of normal lung zzso To determine zzso targets of zzso zzso we cultured embryonic day zzso zzso mouse lungs for 24 zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which inhibited branching zzso zzso gene chip analysis of treated and control zzso identified several genes regulated by zzso zzso including zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso expression in zzso cultures of zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso was zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso had a dynamic pattern of expression during lung zzso We found that expression of zzso was induced by zzso and zzso zzso that primarily bind zzso To further define the pathways by which zzso activate zzso zzso we cultured zzso lung tips in the presence of compounds to inhibit zzso receptors zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso We found that zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso whereas zzso had no zzso zzso also reduced zzso expression in cultures of zzso zzso Finally, zzso was zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso airways of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that zzso regulation of zzso by means of zzso occurs through the zzso zzso
