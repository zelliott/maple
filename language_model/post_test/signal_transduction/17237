zzso zzso of zzso on zzso or zzso zzso is a zzso modification that regulates stability, activity or zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uses zzso produced in the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso from proteins is zzso by the zzso zzso Recent zzso suggest that zzso may affect the growth of cancer zzso However, the consequences of zzso on zzso therapy have not been zzso In this work, we studied the effects of zzso on zzso cell death in the breast zzso zzso zzso zzso that increase zzso zzso and/or zzso protected zzso cells from death induced by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso the effect of tamoxifen on cell zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso is a major regulator of cell survival, we used zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso We observed that these treatments zzso zzso production in zzso zzso This effect was associated with an increase in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which abolished the effect of zzso on zzso zzso did not impair the protective effects of zzso against zzso cell zzso These results suggest that the protective effects of zzso are independent of the zzso zzso zzso As tamoxifen sensitivity depends on the zzso zzso zzso expression level, we evaluated the effect of zzso on the expression of this zzso We observed that zzso treatment significantly reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting a potential mechanism for the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity induced by these zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso of zzso may constitute an interesting approach to improve the sensitivity of breast cancer to zzso zzso
