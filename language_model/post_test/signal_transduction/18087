Treatment of rat zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity, and this activity was inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso zzso action on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acted at the zzso level, rather than directly on zzso zzso This zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was inhibited by an zzso raised against the zzso portion of zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, it was shown that zzso is more susceptible to zzso zzso than zzso or zzso Therefore the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso is due to the zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso by zzso involved sequential zzso at two sites, resulting in the generation of a 39 zzso zzso first, and then a 20 zzso fragment, from the zzso Treatment of zzso cell zzso with zzso toxin increased the rate of zzso zzso toxin treatment of intact zzso cells induced the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso In addition, treatment of intact zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso blocked the increased zzso production and the zzso of zzso which were produced by zzso toxin or zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso sustains zzso zzso in an active form through the zzso of zzso to an active zzso zzso This is a novel zzso zzso mechanism of zzso and, thus, of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso
