zzso smooth muscle cell zzso zzso plays an essential role in vascular development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which may contribute to the development of diabetic zzso In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism of zzso zzso effect in cultured human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso Compared with zzso exposure of zzso to zzso but not zzso significantly increased zzso zzso 1 zzso activity but not zzso zzso This increase was inhibited by protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso and the reduced form of zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso by high zzso involves plasma membrane zzso In addition, zzso markedly inhibited serum zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by either a competitive inhibitor zzso or expression of zzso zzso of zzso or specific small interference zzso zzso substantially attenuated zzso zzso effect and zzso protein zzso expression in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso effect requires the zzso effects of zzso We conclude that zzso stimulates zzso activity via zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso in zzso Taken together, these observations have important implications for understanding the roles of the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso of diabetic zzso
