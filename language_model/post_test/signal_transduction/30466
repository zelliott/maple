Psychiatric disorders are common and complex diseases that show zzso and zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene is related to many psychiatric disorders such as zzso alcoholism, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive zzso zzso is a complex disorder and a single zzso zzso zzso at the zzso gene is related to schizophrenia zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso for the detection of a common functional zzso in the zzso gene from zzso chain reaction zzso zzso has been described without using an external zzso This developed technology combined with a zzso carbon zzso zzso and differential pulse zzso was performed by using short synthetic zzso and zzso zzso in length zzso zzso to measure the change of zzso zzso signal obtained at approximately zzso V after DNA zzso between probe and target zzso target or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were immobilized onto the carbon surface with a simple zzso method in two different modes: zzso zzso targets were attached or zzso zzso zzso were attached onto an zzso By controlling the surface coverage of the target DNA, the zzso event between the zzso and their synthetic targets or specific zzso products was zzso The zzso or zzso zzso zzso were also zzso with an equal amount of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in order to measure the sensor zzso The decrease or appearance in the intrinsic zzso signal simplified the detection procedure and shortened the zzso time because protocol eliminates the zzso zzso The zzso binding effects were minimized by using sodium zzso zzso with different washing zzso The zzso zzso zzso detection were performed with real samples containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The detection limit zzso zzso 3) of the zzso was zzso zzso of target sequence in the zzso zzso zzso performance of the sensor is zzso along with future zzso
