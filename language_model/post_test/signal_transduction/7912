zzso zzso signaling is zzso in multiple human zzso including pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso represents one of the earliest genetic zzso and occurs almost universally in zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso promotes pancreatic zzso in part through zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso activates zzso signaling in zzso cells, utilizing a downstream zzso zzso zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation of human pancreatic zzso zzso cells increases zzso zzso activity, an effect that is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso activity by a small interfering zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso expression in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso elicit a similar zzso In addition, expression of the zzso active form of zzso but not zzso blocks the zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Finally, suppressing zzso activity leads to a selective zzso of the zzso transformation activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso through zzso zzso is directly involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells and that collaboration between these two signaling pathways may play an important role in zzso zzso
