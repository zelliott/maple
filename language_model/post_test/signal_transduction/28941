zzso zzso regulate a diverse spectrum of cellular functions involved in vascular zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso play a key role in zzso cell zzso zzso and tube formation as well as in zzso invasion in three-dimensional zzso collagen zzso and that their regulation is zzso by various downstream zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso suppression of zzso or zzso two major regulators of zzso signaling downstream of zzso or zzso markedly zzso zzso zzso and tube zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso strongly correlate with the zzso formation process in a manner that depends on protein zzso C zzso zzso We identify zzso and zzso as regulators of zzso zzso in zzso collagen zzso Two polarity zzso zzso and zzso are also required for zzso zzso and tube formation, as they establish zzso polarity through their association with zzso and zzso zzso In our model, disruption of any member in the zzso polarity complex zzso zzso zzso and tube formation in zzso collagen zzso This work reveals novel regulators that control the signaling events zzso the crucial zzso formation step in vascular zzso
