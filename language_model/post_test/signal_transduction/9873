zzso arthritis zzso is the zzso zzso zzso inflammatory disorder affecting zzso of the world zzso It has a strong genetic component and a growing number of associated genes have been discovered in zzso association studies zzso which nevertheless only account for zzso of the total genetic zzso We aimed to identify additional zzso zzso through the analysis of zzso in the context of biological zzso We bridge the gap between zzso and zzso analyses of zzso by introducing a zzso gene zzso methodology that identifies potential zzso genes in the zzso disease pathways that may be driving the zzso association zzso We zzso the zzso and the zzso studies of zzso and zzso subjects, zzso We examined 700 pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways by significance revealed that the zzso top-ranked zzso laid within the top zzso of zzso Gene selection on those pathways identified 58 genes in zzso and 61 in zzso 21 of those were common zzso zzso of which 16 were novel zzso Among the identified zzso we validated 10 known zzso associations in zzso and 13 in zzso not discovered using zzso approaches on the same zzso Gene zzso functional enrichment analysis on the identified genes showed significant zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso in both zzso Our findings suggest a novel model of zzso genetic zzso which involves zzso receptors and genes in second zzso zzso systems, in addition to genes that regulate immune responses, which have been the focus of interest zzso
