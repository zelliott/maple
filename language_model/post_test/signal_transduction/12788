The relative capacity of two zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to actively zzso zzso signals was evaluated with three human B cell zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso directed to various zzso of the zzso zzso suppressed spontaneous or T cell zzso zzso DNA synthesis at zzso as low as zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso origin failed to inhibit at doses as high as 100 zzso Several possibilities for the differential capacity of zzso and zzso molecules to signal zzso in these zzso zzso populations were zzso zzso in the intrinsic membrane expression of the two zzso before in zzso zzso zzso were not responsible because the above distinctions were noted in cells of a chronic zzso zzso which expressed slightly more zzso than zzso The ineffective zzso signaling capacity of zzso zzso was also not caused by a selective decrease in the membrane expression of zzso during cell culture, because the density of each zzso remained relatively constant during the first 44 h of in zzso zzso by T cell factors, and following zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with similar zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso with comparable affinities for their respective membrane molecules differed significantly in zzso potential, it was considered improbable that the zzso zzso tested bound to zzso with a zzso affinity for inducing zzso zzso of zzso DNA synthesis was observed after incubation with either zzso zzso or a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso does not make B cell clones zzso to zzso signal zzso through zzso These studies provide strong zzso support for the concept that zzso zzso and zzso molecules play distinct roles in human B cell zzso
