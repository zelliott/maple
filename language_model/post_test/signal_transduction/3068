The resident zzso zzso of the zzso zzso influences diverse zzso functions, including regulation of cellular growth, maintenance of barrier function, and zzso of immune zzso However, it is unknown how zzso zzso organisms mechanistically influence zzso signaling zzso Recent data has demonstrated that gut zzso contacted by enteric zzso bacteria rapidly generate zzso oxygen species zzso While the induced generation of zzso via stimulation of zzso zzso receptors is a zzso feature of the cellular response of zzso to zzso or zzso bacteria, evidence is accumulating that zzso are also similarly zzso in other cell types, including zzso zzso in response to microbial zzso Additionally, zzso have been shown to serve as critical second zzso in multiple signal zzso pathways zzso by zzso zzso and growth zzso This zzso zzso is known to participate in cellular signaling via the rapid and transient zzso zzso of a defined class of sensor proteins bearing zzso zzso zzso These proteins include zzso zzso that serve as regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as components involved in control of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to mediate increased cellular proliferation and zzso and to zzso innate immune zzso These results demonstrate how enteric zzso influence regulatory networks of the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that many of the known effects of the normal zzso on zzso zzso and potential beneficial effects of candidate zzso bacteria, may be at least partially zzso by this zzso zzso
