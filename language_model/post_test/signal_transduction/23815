Nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso is a zzso sensitive zzso factor regulating expression of a number of zzso zzso Recently, zzso has emerged as an important contributor to zzso in cancer zzso In the present study, we found that zzso dose of zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and increases zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced zzso expression at both the zzso zzso and protein levels through zzso of zzso pathway, leading to a reduction of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth, reduced cell proliferation and induced zzso more substantially when compared with zzso treatment zzso These results clearly demonstrate that zzso can be used as an effective zzso zzso to prevent zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso
