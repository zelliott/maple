zzso ducts zzso are the embryonic precursors of the male zzso zzso Their development is induced by testosterone, which interacts with the zzso zzso zzso The molecular pathways underlying zzso zzso development are largely zzso We aimed to identify zzso target genes important in this zzso 

zzso was isolated from rat zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso were used to identify transcripts zzso or zzso more than zzso zzso of seven transcripts was confirmed using quantitative zzso 

zzso from 76 known genes were zzso including zzso of zzso growth factor and transforming growth zzso zzso By controlling these zzso zzso may indirectly affect growth factor zzso pathways important in zzso interactions and organ zzso zzso also zzso may play a role in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and smooth muscle, zzso and zzso zzso synthesis were reflected in regulation of other zzso Several genes were previously suggested to be regulated by zzso or contained functional or putative zzso response zzso indicating they may be direct targets of zzso zzso 

Our results suggest novel zzso of signals that may contribute to zzso zzso development and provide hypotheses that can be tested by future zzso
