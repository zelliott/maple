The current paradigm for managing infectious diseases has targeted unique processes or zzso within zzso A serious disadvantage of this zzso drug targeting strategy has been the development of microbial drug resistance and zzso resurgence of zzso infectious zzso A new drug discovery paradigm has therefore emerged focusing on identifying and targeting host factors essential for pathogen entry, survival, and zzso Innovative strategies combining zzso zzso biology, zzso zzso and traditional forward and reverse zzso have identified zzso interactions and host functions critical for the establishment of zzso zzso and chemical zzso have allowed rapid identification of new and existing licensed drugs with zzso zzso Although most zzso drug targeting studies have focused on viral infections, they have provided a proof of concept for similar approaches to bacterial and zzso zzso Future therapies may combine conventional targeting of microbial zzso factors, together with zzso drug therapy and zzso of protective host factors, to efficiently eliminate the invading zzso
