zzso protein zzso and zzso proteins zzso constitute a family of zzso and zzso binding proteins zzso in zzso The mechanisms of zzso function have remained incompletely zzso However, several zzso are present at membrane contact sites and control the activity of zzso zzso or assembly of protein complexes, with impacts on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An increasing number of protein interaction partners of zzso have been identified, providing clues of their involvement in multiple aspects of cell zzso The functions assigned for zzso zzso include coordination of zzso and zzso metabolism and zzso signaling zzso control of zzso zzso zzso contacts and zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso metabolism zzso cell zzso zzso cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso compounds target zzso and zzso revealing a function of zzso in cell proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins execute multifaceted functions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso These observations identify zzso as coordinators of zzso signals with an unforeseen variety of cellular zzso
