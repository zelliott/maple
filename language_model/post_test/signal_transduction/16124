zzso solutions to the zzso challenges of life in highly variable zzso can span the zzso from evolution of a cosmopolitan plastic zzso to the evolution of locally adapted zzso zzso zzso zzso have evolved both highly plastic and locally adapted zzso within different selective zzso providing a comparative system in which to explore the zzso zzso of zzso plasticity and zzso zzso zzso extensive variation exists among populations and species for tolerance to a variety of zzso and we exploit this variation in comparative studies to yield insights into the zzso basis of evolved zzso zzso zzso species of zzso occupy the zzso of zzso zzso from freshwater to marine and populations within zzso zzso span far greater variation in pollution tolerance than across all species of zzso Here, we explore how zzso regulation zzso extreme zzso plasticity on zzso shock and how zzso and zzso variation is associated with locally evolved pollution zzso We show that zzso zzso quickly zzso to extreme zzso shock by mounting a dramatic rapid zzso response including an early crisis control phase followed by a tissue zzso phase involving many regulatory zzso We also show that zzso evolution of locally adapted pollution tolerance involves complex patterns of gene expression and zzso sequence variation, which is zzso with zzso dependence for some zzso Similarly, exploiting the natural zzso variation associated with other established and emerging model organisms is likely to greatly accelerate the pace of discovery of the zzso basis of zzso zzso
