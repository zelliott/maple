This chapter reviews the expression and regulation of zzso receptors in sensory zzso and the interactions of these receptors with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of peripheral zzso leads to increased synthesis and zzso transport of zzso receptors in zzso root zzso zzso This results in zzso zzso zzso and enhanced G protein zzso at peripheral sensory nerve zzso These events are dependent on zzso electrical activity, and on production of zzso zzso and nerve growth factor within the inflamed zzso Together with the disruption of the zzso barrier, these factors lead to an enhanced zzso efficacy of peripherally active zzso The major local source of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso These cells contain and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor zzso and the entire zzso machinery necessary for its processing into the functionally active zzso zzso immune cells zzso using zzso molecules and zzso to accumulate in inflamed zzso Upon stressful stimuli or in response to releasing agents such as zzso factor, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Depending on the cell type, this release is contingent on zzso zzso or on zzso zzso zzso triggered release of zzso from zzso zzso Once zzso zzso peptides activate peripheral zzso receptors and produce analgesia by zzso the zzso of sensory nerves and/or the release of zzso zzso These effects occur without central zzso side effects such as depression of breathing, clouding of consciousness, or zzso Future aims include the development of peripherally restricted zzso zzso selective targeting of zzso zzso to sites of painful injury, and the zzso of peripheral zzso zzso and zzso zzso
