zzso zzso complexes couple zzso signals via cell surface receptors to downstream zzso called zzso zzso zzso complexes, together with their zzso receptors and zzso operate at the zzso of signal zzso In plants, the number of zzso complex components is dramatically less than in other zzso zzso An understanding of how multiple signals zzso zzso through the zzso zzso can be found in the unique structural and kinetic properties of the plant zzso zzso zzso This review addresses these unique features and zzso on why the repertoire of zzso signaling elements is dramatically simpler than that in all other zzso zzso
