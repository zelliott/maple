The zzso zzso zzso known as the Philadelphia zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso is the common zzso zzso and an zzso prognosis in adult acute zzso zzso zzso Although zzso treatment produced high rates of complete response in approximately zzso of newly diagnosed zzso zzso the onset of resistance and clinical zzso is zzso zzso the efficacy of treatment in zzso ALL is still to be zzso In this study, we aimed to assess the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Corporation, zzso zzso a zzso target of zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso zzso & zzso Company, zzso in a zzso acute zzso cell line zzso and a primary zzso ALL sample in zzso Here, we demonstrated that 50 zzso of zzso significantly intensified the zzso induced by zzso on both zzso ALL cell line and a primary zzso ALL zzso zzso we reported that the consequence of zzso treatment induced the over expression of the components of zzso target of zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso effectively eliminated this deleterious side effect of zzso which might enhance zzso ability to kill drug-resistant zzso The synergistic effect was also associated with the increase in zzso zzso of cell cycle progression in the zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that zzso in combination with zzso is more effective in the treatment of zzso ALL compared with zzso zzso
