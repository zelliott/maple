In an attempt to examine the zzso relationship of the zzso zzso zzso we examined the structural motif of zzso truncated peptides responsible for rat pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of 3, 20, and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso evoked zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso had no effect, suggesting the importance of zzso and zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso zzso Thus zzso appears to be required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not cause zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso zzso at low doses and large zzso zzso at high zzso In contrast, similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at all zzso zzso C zzso inhibitor inhibited zzso zzso induced by high doses of zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor only inhibited the action of high doses of zzso Neither zzso inhibitor nor zzso inhibitor affected zzso zzso evoked by low doses of zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to its actions on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor had no effect on the action evoked by all zzso short zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso levels over zzso None of these zzso short peptides increased zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso did not stimulate zzso activity, whereas zzso evoked a zzso to zzso increase over zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso are key zzso acids in evoking zzso zzso At low doses, zzso zzso and zzso zzso some yet to be identified pathways to evoke zzso zzso and zzso zzso At high doses, zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso possesses the minimal essential zzso acids to fully activate the zzso zzso
