zzso has been shown to play an important role in the formation of hair zzso tumors, including zzso Several investigators have shown that zzso gene zzso is observed in zzso However, the relationship between the pattern of zzso zzso in the cell and zzso gene zzso is still zzso 

This work was performed to determine the frequency of zzso nuclear zzso in zzso the relationship between the pattern of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the involvement of zzso zzso 

Typical 32 zzso were examined for zzso expression by zzso zzso DNA was zzso amplified and zzso from 23 zzso with nuclear zzso zzso and 4 zzso without nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene were confirmed by zzso zzso and restriction zzso zzso 

Using zzso we found that zzso zzso of zzso displayed nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso contained zzso in zzso 3 of zzso However, no zzso were detected in 4 zzso without zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso were adjacent to or abolished well-known regulatory zzso sites of zzso zzso gene zzso were not detected in 27 zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso 

These results confirmed that zzso zzso and its nuclear zzso are frequent causes of zzso signaling zzso zzso and suggested that zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso of zzso
