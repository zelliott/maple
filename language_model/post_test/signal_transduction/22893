Human zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells to study the interactions between two receptors that are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells showed a high density of zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso per zzso zzso The zzso receptors were zzso an zzso zzso could stimulate zzso binding and reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso binding of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors shifted the zzso curve for zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso However, zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did cause a zzso increase in zzso zzso The zzso zzso response was decreased by the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but there was no change in zzso and no effect in cells zzso only with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso of zzso response zzso protein and expression of zzso zzso These effects were also strongly zzso by zzso These results show that the zzso actions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors noted previously in zzso can also be observed in zzso cells where the two receptors are zzso Thus, no brain zzso factors are required for such zzso Furthermore, the interaction at the second zzso level and beyond may be zzso more important than zzso zzso zzso of high affinity zzso zzso binding to the zzso
