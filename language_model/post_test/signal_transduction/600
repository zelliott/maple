The zzso fungus zzso zzso has the largest zzso of all zzso yet zzso The large zzso size is partly a result of an expansion of gene family zzso Among the largest gene families are protein zzso and zzso small zzso zzso zzso which are key components of signal zzso zzso Comparative zzso and zzso analyses were used to examine the evolution of the two largest families of protein zzso and zzso small zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels in various zzso and growth conditions were zzso from zzso zzso The two families possessed a large number of young zzso zzso that had arisen in the zzso lineage following the separation from the zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso were dispersed in many small zzso and the majority were zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso were found in three large groups of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with few zzso zzso of protein zzso and zzso small zzso have either zzso gained or lost motifs found in the coding regions of their zzso zzso outcomes during evolution were the formation of zzso zzso or proteins with novel structures and expression patterns zzso
