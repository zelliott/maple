Loss of zzso is associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying this synaptic impairment is not well zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso is known to enhance the formation of zzso spines via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Here, we show that the amount of zzso is significantly reduced, and correlated with the level of zzso in the frontal zzso of zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the amount of zzso zzso was decreased and strongly correlated with the level of zzso zzso which is considered to be active zzso The synaptic scaffolding zzso zzso density zzso was specifically decreased in zzso and the amount of zzso correlated with the level of zzso Moreover, the amounts of zzso and zzso were zzso correlated with the extent of zzso zzso which is crucial for zzso tangle zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso is involved in the synaptic zzso of zzso
