zzso zzso molecules are believed to be important for synaptic zzso zzso which links zzso and the zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso and regulates synaptic structure and zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with a novel zzso zzso named zzso that acts on zzso and zzso The zzso complex was found to be associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and localized to the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein activity of zzso was inhibited by zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the synaptic zzso and zzso organization of zzso networks and signal zzso Thus, zzso may regulate zzso spine zzso and strength by modulating zzso zzso
