zzso disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States and the zzso A profound pattern exists in the time of day at which the death zzso it is in the morning, when the zzso is most vulnerable and blood pressure surges, that stroke and heart attack most frequently zzso Although the molecular components of zzso rhythms rhythmically zzso in blood vessels, evidence of a direct function for the zzso zzso in the progression to vascular disease is zzso 

In the present study, we found increased pathological zzso and vascular injury in mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso and Clock zzso In addition, zzso zzso from zzso and Clock zzso mice exhibit zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso oxide zzso a zzso critical to vascular function, was significantly attenuated in arteries from zzso zzso 

Our data reveal a new role for the zzso clock during chronic vascular responses that may be of significance in the progression of vascular zzso
