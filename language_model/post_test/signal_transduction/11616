The zzso signal zzso network performs critical roles in zzso zzso interactions during zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso network components can cause birth zzso skin cancer, and other zzso The zzso gene family zzso zzso and zzso encodes zinc finger zzso factors that act as zzso of zzso signal zzso In this study, we investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is zzso regulated in a tissue zzso zzso zzso is exclusively zzso during virgin stages of development but becomes both zzso and zzso during pregnancy and zzso The zzso zzso with respect to both zzso and zzso development was examined by transplantation rescue of embryonic zzso zzso into zzso normal host zzso zzso derived from both wild type and zzso zzso donors showed zzso zzso that developed to equivalent zzso in virgin zzso However, in zzso transplants, ducts were frequently distended or zzso shaped and showed a range of zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso development during pregnancy was not overtly affected by loss of zzso zzso zzso defects were not observed when zzso zzso zzso was transplanted into a wild type zzso background, indicating that zzso function is required primarily in the zzso for proper zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated an elevated frequency and severity of focal zzso zzso relative to that of wild type zzso and zzso control zzso
