The zzso family represents a new class of zzso zzso zzso with known or suspected roles in zzso maturation and zzso These zzso display a preference for zzso in the zzso position of zzso To clarify differences in the biological roles of the zzso converting zzso zzso family zzso we have examined in detail the zzso beyond the zzso position of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toward minimal length zzso zzso in zzso We find differences and similarities between the zzso that suggest a functional zzso of the family different from that based on overall sequence zzso The primary zzso of ICE zzso explain many observed zzso preferences for zzso zzso and can be used to support predictions of their natural zzso The results also suggest the design of optimal zzso zzso and zzso
