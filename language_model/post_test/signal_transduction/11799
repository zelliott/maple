The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was studied in slices of guinea-pig cerebral zzso under normal and zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, in normal zzso zzso buffer solution zzso zzso medium zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso level and abolished the zzso effect of zzso It also abolished the effect of zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the presence of the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso the effect of high zzso and restored the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of slices with zzso or zzso two zzso antagonists, had the same effect as low zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso and caused reappearance of the zzso effects of zzso and zzso On the contrary, zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso C, and zzso an inhibitor of zzso C, had no significant effect on zzso phenomena and did not restore the effect of zzso These data suggest that the zzso system activated by membrane zzso regulates the zzso level directly and also by affecting the zzso process in nerve zzso
