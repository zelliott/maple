During the transition from zzso to zzso growth, the shoot zzso of flowering plants acquires the zzso identity to generate flowers rather than zzso zzso An important regulator that promotes the zzso identity in zzso is zzso 24 zzso a zzso zzso zzso Using a functional zzso system in combination with zzso analysis, we identified zzso zzso including zzso OF zzso OF CO 1 zzso a floral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a functional zzso line revealed in zzso binding of zzso to the regulatory region of zzso zzso of the zzso binding site in the zzso promoter decreased zzso expression and compromised zzso function in promoting zzso Our results show that zzso is one of the direct targets of zzso and that zzso expression is zzso by zzso at the shoot zzso at the floral transitional zzso zzso zzso using a functional zzso line and promoter zzso analysis also revealed in zzso binding of zzso to the regulatory regions of zzso and zzso of zzso at the shoot zzso by zzso Furthermore, we found that as in other flowering genetic zzso the effect of zzso on flowering under zzso conditions was zzso by the interaction between zzso and zzso These observations suggest that during floral transition, a zzso loop zzso by direct zzso regulation between zzso and zzso at the shoot zzso zzso flowering zzso
