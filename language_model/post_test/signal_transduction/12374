Work by our group and others has demonstrated a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso regulatory T cell zzso zzso zzso we explore the zzso basis for this zzso Using mouse zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso promotes expression of zzso in part through production of zzso This promotion of zzso production was resistant to zzso A treatment, suggesting that zzso zzso may promote zzso production through bypassing zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso increased production of zzso in a partially zzso manner and also promoted cell surface zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso from zzso knockout mice demonstrated impaired regulatory function ex zzso and depressed production of zzso and cell surface zzso These data reveal a novel role for zzso zzso in the production of regulatory zzso Similar zzso effects on zzso expression were observed upon zzso with zzso the primary natural zzso for zzso This effect is dependent upon zzso zzso while both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso neither zzso weight zzso nor soluble zzso zzso did zzso The implication is that intact zzso weight zzso can zzso zzso only in those settings where it zzso over zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose that intact but not fragmented zzso is capable of zzso zzso and thereby maintains zzso tolerance in zzso or healing zzso
