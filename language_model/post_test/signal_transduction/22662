The tumor zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso signal zzso by helping target the zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso zzso to the cell zzso near the ends of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso but only in a limited set of zzso We describe a second fly zzso zzso which binds zzso and is expressed in a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso with zzso in many but not all cellular zzso and also suggested a possible interaction with astral zzso For example, zzso has a striking zzso distribution in zzso and zzso zzso with assembling zzso filaments at the base of developing zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso revealing that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso signaling in the embryonic zzso This zzso acts genetically downstream of zzso and upstream of arm, zzso and, surprisingly, zzso We discuss the implications of our results for zzso zzso and suggest a role for zzso as a zzso of zzso effects on the zzso We also speculate on more general roles that zzso may play in zzso zzso
