zzso zzso is a novel, zzso accessible zzso compound that acts as a zzso agent and zzso cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso was found to zzso tumor zzso Here, we hypothesized that zzso could exert zzso activities on existing tumor zzso 

We aimed to characterize the zzso effects of zzso and to zzso the underlying mechanisms in zzso zzso In zzso zzso rapidly induced zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of established zzso tubes on zzso and in an ex zzso zzso ring zzso It disrupted zzso cell junctions and triggered zzso stress fiber formation and cell contraction by the zzso protein zzso zzso without causing cell zzso In zzso using a zzso zzso zzso chamber preparation, zzso significantly decreased blood flow and vessel diameter in zzso zzso zzso melanoma tumors but not in the neighboring healthy zzso In a second tumor model using mice with subcutaneous zzso zzso melanoma tumors, a single dose of zzso (10 zzso caused a shut down of tumor blood flow and a strong central tumor cell necrosis within 24 zzso zzso zzso administration significantly zzso tumor growth and seems to be well zzso 

In zzso we could show for the first time that the zzso effect of zzso is, at least in part, zzso via its zzso activities on existing tumor zzso
