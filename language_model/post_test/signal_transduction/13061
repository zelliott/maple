zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a mechanism called zzso or zzso zzso which ultimately results in a degradation of both zzso It is well established, however, that zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso and its subsequent zzso in the zzso whereas zzso is targeted to the 26 S zzso for zzso under similar zzso zzso Here we report that two distinct zzso systems responsible for specific degradation of two zzso short-lived protein targets, zzso and zzso zzso most (if not all) protein components of the same zzso sensing zzso zzso Indeed, initiation of zzso and zzso zzso appears to require rapid transport of those zzso of the zzso zzso that are at least partially zzso by zzso zzso Also, zzso transported via the zzso zzso generates an appropriate signal that culminates in the degradation of both zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were found to play a role in zzso of the zzso signal for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, one signaling zzso zzso two different zzso mechanisms of zzso degradation, zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso
