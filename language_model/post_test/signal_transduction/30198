zzso and zzso are two chemically related small molecules that inhibit the entry of human zzso virus type 1 zzso via human zzso zzso also zzso zzso entry via zzso zzso zzso but zzso does zzso Among the eight zzso that differ between the human and zzso versions of the zzso only one, zzso accounts for the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso by zzso Thus, the zzso zzso engineered to contain the natural human zzso zzso zzso at position 198 is sensitive to zzso entry zzso by zzso whereas a human zzso zzso containing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso 198 is in zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 and is not located within the previously defined binding site for zzso and zzso which involves zzso in TM zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso zzso binds to human zzso whether zzso 198 is zzso or zzso and it also binds to zzso zzso However, the binding of a zzso zzso zzso to human zzso is inhibited by zzso only when zzso 198 is zzso These zzso taken together, suggest that the zzso effects of zzso and zzso involve stabilization, or zzso of a zzso zzso that is not compatible with zzso zzso However, zzso is unable to exert this effect on zzso zzso when zzso 198 is zzso The region of zzso near zzso 198 has, therefore, an important influence on the zzso state of this zzso
