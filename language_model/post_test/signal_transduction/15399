Numerous aspects of the immune system operate on the basis of complex regulatory networks that are amenable to mathematical and zzso zzso Several modeling zzso have recently been applied to simulating the immune system, including systems of ordinary differential zzso delay differential zzso partial differential zzso zzso models, and zzso differential zzso In this chapter, we zzso several recent examples of work that has been done in immune modeling and discuss two specific examples of models based on zzso that can be used to understand the dynamics of T cell zzso
