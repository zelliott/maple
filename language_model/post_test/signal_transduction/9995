Although gene and protein zzso are increasing in quantity and zzso they do not characterize a zzso entire zzso in an environmental or experimental zzso Here we zzso consider associations between components of zzso zzso and environment to identify genes that may govern zzso and responses to the zzso Context from the zzso of gene expression data sets in the Gene zzso zzso is represented using the zzso Medical Language System, a compendium of biomedical zzso with nearly zzso zzso After showing how data sets can be clustered by zzso concepts, we find a network of relations between zzso disease, environmental and experimental contexts as well as genes with differential expression associated with these zzso We identify novel genes related to concepts such as zzso zzso identifying genes related to zzso and environment is a step toward the Human zzso zzso
