zzso zzso exhibits diverse biological activities, including control of cell growth and tumor zzso Here, we report that the treatment of zzso cells, a human zzso prostate cancer cell line, with zzso resulted in marked zzso of cell proliferation and induced zzso These effects were not seen with either zzso or zzso zzso cells, like many other human cancer cells, contain zzso activated signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso The zzso levels of both zzso and zzso zzso are also markedly elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso of zzso cells were associated with persistent suppression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso however, was inhibited when the zzso zzso was specifically blocked by zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso with zzso also suppressed the zzso zzso pathway, and correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso or zzso abolished zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso pathway, however, did not affect zzso zzso of zzso pathway, and suppression of zzso expression by zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that an intact zzso zzso is critical for zzso suppression of zzso and zzso Our study thus provides novel insights into the contributions of signaling pathways other than the classical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso actions of zzso
