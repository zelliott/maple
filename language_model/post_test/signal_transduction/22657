zzso a product of zzso oxide and zzso is one of the most potent zzso and it has been suggested to be involved in many neurodegenerative zzso The mechanism of the zzso by zzso was examined using zzso zzso as a zzso donor and zzso cells as a model of zzso zzso zzso was found to induce zzso cell death with typical zzso DNA fragmentation with zzso of zzso zzso zzso The signal zzso of zzso was studied in concern to zzso protein zzso zzso After zzso treatment, zzso of zzso was zzso followed by that of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso suppressed zzso zzso to the zzso level and partially reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and also the cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may activate zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso in zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso zzso
