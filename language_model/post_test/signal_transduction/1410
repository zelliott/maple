The zzso zzso of the coronavirus zzso contains an efficient zzso zzso signal at the junction of two overlapping open reading zzso We have defined by deletion analysis an 86 zzso sequence encompassing the overlap region which is sufficient to allow zzso in a zzso zzso The upstream boundary of the signal consists of the sequence zzso which is the likely site of zzso zzso We show by creation of complementary zzso changes that the zzso downstream of this zzso sequence folds into a zzso structure termed a zzso the formation of which is essential for efficient zzso
