zzso is a zzso signaling zzso with structural and functional characteristics of an zzso and/or zzso acting growth zzso In the eye, zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso specifically binds to zzso receptors and activates the zzso zzso signaling zzso that is profoundly enhanced when zzso is present at the zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso are not formed during zzso zzso As a result there is considerable evidence that zzso and zzso are part of an essential signaling system that controls the formation of the retinal zzso during eye zzso zzso zzso promotes vessel regrowth and zzso the formation of zzso zzso following zzso zzso in mice, an animal model of zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso has pronounced zzso properties on retinal zzso cells zzso with the distinct potential to decrease the damaging effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso similarly involve an zzso of zzso signaling and the subsequent induction of zzso growth factor synthesis in zzso cells, such as that of zzso growth zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso Overall, zzso and the molecules involved in its signaling zzso appear to be promising targets to develop strategies that induce zzso vessel formation in patients suffering from zzso zzso or that increase zzso survival in zzso
