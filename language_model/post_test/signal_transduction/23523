zzso 2A zzso as a stress zzso plays a protective role in gastric zzso zzso Its role in the development of gastric cancer zzso is zzso The mechanism of zzso will be investigated in gastric zzso 

zzso expression was detected in zzso gastric zzso The biological function was determined through zzso expressing zzso in zzso and in zzso The possible downstream zzso of zzso were investigated in zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were analyzed in a subset of 258 patients by zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso status of zzso and zzso stage were evaluated using the zzso method and compared using the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was detected in cell lines and primary tumors of zzso In clinical data, loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with poor prognosis zzso advanced zzso stage zzso and zzso of zzso expression zzso Furthermore, zzso was the independent zzso signature zzso from the status of zzso and pathological zzso In addition, zzso inhibited cell growth through zzso and zzso arrest, which zzso regulated zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso D1 zzso 

zzso might play a tumor zzso activity through zzso zzso signaling and may be a zzso zzso and potential target for individual therapy of zzso zzso
