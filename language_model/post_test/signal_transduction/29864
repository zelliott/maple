zzso are exposed to a zzso environment during zzso or inflammatory process, and the zzso systems are functional to protect themselves against harmful zzso oxygen species zzso The crucial roles of zzso zzso and a DNA repair zzso zzso in zzso are reported in zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulate different signaling pathways in many cellular zzso Their effects often cause some diseases or are zzso for the treatment of other zzso For example, the cells derived from zzso anemia zzso patients are intolerant of zzso stress and the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on B cell zzso disorders is due to the generation of zzso To clarify the zzso zzso signaling zzso we zzso a B cell line with various zzso of zzso As a result, a protein zzso zzso zzso was involved in the induction of zzso arrest and protection of cells from zzso zzso might inhibit the zzso of zzso through zzso thereby protecting cells from zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso was required for acceleration towards zzso following zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers the zzso of different zzso such as zzso or survival zzso and that the balance of these pathways is a key factor in determining the fate of the cells exposed to zzso zzso In contrast, the stimulation with the zzso zzso of zzso rapidly led to necrosis in which zzso zzso of zzso was involved at the downstream of Lyn and zzso
