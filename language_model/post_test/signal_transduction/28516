As zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso yet is also found in the nucleus, we investigated whether nuclear zzso is regulated by membrane zzso zzso zzso of the mast cell zzso zzso leads to the release and synthesis of inflammatory zzso as well as increased proliferation and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso following zzso of zzso with zzso This also resulted in a significant increase in the nucleus of several zzso zzso fragments, the largest of which included the zzso domain but not the focal zzso targeting zzso This was confirmed using cells that zzso expressed zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso expressing cells with zzso B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, resulted in increased nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso can shuttle between the nuclear and zzso compartments and the cellular distribution of zzso zzso is regulated by membrane zzso zzso
