Rod zzso are highly zzso sensory zzso that maintain strict zzso and molecular zzso zzso subdivisions include the outer segment, inner segment, cell body, and synaptic zzso The visual zzso zzso is found predominantly in zzso of the rod cell outer segment but becomes zzso appearing throughout the plasma membrane of the cell in many retinal diseases and zzso Currently, there is no known link between zzso zzso and rod cell zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zzso kills rod cells by stimulating normally zzso signaling zzso This hypothesis was tested in primary retinal cell cultures, which contain zzso In rod zzso zzso zzso occurred throughout the rod cell plasma zzso zzso of this zzso zzso by zzso after formation of zzso or by incubation with zzso zzso zzso killed zzso of rod zzso Rod cell death was zzso as indicated by marked zzso zzso and the requirement for zzso zzso Rod cell death could be induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and conversely, zzso cell death could be blocked by zzso with zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin (a G protein zzso also blocked zzso cell zzso The data support a mechanism by which zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso rod cell death through G protein stimulation of zzso zzso
