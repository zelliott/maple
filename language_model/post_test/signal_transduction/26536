Excess zzso stimulates the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and hence represents a major risk factor for breast zzso zzso is subjected to zzso zzso zzso metabolism to produce an zzso zzso estrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycling during which zzso oxygen species zzso as well as the chemically zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are produced, thereby contributing to hormonal zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso present in grapes, has been reported to possess zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso effects of zzso on zzso transformation of human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited migration and zzso growth of zzso cells treated with zzso zzso treatment suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and consequently zzso DNA binding activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso production and zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso blocks zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, thereby suppressing migration and transformation of these zzso
