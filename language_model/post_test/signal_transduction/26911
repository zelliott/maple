Upon zzso zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso leading to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as a zzso pathway, responsible for the zzso induction of zzso Previous findings delineated that human zzso are unable to induce the zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso Because zzso do not express protein zzso C zzso a zzso recently reported as essential for initiating the zzso pathway, we zzso an zzso method to zzso zzso into zzso with very high zzso By doing so, a significant zzso zzso expression was zzso in the absence of zzso zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in cells zzso with a series of empty DNA zzso however, zzso further zzso the zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso studies, as well as zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso promoter, revealed that zzso zzso induction occurred through the cooperative action of zzso activated by zzso DNA, and zzso activated by zzso Additional zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso express various zzso DNA sensors, including zzso protein 16, zzso repeat (in zzso I) interacting zzso and zzso as well as that zzso protein 16 is the zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso type 5, promoted a marked induction of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data raise questions about the role of zzso in driving the zzso response and indicate that human zzso are able to recognize and respond to microbial zzso zzso
