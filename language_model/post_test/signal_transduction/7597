Ras zzso mediates several cellular signal zzso pathways and is found zzso in a large number of zzso It is active in the zzso state, where it interacts with zzso zzso and at rest in the zzso zzso The zzso domain is zzso to the zzso with which it interacts in a zzso zzso Here we present the program zzso of Related zzso zzso zzso for zzso water analysis on protein surfaces and use it to study zzso zzso reads and zzso multiple zzso Data Bank zzso transfers zzso water molecules to the position closest to the protein surface, and ranks the waters according to how well zzso and tightly clustered they are in the set of zzso zzso according to this rank allows zzso of the zzso The zzso region of Ras is hydrated with highly zzso water molecules at the interface between the zzso switch I, and switch II, as well as at the zzso binding zzso Furthermore, we discovered a new zzso zzso zzso network present in zzso but not in zzso that links the zzso sensor zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 5 to the active zzso The double zzso zzso where the final link between zzso 5 and the zzso is not possible, is a severely impaired zzso while the single zzso zzso with partial connection to the active site, has a zzso zzso zzso zzso was instrumental in determining the zzso connectivity networks that link two zzso of the zzso domain in zzso
