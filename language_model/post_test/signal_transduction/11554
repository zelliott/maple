zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of death zzso that selectively zzso zzso in zzso cells of diverse zzso In this report, we have reviewed recent studies examining zzso zzso in multiple myeloma zzso a zzso zzso which, in spite of its initial sensitivity to steroids, zzso and high-dose chemotherapy, remains zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and resistant zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso selectively induced zzso of patient zzso zzso cells while sparing zzso bone zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso a potent growth and survival factor for zzso cells which, as we and others have previously zzso blocks various zzso signals including zzso zzso which like zzso is also a member of the zzso family of zzso In view of the potential clinical application of zzso to the treatment of zzso we have attempted to discern zzso mechanisms of action and resistance for zzso in zzso along with strategies to increase sensitivity and overcome resistance of zzso cells to zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso an agent which is commonly used to treat zzso patients, zzso the expression of the zzso zzso TRAIL zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso effect of TRAIL on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso such as zzso (a cell permeable inhibitor of zzso nuclear zzso as well as the zzso inhibitor zzso which is currently in Phase II clinical trials, also enhanced the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso Lastly, zzso zzso in zzso cells was dependent on zzso zzso and inhibited by the zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso These studies provide a framework for the use of zzso as a single agent or as part of combination therapy for the treatment of zzso
