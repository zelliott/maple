The zzso benefits of zzso including vascular protective effects and zzso properties, have now been zzso but the involved molecular mechanisms have not been well zzso Following our previous work on zzso mechanisms of some zzso against zzso triggered by zzso in zzso cells, here we investigated the protective role of zzso a major dietary zzso on such deleterious process, by exploring the interference on cellular zzso species formation and on zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with 25 zzso zzso protected efficiently zzso cells from zzso zzso death, an effect which may be partially zzso by its ability to decrease the formation of zzso species after cell zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso and by zzso groups zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso zzso signaling pathways induced by zzso by zzso zzso membrane zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and the increase in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our data expands our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the vascular protection afforded by zzso and zzso in general, in the context of prevention of zzso dysfunction and zzso
