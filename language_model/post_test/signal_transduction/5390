As zzso organisms, plants must cope with multiple and combined variations of signals in their zzso However, very few reports have studied the zzso effects of systematic signal combinations on gene zzso Here, we evaluate a high level of signal integration, by modeling zzso expression patterns under a zzso combination of carbon zzso light zzso and nitrogen zzso as zzso factors in two zzso zzso roots and zzso Signal management is different between C, zzso and L and in shoots and zzso For example, L is the major factor controlling gene expression in zzso However, in roots there is no obvious prominent zzso and signal interaction is zzso The major signal interaction events detected zzso wide in zzso roots are zzso and summarized in a comprehensive conceptual zzso Surprisingly, global analysis of gene expression in response to C, zzso zzso and O revealed that the number of genes controlled by a signal is zzso to the magnitude of the gene expression changes zzso by the zzso These results uncovered a strong constraining structure in plant cell signaling zzso which prompted us to propose the existence of a zzso of signal zzso
