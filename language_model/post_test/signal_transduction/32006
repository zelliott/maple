zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso gene zzso during zzso by fatty acid zzso acid zzso zzso contained in oral zzso of zzso zzso To understand the roles of zzso and its major product, zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso zzso defenses, we used a transgenic line specifically silenced in zzso expression zzso and monitored zzso production in zzso zzso and its role in influencing the production of direct defense compounds and resistance to this zzso zzso by zzso larvae amplified zzso formation at the feeding zzso a reaction probably facilitated by zzso high pH optimum which allows zzso formation to occur in the more alkaline conditions at the feeding sites or potentially in the insect mouth parts after the leaf tissue is zzso zzso zzso larvae performed better on zzso plants than on zzso zzso plants as a result of attenuated zzso zzso and zzso bursts as well as zzso well-established defenses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso applications of zzso to wounds before insect feeding partly amplified zzso defenses and restored the resistance of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso produced by zzso zzso activity, zzso in defense zzso during insect zzso
