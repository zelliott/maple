zzso zzso and other zzso zzso are aggressive primary zzso of the brain that exhibit notable zzso to standard treatment zzso Recent large-scale molecular profiling has revealed distinct disease zzso within zzso zzso whose defining zzso features highlight zzso molecular networks as potential targets for therapeutic zzso The zzso designation represents the largest and most zzso of these zzso and includes both a large fraction of zzso along with most of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso has been repeatedly associated with zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso amplification or zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso characterize only a subset of zzso zzso while the mechanisms driving zzso zzso signaling and downstream zzso networks in remaining tumors are zzso zzso zzso are a class of small, zzso zzso that regulate gene expression by binding loosely complimentary sequences in target zzso The role of zzso biology in numerous cancer zzso is well zzso In an analysis of zzso involvement in the zzso expression and regulation of zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, analysis of data from the Cancer Genome zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression is significantly lower in zzso zzso compared to other tumor zzso Using primary zzso cells maintained under zzso conditions, we then demonstrated that zzso specifically affects growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Further zzso analysis identified zzso as a direct target of zzso and this interaction was zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso repression is unlikely to operate solely through a zzso zzso Taken together, our data support the existence of zzso negative feedback regulation involving zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso and, as such, identify a zzso specific therapeutic potential for zzso
