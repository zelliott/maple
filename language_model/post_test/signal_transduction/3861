zzso of zzso zzso influx by the zzso zzso through generation of zzso is being found in an increasing number of cell zzso In the present work, we examined the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and attempted to identify the zzso zzso most likely to regulate zzso zzso For this, we first show that two zzso zzso acting on pancreatic zzso cells, zzso zzso and the zzso analog zzso zzso evokes different type of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso rapidly became acutely dependent on the presence of zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso continue for long periods of time in the absence of zzso zzso This differential behavior allowed us to isolate zzso influx and study its regulation while controlling for non specific effects on all other zzso transporting events involved in generating zzso zzso zzso of selective steps in the zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso were then used to show that scavenging NO with reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso G with zzso inhibited zzso zzso evoked by zzso but not those evoked by zzso These findings were extended to duct and zzso cells of the zzso In these cells, zzso zzso stimulate large zzso influx, which was inhibited by all zzso of the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso revealed that the cells did not express zzso zzso was expressed only in blood vessels and zzso whereas zzso was expressed at high levels next to the plasma membrane of all zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso influx into zzso zzso and duct zzso Thus, together, our findings favor zzso as the zzso activated by the zzso released from internal stores to generate zzso and regulate zzso zzso
