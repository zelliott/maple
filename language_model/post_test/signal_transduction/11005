The zzso play an important role in the initiation of cellular innate immune responses to a wide range of bacterial products, including zzso and zzso Although rapid progress has been made on signaling functions of activated zzso the molecular mechanisms that lead to zzso zzso are still poorly zzso We report in this study that the zzso domain of zzso interacts directly with synthetic bacterial zzso zzso a potent analog of bacterial zzso Using zzso labeled zzso zzso to soluble zzso zzso zzso we observed specific binding of zzso to the surface of cells expressing zzso zzso and to a zzso soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso at the cell surface did not require prior induction of zzso zzso In addition, using a zzso zzso zzso we showed that the zzso region of zzso carries the specificity for binding of the zzso and for initiating zzso zzso binding of fluorescent zzso to zzso zzso required zzso However, zzso was not part of the complex formed by soluble zzso and zzso Together, these data provide evidence that zzso recognizes zzso through direct zzso
