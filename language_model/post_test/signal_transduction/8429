Natural killer T zzso cells are zzso zzso that recognize zzso zzso and have been shown to enhance zzso zzso and zzso zzso B cells typically recruit zzso help by presenting zzso zzso recognized by their surface zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient means zzso human B cells present zzso zzso to zzso cells, capturing the zzso using zzso E zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically enhances zzso presentation of zzso zzso an zzso zzso presented zzso inducing zzso of zzso cells and the subsequent zzso of B zzso B cells express the zzso on zzso and the zzso of zzso cells by B cells is completely zzso dependent, as shown by blocking experiments and the complete lack of presentation when using zzso an zzso of zzso incapable of zzso zzso The dependence on zzso and the zzso is much more pronounced in B cells than we had previously seen in zzso cells, which can apparently use alternate pathways of zzso zzso zzso Thus, B cells use an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which constitutes a form of innate help for B cells by zzso zzso
