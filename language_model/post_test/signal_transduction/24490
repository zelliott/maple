Taste buds on the anterior part of the tongue develop in conjunction with zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso zzso Sonic zzso zzso and Bone zzso zzso 4 zzso are expressed in developing taste zzso but the roles of these signaling molecules in zzso of taste bud zzso and in zzso zzso are zzso We show here that zzso is not expressed in the early zzso but is precisely zzso with zzso in zzso zzso which serve as a signaling center for both zzso and zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso we used an in zzso model of mouse zzso zzso development to determine the effects of two functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tongue zzso express zzso and zzso in a pattern similar to that of intact zzso zzso to developing zzso zzso after 2 days in zzso zzso cultured with zzso zzso continue to express these genes in zzso patterns but develop more zzso that are larger and closer together than in zzso zzso cultured with zzso have a zzso expansion of zzso and zzso expression zzso Both zzso and zzso tongue zzso also are smaller than zzso Taken together, these results suggest that, although zzso is not involved in the initial zzso of zzso zzso zzso does play two key roles during zzso development: zzso as a zzso that directs cells toward a zzso fate, and zzso as a zzso causing expansion of the zzso zzso and underlying zzso
