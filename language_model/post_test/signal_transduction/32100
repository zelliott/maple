zzso chemotherapy is widely used for zzso cancer, sometimes in combination with zzso but poor response to chemotherapy is not zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether zzso expression is useful to predict the response to chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso 

Using zzso biopsy samples from 98 patients with zzso cancer who received zzso chemotherapy, we measured the expression level of several zzso whose expression was altered in zzso zzso cancer cell lines compared with those parent cell lines and examined the relationship between the zzso expression and response to zzso In zzso zzso were conducted to clarify the mechanism of zzso changes in zzso 

The expression levels of 15 zzso were altered in zzso zzso Of these, low expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso from 74 patients of the training set correlated significantly with poor response to chemotherapy, both clinically and zzso Low expression of zzso also correlated with poor prognosis zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso expression and response to chemotherapy was confirmed in the other 24 patients of the validation zzso In in zzso zzso zzso of zzso restored sensitivity to zzso and increased rate of zzso after exposure to zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression in zzso cancer can be potentially used to predict the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
