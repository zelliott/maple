zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common, bacterial second zzso that regulates diverse cellular processes in zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso control zzso zzso in the zzso Many microbes have a large number of genes zzso zzso and zzso that are predicted to be part of zzso signaling zzso Other building blocks of these networks are zzso receptors which sense the cellular levels of the zzso zzso receptors form a more diverse family, including various zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso Recent studies revealing the molecular basis of zzso signaling mechanisms enhanced our understanding of how this zzso controls downstream biological processes and how zzso signaling specificity is zzso
