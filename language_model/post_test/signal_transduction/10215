The mechanism of skeletal zzso fusion is not well zzso We show that zzso zzso oxide zzso generation is required for zzso fusion both in embryonic zzso and in satellite zzso The effect of NO is concentration and time dependent, being evident only at the onset of zzso and direct on the fusion process zzso The action of NO is zzso through a tightly regulated zzso of zzso zzso and generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso so much so that deregulation of zzso signaling leads to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and embryonic muscles, and to the acquisition of fusion competence by zzso precursors in the zzso zzso NO and zzso induce expression of zzso and this zzso protein mediates their action in zzso These results establish a zzso unappreciated role of NO and zzso in regulating zzso fusion and zzso their mechanism of action, providing a direct link with zzso which is a key player in zzso
