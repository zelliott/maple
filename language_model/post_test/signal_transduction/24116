zzso growth zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor that plays a critical role in tissue repair and zzso zzso signaling has been shown to regulate a variety of cellular processes and has been implicated in collagen gene zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether zzso zzso are involved in the zzso signaling zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso levels in a zzso manner within zzso zzso of cell zzso Using human zzso zzso with a zzso collagen zzso gene construct zzso zzso (10 zzso exerted a zzso effect on zzso and zzso activity of this zzso Next, to define the effects of zzso zzso on zzso signaling we employed zzso expression of zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and cooperated with zzso in zzso of this zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso resulted in the pronounced increase of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso is a positive regulator of collagen gene zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic increase of zzso promoter zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates a direct role for the zzso zzso zzso in regulating the zzso signaling zzso
