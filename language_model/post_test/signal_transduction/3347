zzso of zzso signaling networks requires reliable data about the underlying cellular zzso zzso We report a chemical zzso and quantitative zzso approach that encompasses cellular zzso zzso in combination with comparative replicate mass zzso analyses of cells expressing either zzso or resistant zzso zzso We applied this zzso to zzso zzso zzso 1) in zzso cells and induced cellular zzso activity by zzso of the bulky zzso inhibitor zzso which targets a zzso zzso version with an enlarged zzso pocket while not interfering with zzso zzso We zzso more than 20,000 distinct zzso sites by zzso approximately half of which were measured in at least two independent experiments in cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso Based on replicate zzso site zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, our chemical genetic zzso concept enabled stringent comparative statistics by significance analysis of zzso which unveiled more than 350 cellular downstream targets of zzso validated by full zzso of both statistical and experimental zzso Our data point to zzso poorly characterized aspects in zzso zzso progression and provide a largely extended resource for functional zzso We anticipate the described strategies to be of general utility for systematic and confident identification of cellular protein zzso zzso
