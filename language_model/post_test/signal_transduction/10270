zzso zzso signaling is crucial for formation and stabilization of an zzso zzso We demonstrated recently in zzso from healthy subjects that insulin interferes with zzso increases induced by zzso contact through blockade of the zzso zzso and thereby with zzso suppression of zzso 

Here we show in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso that zzso have lost responsiveness to insulin leading to increased zzso zzso and zzso activity on contact with zzso Using zzso zzso of protein zzso B as output for insulin zzso a zzso increase is found in zzso normal zzso but in zzso zzso there is no significant zzso In addition, zzso zzso show increased zzso suppression of zzso and decreased zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 

The loss of responsiveness to insulin together with increased signaling through zzso might explain the zzso of zzso in patients with zzso
