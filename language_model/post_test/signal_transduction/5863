A substantial body of evidence indicates that protein zzso C zzso is involved in the zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso an event that reduces the formation of the zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have shown that trafficking and processing of zzso are both impaired by zzso of zzso zzso one of the major zzso motor zzso Here, we provide evidence that the zzso processing of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso This signaling zzso provides an important link between zzso and the zzso zzso and might be crucial for the understanding of the biological and pathological roles of zzso
