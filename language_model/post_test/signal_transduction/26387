zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso and gives an in zzso survival advantage to B cells isolated from patients with zzso zzso zzso In this study, we undertook to zzso the signaling zzso responsible for this zzso zzso In responding cells only, in zzso zzso engagement triggers global zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso reflecting competency of zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso and to some extent zzso activated in all zzso B zzso In contrast, its zzso capacity is enhanced on zzso stimulation in responding cells zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso prevents induction of zzso target gene and zzso survival, converting responding cells to unresponsive zzso At the opposite, zzso zzso activity allows survival of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the functional zzso relies on zzso of protein levels establishing zzso thresholds and zzso zzso Finally, status of the zzso zzso for each patient reveals its relevance for zzso clinical outcome and points out to zzso zzso as promising functional therapeutic zzso
