zzso zzso zzso is a life-threatening zzso condition caused by dysfunctional zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, which primarily originates from genetic zzso in the zzso release channel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to its physical interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled by the electrical potential across the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibits both zzso zzso and zzso Here we determined the impact of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso on these processes in adult muscle fibers isolated from zzso zzso zzso The zzso dependence of zzso zzso release flux was zzso by approximately 8 zzso As a consequence, the zzso window for zzso zzso release extended to more negative holding zzso in muscle fibers of the zzso A rise in temperature from 20 degrees to 30 degrees C caused a further shift to more negative zzso of this window (by approximately 20 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso current was minimally changed by the zzso However, surprisingly, the zzso dependence of zzso zzso of zzso calcium zzso and release were also shifted by approximately 10 zzso to more negative zzso indicating a retrograde action of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso that limits window zzso zzso This effect serves as a zzso response to the lowered zzso threshold for zzso release caused by the zzso zzso and represents a novel mechanism to counteract excessive zzso leak and store depletion in zzso zzso
