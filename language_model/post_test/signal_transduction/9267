zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso iron zzso zzso zzso is a potent negative regulator of zzso Based on in zzso data, it has recently been proposed that zzso decreases zzso synthesis by zzso membrane zzso a key protein of the zzso zzso However, in zzso evidence for this mechanism of action of zzso is zzso To investigate the zzso interaction in zzso an zzso zzso for liver membrane zzso was zzso using zzso mice as a negative zzso In zzso mice, two zzso bands of zzso and zzso were detected in mouse liver membrane fraction under reducing zzso under zzso conditions, a single band of approximately zzso was zzso zzso zzso C treatment confirmed binding of the detected protein to the cell membrane by a zzso anchor, indicating that the major form of mouse liver membrane zzso is a zzso zzso zzso comparison of liver zzso from zzso and zzso mice revealed significantly zzso rather than increased, zzso zzso content in zzso zzso These data do not provide direct support for the concept that zzso zzso membrane zzso and may indicate that, in zzso the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression is more zzso
