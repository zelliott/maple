In recent years, research on neural crest induction has allowed the identification of several molecules as candidates for neural crest zzso Although many of these molecules have the ability to induce neural crest in different zzso a general mechanism of neural crest induction that includes a description of the zzso that produce the zzso signals and the time and steps in which this process takes place remains zzso To better understand the mechanism of neural crest zzso we developed an zzso that has been used previously by zzso to study zzso pattern of the neural zzso zzso of competent zzso were implanted in different positions of a young zzso zzso and the induction of neural crest was analyzed using the expression of the neural crest marker zzso We identified a very localized region of the early zzso where it is possible to get neural crest zzso whereas all of the regions tested showed a clear induction of the neural plate marker zzso These results indicate that there is a region in the zzso with the appropriate combination of signals needed to induce neural crest zzso we called this region the neural crest competence zzso In addition, our results show that neural crest induction is always accompanied by neural plate zzso but there are many cases where neural plate was induced without neural zzso These results support the model in which the neural crest is induced by an interaction between neural plate and zzso but they also suggest that additional signals are zzso By making zzso of different sizes and zzso them in the zzso or the neural plate, we concluded that one of the zzso signals is produced in the zzso region of the zzso and travels into the zzso Finally, by performing zzso and zzso of zzso signaling experiments, we show that this zzso plays an important role not only in neural crest induction but also in the zzso of the neural crest competence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
