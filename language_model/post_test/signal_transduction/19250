zzso in the environmental zzso are key zzso for the growth of zzso To ensure a zzso acceptable level of cellular zzso and zzso at high zzso many bacteria accumulate compatible zzso zzso controlled zzso systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective zzso A number of these systems belong to the zzso family zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are ubiquitous in zzso The zzso family also contains zzso an zzso zzso that is not involved in zzso stress zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a representative for zzso zzso of the zzso family and functions both as an zzso and zzso The crystal structure of zzso in an zzso zzso in complex with its zzso zzso zzso and two crystal structures of zzso in an zzso open zzso in complex with zzso and zzso were reported zzso These structures and the wealth of zzso data on the activity control of zzso in response to zzso stress enable a correlation between the sensing of zzso stress by a zzso protein with the ensuing regulation of transport zzso zzso zzso governing the zzso binding of the compatible zzso by zzso and zzso the zzso in zzso and zzso and the zzso properties are discussed in detail for zzso and various zzso zzso
