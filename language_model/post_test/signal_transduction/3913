Several zzso of zzso are known to interact with either the insulin zzso or the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso or zzso zzso as the data in the literature on the function of zzso are not always zzso we have investigated the role of one of these zzso zzso in cell zzso For this purpose, a zzso expressing zzso was zzso zzso into zzso cells and other mouse zzso zzso cell zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso growth, causes a delay in the S and zzso zzso of the cell cycle, and partially reverses the transformed zzso In contrast, it has no effect on insulin stimulation of cell zzso These studies indicate that this zzso of zzso has an zzso effect on zzso signaling of cell zzso
