The zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso One is the zzso zzso filaments that fill the zzso and mediate zzso zzso The other is the membrane skeleton that coats the plasma membrane and regulates properties of the membrane such as its contours and stability and the lateral distribution of membrane zzso Recent work reviewed in this article indicates that the zzso zzso complex can associate with the membrane zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes competent to bind its adhesive zzso zzso This zzso a reorganization of the zzso such that the membrane skeletal proteins with which zzso zzso is associated become associated with underlying zzso zzso As in focal contacts of cultured cells, this zzso association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso filaments regulates the ability of zzso zzso to bind adhesive zzso zzso zzso that are activated as a consequence of zzso binding to the zzso zzso complex include zzso zzso and zzso making these potential candidates for zzso inducing the zzso signaling across the zzso Additional candidates include zzso zzso and protein zzso C, other zzso that have been detected in focal contacts of zzso zzso Future studies identifying interactions between the zzso zzso complex and membrane skeletal proteins should help to further zzso the significance of the zzso zzso in zzso interaction in regulating zzso zzso signaling in zzso
