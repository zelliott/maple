zzso 5 zzso zzso a synthetic K vitamin zzso or zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso rat zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the cellular responses to zzso 5, its effects on the zzso signal zzso zzso were examined and compared to those of the zzso zzso zzso 5 induced a cellular response program that included the induction of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso 5 in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that both zzso and zzso 5 induced zzso zzso of zzso was associated with increased amounts of adapter proteins zzso and zzso and the Ras zzso exchange protein zzso indicating the formation of functional zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was induced both by the stimulant zzso and the inhibitor zzso 5, the timing and intensity of zzso by zzso and zzso 5 were zzso zzso activated zzso zzso whereas zzso 5 induced an intense and sustained zzso zzso zzso cells had a decreased ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso providing evidence for an zzso of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso 5 caused an induction of zzso response zzso zzso which was also more sustained with zzso zzso Moreover, whereas zzso 5 induced a striking zzso of zzso zzso from zzso to the nucleus, no significant nuclear zzso occurred after stimulation with zzso The data suggest that this novel compound causes growth zzso through antagonism of zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso This is supported by experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which both antagonized zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of DNA zzso These results imply a mechanism of cell growth zzso associated with intense and prolonged protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may thus be a novel target for drugs designed to inhibit cell zzso
