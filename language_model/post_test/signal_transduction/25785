Bone zzso zzso cells zzso can protect zzso cells from chemotherapy, thus increasing their survival zzso We studied the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso of ALL cells with zzso induced on the zzso plasma membrane the expression of a signaling complex formed by zzso zzso zzso gene 1) channels, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The assembly of such a protein complex activated both the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso At the same time, ALL cells became markedly resistant to zzso zzso zzso channel function appeared to be important for both the initiation of zzso signals and the development of drug resistance, because specific channel zzso decreased the protective effect of zzso zzso mice zzso with ALL cells and treated with channel zzso showed reduced zzso zzso and had higher survival zzso Moreover, zzso blockade enhanced the therapeutic effect produced by zzso Our findings provide a rationale for clinical testing of zzso zzso in the context of zzso therapy for patients with zzso
