We are living in an exciting era in the treatment of cancer, using drugs that target specific proteins rather than agents that cause more general zzso zzso The identification of proteins and signal zzso pathways that play crucial roles in the zzso of cancer has allowed treatments to be designed that target these zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso are rare zzso tumors and were among the first solid tumor types for which such a novel treatment (in this case zzso became zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso targets the human zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso This drug exhibits impressive zzso effects against zzso and has become the zzso therapy for advanced zzso Major insights into the mechanism of action of this drug, drug resistance, and patient management issues have been zzso Additionally, new drugs developed for the treatment of zzso have been zzso As a consequence, lessons learned from zzso are widely zzso to other tumor entities, thereby rendering zzso the paradigm of solid tumors treated with zzso zzso zzso This Review discusses the zzso of zzso treatment strategies, mechanisms accounting for drug resistance, and potential future zzso
