zzso and zzso are large nuclear zzso zzso by two distinct zzso that appear to be involved in regulated zzso and cellular growth zzso They are highly related in sequence and are expressed in most, if not all, zzso zzso There is evidence for the existence of additional cellular proteins sharing at least some of the sequence motifs of zzso and zzso Members of this protein family also appear to be present in zzso zzso and zzso but, based on the recently published complete zzso zzso not in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso proteins are likely confined to zzso organisms where they may fulfill specific functions required for the proper growth and zzso This view is supported by the occurrence of multiple zzso and zzso defects in patients suffering from zzso syndrome which is due to an zzso zzso in one zzso zzso
