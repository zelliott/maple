We previously demonstrated that the zzso factor zzso is important for zzso replication and survival in rat zzso zzso we investigate zzso expression in zzso of zzso and diabetic donors, its regulation by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and evaluate its effect on human zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso derived from Type 2 diabetic donors zzso with zzso In zzso studies on non diabetic zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and insulin increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso Surprisingly, increases in zzso expression did not prompt a surge in human zzso cell zzso Furthermore, expression of the proliferation marker gene zzso remained zzso zzso expression of human zzso resulted in a small increase in zzso expression while zzso transcript levels and cell replication were unchanged in human zzso In contrast, zzso of mouse zzso induced human zzso cell zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso induced zzso without stimulating zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso DNA binding activity was found to be lower than that of the mouse zzso Thus, human zzso gene expression is zzso regulated and induced by zzso stimuli through the concerted action of multiple zzso zzso However, it is unable to initiate the zzso replication program likely due to zzso modifications of the zzso The latter highlights fundamental differences between human and zzso zzso physiology and emphasizes the importance of zzso results obtained with animal models in human zzso
