We have previously shown that zzso zzso and zzso significantly induced the expression of zzso zzso but the zzso activity was inhibited by the three metals, and the zzso was accompanied by an increase in the zzso stress zzso In the current study we investigated the role of zzso zzso factors and the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in the zzso effects on zzso gene zzso We show that heavy metals caused the induction of zzso stress zzso such as zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso and the depletion of cellular zzso content, which was associated with zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso significantly abolished the zzso induction of zzso zzso whereas it further zzso their zzso effects on zzso zzso In zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso further zzso the zzso induction of zzso zzso whereas it reversed their zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso of zzso upstream signaling zzso zzso such as zzso by zzso suppressed zzso zzso induction by heavy metals, whereas it zzso their zzso effects at the activity zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso further zzso heavy zzso induction of zzso zzso whereas it reversed their zzso effects on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed the zzso induction of zzso zzso but did not alter zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways is directly involved in the zzso of zzso by heavy zzso
