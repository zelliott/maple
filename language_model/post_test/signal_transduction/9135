Bone zzso proteins zzso play diverse roles in embryonic kidney development, regulating essential aspects of both zzso bud and zzso zzso In this review, we provide an overview of reported expression patterns and functions of zzso signaling components within the zzso zone or zzso zzso niche of the developing zzso zzso in zzso zzso results are relatively challenging to interpret and sometimes zzso Comparing these with high-resolution zzso gene expression data available in zzso we propose a consensus gene expression pattern indicating that essential components of both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso pathways are expressed in the zzso zzso cell compartment and may be activated by zzso but that cortical zzso may only be able to respond to zzso through zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors and studies of a zzso reporter mouse strain however indicate limited zzso responsiveness to zzso signaling in cap zzso An overview of genetic zzso organ culture, and primary cell studies indicates that zzso signaling may elicit two important biological outcomes in the zzso zzso survival of the cap zzso and the physical segregation of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso studies using a novel primary cell system that establishes the zzso zone ex zzso are pursuing the concept that the balance between zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso may zzso these distinct zzso
