We earlier demonstrated that oral infusion of green tea zzso zzso development and progression of prostate cancer in transgenic zzso of the mouse prostate zzso zzso Evidence indicates that elevated levels of zzso with zzso lowering of zzso binding protein zzso are associated with increased risk for prostate cancer development and zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso signaling and its downstream and other associated events during zzso of prostate cancer by green tea zzso in zzso zzso Our data demonstrated an increase in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 with zzso decrease in zzso in zzso prostate of zzso mice during the course of cancer zzso zzso as a function of zzso Continuous green tea zzso infusion for 24 weeks to these mice resulted in substantial reduction in the levels of zzso and significant increase in the levels of zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso of zzso was found to be associated with an zzso of protein expression of zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, green tea zzso infusion resulted in marked zzso of markers of zzso and zzso most notably vascular zzso growth factor, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 and zzso Based on our data, we suggest that zzso signaling zzso is a prime zzso for green tea zzso zzso of prostate cancer that limits the progression of cancer through zzso of zzso and zzso
