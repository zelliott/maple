zzso is a novel zzso biased zzso of the zzso II type 1 zzso it zzso zzso zzso zzso while, in contrast to classical zzso II type 1 zzso antagonists, it engages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while, via zzso zzso it increases zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso would elicit beneficial zzso actions when added to zzso in experimental heart zzso 

Two groups of zzso dogs zzso each) with zzso heart failure were zzso After a baseline zzso 1 group zzso received zzso (1 zzso per zzso plus saline for 90 minutes, whereas the other zzso received the same dose of zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso zzso per minute for 45 minutes zzso 2 zzso were done during drug zzso After a zzso a zzso clearance was zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso and zzso to a similar extent during drug administration, but urine zzso and urinary sodium zzso were higher in the zzso clearance with zzso zzso zzso rate was preserved in both zzso Renal blood flow increased with zzso but this was not significant versus zzso Compared with zzso zzso decreased mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso wedge zzso decreased to a larger extent with zzso than with zzso 

When added to zzso zzso a novel zzso biased zzso II type 1 zzso zzso preserved zzso zzso and zzso while reducing cardiac zzso and zzso These results provide support for zzso as a promising novel therapeutic for the treatment of heart zzso
