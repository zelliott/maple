zzso growth zzso zzso signals through a unique set of zzso zzso called zzso that have been characterized mainly in transient zzso zzso Because several models of zzso suggest a role for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we sought to characterize the role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso responses in a more zzso system using zzso human zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression and its zzso by zzso were evaluated by Western and Northern zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was determined by both zzso and zzso zzso function and its role in type I collagen zzso were investigated in zzso experiments using zzso reporter gene zzso 

zzso human zzso cells express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso respectively, after 4 and 24 hours of treatment, whereas zzso and zzso were less zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso in response to zzso beginning at 5 minutes, with zzso zzso at 15 minutes, and decreasing zzso by 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso only after zzso zzso The activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity, which was further zzso by zzso A dominant negative zzso form of zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso sites zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso of an zzso collagen zzso reporter construct zzso into zzso zzso This zzso was inhibited by zzso with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso are present and activated by zzso in human zzso zzso The zzso zzso is functional in these cells and appears to be involved in zzso type I collagen gene zzso These findings raise the possibility that zzso signaling plays a role in zzso zzso zzso
