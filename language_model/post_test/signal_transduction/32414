zzso conversion of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso into the zzso species of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in minced human primordial zzso incubated with zzso was zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso zzso zzso revealed a much higher capacity of the zzso to zzso zzso than zzso and indicated the rapid metabolism of zzso In addition, zzso zzso the labeling of PC whereas no such effects on the labeling of zzso and PA were zzso This effect of zzso is not related to the synthesis of PC de zzso because zzso did not exhibit any stimulating effect on the synthesis of PC from zzso or zzso zzso with varying zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed increasing rate of formation of zzso over a concentration range from zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was the lowest concentration where significant formation of zzso was zzso zzso of PC was about zzso over control at zzso zzso as well as at zzso zzso zzso and decreased below the control level at zzso zzso zzso zzso of PA and zzso was not influenced by these zzso zzso zzso of PC, either zzso by zzso or not, was more sensitive to the zzso effect of 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso Moreover, 1 zzso zzso inhibited the formation of zzso without such an effect on the labeling of zzso These findings indicate that in the primordial human zzso PC synthesis represents a more efficient zzso zzso of zzso signal than the formation of PA by zzso zzso
