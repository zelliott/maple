Within pancreatic zzso cells, rhythmic changes in the zzso zzso concentration have been reported to occur in response to zzso zzso zzso and to be zzso with zzso release of zzso We explored the possible mechanisms responsible for zzso signal propagation within zzso cells, with particular regard to gap junction communication, the zzso widely credited with being responsible for coordination of the zzso zzso Using zzso imaging, we found that multiple mechanisms control zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso zzso Gap junction blockade by 18 zzso acid greatly restricted the propagation of zzso waves induced by mechanical stimulation of cells but affected neither zzso signals nor insulin zzso zzso by zzso zzso The source of zzso zzso was also different under the two experimental conditions, the first being sustained by release from inner stores and the second by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso waves were able to zzso across zzso zzso indicating that zzso factors can control zzso signal zzso Our results provide evidence that multiple mechanisms of zzso signaling operate in zzso and that gap junctions are not required for zzso zzso wave propagation or insulin zzso in response to zzso
