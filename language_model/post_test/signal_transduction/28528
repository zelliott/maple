zzso cells require a constant supply of oxygen to maintain energy balance, and sustained zzso can result in cell zzso It is therefore not surprising that sophisticated zzso mechanisms have evolved that enhance cell survival during zzso During the past few years, there have been a growing number of reports on zzso zzso of specific zzso In this review, we describe a unique experimental approach that zzso focused zzso libraries coupled to zzso analyses to identify zzso signal zzso pathways and genes that zzso the zzso zzso We have used the zzso suppression zzso zzso method to create a zzso library enriched in zzso genes in zzso zzso cells and have used this library to create zzso that allow us to examine hundreds of genes at a zzso This library contains over 300 genes and expressed sequence tags zzso by zzso including zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso zzso regulation of these and other genes in the library has been confirmed by zzso Northern zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso focused zzso libraries with zzso analyses allows one to specifically study genes relevant to a zzso of interest while reducing much of the biological noise associated with these types of zzso When used in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso for cell survival and zzso this approach offers a rapid method for discovering validated therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and zzso
