zzso X zzso zzso plays an important role in maintaining zzso acid and cholesterol zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso also regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the synthetic zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso active zzso by zzso gene transfer significantly lowered blood zzso levels in both diabetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these data, zzso zzso mice exhibited zzso intolerance and insulin zzso We further demonstrate that zzso of zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso genes and increased zzso zzso synthesis and zzso content by a mechanism that involves enhanced insulin zzso In view of its central roles in zzso regulation of both zzso and zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso are promising therapeutic agents for treatment of diabetes zzso
