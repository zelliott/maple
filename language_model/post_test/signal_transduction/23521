The zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso protein that mediates zzso recruitment and migration during peripheral and central nervous system zzso zzso 

To determine the impact of zzso in inflammation in zzso and to zzso the zzso polarization of activated brain zzso we delivered zzso into the brains of zzso mice via zzso zzso virus zzso 9 zzso driven by the chicken zzso zzso We measured zzso zzso using zzso and chemical measurement and recruitment of zzso using zzso and flow zzso 

The zzso of zzso in the zzso induced significant zzso of brain resident zzso zzso and major zzso complex class II zzso significantly increased at the sites of zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso revealed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso B and zzso as well as markers associated with zzso zzso of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The protein expression profile in the zzso demonstrated markedly increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso but no changes in the levels of other zzso including zzso and zzso Moreover, real-time zzso analysis confirmed increases in zzso levels of gene transcripts associated with zzso following zzso zzso Finally, we investigated the zzso properties of zzso in zzso by performing adoptive transfer of bone zzso cells zzso isolated from donor mice that zzso expressed green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso into brain zzso and zzso with zzso zzso 

Taken together, our results suggest that zzso strongly activates resident zzso in the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso with no bias toward the zzso or zzso zzso in the activated zzso As expected, zzso zzso actively recruited circulating zzso into the zzso Thus, zzso expression in mouse brain zzso zzso zzso and represents an efficient method for recruitment of peripheral zzso
