Previous reports have shown that zzso and zzso cells express functionally active zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a member of a growing family of zzso activated receptors zzso requires zzso of the zzso zzso domain by zzso to induce signal zzso Studies from our laboratory have shown that zzso zzso following the addition of zzso or a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death both in zzso and in zzso In addition to increasing zzso cell death, zzso 1 zzso leads to decreases in the mean zzso length and side branching in highly enriched zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso survival depends on access to sufficient zzso zzso factors through zzso branching and synaptic zzso However, whether the zzso effects on zzso can be prevented by zzso factors is still zzso Using highly enriched avian zzso cultures, we show here that alone, soluble chick skeletal muscle extracts zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso significantly increased zzso survival compared to controls, whereas nerve growth factor zzso did not have a significant effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly prevented the death of zzso induced by zzso Yet, zzso agents zzso and zzso had little or no significant effect in reversing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the mean length of zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso failed to enhance zzso outgrowth compared to zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso significantly prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso only partially reversed zzso zzso of zzso zzso These findings show differential effects of zzso factors on zzso zzso zzso and suggest specific zzso between the zzso and stress pathways activated by some zzso agents and zzso zzso
