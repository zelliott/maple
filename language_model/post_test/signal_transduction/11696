zzso protein zzso II zzso is known to play a key role during induction of long-term zzso zzso Given the dependence of zzso on the frequency of synaptic zzso several previous modeling efforts have proposed that zzso properties of zzso itself might be in part responsible for this zzso Recently, De zzso and Schulman zzso have provided direct experimental evidence that the zzso itself is sensitive to the frequency of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate the ability of a detailed zzso model constructed solely on zzso zzso of zzso proteins to generate the frequency sensitivity demonstrated by De zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the model reveals that this frequency sensitivity is provided by a mechanism different from those previously zzso This analysis leads to specific predictions concerning the effects of zzso on this zzso We further employ the model to examine the zzso behavior of zzso system during longer simulated periods of zzso The analyses of the model suggest that the transient and zzso frequency sensitivity of this zzso are dependent on different zzso zzso These results may be zzso to zzso signaling pathways in zzso
