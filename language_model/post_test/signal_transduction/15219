zzso infection elicits a robust innate zzso response dominated by the production of type 1 zzso In zzso innate immune cells such as zzso type 1 zzso is rapidly produced following the recognition of viral zzso and the subsequent zzso of the zzso expressed zzso factor zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso Although origin, zzso and length are factors in zzso zzso recognition and binding by cellular zzso zzso the biological significance of differential zzso binding is zzso since the subsequent signaling pathways zzso on zzso In this study, we show a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes in mouse zzso The length dependence was exacerbated in zzso deficient in the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso 1 and zzso suggesting that zzso gene induction zzso by short and long zzso molecules is predominantly zzso promoter zzso 1 and zzso dependent and independent, zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence of an innate zzso response in zzso in the absence of both zzso and type 1 zzso zzso Even with these key zzso missing, a zzso zzso of virus replication was observed following zzso treatment with short or long zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence of a novel zzso zzso that is dependent on zzso zzso but independent of the type 1 zzso zzso
