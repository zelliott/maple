A large number of zzso binding zzso which in general have intrinsic and/or zzso zzso activity, have been identified in recent years and are involved in a wide range of cellular regulatory and signal zzso zzso A common property of these proteins is that they exist in what is generally described as an active form when zzso is bound and an inactive zzso form when zzso is zzso Thus, the intrinsic or zzso zzso activity of these zzso serves to turn off a signal or to terminate a regulated zzso It has been suggested that these zzso together with zzso whose prime function is to convert the free energy of zzso zzso into another form of energy or into zzso chemical reactions should be grouped together under the heading of zzso In this article, this suggestion is examined from the point of view of identifying the role of the zzso of zzso of zzso in the zzso or regulatory process of the zzso It is concluded that there is a qualitative difference between zzso and classical zzso in the sense that a quantitative relationship between the zzso of zzso zzso and the appearance of this energy in a different form cannot be directly zzso The significance of the high free energy of zzso is that it allows efficient transition from the active to the inactive state of zzso in spite of the tendency of the strong interaction of the zzso form with a partner zzso zzso an essential feature of their mode of action, to stabilize the zzso zzso
