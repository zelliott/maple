zzso nerve head zzso become abnormal in eyes that have elevated zzso pressure, and cultured zzso display altered protein expression after being subjected for zzso or zzso 1 days to elevated zzso zzso Here we show that zzso elevated zzso pressure (15 or 30 zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cultured rat zzso nerve head zzso as judged by Western zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso abolished zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso To examine zzso activity, zzso pH zzso was measured with zzso and, in some experiments, cells were zzso by zzso exposure to 20 zzso ammonium zzso Although baseline zzso was zzso the rate of zzso recovery from zzso was fourfold higher in zzso zzso In the presence of either zzso or zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso pressure did not change the rate of zzso zzso The findings are consistent with zzso zzso due to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso These responses may zzso long-term changes of protein expression known to occur in zzso zzso
