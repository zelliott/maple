We used a zzso based on the Sleeping Beauty zzso to search for zzso zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso were produced by random zzso of a zzso promoter, which provided robust and exceptionally zzso expression of downstream zzso The ability to regulate the zzso zzso was used to attribute the latter to the zzso zzso In one such zzso the promoter was inserted in the middle of the gene zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso The protein zzso by the hybrid transcript lacks the putative zzso domain of zzso but zzso stimulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso treatment, expression of the short zzso was toxic to cells that failed to zzso zzso The effects of short zzso did not require zzso zzso or zzso treatment and coincided with reduced responsiveness to zzso Additional evidence indicates that a similar short zzso could be produced naturally from the zzso zzso Interestingly, elevated expression of short zzso resulted in the loss of full length zzso from cells, pointing to a novel mechanism through which the abundance of zzso and the status of the related signaling zzso may be zzso
