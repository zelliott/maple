The induction of zzso in host cells is a common strategy by which zzso bacteria interfere with the host immune zzso The zzso zzso outer protein P zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso B in zzso which suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso The simultaneous initiation of zzso signaling by zzso infection or zzso treatment results in zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso as a tool to dissect zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso with expression plasmids for zzso and zzso zzso of signal zzso of the zzso B cascade downstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 2 diminished zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting implication of zzso and zzso in signaling cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso factor 6 zzso did not provide protection, but zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso which indicates roles of zzso and zzso in the zzso signal relay of the zzso B zzso The distinct functions of zzso members in zzso survival were reflected by opposing effects of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell death were substantially attenuated by a specific zzso zzso zzso or by dominant negative zzso death domain protein zzso This suggests, that zzso zzso involves a zzso signal relay through zzso and zzso which potentially targets the zzso death domain zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso and zzso counteract the zzso zzso response by signaling zzso zzso
