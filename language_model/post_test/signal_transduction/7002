zzso zzso gene 5 zzso is one of the three members in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso family, which are zzso pathogen recognition receptors recognizing zzso zzso In the present study, zzso and its spliced shorter forms, named as zzso and zzso were identified in zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso in cell lines following the infection of a negative zzso virus, the spring zzso of carp virus zzso and an zzso zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso that the zzso may also be able to sense elements released from zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in fish cells resulted in significant induction of type I zzso promoter activity and enabled the protection of zzso cells against zzso zzso Furthermore, the shorter spliced form, zzso when zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso induced a significantly higher level of zzso promoter activity, indicating that zzso may function as an zzso in the interaction between zzso and zzso
