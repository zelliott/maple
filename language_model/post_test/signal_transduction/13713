Although zzso and anatomical studies indicate that zzso veins are characterized by zzso wall weakening and zzso fibrosis, the exact underlying zzso mechanism of their development remains zzso Additionally, no quantitative zzso study of zzso proteins leading to decreased zzso of zzso veins has been reported to zzso zzso to zzso the molecular mechanism of altered vascular zzso this study performed shotgun zzso analysis to obtain protein expression profiles in patients with zzso zzso zzso isotope zzso labeling coupled with zzso revealed zzso in 12 zzso including zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, analyses of protein species associated with zzso assembly or with cellular zzso showed no clear zzso or zzso These results indicate that defects in zzso generation and zzso may account for the dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle following formation of zzso zzso zzso the severity of zzso veins depends on the regulatory roles of various protein factors in the zzso coordination of zzso zzso This pilot study improves understanding of the zzso of zzso veins and lays the foundation for further validation and clinical translation of zzso for targeted therapies in treating this zzso
