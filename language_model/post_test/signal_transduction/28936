During the last 20 years, since the appearance of the first publication on zzso zzso zzso our knowledge of this phenomenon has increased zzso PC is defined as an increased tolerance to zzso and zzso induced by previous zzso period zzso This is the most powerful mechanism known to date for limiting the zzso zzso This adaptation occurs in a zzso pattern zzso early zzso zzso for 2-3 zzso and zzso late zzso zzso at 24 h lasting until zzso h after initial zzso Early zzso is more potent than delayed zzso in reducing zzso zzso Late zzso zzso zzso stunning and requires zzso zzso with de zzso protein zzso Early zzso depends on zzso zzso and to a lesser degree, on zzso and zzso released during zzso These molecules activate zzso zzso initiate zzso of zzso channel and generate zzso zzso and stimulate a series of protein zzso which include protein zzso C, zzso zzso and members of zzso zzso zzso Late zzso is triggered by a similar sequence of events, but in addition essentially depends on newly zzso zzso which comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly heat shock zzso The final mechanism of PC is still not very zzso The present review focuses on the possible role signaling molecules that regulate zzso life and death during zzso and zzso
