Our recent study has shown that zzso c zzso binding protein zzso the zzso zzso of zzso complex III, plays a crucial role in zzso zzso via zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Here we report a new synthetic small zzso targeting the zzso oxygen sensor zzso that was identified by zzso virtual screening and in zzso and in zzso competition binding zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso pocket of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells without zzso Furthermore, the binding of zzso to zzso suppressed zzso zzso hypoxic signal zzso These results demonstrated that zzso is a novel synthetic small zzso targeting zzso and exhibits zzso activity by modulating the zzso function of zzso
