Despite recent advances in the identification of the zzso profiles of zzso a significant group of tumors still show normal zzso or few zzso zzso The authors analyzed the zzso profile of 50 zzso using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results confirm that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deleted zzso zzso and zzso are the most frequent zzso Additionally, zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed, while copy number patterns consistent with zzso zzso gains, gene amplification, and copy number neutral loss of zzso zzso were either absent or zzso Based on their overall zzso profiles, zzso could be classified zzso zzso zzso cases, zzso zzso with a single zzso change zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors with zzso altered zzso In zzso our results confirm and extend on previous observations showing that the most zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso to zzso losses localized in zzso 1, 22 and less frequently in zzso 6, 7, 14, and 19, while zzso gains and zzso are restricted to a small proportion of zzso Finally, a set of zzso candidate genes associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways was identified, in cases with zzso zzso 14 and zzso
