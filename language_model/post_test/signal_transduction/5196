zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays a variety of cellular functions mainly through the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso and zzso by the type I zzso zzso is a key step for their zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) can mediate zzso signaling in zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso restricts zzso zzso zzso and zzso responsiveness in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso manner and blocks their zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso which is adjacent to the zzso loop that contributes to the zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso with zzso acid zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by attenuating the zzso interaction and thus zzso zzso
