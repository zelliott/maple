A dynamic balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation paces generation of zzso progeny during normal development and maintenance of zzso Recent studies show that zzso plays a key role in regulating the identity of zzso stem cells, which generate terminally differentiated zzso that populate the adult zzso lobe via the intermediate zzso cell type called zzso Thus, understanding how zzso controls zzso cell maintenance and zzso formation will provide critical insight into the intricate regulation of stem cell function during tissue zzso Here, we showed that a low level of zzso signaling functions to maintain the zzso cell identity by suppressing the expression of zzso gene through the zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso which zzso with transient cell cycle arrest but precedes the expression of zzso in cells near the zzso edge of zzso defines transitioning zzso cells that are in the process of acquiring the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in transitioning zzso cells decreases their sensitivity to zzso and prevents them from becoming converted into zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling combined with a high level of zzso trigger a zzso conversion from transitioning zzso cells to immature zzso at the zzso edge of zzso Thus, changes in zzso signaling orchestrate a dynamic balance between maintenance and conversion of zzso cells during zzso lobe zzso
