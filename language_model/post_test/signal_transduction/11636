The role of zzso zzso in the evenly spaced bristle pattern of zzso is zzso zzso of zzso results in development of an excess of zzso zzso of alternately spaced bristle precursors and zzso cells from a group of zzso cells relies on lateral zzso zzso by zzso and Delta zzso In this process, zzso bristle precursors inhibit the neural fate of zzso cells, causing them to adopt the zzso zzso We show that zzso a zzso zzso for zzso can inhibit adjacent cells, in direct contact with the zzso in the absence of zzso In contrast, zzso of cells not adjacent to the precursor requires, in addition, zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso background, leads to increased spacing between zzso suggesting that the range of zzso has been zzso zzso acts zzso and we present evidence that, during bristle precursor zzso zzso is required to maintain the normal adhesive properties of zzso zzso The possible effects of such changes on the range of zzso are zzso We also show that the sensory organ precursors extend numerous fine zzso extensions bearing zzso zzso and speculate on a possible role for these structures during zzso
