The first mouse zzso zzso factor zzso ) zzso was discovered over 60 years ago, and since then over 24 spontaneous and induced zzso have been identified at the zzso zzso encodes a member of the zzso zzso family of basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso regulates gene expression by binding to DNA as a zzso or as a zzso with another related family member, in the case of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study of zzso has provided many insights into the biology of zzso and helped to explain how zzso gene expression and signaling is zzso The human zzso of zzso is zzso in patients with the zzso and deafness disorder zzso zzso Type 2A zzso The mouse zzso zzso therefore serve as a model for the study of this human zzso zzso and/or zzso expression of several zzso family member genes have also been reported in human cancer, including melanoma zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso soft part zzso zzso Genes in the zzso zzso may therefore also represent valuable therapeutic targets for the treatment of human zzso Here we review recent developments in the analysis of zzso function in zzso and in zzso and show how traditional zzso modern forward zzso and in zzso zzso analyses have combined to produce an intriguing story on the role and actions of a gene family in a living zzso
