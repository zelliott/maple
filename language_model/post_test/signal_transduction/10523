zzso zzso growth factor zzso which is expressed in the zzso during normal pregnancy, is down regulated in zzso a human pregnancy disorder associated with poor zzso differentiation and zzso This growth factor protects against zzso during stress, suggesting a role in zzso survival in the relatively low zzso ( approximately zzso environment of the first zzso zzso Using a zzso human first zzso zzso cell line, we found that a zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso independently of an increase in its zzso Five other expressed members of the zzso family are largely zzso At zzso zzso signaling via zzso or zzso known zzso zzso is required for both zzso zzso and protection against zzso This zzso loop is dependent on zzso zzso and shedding of the zzso zzso The restoration of zzso survival by the addition of soluble zzso in cultures exposed to low zzso and zzso inhibitor suggests that the effects of zzso are zzso by zzso rather than zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that a zzso mechanism induced in zzso by low zzso rapidly zzso zzso signaling to inhibit zzso These findings have a high clinical significance, as the zzso of zzso in zzso is likely to be a contributing factor leading to the demise of zzso
