zzso proteins are zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and play a pivotal role in many aspects of cellular zzso zzso cell surface receptors to various zzso zzso In zzso there are three family members; zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso system, whereas zzso and zzso are more zzso zzso zzso proteins contain multiple zzso that enable their function in various zzso The participation of the zzso proteins in several processes that require zzso zzso such as the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transformation will be discussed in this zzso We will also cover how the zzso proteins succeed in controlling these processes by their function as zzso zzso exchange factors zzso for the zzso family of zzso The contribution of the zzso proteins in a zzso manner to the organization of the zzso will also be zzso The scope of this review is to highlight the numerous roles of the zzso signal zzso proteins in zzso zzso
