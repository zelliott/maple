zzso synthesis zzso is an emerging field involving the synthesis of zzso libraries of diverse small molecules for biological zzso Rather than being directed toward a single biological target, zzso libraries can be used to identify new zzso for a variety of zzso Several different strategies for library design have been developed to target the biologically relevant regions of chemical structure zzso zzso has provided powerful zzso to investigate biological mechanisms and also served as a new driving force for advancing synthetic organic zzso
