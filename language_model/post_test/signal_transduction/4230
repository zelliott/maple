zzso zzso stage 0 F zzso a zzso protein responsible, in part, for regulating the transition of zzso zzso from a zzso state to a dormant zzso has been studied by high-resolution zzso The zzso zzso and zzso chemical shift assignments for the backbone zzso have been determined from analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for many zzso zzso zzso are also zzso The secondary structure, zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso constants, and hydrogen exchange patterns, define a zzso consistent with a doubly wound zzso zzso Interestingly, comparison of the secondary structure of zzso to the structure of the zzso coli response regulator, zzso Y protein zzso zzso K, zzso zzso 1991, J zzso zzso zzso zzso M et zzso 1993, zzso J zzso zzso show differences in the relative length of secondary structure elements that map onto a single face of the zzso structure of zzso This surface may define a region of binding specificity for response zzso zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso chemical shift changes, gives an equilibrium zzso constant of 20 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso most zzso by zzso binding are near the putative site of zzso zzso zzso
