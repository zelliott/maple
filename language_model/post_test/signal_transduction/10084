zzso a gene required for efficient mating of the zzso zzso zzso was characterized in this zzso The gene encodes a protein of 212 zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso is associated with a five- to zzso reduction in mating efficiency, mainly due to defects in nuclear migration and zzso at the zzso zzso However, prior to mating pair fusion, zzso formation is reduced by zzso with a zzso failure to form mating zzso zzso migration of the nucleus into the zzso tip is also delayed or fails to zzso In addition, we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso protein zzso fail to zzso properly to the zzso tip, suggesting that the nuclear migration zzso could be due to zzso zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso (as measured by zzso induction by zzso is not affected in zzso zzso and zzso is also normal in these zzso zzso is not induced by mating zzso In zzso growing cells, zzso is localized in the nucleus, and remains nuclear after exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso shows no evidence of the zzso processing typical of zzso and also zzso to the zzso Thus zzso is a novel zzso whose product plays a role in zzso formation and in nuclear migration in the zzso possibly by interacting with other zzso proteins that possess zzso association zzso zzso
