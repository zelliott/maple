Most sham feeding studies show that about three sham feeding tests are required for intake to reach zzso One study, however, using a dilute solution, reported maximum sham intake in the first sham feeding test, suggesting that the progressive rise in sham intake may be concentration zzso We tested this hypothesis with six groups of rats given five sham feeding tests each with one of six zzso of zzso condensed milk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It took three sham tests for intake to reach maximum with the three most concentrated solutions, but only one with the three zzso Thus the intake of concentrated solutions of milk is limited by two negative feedback signals, one derived from the zzso of fluid in the gastrointestinal zzso the other from a zzso signal that loses its effectiveness with sham feeding zzso In contrast, the intake of weak zzso is limited only by the zzso negative feedback signal because the zzso signal is zzso
