Despite the popularity of zzso zzso as a model system of zzso in zzso they do not carry all of the cellular functions of zzso in zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso rigidity on insulin signal zzso in zzso zzso On 250 Pa zzso gel zzso zzso laminated with a mixture of collagen type 1 and zzso whose rigidity matches that of zzso zzso expression of the insulin zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and their zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso was zzso whereas the expression of zzso was unaffected as zzso rigidity zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the plasma membrane was significantly enhanced in cells seeded on soft zzso These results suggest that adjusting the zzso rigidity to that of zzso tissue zzso insulin signaling in zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso recruitment to the plasma zzso
