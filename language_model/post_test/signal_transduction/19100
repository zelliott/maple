zzso zzso zzso zzso display potent cancer zzso activity, but also markedly stimulate zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso is well known to promote cell survival and zzso We examined the impact of zzso zzso on zzso activity of zzso using zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso was almost completely suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso However, suppression of zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, we previously showed that in response to zzso treatment zzso was predominantly zzso among zzso family members largely by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005; zzso zzso but neither zzso zzso nor forced expression of zzso altered the zzso activity of zzso In addition, zzso zzso which is considered as an zzso target gene and promotes cell zzso was markedly elevated in zzso zzso zzso neither zzso or zzso zzso nor forced zzso expression had a significant impact on zzso D1 induction by zzso indicating that zzso does not play an important role in zzso D1 induction by zzso In conclusion, despite the known role of zzso as a zzso of cell growth and zzso our data show that its zzso does not diminish the zzso activity of zzso and is not responsible for zzso D1 induction by zzso
