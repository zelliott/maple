Various zzso or growth zzso stimuli induce a rapid change in the association of terminal zzso zzso zzso with zzso It is generally believed that such zzso control hinges on the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid availability affects the translation of zzso zzso although the signaling zzso involved in this regulation is less well zzso To investigate both zzso and zzso zzso control of zzso zzso translation and the signaling pathways involved, zzso cells were subjected to serum and/or zzso acid deprivation and zzso Our results indicate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid deprivation had additive effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso The serum content of the medium specifically affected zzso zzso translation, whereas zzso acid availability affected both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling to zzso zzso involved only a zzso pathway, whereas zzso acid signaling depended on both zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso increased during zzso acid zzso but not following serum zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment suggests a novel connection between the zzso zzso and zzso initiation zzso zzso in zzso cells, which may not, however, be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
