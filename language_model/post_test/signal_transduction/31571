zzso zzso have been reported to be zzso in zzso Thus, we examined zzso zzso signaling relevant to zzso zzso zzso skin wounds were created on the backs of mice, and zzso in wound zzso zzso was zzso zzso closure and zzso in zzso zzso knockout mice zzso were significantly delayed compared with their zzso zzso mice, whereas those in zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso zzso zzso estimated with zzso zzso in zzso mice was significantly inhibited compared with that in zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso in wound zzso zzso in zzso mice was markedly less than that in zzso zzso zzso closure in zzso mice was delayed significantly by zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso zzso and wound closure were significantly suppressed in zzso bone zzso transplantation mice compared with those in zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso These were accompanied with the reductions in zzso of zzso cells in wound zzso zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in peripheral zzso These results indicate that the recruitment of zzso cells to wound zzso zzso is critical for surgical wound healing and zzso via zzso of zzso
