zzso motif containing 22 zzso a member of the zzso family, has been reported to activate the nuclear zzso B zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, but the detailed mechanisms governing this zzso remains zzso We investigated this mechanism in zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso could activate the zzso zzso and conversely, could inhibit the tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Further experiments showed that zzso could decrease the zzso of zzso and interact with and degrade transforming growth zzso activated zzso 1 binding protein 2 zzso and that these effects could be partially rescued by a zzso zzso domain deletion zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso of zzso may zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso by interacting with and degrading zzso
