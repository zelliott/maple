A limited number of zzso pathways are involved in the zzso of cell fate during the development of all zzso Several of these pathways were originally identified in zzso To clarify their roles, and possible zzso we have built a logical model for the nine key zzso pathways zzso used in zzso zzso In each case, we considered the associated zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso factors reported in the zzso zzso using the logical zzso software zzso the resulting models zzso zzso the main characteristics of each pathway, in wild type as well as in various zzso situations zzso zzso or zzso These models constitute zzso zzso that can be used to assemble comprehensive models of complex zzso zzso Moreover, these models of zzso pathways could serve as scaffolds for more complicated models of zzso zzso zzso Comprehensive model zzso and zzso files are provided for each of the nine considered zzso
