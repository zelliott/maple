zzso activity is controlled by changes in affinity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Little is known, however, about the effect of affinity maturation on zzso zzso and on the associated signaling zzso To study the effect of affinity maturation on zzso zzso we zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso with zzso to increase zzso affinity and monitored zzso of beta 1 and beta 3 zzso In zzso zzso beta 1 zzso were present in zzso zzso while alpha V beta 3 was detected in peripheral focal zzso zzso beta 1 and beta 3 zzso expressed high zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso promoted focal zzso and zzso stress fiber formation at the zzso surface of the cells, and strongly enhanced zzso zzso zzso and expression of beta 3 high zzso zzso at focal zzso zzso alpha V beta 3 zzso was blocked by a soluble zzso zzso by zzso and zzso two pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of active zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso enhanced zzso and zzso alpha V beta 3 zzso zzso increased zzso of protein zzso zzso a direct target of zzso zzso occurred upon zzso zzso zzso did not alter beta 1 zzso distribution or zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we conclude that zzso alpha V beta 3 zzso affinity maturation stimulates focal zzso and zzso stress fiber formation, and promotes recruitment of high affinity alpha V beta 3 to focal zzso zzso alpha V beta 3 zzso requires zzso signaling and is zzso regulate by zzso
