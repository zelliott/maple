zzso zzso is a leading cause of zzso bacterial zzso zzso Investigation of zzso is hampered by a lack of suitable zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso mice as well as conventional zzso animals are susceptible to zzso zzso infection and develop zzso immune zzso However, clinical symptoms of zzso zzso infection were rather subtle and did not reflect acute bloody zzso seen in human zzso 

In order to overcome these limitations we generated zzso zzso mice by zzso zzso treatment starting right after zzso The early treatment was essential to prevent these animals from chronic zzso Following oral infection zzso zzso zzso the gastrointestinal tract at high levels and induced acute zzso within 7 days as indicated by bloody zzso and pronounced zzso changes of the zzso zzso zzso was further characterized by increased numbers of zzso cells, regulatory zzso zzso and zzso as well as elevated zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the inflamed zzso The induction of zzso was specific for zzso zzso given that control animals infected with a zzso zzso coli strain did not display any signs of zzso Most zzso zzso zzso was ameliorated in mice lacking zzso or zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for induction and progression of zzso 

zzso zzso mice develop acute zzso following zzso zzso infection mimicking severe episodes of human zzso and are thus well suited to further dissect mechanisms underlying zzso infections in zzso
