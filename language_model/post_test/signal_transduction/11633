At the late zzso stage, the zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso undergo a zzso change that allows them to invade into the zzso zzso and make contact with the maternal zzso This step can be regulated in zzso by the availability of zzso zzso zzso cultured in defined medium lacking zzso acids cannot form zzso cell zzso on zzso an in zzso model of zzso but remain viable for up to 3 days in culture and will form zzso when transferred into complete zzso The zzso acid requirement is a zzso regulated zzso event that occurs during a zzso to zzso period at the early zzso zzso zzso acids affect spreading competence specifically by regulating the onset of zzso activity and not the onset of zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso blocks zzso acid stimulation of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso is required for the initiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of global protein translation with zzso also zzso zzso zzso signals, suggesting that zzso regulates the translation of proteins required for zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso activity has a zzso regulatory function in zzso differentiation that may serve to coordinate zzso and zzso at the time of zzso
