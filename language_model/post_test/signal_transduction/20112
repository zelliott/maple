Cellular responsiveness to many zzso is controlled by zzso of the zzso receptors that zzso their zzso zzso membrane trafficking of particular zzso receptors exhibits remarkable diversity and zzso determined largely by molecular sorting operations that guide receptors at trafficking zzso after zzso In this Review, we discuss recent progress in zzso mechanisms zzso the molecular sorting of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso There is emerging evidence that zzso trafficking of zzso zzso in addition to influencing longer-term cellular responsiveness under conditions of prolonged or repeated zzso may also affect the acute zzso zzso and pathological consequences of defined zzso trafficking events are only now being zzso but it is already apparent that zzso of zzso receptors has a significant impact on the actions of therapeutic zzso The present data also suggest, conversely, that mechanisms of zzso zzso and molecular sorting may themselves represent promising targets for therapeutic zzso
