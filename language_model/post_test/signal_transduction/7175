The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in Head and Neck zzso Cell Carcinoma zzso zzso positively with high-grade tumors and shortened patient zzso As such, Met may represent an important therapeutic zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the role of Met signaling for zzso growth and zzso zzso 

Using a zzso system for zzso zzso we knocked down Met in established zzso cell lines that express high levels of the zzso zzso The effect of Met zzso on in zzso zzso cell survival and migration was examined using western analysis, zzso and live cell zzso In zzso tumor growth, dissemination and mouse survival was assessed using an zzso tongue mouse model for zzso 

We show that Met zzso zzso impaired zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso reduced cell viability and zzso independent zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso on zzso zzso reduced in zzso tumor growth by increased cell zzso zzso caused reduced zzso of tumor dissemination to regional zzso zzso and zzso increased the survival of nude mice with zzso zzso 

Met signaling is important for zzso growth and zzso dissemination in zzso and that targeting Met may be an important strategy for zzso
