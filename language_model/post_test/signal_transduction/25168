zzso zzso both rapid and delayed effects on the cardiovascular zzso The early effects take place within minutes zzso changes in zzso zzso and are zzso through rapid zzso signaling zzso whereas the delayed effects zzso zzso or zzso zzso require hours to days to occur and require zzso effects with subsequent zzso of protein zzso To study the acute effects of zzso zzso treatment on vascular function, we have investigated the rapid (on the order of minutes) effects of zzso treatment on zzso signaling in human zzso cells zzso Our previous data have shown that zzso zzso rapid release of NO from and zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso also activates zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling within minutes in zzso We hypothesized that this effect might be zzso by zzso receptors zzso localized to the cell zzso Our data show that zzso forms of zzso also activate zzso zzso protein zzso as well as stimulate zzso production and NO zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks this zzso Using zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis, we demonstrate that zzso contain surface binding sites for zzso zzso by zzso zzso binding and equally with an zzso zzso zzso bands of 66 and 45 zzso are zzso with an zzso zzso in human zzso and their individual presence zzso functionally with zzso zzso and rapid zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso may provide key molecular switches in these novel, rapid signaling pathways induced by zzso in zzso
