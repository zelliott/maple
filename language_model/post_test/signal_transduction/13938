The use of oxygen in acute treatment of zzso term newborns is associated with increased zzso It is unclear how zzso zzso after zzso affects zzso changes in the newborn zzso 

On zzso day 7, zzso mice zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso of inspired oxygen zzso zzso or zzso The zzso group was further zzso to zzso for zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and the zzso group to zzso zzso or zzso zzso profiling was performed on zzso lung tissue using the zzso zzso expression zzso and validation was carried out by real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso model induced zzso factor 1 zzso targets like zzso zzso and zzso In total, zzso of the significantly zzso expressed genes were detected in the two high zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso oxygen after zzso uniquely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified zzso target of zzso zzso signaling pathway, DNA repair, zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation, and cell cycle after zzso zzso was zzso 

Acute zzso zzso zzso targets independent of the zzso regime zzso zzso zzso affects pathways regulating cell growth and zzso zzso genes are restricted to zzso with zzso zzso
