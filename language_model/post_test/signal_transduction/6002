zzso acid binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that binds zzso fatty acids zzso It is believed that zzso is present in normal cells and disappears in cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso cells lack expression of zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso blocked growth of zzso cells suggesting its role as a tumor zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso cells underwent zzso when induced to zzso zzso using an zzso expression zzso zzso cell cultures in complete medium exhibited a maximum of approximately zzso of zzso cells after 96 h of exposure to an zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the possible mechanisms leading to the observed zzso effect may be due, in part, to an zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and a moderate zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was not altered in these cells, suggesting that zzso may cause zzso by inducing zzso of essential zzso growth factors and/or zzso of zzso zzso
