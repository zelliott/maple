To investigate the effect of zzso with zzso on liver zzso and zzso signal zzso in rats after zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso 

A total of 120 normal male zzso rats weighing zzso g were zzso into 3 groups zzso namely simple partial zzso zzso group, partial zzso with zzso zzso group, and zzso zzso All the rats received zzso of the left and middle liver zzso In zzso group, the remnant right zzso were subjected to blood flow zzso for 30 zzso in zzso group, the rats were given 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso prior to the zzso and in zzso group, the blood flow was not zzso At 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 after the zzso the remnant liver zzso were examined for zzso liver weight, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso liver weight and zzso zzso rates were significantly higher in zzso group than in zzso group at 24 h and 48 h after the zzso zzso In zzso group, the levels of zzso and zzso were significantly lower, and zzso level and the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso D1 and zzso proteins were significantly higher in zzso group than in zzso group at 24 h and 48 h zzso 

zzso can promote liver zzso after major zzso and zzso injury, and the effect is possibly related with zzso of zzso signal pathway, which promotes the synthesis of zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso
