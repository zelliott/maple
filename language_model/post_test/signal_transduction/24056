The zzso family of zzso factors constitute an zzso zzso zzso within the larger family known as winged zzso or zzso zzso zzso Building upon work in the zzso researchers have uncovered a role for these proteins in a diverse set of cellular responses that include zzso zzso stress response, cell cycle regulation, and zzso At the zzso level, zzso zzso factors are believed to function in various pathological processes ranging from cancer and diabetes to zzso zzso A number of studies have also shed light on the signaling pathways that regulate zzso activity in response to external stimuli and have identified multiple zzso target genes that mediate this varied set of biological zzso
