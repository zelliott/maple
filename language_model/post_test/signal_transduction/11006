Like zzso zzso bacteria stimulate their host cells to produce type I zzso zzso and zzso In our study, we investigated the signals and molecules relevant for the synthesis of and response to zzso by mouse zzso infected with zzso zzso We report that zzso is the critical zzso zzso made during infection, because the synthesis of all other type I zzso expression of a subset of zzso zzso and the biological response to type I zzso was lost upon zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso death, in turn, was absolutely dependent upon the presence of the zzso factor zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso zzso synthesis and signal zzso occurred in zzso deficient for zzso or their zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso a candidate zzso for zzso bacteria, increased during infection, but the protein was not required for zzso signal zzso to the zzso zzso Based on our data, we propose that zzso is a convergence point for signals derived from structurally unrelated zzso zzso and that zzso zzso stimulates a novel zzso and zzso zzso to target zzso and the type I zzso zzso
