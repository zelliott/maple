zzso sclerosis complex is a dominant genetic disorder produced by zzso in either of two tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso it is characterized by zzso tumors, and is associated with severe neurological and behavioral zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso a zzso growth control zzso that includes Ras zzso enriched in brain zzso and Target of zzso zzso To understand the function of this zzso in neural development, we have examined the contributions of multiple components of this zzso in both zzso junction assembly and zzso zzso guidance in zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso but not the muscle of the zzso zzso junction produced synaptic overgrowth and enhanced synaptic function, while reductions in zzso function compromised zzso zzso zzso growth produced by zzso is insensitive to zzso an inhibitor of zzso complex 1, and requires wishful thinking, a bone zzso protein zzso critical for functional zzso zzso In the visual system, loss of zzso in the developing zzso disrupted zzso guidance independently of cellular zzso zzso zzso complex 1 with zzso or eliminating the zzso complex 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso did not rescue zzso guidance abnormalities of zzso zzso while reductions in zzso function suppressed those zzso These findings show that zzso control of zzso guidance and zzso assembly occurs via zzso signaling mechanisms, and suggest that zzso complex 2, a regulator of zzso organization, is critical in these aspects of zzso zzso
