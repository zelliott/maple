zzso zzso and zzso premature zzso zzso cells are known to share certain zzso However, whether these cells are different at the protein level is zzso Thus, this study has zzso zzso to identify differences in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells compared to normal zzso zzso zzso was induced by serial passage of normal cells in zzso zzso was established by exposure to zzso zzso at a zzso concentration of 20 zzso for two zzso Following zzso protein profiles were compared and protein spots that changed in abundance were identified by zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso was then performed to evaluate the transcript expression of selected altered zzso A total of 24 and 10 proteins were found to have changed in abundance in zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively, when compared to young zzso zzso zzso revealed that nine genes showed the same direction of change as observed in the zzso zzso Very little overlap was observed between proteins that changed in zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that although both zzso and zzso zzso cells share hallmarks of cellular zzso they were different in terms of proteins that changed in zzso
