zzso signaling plays a key role in zzso zzso axis formation by inducing the anterior visceral zzso zzso the zzso signaling center that zzso anterior patterning in the zzso Here we provide direct evidence that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso through a zzso with the zzso signaling zzso We show that zzso zzso is directly zzso by zzso and fails to be maintained upon zzso of this zzso both in zzso and in zzso In turn, zzso strengthens the zzso signaling response by zzso the zzso zzso region and enhancing the level of zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that this zzso amplification loop is essential for correct zzso of the zzso in two ways: first, by showing that zzso zzso activity in zzso days zzso zzso cultures leads to a switch from zzso to an zzso visceral zzso cell identity, and second, by demonstrating that genetically reducing zzso activity in a zzso background leads to a failure of zzso zzso in zzso zzso our results reveal a novel role for zzso in regulating the threshold of zzso signaling and propose a new mechanism by which zzso axis development can be reinforced during early zzso
