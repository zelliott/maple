zzso stimulation leads to the zzso of various signal zzso pathways in cells, and the zzso signals are integrated into the serum response factor zzso zzso of zzso genes such as zzso 

To further characterize this response, we investigated the mechanism which controls serum response zzso in cultured human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso bodies zzso formation increases shortly after serum zzso probably zzso the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activities upon addition of serum to cells or expression of zzso active zzso family zzso We mapped the region in the zzso that interacts with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso deleted of the zzso domain neither zzso with zzso in zzso nor fulfills its zzso zzso Under conditions of serum zzso the formation of zzso zzso with the zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data provide an insight into the involvement of zzso in modulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
