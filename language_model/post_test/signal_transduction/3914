Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso D (10 zzso 1 h at 37 degrees zzso disrupted the zzso zzso and changed the cells from a zzso extended zzso to a rounded zzso zzso zzso by zzso or by zzso growth factor was zzso while the ability of zzso (2 zzso to empty calcium stores and activate calcium influx was zzso Similar experiments with zzso to zzso the zzso network yielded identical zzso zzso growth factor induced an increase in zzso zzso and this increase was undiminished in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the blockade of zzso responses by this drug does not result from decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso released calcium to the same extent in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic studies revealed a significant zzso of the zzso zzso after zzso D zzso Thus, disruption of the zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso but this effect does not result from a lower calcium storage capacity, impaired function of the zzso zzso or diminished zzso C zzso We suggest that zzso disruption alters the spatial relationship between zzso C and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso calcium entry was not altered under these conditions, indicating that the zzso between depletion of zzso calcium stores and calcium entry does not depend on a precise structural relationship between zzso stores and plasma membrane calcium zzso
