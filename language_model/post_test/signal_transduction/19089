At the zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso composition lead to zzso feedback and zzso zzso zzso entry of sodium zzso in both zzso zzso and cortical thick ascending limb zzso cells occurs via zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso entry of sodium zzso leads to changes in cell volume, although there are conflicting data regarding the directional change in zzso zzso cell volume with increases in zzso sodium zzso zzso To further assess volume changes in zzso zzso cells, zzso preparations were isolated and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso cells were loaded with fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell volume was determined with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso sodium zzso concentration from 0 to 80 zzso at constant zzso led to cell swelling in zzso zzso and zzso cells, an effect that was blocked by zzso application of zzso However, increases in zzso sodium zzso concentration from 0 to 80 zzso with zzso increases in zzso caused sustained decreases in zzso zzso cell volume but transient increases in zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso also resulted in zzso zzso cell zzso These studies suggest that, under zzso relevant conditions of concurrent increases in zzso sodium zzso concentration and zzso there is zzso zzso cell zzso which may play a role in the zzso zzso cell signaling zzso
