zzso is a human zzso zzso that causes chronic zzso leukemia zzso The zzso zzso is generated from the Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso zzso and creates a zzso active zzso zzso There is zzso expansion of zzso stem cells of several different lineages in zzso zzso patients in stable phase usually have high white blood counts and immature cells of zzso zzso zzso phase zzso zzso to a more aggressive phase typically within zzso years, where differentiation is blocked and acute leukemia zzso The transition of zzso stable phase to blast phase is reflected in the loss of growth factor requirement of zzso cells and zzso with additional zzso zzso Some biological effects reported in primary zzso cells include reduced zzso and altered zzso to zzso however, the cells are dependent on zzso growth zzso On a molecular level, the zzso zzso is well zzso However, the actual mechanism of transformation by the zzso zzso of zzso cells is largely zzso Enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso appears to be crucial for zzso This zzso zzso activity leads to zzso of several signal zzso pathways that are also zzso by zzso growth factors, including steel factor, zzso zzso and zzso stimulating zzso In several model systems, zzso has overlapping biological effects with zzso growth factors, and transformation of zzso growth zzso cell lines leads to growth factor zzso In this review, we will describe the molecular and biological abnormalities in zzso and several signal zzso mechanisms zzso by zzso as compared to zzso growth zzso
