zzso trafficking of zzso zzso represents a fundamental process that controls the architecture of different zzso compartments and communication between the cell and its zzso Major trafficking pathways consist of an inward flux of zzso zzso from the plasma membrane and an outward flux of zzso zzso to the plasma zzso This overview describes a number of molecular biology tools commonly used to analyze zzso and zzso zzso The overall emphasis is on major proteins responsible for zzso formation, recognition, and zzso These include components of zzso zzso zzso complexes, zzso zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which represent attractive targets for genetic manipulation aimed at unraveling mechanisms of zzso and zzso
