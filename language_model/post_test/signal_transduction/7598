zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein involved in the negative regulation of the zzso zzso factor, which is a key player in inflammatory responses, immunity and zzso zzso recruits zzso to the zzso signaling proteins zzso and zzso leading to their zzso zzso and the disruption of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zinc fingers localized at its zzso function as novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso Here we present for the first time both the solution and crystal structures of two classical zzso zzso in tandem within the human zzso The relative orientation of the two zzso is slightly different in the X-ray structure with respect to the zzso structure, indicating some degree of zzso flexibility, which is rationalized by zzso relaxation zzso The observed degree of flexibility and stability between the two zzso zzso might have consequences on the recognition mechanism of interacting zzso
