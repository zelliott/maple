Rapid progress in zzso during the first part of the last century has shown that gastrointestinal zzso function is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, recent advances in chemical zzso especially in the last decade, have revealed that free zzso acids zzso among other zzso play a critical role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso modulating protein zzso metabolism and zzso zzso and supporting the integrity and defense of the zzso zzso Many of the mechanisms by which zzso elicit these functions in the zzso has been linked to the traditional concept of hormone release and nervous system zzso But most these effects are not zzso zzso appear to function by binding to a chemical communication system such as G zzso receptors zzso that activate signaling zzso These zzso signals, although their molecular bases are not completely zzso yet, are the ones responsible for the zzso activity and release of hormones that in turn regulate zzso zzso This review aims to describe the distribution of the known zzso from the class 3 zzso that bind to different kinds of zzso especially from the zzso cavity to the stomach, what kind of taste qualities they zzso such as zzso bitter or sweet, and their activity in the zzso zzso
