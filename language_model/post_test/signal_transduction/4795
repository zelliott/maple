This work was motivated by the incomplete characterization of the role of vascular zzso growth zzso zzso in the stressed heart in consideration of upcoming cancer treatment options challenging the natural zzso balance in the zzso We tested, if the zzso cancer therapy zzso zzso or the zzso therapy zzso alters viability and zzso signaling in primary cardiac zzso zzso cells zzso and adult rat zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and cultured in zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the left zzso and used in the second zzso zzso was measured by zzso and by zzso cellular zzso by high-resolution zzso zzso release was measured using a rat specific zzso zzso zzso were characterized by marker proteins including zzso von zzso factor, smooth muscle zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso led to a zzso reduction of cell zzso zzso treatment caused a significant reduction of complex I and zzso zzso in zzso and the loss of zzso membrane potential in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso release after zzso or zzso zzso zzso induced zzso stabilization and zzso at clinically relevant zzso of the cancer zzso zzso release was zzso by the zzso of the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso did not answer to zzso stress conditions by the release of zzso as observed in zzso zzso zzso 2 amounts were reduced by zzso and by zzso in a zzso manner in both zzso and zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that cancer therapy with zzso zzso zzso release and its cellular receptors in zzso and zzso and therefore alters zzso signaling in the zzso
