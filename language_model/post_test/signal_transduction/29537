We report here the identification and functional characterization of zzso a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors found in insects and zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso shares the structural organization of zzso zzso factors of class zzso It includes a zzso zzso domain as well as a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line activated the expression of a zzso reporter zzso whereas zzso with a zzso construct containing a zzso deletion of the TD or using a reporter gene with zzso zzso binding sites failed to activate zzso These results suggest that zzso is a functional member of the zzso family of zzso factors, making this the sixth structurally zzso component of the zzso zzso characterized in zzso zzso Based on zzso to other zzso zzso zzso the function of the oyster zzso may serve to regulate genes involved in innate defense and/or zzso These findings serve to highlight a potentially important regulatory zzso to the study of oyster zzso hence allowing comparison of the immune system in zzso and zzso an important key issue to understand its zzso
