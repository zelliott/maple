zzso evidence suggests that zzso recycling regulates cell zzso However, the lack of zzso to selectively target the trafficking of individual zzso as opposed to zzso transport as a whole, has made it difficult to define the contribution made by particular recycling pathways to directional cell zzso We show that zzso of protein zzso D1 zzso at zzso is necessary for its association with zzso zzso zzso of zzso or the use of zzso of zzso that do not bind to zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso recycling of zzso and this suppresses the persistence of zzso zzso However, we report that zzso recycling does not directly contribute to zzso migration by moving zzso to the cell front, but by zzso zzso recycling, which, in turn, influences the cell's decision to migrate with persistence or to move zzso
