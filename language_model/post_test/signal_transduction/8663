Network motifs are zzso interaction patterns, which are significantly more often encountered in biological interaction zzso than expected from random zzso Their existence raises questions concerning their emergence and functional zzso In this context, it has been shown that feed forward zzso zzso composed of three genes are capable of processing external signals by responding in a very specific, robust manner, either accelerating or delaying zzso Early studies suggested a zzso mapping between zzso and dynamics but such view has been repeatedly zzso The zzso function has been attributed to this specific zzso A general response analysis is difficult, because one is dealing with the zzso trajectory of a system towards a new regime in response to external zzso 

We have developed an zzso method that allows us to systematically explore the patterns and probabilities of the emergence for a specific zzso zzso The method is based on a rather simple, but powerful geometrical analysis of the system's zzso zzso by an appropriate zzso of the response zzso 

Our analysis allows to determine zzso the relationship between motif zzso and the set of potentially zzso zzso The distribution probability zzso are linked to the degree of specialization or flexibility of the given network zzso The implications for the emergence of different motif zzso in complex networks are zzso
