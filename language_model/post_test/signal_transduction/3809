The block of differentiation in zzso zzso can be overcome by treatment with a variety of agents including zzso zzso 6 zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso induce zzso differentiation and growth arrest through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of various other zzso zzso lines with zzso or zzso did not lead to induction of zzso Several defects in the zzso triggered zzso signal zzso were striking in these zzso They expressed a decreased or zzso amount of at least one of the components of the specific zzso zzso zzso Three lines contained a zzso activated zzso signal cascade and in two of them, lines C and zzso this cascade was zzso by treatment with zzso despite of a very low density of zzso Apart from the zzso zzso additional components of the zzso signal cascade were altered in these zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were markedly decreased compared to zzso cells, suggesting a role of activated zzso in the induction of zzso These results demonstrate a direct correlation between zzso in the zzso signal zzso and the inability to differentiate after zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso
