The molecular interactions leading to zzso controlled zzso zzso degradation are of central importance during growth, development and tissue repair, and when zzso contribute to disease processes including cancer cell zzso There are two major pathways for collagen zzso one dependent on zzso and zzso zzso the other on zzso collagen zzso and zzso zzso Despite the established importance of both zzso the functional interaction between them is largely zzso We demonstrate here, that the collagen zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso is a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show close correlation between zzso zzso collagen zzso and regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We directly zzso using collagen zzso studies and zzso zzso of zzso that the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is the ability of zzso to bind and/or zzso zzso rather than by acting as an interaction partner for zzso and its zzso zzso These studies strongly support a functional interaction between two distinct collagen degradation zzso define a novel mechanism regulating zzso activity and might have important implications for zzso collagen clearance in the zzso zzso
