zzso zzso gene I zzso is a zzso zzso that recognizes viral zzso and activates the zzso innate zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of signal zzso at the zzso level, we zzso zzso and zzso human zzso containing the two zzso zzso and recruitment zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso is a functional protein that interacts with zzso zzso with substantially higher affinity as compared with zzso zzso structures unless they contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso which at the cellular level translates into a zzso increase of zzso zzso In contrast, the isolated zzso domain is zzso activated while also retaining its zzso zzso binding zzso These results support the recent model by which zzso signaling is zzso in the absence of zzso by zzso interactions between the zzso and the C zzso Based on pH profile and metal zzso dependence experiments, we propose that the active site of zzso cannot efficiently accommodate zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results show a direct correlation between zzso binding and zzso zzso function leading to signal zzso and suggest that a tight control of zzso activity by the zzso prevents zzso signaling in the absence of viral zzso
