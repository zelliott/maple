zzso binding of zzso zzso receptors and zzso receptors results in rapid zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso zzso such as zzso associates with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso via zzso and zzso domain binding with their zzso zzso More recent studies have shown that the zzso product zzso zzso with zzso following engagement of zzso and zzso zzso As opposed to in zzso zzso studies, the zzso zzso screen reveals in zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso screen, we demonstrate an in zzso association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not interact with zzso in the zzso zzso screen, as would be predicted from zzso zzso fusion protein pull-down or zzso studies from whole cell zzso However, the zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso When zzso were transformed with zzso zzso an interaction between zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso From the data, we propose the following three step process of zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes of zzso and zzso exist without zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Lyn becomes active and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso site for the zzso zzso of zzso - thereby stabilizing the complex and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso system can be used to dissect the precise mechanisms of in zzso zzso zzso including those between zzso and zzso zzso
