We investigated the effects of zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in combination in a panel of human colon zzso cell lines that differ in their zzso and mismatch repair zzso Analysis of zzso after combined treatment revealed additive effects of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and antagonism in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated antagonism in zzso an additive effect in zzso and zzso in zzso 116 and zzso cell zzso Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully blocked by zzso in zzso and zzso cells, whereas in zzso 116 and zzso cells it was inhibited only zzso The zzso of zzso was also more pronounced in zzso and zzso 116 cell zzso These data suggested that a minimal level of zzso signaling through zzso was required for zzso with this zzso To test this hypothesis, we used the specific zzso inhibitor zzso when zzso was inhibited zzso in zzso 116 and zzso cells, they demonstrated increased survival in zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso of zzso zzso led to an increase of the zzso of the zzso combination in zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the synergistic interaction of this combination in colon cancer cell lines depends on the effect exerted by zzso on zzso signaling through zzso and associated pathways leading to cell zzso An implication of that finding is that quantitative effects of signaling zzso may be critical for their ability to reverse zzso zzso
