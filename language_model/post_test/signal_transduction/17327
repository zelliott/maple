zzso are an important part of the plasma membrane and implicated in a multitude of cellular zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in an zzso context and their potential influence on the activity of signaling zzso To shed light on these aspects we analyzed the consequences of changing zzso levels in zzso in the zzso wing zzso an zzso tissue in which the most fundamental signaling zzso including the zzso signaling pathway, are well zzso We found that zzso of zzso only zzso zzso gene zzso led to defects in the zzso trafficking of zzso One of the affected proteins is the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso although zzso protein levels were raised, signaling activity of the zzso zzso was zzso Recent work has zzso the central role of the zzso trafficking in the zzso of the zzso zzso Our results underscore this and support the view that zzso levels are crucial in orchestrating zzso zzso trafficking in zzso They further demonstrate that zzso levels can affect zzso zzso
