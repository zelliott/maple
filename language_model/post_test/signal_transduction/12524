The zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso expressed by human zzso exhibits zzso potential, driven by zzso zzso 6 and 7 alternative zzso leading to omission of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and several zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso promotes genetic instability by interacting with and exhibiting zzso activity at the zzso This function depends upon zzso zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso domain orientation, predominantly within structures that closely associate with the fully assembled zzso zzso intermediate compartment and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso which is regulated by zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso interaction with zzso paving the way for zzso recruitment to the zzso At the zzso zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso increases zzso interaction with polo zzso 4, and decreases zzso interaction with zzso the net results of which are zzso amplification and increased genetic zzso The data characterize zzso as a novel internal zzso zzso zzso unveiling an important alternative mechanism to zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso signaling through which zzso alternative zzso zzso influences the zzso zzso
