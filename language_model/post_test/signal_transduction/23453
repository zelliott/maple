zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a dominant, zzso grass that has extensive plasticity in adapting to various harsh zzso Based on data from zzso zzso sequencing zzso zzso exposure to salt stress, an unknown functional zzso gene zzso was identified from zzso zzso specific expression profiles showed that the zzso gene was expressed zzso in different zzso with higher expression levels observed in the zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was induced obviously by high salt, drought and zzso acid and was induced slightly by zzso A fusion protein of zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso was localized to the nucleus, and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was an zzso of zzso zzso zzso plants were more tolerant to salt stress than zzso zzso The amounts of zzso and soluble zzso were higher in transgenic zzso than in zzso plants under salt stress zzso The zzso of zzso enhanced the expression levels of zzso and inhibited other salt stress response gene zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso influences the intricate salt stress response signaling networks by promoting different pathways than the classical zzso and zzso signaling zzso Additionally, zzso is a promising gene resource for improving zzso tolerance in zzso
