zzso evidence suggests that the focal zzso targeting zzso domain, an zzso zzso zzso exists in alternative zzso that may zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso In order to characterize the zzso dynamics of the FAT domain, we have developed a novel method for reconstructing the folding zzso of the FAT domain by using discrete molecular dynamics zzso simulations, with free energy constraints derived from zzso hydrogen exchange zzso The zzso simulations detect a folding zzso in which a cooperative unfolding event causes zzso 1 to lose zzso character while separating from the zzso zzso The zzso dynamic features of zzso 1 in the intermediate state of the FAT domain are likely to facilitate zzso zzso yet interfere with zzso zzso The presence of this intermediate state in zzso may promote zzso signaling via the zzso zzso and by release of zzso from focal zzso
