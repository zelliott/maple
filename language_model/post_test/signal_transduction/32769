Here, we report the functional expression of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso from zzso precursor zzso primary tumors, and zzso revealed that zzso surface expression is zzso during tumor zzso zzso expression was confirmed in 7 human zzso cell lines established from zzso primary tumors or zzso whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were zzso zzso zzso expression could be enhanced in zzso zzso by stimulation with zzso and tumor necrosis zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso by zzso zzso zzso or by a soluble zzso fusion protein zzso their expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso class I and class II molecules and their zzso of zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor and also induced a rapid zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cell line enhanced its zzso to specific zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso induced growth zzso and zzso in zzso These results indicate that zzso interactions may play an important role in zzso zzso immunity and inducing zzso in some zzso zzso human zzso
