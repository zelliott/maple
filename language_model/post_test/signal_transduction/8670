zzso zzso the zzso agent of the devastating zzso disease zzso can form zzso on diverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation is important for the survival of this zzso both in its natural environment and in the human zzso Development of zzso zzso zzso are regulated by complex regulatory networks that respond to environmental zzso One of these signals, zzso is a zzso that enhances zzso formation via the zzso signaling zzso In this work, we have investigated the role of the zzso zzso in regulating zzso formation in zzso zzso We show that zzso import requires zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso protein of the zzso transport system in zzso zzso We also show that deletion of the zzso gene results in a significant increase in zzso zzso We zzso that zzso imported into the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further reduces zzso formation in a zzso but zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso affect zzso formation in zzso zzso via multiple pathways involving both transport and signaling zzso
