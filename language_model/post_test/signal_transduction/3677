We have demonstrated previously that zzso controls the zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that while only zzso and Yes were expressed and activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to exert a zzso effect on the scattering zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were required for zzso of cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso showing that Ras is another regulator of cell zzso zzso of zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation and zzso zzso three elements of the Ras zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso and zzso rescued the block induced by zzso but not by zzso showing that zzso zzso and Ras operate in separate zzso In addition, zzso D zzso of zzso synthesis zzso the ability of the activated zzso zzso but not that of zzso to induce zzso cell zzso Since zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso were abolished in zzso zzso cells, we concluded that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso may control zzso cell zzso in the absence of gene expression and by directly regulating the organization of the cortical zzso
