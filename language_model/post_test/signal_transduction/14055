Nutrition support for critically ill patients supplemented with additional modular protein may promote skeletal muscle protein zzso in addition to zzso acute nitrogen zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether the essential zzso acid zzso enriched zzso zzso nutrition zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso system and activates the zzso target of zzso zzso anabolic signaling zzso in a zzso shock zzso rat zzso 

Male zzso rats zzso zzso 90, zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly assigned to 5 groups: zzso normal control, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and standard zzso and zzso zzso and zzso enriched zzso zzso Six animals from each group were harvested on days 2, 4, and 6 for serum, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sample zzso zzso significantly reduced muscle zzso Nutrition support maintained muscle mass, especially the zzso enriched zzso zzso Meanwhile, a pronounced zzso in zzso axis as well as impaired zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso Compared with animals receiving standard zzso those receiving zzso enriched zzso zzso presented zzso higher serum free IGF-1 levels following 3 days of nutrition support and zzso higher after 5 zzso These changes were consistent with the zzso zzso in serum insulin and reduction in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of downstream anabolic signaling zzso - including protein zzso B, zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso - increased significantly in rats receiving zzso enriched zzso zzso 

Our findings zzso demonstrate the beneficial effect of zzso enriched zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of skeletal muscle protein zzso by regulating the IGF-1 system and downstream anabolic signaling zzso
