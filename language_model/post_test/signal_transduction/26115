zzso of zzso are found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and are enriched in tumors with more aggressive zzso We developed mice with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to explore the role of zzso expression of this zzso on tumor initiation and zzso In contrast to other zzso mouse models of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso of zzso zzso mostly benign zzso zzso zzso become transformed and progress to invasive zzso with a very short zzso a process that is dampened by treatment with an zzso zzso zzso These mice also become profoundly zzso due to deregulation of genes involved in zzso hormone zzso and consequently have high zzso zzso To determine whether zzso signaling zzso with zzso zzso in this process, we first crossed zzso with zzso knockout zzso Although zzso zzso was appropriately activated in zzso zzso cells of these mice, they had a lower zzso index and were not zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene in zzso mice also resulted in an attenuated cancer zzso indicating that the cooperation of zzso with zzso zzso is zzso in part by zzso zzso Once tumors were established in mice with zzso zzso suppression of zzso did not zzso the zzso These data demonstrate the key role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso cancer initiation and provide experimental support for recent observations in humans pointing to a strong association between zzso levels and zzso cancer zzso
