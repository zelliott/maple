It has been known that ethanol causes zzso cell death through zzso zzso Ethanol itself and zzso oxygen species zzso produced by ethanol zzso zzso signaling pathways including zzso protein zzso zzso zzso This study was conducted to examine the impact of ethanol on zzso signaling in zzso zzso Ethanol zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurred in early time and zzso zzso zzso was evident when zzso zzso was zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso protected zzso cells against ethanol, which was accompanied by an zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no effects on zzso zzso cell death when they are treated with ethanol for zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may have important roles in zzso zzso during zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso
