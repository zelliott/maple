T helper type 2 zzso cells are critical to host zzso against zzso infection and the zzso of allergic zzso The differentiation of zzso cells from zzso zzso T cells is controlled by intricate zzso zzso At the precursor stage of zzso zzso T cells, zzso mechanisms maintain the potential and in the zzso prevent spontaneous differentiation to zzso zzso In addition, zzso interactions important for zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso T zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso engagement, zzso zzso T cells are induced by polarizing signals of the zzso and zzso pathways to zzso the expression of zzso Once zzso zzso drives zzso and suppresses zzso differentiation in a cell autonomous zzso In this stage of zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modifications that contribute to the zzso memory of zzso zzso gene expression zzso Once zzso zzso zzso cells promptly produce zzso zzso upon zzso zzso which is regulated by concerted actions of zzso zzso zzso enhancers and the zzso locus control zzso This review provides a detailed account of the zzso regulatory events at these different stages of zzso zzso
