zzso element binding factors zzso proteins are zzso zzso factors, many of which have been linked to stress zzso We have identified four zzso zzso genes whose expression was specifically induced by zzso and virulent strains of the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso tomato, with overlapping but distinct induction zzso However, a delay in zzso zzso zzso after infection with the virulent strain was observed when compared with the zzso zzso The induction of zzso gene expression in most cases preceded the zzso zzso of a basic zzso zzso a potential downstream target for one or more of these zzso The expression of the zzso genes was examined among different zzso zzso in response to the signaling molecules zzso zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso and in zzso zzso with decreased or enhanced zzso to zzso and significant differences were zzso For example, in zzso some of the zzso genes were not induced by zzso in the zzso but were zzso responsive in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso which acts upstream of zzso zzso is also involved in zzso the zzso expression of specific zzso zzso The four zzso proteins were shown to contain zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso involving zzso proteins may be important for plant defense to pathogen attack and that some zzso family members could be involved in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
