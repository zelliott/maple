We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso in some zzso zzso cell zzso We investigated a potential protective role for zzso in zzso induced by zzso in two zzso cell lines, one zzso and one zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso cells treated with zzso exhibited classical features of zzso 6 h after drug exposure, all the cells being dead after zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso significantly delayed, but did not prevent the occurrence of zzso zzso with no surviving cells 96 h after drug zzso To zzso the mechanism of the protection zzso by zzso we explored the signaling zzso which zzso zzso zzso In this report, we show that, in both the zzso and zzso parental cell lines, zzso triggered a zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso induced DNA fragmentation in these cells, with levels similar to those observed with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso protected the cells against zzso induced by zzso treatment, without preventing the early zzso zzso nor the zzso generation in these zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso protection of zzso zzso is zzso downstream of the zzso signaling zzso
