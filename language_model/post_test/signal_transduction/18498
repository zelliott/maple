We recently reported that the zzso of zzso receptors zzso evoked zzso zzso currents zzso in nucleus zzso zzso indirectly through zzso acid zzso acting on zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we determined the second zzso system that couples zzso receptors to the observed synaptic zzso Using in zzso zzso slices of rats and zzso patch recording, we tested the hypothesis that zzso receptors are coupled to zzso and protein zzso A signaling zzso zzso induced inward currents and depressed evoked zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that is an inhibitor of zzso type IV, independently increased zzso zzso and blocked the inward current and synaptic depression induced by zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso A zzso also blocked zzso zzso However, depression of the evoked zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso was not blocked by zzso or zzso These findings indicate that zzso but not zzso receptors are coupled to the zzso zzso zzso A signaling zzso in the zzso to induce inward currents and cause synaptic zzso
