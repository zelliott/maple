In this paper we explore the possibility of improving, by genetic engineering, the resistance of zzso cells to the zzso and inflammatory stresses that are anticipated to limit their function and survival when zzso and transplanted in a type 1 diabetic zzso We show that transfer of the zzso zzso zzso and of genes specifically interfering with zzso zzso signaling zzso greatly improves resistance of the cells to zzso limitations and inflammatory zzso
