We aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of zzso zzso on free fatty acids zzso peripheral insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso rats were subjected to zzso intravenous infusion of either saline or zzso plus zzso zzso with or without different doses of zzso zzso zzso clamp was performed in awake rats to assess peripheral insulin zzso zzso with zzso significantly prevented zzso peripheral insulin resistance, decreased plasma markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment reversed zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso increase in protein zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso treatment ameliorated zzso peripheral insulin resistance in zzso and this might be through decreasing zzso stress and zzso membrane zzso zzso the zzso zzso and improving insulin signaling zzso in zzso This study suggests the therapeutic value of zzso in protecting from insulin resistance caused by elevated zzso
