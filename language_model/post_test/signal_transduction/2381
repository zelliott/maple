zzso muscle zzso zzso via the transport system zzso is subject to rapid zzso zzso approximately 1 zzso regulation after changes in cell volume by mechanisms that remain to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso prevents both zzso zzso stimulation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in primary culture of rat skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also abolished responses of zzso transport to cell volume changes whereas these responses were sustained in the presence of zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso transport does not seem to involve release of zzso factors because zzso medium from swollen cells has no effect on previously zzso zzso System A zzso acid transport exhibits responses to cell volume change that are opposite to those of system zzso but these are also blocked by zzso Active zzso zzso appears to be required to enable muscle cells to exhibit zzso zzso changes in zzso acid transport when suitably zzso
