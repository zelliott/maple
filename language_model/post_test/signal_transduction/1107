To further investigate the role of the zzso cell zzso molecules zzso we have developed an in zzso zzso that allows us to test the contribution individual zzso make to promote outgrowth of specific zzso zzso The extension of primary cultured zzso on a zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso We show that both zzso and zzso are able to promote outgrowth of zzso or zzso expressing zzso zzso Furthermore, this growth promotion activity is provided when the zzso are presented both in a zzso bound or soluble zzso We also show that the signal provided by the zzso acts via the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso as outgrowth is reduced to zzso levels in the presence of an zzso inhibitor or if zzso function is missing from the zzso
