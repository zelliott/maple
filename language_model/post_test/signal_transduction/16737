Development of the eye depends partly on the zzso zzso derived from the neural crest zzso but the fate of NC cells in zzso eye development and the signals zzso the formation of zzso structures are poorly zzso 

Here we reveal distinct NC contributions to both anterior and zzso zzso eye structures and show that zzso signaling in these cells is crucial for normal eye zzso In the anterior eye, zzso released from the lens is required for the expression of zzso factors zzso and zzso in the zzso cornea and in the zzso structures of the eye that control zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso and zzso zzso expression in cell zzso As in patients carrying zzso in zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso in NC cells leads to zzso defects characteristic of the human disorder zzso zzso In the zzso eye, NC zzso zzso of zzso signaling results in a condition reminiscent of the human disorder persistent zzso primary zzso As a secondary effect, retinal patterning is also disturbed in zzso zzso 

In the developing eye the lens acts as a zzso signaling center that controls the development of eye structures derived from the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso interferes with zzso differentiation and survival anterior to the lens and with normal tissue zzso and patterning zzso to the zzso The similarity to zzso eye disorders in humans suggests that defective zzso signal zzso in zzso NC derivatives contributes to the zzso of these zzso
