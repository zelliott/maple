zzso zzso factors function as crucial regulators of inflammatory and immune responses as well as of cell zzso They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and zzso However, despite extensive zzso characterization of zzso zzso during the past zzso years, the requirement for zzso in zzso development in zzso particularly in solid zzso is not completely zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso is required for the development of zzso in a mouse model of lung zzso zzso loss of zzso (also known as zzso and expression of zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso in primary mouse embryonic zzso zzso in lung zzso cell lines expressing zzso and lacking zzso zzso restoration led to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso lung cancer cell zzso zzso of the zzso in lung zzso in zzso from the time of zzso initiation or after zzso zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso zzso Together, these results indicate a critical function for zzso zzso in lung zzso development and, further, that this requirement depends on zzso zzso These findings also provide support for the development of zzso zzso drugs as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined zzso in zzso and zzso
