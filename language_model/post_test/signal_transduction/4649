Although the zzso zzso zzso loading switch is a major regulatory mechanism that controls the activity of the zzso zzso zzso we report a distinct mechanism for regulating Ras activity through zzso degradation and describe the role of this second regulatory mechanism in the suppression of cellular transformation and tumors induced by Ras zzso We found that negative regulators of zzso signaling contributed to the zzso degradation of Ras after its zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent recruitment of zzso zzso We found a positive association between zzso and Ras stabilization resulting from the zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso from two mouse models of colon cancer, human zzso tumors from various zzso and colon zzso of patients with familial zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso plays an essential role in Ras degradation and that zzso of this degradation zzso by zzso zzso signaling may contribute to zzso transformation in zzso zzso
