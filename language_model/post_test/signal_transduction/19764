zzso is a citrus zzso that suppresses tumor growth and zzso both of which depend on zzso We recently identified zzso as a cell differentiation zzso Because cell differentiation is a critical event in zzso it might be possible that zzso could exhibit zzso activity, resulting in suppression of these tumor zzso zzso To verify this possibility, we examined the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso had zzso zzso effects on multiple functions of zzso zzso cells zzso it suppressed the zzso migration and tube formation on zzso of human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell growth supplement zzso a mixture of zzso and basic zzso growth factors zzso zzso zzso and northern zzso revealed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso PA zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso differentiation induced by vascular zzso growth factor and zzso an in zzso zzso zzso This zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso In a chick zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso showed an zzso activity, the zzso value being zzso zzso per zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso compound that exhibits its activity through combined zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso
