zzso zzso of low molecular weight zzso proteins zzso zzso that is concentrated bovine milk zzso active proteins zzso have been found to enhance bone formation in both in zzso and clinical studies, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso In this study, we found that zzso promoted zzso differentiation in normal human zzso and determined the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso zzso We observed that alkaline zzso activity and zzso were significantly induced by zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso was intensely elevated in zzso zzso indicating that the zzso events of differentiation were zzso We found that zzso activated the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses using the various signaling zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso
