zzso immunity to viral infection is initiated within the infected cells through the recognition of unique viral signatures by pattern recognition receptors zzso that mediate the induction of potent zzso factor, type I zzso zzso zzso with zzso viruses is recognized by the members of the zzso acid zzso gene I zzso zzso zzso family in the zzso Our recent study demonstrates that zzso production in response to zzso viral zzso is increased in the absence of zzso The process of zzso functions as an internal cleanup crew within the cell, shuttling damaged cellular zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso for zzso Our data show that the absence of zzso leads to the amplification of zzso signaling in two zzso First, in the absence of zzso zzso accumulate within the cell leading to the buildup of zzso associated zzso zzso a key signaling protein for zzso Second, damaged zzso that are not zzso in the absence of zzso provide a source of zzso oxygen species zzso which amplify zzso signaling in zzso knockout zzso Our study provides the first link between zzso and zzso signaling zzso by the zzso and suggests the importance of zzso in the regulation of signaling emanating from zzso
