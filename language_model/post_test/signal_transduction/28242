To investigate the interplay between the thin and thick filaments during calcium zzso in zzso muscle, we employed zzso zzso zzso as an inhibitor of zzso C and compared its effects with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In both skeletal and cardiac zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and tension over the full range of calcium zzso between zzso zzso and zzso resulting in reduced calcium sensitivity and zzso of zzso and tension zzso At zzso zzso in skeletal zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso M for zzso and zzso zzso M for tension, nearly zzso lower than zzso (20 zzso and 5-8 zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso were combined in skeletal zzso the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited lower apparent zzso and zzso and higher calcium sensitivity than expected from two independent zzso zzso suggesting that the interplay between the thin and thick filaments varies with the level of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso increased the zzso ratio during zzso in both muscle zzso zzso holds much promise as a potent and zzso inhibitor of thin zzso calcium zzso of skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso
