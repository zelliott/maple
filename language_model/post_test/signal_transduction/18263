Several lines of zzso evidence correlate the presence of energy zzso defects with the functional zzso associated with brain aging and with the zzso of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's zzso Within this context we tested the ability of insulin to regulate the zzso precursor protein zzso processing in zzso zzso zzso Our findings show that insulin promotes zzso metabolism by a zzso zzso We demonstrate a novel zzso zzso that increases the rate of zzso of soluble zzso through the activity of zzso 3 zzso zzso This pathway, downstream of insulin zzso zzso zzso activity, does not involve either the zzso of protein zzso C or the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Because of the zzso role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we speculate that zzso involvement in zzso metabolism may act at the level of zzso zzso
