Two zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso F box zzso and muscle zzso finger 1 zzso are crucial for zzso protein zzso The insulin like growth zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso expression through zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors, while zzso protein zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso The underlying cellular zzso however, remains zzso In this study, the effect of zzso and its interaction with IGF-1 on zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso were treated with 0, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of 50 zzso zzso IGF-1 activated zzso which enhanced zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and reduced the expression of zzso zzso though zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso was not zzso but strengthened by zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso and induced zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expression and reversed the zzso effect of IGF-1 on zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso zzso by zzso stimulates zzso expression despite the zzso of zzso zzso which may be due to the possible zzso effect of zzso zzso by zzso on zzso by zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso may provide an additional explanation for the enhancement of zzso expression by zzso
