The zzso zzso of zzso channels to discrete zzso is critical for proper electrical signaling in the cardiovascular zzso Ion channels are important components of many signal zzso zzso therefore, this zzso ensures that the channels are located in proximity to the signaling molecules that zzso them, permitting dynamic regulation of cardiovascular zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms governing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Whereas zzso interactions play an important role in zzso channel zzso the recent discovery of zzso channels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso presents a novel mechanism for zzso channel zzso Furthermore, many signaling proteins are localized to zzso zzso including several that play an important role in cardiovascular zzso This review focuses on the zzso of cardiovascular zzso channels to zzso zzso and its impact on channel zzso
