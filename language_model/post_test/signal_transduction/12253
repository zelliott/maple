B cell lineage acute zzso leukemia zzso arises in virtually all cases from B cell precursors that are arrested at zzso cell zzso zzso The Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso of ALL accounts for zzso of cases of adult zzso has the most zzso clinical outcome among all ALL zzso and is defined by the zzso zzso zzso and deletions of the zzso gene in zzso of zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso cell zzso functions as a tumor zzso upstream of zzso through induction of cell cycle arrest in zzso ALL zzso zzso cell zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso ALL cells critically depends on zzso function, and is reversed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also promotes tumor suppression through cooperation with downstream molecules of the zzso cell zzso signaling pathway, even if expression of the zzso cell zzso itself is zzso In this case, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling from zzso zzso to zzso which functions as a critical tumor zzso downstream of the zzso cell zzso These findings provide a rationale for the surprisingly high frequency of zzso deletions in zzso ALL and identify zzso cell cycle exit as the zzso of an emerging zzso of zzso cell zzso tumor zzso
