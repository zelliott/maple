The zzso shock protein zzso system found in zzso is induced in response to impaired inner membrane integrity (where the zzso response is thought to help maintain the zzso motive force of the zzso and is implicated in the zzso of pathogens such as zzso and zzso We provided evidence that the zzso zzso system was involved in induction of the zzso response in zzso coli and now report that role of zzso is zzso zzso predominantly through the action of zzso regulated zzso but also via a direct zzso interaction, is required to zzso the protein IV zzso zzso zzso during zzso but not during zzso or zzso We show that zzso directly interacts with the zzso possibly by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby allowing zzso between the two zzso In addition we demonstrate that the zzso induction of zzso expression in zzso is independent of zzso establishing that zzso and zzso can function as a minimal zzso system responsive to inner membrane zzso
