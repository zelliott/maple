zzso are zzso assembled into zzso territories zzso within the nucleus of living zzso Recent zzso have suggested associations between three-dimensional organization of zzso and the active gene clusters within neighboring zzso These gene clusters are part of signaling networks sharing similar zzso factor or other downstream zzso zzso zzso presence of such gene clusters of active signaling networks in a cell type may regulate the spatial organization of zzso in the zzso However, given the zzso nature of zzso positions and complex zzso factor networks zzso quantitative methods to establish their correlation is zzso In this paper, we use zzso positions and gene expression profiles in zzso zzso and describe methods to capture the correspondence between their spatial position and zzso In addition, zzso simulations designed to incorporate the interacting zzso reveal that the zzso positions are also zzso for the activity of these zzso These methods were validated for specific zzso pairs mapped in two distinct zzso states of zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our methods highlight the functional zzso between zzso of zzso and their respective gene expression zzso
