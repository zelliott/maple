zzso zzso are critical components of the zzso complex that mediates zzso of type I membrane proteins including the zzso precursor protein to generate the zzso zzso In addition, zzso interacts with zzso and zzso its zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso 353 and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a structural change of the zzso loop of zzso that can also be zzso by substitution of the zzso sites by zzso charged zzso acids in zzso and in cultured zzso The structural change of zzso reduces the interaction with zzso leading to decreased zzso and zzso of zzso The decreased interaction of zzso with zzso leads to stabilization of zzso thereby increasing its nuclear signaling and the zzso of target zzso including zzso zzso with increased expression of zzso a zzso zzso that mimics zzso zzso increased cell proliferation as compared with zzso zzso These results indicate a regulatory mechanism in which zzso zzso zzso a structural change of the zzso loop of zzso thereby zzso modulating the formation of a zzso complex between zzso zzso and zzso which leads to stabilization of zzso
