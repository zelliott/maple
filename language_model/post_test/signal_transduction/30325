zzso large zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive and the most common type of zzso zzso Despite recent advances in treatment, less than 50% of the patients are cured with current zzso zzso zzso zzso activity not only contributes to tumor development but also renders cancer cells resistant to zzso zzso zzso and targeting signaling molecules that control zzso zzso in cancer cells may thus yield more effective therapy for zzso Here, we show that while zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso signaling in zzso cells, suppression of zzso expression zzso zzso activity in these zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso induced by B zzso factor of tumor necrosis factor family zzso in zzso cells requires zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso zzso the survival of zzso cells in zzso and zzso tumor growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso expression also zzso zzso cells to treatment with zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso plays a pivotal role in the survival of human zzso cells and represents a potential target for zzso zzso
