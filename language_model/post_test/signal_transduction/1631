The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an important role in regulating smooth muscle zzso An increase in zzso zzso levels is a prerequisite for penile zzso zzso of zzso degradation by zzso specific zzso 5 has been used for treating zzso zzso In addition to degradation by zzso zzso is exported from cells by zzso resistance protein 5 zzso also called zzso which we recently identified as an zzso zzso dependent export pump for zzso zzso is zzso inhibited by substances known as zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso we analyzed whether zzso is expressed in zzso of the human zzso system and whether zzso and zzso 5 proteins are localized in the same cell zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso 5 was analyzed by zzso zzso in zzso of various zzso of the human zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso 5 were zzso in smooth muscle cells of the corpus zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso and zzso 5 were localized in zzso cells of the zzso in the zzso and zzso and in blood vessels of the zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso and zzso 5 in smooth muscle cells of the zzso system indicates 2 distinct pathways for zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso represents a new approach for enhancing zzso levels in smooth muscle cells and developing drugs for zzso zzso
