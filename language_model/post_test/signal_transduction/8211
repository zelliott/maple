zzso signal zzso zzso regulates cell cycle through a number of zzso second zzso which stimulate cell proliferation zzso initiate growth arrest or induce zzso zzso zzso To zzso the functioning of zzso zzso during liver zzso after partial zzso in rat zzso we measured the content of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of neutral zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the remnant liver zzso during the first zzso after zzso in zzso The activity of zzso zzso was highest at 4th hour after zzso whereas the activity of neutral zzso peaked at 12th hour after the zzso At these time points the activity zzso zzso was also zzso together with the content of zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso to zzso The activity of zzso zzso increased gradually from 4th to 24th hour after the zzso This was accompanied by significant increase in the content of zzso between 4th and 24th hour and reduction in the content of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso It is concluded that partial zzso zzso production of the zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso during the first zzso of liver zzso in zzso
