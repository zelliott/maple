Cellular interactions with zzso zzso play essential roles in tumor zzso progression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso identified as a key zzso of signaling by zzso a major family of cell surface receptors for zzso zzso as well as other receptors in both normal and cancer zzso zzso is activated by zzso through disruption of an zzso zzso interaction between its zzso domain and the zzso terminal zzso zzso The activated zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso family zzso which can zzso other zzso and trigger multiple zzso signaling pathways to regulate various cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso in focal zzso is essential for zzso zzso which is another distinguishing feature of the zzso zzso signaling has been shown to activate a number of signaling pathways through zzso and zzso interactions to promote zzso zzso also plays a prominent role in tumor progression and zzso through its regulation of both cancer cells and their zzso including cancer cell migration, invasion, zzso to zzso transition, and zzso More recently, a role for zzso in tumor initiation and progression has been demonstrated directly using zzso as well as conditional knockout mouse zzso In agreement with these experimental data, zzso and zzso of zzso have been found in a variety of human zzso A number of small zzso zzso for zzso have been developed and in various zzso of testing for cancer zzso Overall, the intensive research on zzso signaling in cancer have yielded a wealth of information on this pivotal zzso and these and future studies are leading to potentially novel therapies for zzso
