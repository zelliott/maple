zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is a versatile human zzso and zzso type 28 zzso is the most frequently isolated type from zzso zzso The zzso strain is associated with zzso zzso and zzso toxic shock zzso zzso regulation is one of the important regulatory mechanisms in zzso which controls gene expression at restricted zzso of zzso zzso a zzso regulatory system, is considered the regulator of zzso zzso zzso B zzso and is thought to be activated in the exponential phase of zzso In the present study, Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso of the analyzed zzso strains expressed zzso at the exponential phase, but zzso of the strains expressed zzso at the early stationary phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the early stationary phase showed better growth and earlier zzso expression than the other group of zzso zzso sequence typing and zzso gel zzso analysis showed only zzso strains (which comprise a zzso zzso were expressing zzso at the early stationary phase of growth, indicating that zzso strains have special characteristics which may be related to their worldwide zzso
