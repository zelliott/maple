In plants, zzso zzso is a major regulator of zzso zzso zzso by way of zzso mechanisms including transcript zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso organization, zzso and mode of action in plants are known, the regulatory mechanisms affecting zzso are poorly zzso We have shown that zzso functions as a zzso zzso for zzso expression in the context of zzso zzso zzso directly binds to a zzso site in the promoter of the zzso precursor and regulates zzso zzso In addition, zzso transcripts are induced under zzso zzso The zzso of zzso affects root system architecture zzso indicated by suppression of primary root growth and enhanced development of root zzso zzso and zzso are expressed and localized in the same zzso under zzso zzso This study establishes that zzso regulates zzso responses zzso by zzso of zzso transcript, suggesting that an analysis of this zzso promoter could reveal the existence and extent of zzso with other signaling zzso
