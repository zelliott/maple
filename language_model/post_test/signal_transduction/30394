zzso germ cell survival is dependent upon the formation of primordial zzso which occurs during fetal life in the zzso zzso contributes to germ cell proliferation and survival at this zzso zzso and 3 are central elements in the zzso zzso zzso and thus indicate sites of zzso zzso We have investigated the expression and zzso of zzso and 3 in the fetal zzso between 14 and 20 weeks zzso zzso preceding and during primordial zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso fold zzso zzso and 3 proteins were zzso by zzso to the zzso of three distinct populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells between clusters of germ zzso zzso some zzso cells zzso with zzso beta zzso germ zzso zzso zzso cells surrounding primordial zzso zzso cells did not express zzso or zzso zzso A increased and zzso decreased zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso It therefore appears that zzso cells are the targets for zzso zzso in the developing zzso The effects of zzso on germ cells are indirect and include mediation by the kit zzso pathway, rather than being an zzso germ cell zzso
