We found in our present study that zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso inner zzso collecting duct zzso zzso zzso of the promoter region required for the effect of zzso identified a positive regulatory element within zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso This region contained three putative zzso zzso binding sites found to be essential for zzso induction by zzso The effect of zzso was zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although there was no zzso site for T cell zzso zzso factor zzso in the zzso We found that zzso activated the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso via zzso in these cells, and the effect of zzso to induce zzso was amenable to the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso in both cellular zzso levels and zzso activities affected the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in a cooperative zzso In zzso our results show that zzso can induce zzso expression in zzso cells through both zzso and zzso pathways downstream of zzso zzso which act zzso on the zzso zzso binding elements in the promoter zzso
