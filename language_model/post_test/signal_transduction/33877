The zzso modification of proteins by the addition of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso modification in zzso zzso It is zzso by zzso zzso which zzso zzso to zzso zzso and it is zzso by zzso which is the zzso zzso that removes the zzso zzso zzso modification competes with zzso by protein zzso at similar sites, thereby affecting important zzso zzso zzso evidence supports a central role for zzso modifications and the corresponding zzso in the regulation of immune cells, particularly in the zzso processes of T and B zzso Here, we discuss recent advances in the field of zzso zzso focusing on the cells of the immune zzso
