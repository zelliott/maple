zzso protein zzso function in signal zzso pathways that are involved in controlling key cellular processes in many zzso A zzso member of this zzso family, zzso has been reported to link upstream zzso to downstream zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso This zzso protein zzso zzso has been implicated in the signal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in a variety of cell zzso Here, we report that two human tumor cell lines, derived from pancreatic zzso and lung zzso harbor zzso deletions that eliminate coding portions of the zzso locus at zzso located approximately 10 zzso zzso of zzso In addition, in a set of 88 human cancer cell lines zzso for loss of zzso we detected two nonsense and three zzso sequence zzso of zzso in cancer cell lines derived from human zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that, when zzso by zzso four of the five altered zzso proteins lacked the ability to zzso zzso protein zzso Thus, the zzso of coding zzso of zzso in the set of cell lines is 6 of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may function as a zzso of zzso or zzso in certain types of zzso
