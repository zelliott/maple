The present study was designed to explore the zzso production and zzso of the sulfur dioxide zzso zzso zzso in vascular zzso of rats and to examine its zzso effect on isolated zzso zzso well as the possible zzso 

The content of zzso in the samples was determined by using high performance liquid zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and its gene expression were measured by an zzso method and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso location in zzso was detected by in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on isolated zzso rings of the rats was investigated in zzso zzso calcium channel blocker, zzso and zzso calcium channel zzso Bay zzso were used to explore the mechanisms by which zzso relaxed the zzso zzso 

zzso had the highest zzso content among the vascular zzso tested zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso located in zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells beneath the zzso zzso a zzso dose of the zzso derivatives zzso relaxed isolated artery rings slightly, whereas higher doses zzso zzso relaxed rings in a zzso zzso zzso with zzso eliminated the zzso response of the zzso rings to zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso derivatives successfully prevented zzso induced by Bay zzso 

zzso zzso and its derivatives have a zzso function, the mechanisms of which might involve the zzso of the zzso calcium zzso
