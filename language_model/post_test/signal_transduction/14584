This review summarizes recent findings on the zzso or zzso actions of zzso that regulate the function of the normal and zzso zzso zzso This review focuses on three zzso the classic zzso zzso the membrane zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso that were initially cloned from zzso zzso and a zzso binding protein referred to as zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso Specifically, the structure of each of these receptors is compared and related to their capacity to activate various signal zzso zzso Then the biological effects of zzso on the function of zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso surface zzso cells, and zzso zzso that are derived from the zzso surface zzso cells are discussed in relationship to the expression of each of these zzso Whenever possible, studies involving human cells and zzso are zzso although data from other zzso species are used to supplement the human studies to provide a more complete picture of this complex and rapidly developing area of zzso actions of zzso
