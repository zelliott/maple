zzso analysis of connection between zzso their cellular function and zzso manifestations in disease is a central problem of biological and clinical zzso The solution to this problem requires the development of new approaches to link the rapidly growing zzso of zzso associations with the many complex and overlapping zzso of human zzso 

We analyze genetic skin disorders and suggest a manually designed set of elementary zzso whose combinations define diseases as points in a zzso space, providing a basis for zzso disease zzso zzso the known zzso associations in the context of this space reveals new patterns that suggest previously unknown functional links between zzso signaling pathways and disease zzso For example, analysis of zzso zzso vein zzso reveals a previously zzso interplay between the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso This interaction may mediate zzso regulation of zzso zzso providing a clue to the known association between zzso and diabetes and zzso new gene candidates for zzso analysis and drug zzso
