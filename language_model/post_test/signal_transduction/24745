In a previous study we demonstrated that a zzso zzso corresponding to the 60 zzso acid long zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was capable of crossing the plasma membrane of cells in zzso This finding has led us to investigate whether zzso molecules encompassing the zzso would behave in a similar zzso We demonstrate here that a zzso of 93 zzso acids composed of the zzso and of the C zzso of zzso a small zzso zzso crosses the membrane of zzso zzso and zzso and is conveyed to their zzso This transport is highly efficient, is observed in all the cells present in the culture and occurs at 37 degrees C and 12 degrees C without quantitative zzso zzso Beyond its theoretical implications for our current views on cellular zzso this finding could have technical repercussions on the development of drugs with zzso zzso
