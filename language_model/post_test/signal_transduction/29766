zzso cells contain a zzso zzso gene and differentiate into various lineages in response to different zzso We studied the role of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso A or zzso using genetically modified cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso A was markedly reduced in zzso cells compared with that in parental cells, while it was zzso in zzso zzso zzso A and zzso differentiated zzso cells accompanying with the transient zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso differentiation was markedly suppressed in zzso cells, and early zzso of zzso activity was not observed in these zzso In contrast, the induction of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Once the zzso was zzso the initial zzso activity became zzso and its early zzso by the zzso of zzso was marked and zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso A or zzso requires the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
