To understand the zzso of immature zzso which have not express T cell zzso zzso zzso we studied whether zzso has zzso zzso zzso zzso cells including zzso from zzso zzso and zzso mice and nude mouse zzso cells did not show zzso responses in the culture with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso cells from normal zzso or zzso did show a response to zzso Since zzso zzso is suggested to require zzso of the zzso complex, we compared the T cell zzso response in mature T cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Under the presence of zzso or zzso accessory zzso zzso T cells were cultured with zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso response of zzso T cells cultured with zzso much more than that with zzso zzso however, showed zzso effect on the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso T zzso These data suggest that signals triggered via zzso and zzso may provide a distinct zzso zzso for T cell zzso
