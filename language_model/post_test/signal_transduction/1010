zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the negative feedback regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso So far, it has been reported that zzso zzso the action of multiple zzso at least in zzso We previously showed that zzso suppresses tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso in zzso embryonic zzso but the mechanism of suppression was not fully zzso In this study, we show that zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso and are activated by zzso We also show that the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso are suppressed by zzso Furthermore, in zzso cell lines, DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso by zzso are zzso indicating that zzso participate in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso through regulation of zzso
