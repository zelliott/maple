zzso cells are essential for the development and function of the nervous zzso In the zzso brain, vast numbers of zzso of several different functional types are generated during late embryonic and early zzso zzso However, the molecular cues that instruct zzso and determine zzso cell type are poorly zzso During zzso development, the number of zzso in the zzso zzso brain increases dramatically, potentially providing a powerful model for understanding zzso Using zzso zzso analysis we find that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extensively through zzso cell division in the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis we find that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is required for the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso proliferation and acts zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso require zzso in part, but not downstream components of the zzso pathway, for zzso Moreover, zzso zzso absolutely require zzso zzso such that zzso of the zzso zzso almost completely blocks the generation of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for the generation of zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism zzso zzso zzso expression coordinates zzso and zzso zzso In zzso we have identified two major pathways that control zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso brain and have shown that the molecular zzso required is lineage zzso
