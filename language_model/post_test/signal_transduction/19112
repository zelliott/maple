We have shown that zzso an zzso signal zzso for transforming growth zzso zzso is required to elicit the full zzso manifestations of zzso airway disease in a zzso transplant zzso This suggests that chronic zzso rejection results in zzso zzso zzso that leads to airway obliteration through zzso and increased zzso zzso In other systems, these latter events are zzso related to the zzso of zzso into zzso but their role in zzso zzso zzso after lung transplantation is zzso We confirmed the presence of zzso inside affected airways associated with experimental zzso using zzso zzso airway zzso in zzso we observed increased zzso zzso in response to zzso evidenced by increased zzso muscle zzso zzso and protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso was greatly diminished but not zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso Further studies revealed that small zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso further reduced the remaining effect of zzso in zzso zzso Together, these studies suggest that in chronic zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso through zzso and zzso signals, contributing to the excessive zzso deposition that characterizes zzso zzso
