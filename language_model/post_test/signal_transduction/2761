zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso in the expression of zzso showing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso We have isolated five zzso genes which suppress the zzso zzso in multiple copies by genetic zzso Among them, one zzso designated as zzso also suppressed the zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso 111, zzso The zzso zzso is not zzso to zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene encodes zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which is another zzso gene for zzso and is known to be a positive factor for zzso zzso also suppressed the growth zzso of the zzso zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso genetically interact and the zzso and zzso genes are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
