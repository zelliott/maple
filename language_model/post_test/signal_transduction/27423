zzso is regulated by zzso zzso promoting zzso the active form of zzso B zzso zzso levels of zzso B abundance and the loss of zzso zzso from zzso drives cells into zzso whereas zzso B destruction zzso zzso and drives cells out of zzso zzso with defective zzso are arrested in zzso by the zzso checkpoint, which prevents the destruction of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso We have investigated the relationship between the zzso checkpoint, zzso destruction, zzso zzso of zzso and exit from zzso 

The previously characterized budding zzso mad zzso lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not arrest them in zzso because they cannot stabilize zzso zzso In contrast, a newly isolated zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein zzso 2A zzso regulatory zzso shows a different checkpoint zzso In the presence of a defective zzso these cells separate their sister zzso and leave zzso without inducing zzso B zzso Despite the persistence of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Two experiments show that this zzso is due to zzso zzso on zzso zzso accumulates on zzso in zzso delta cells whose zzso have been zzso and a zzso zzso that lacks zzso zzso sites on zzso allows zzso defects to arrest zzso zzso in zzso with active zzso and zzso sister zzso 

We conclude that zzso of protein zzso activity allow zzso to be zzso by zzso zzso instead of by zzso zzso Under these conditions, sister zzso separation appears to be regulated by zzso activity rather than by protein zzso We discuss the role of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso control, and the possibility that the novel zzso exit zzso plays a role in adaptation to prolonged zzso of the zzso zzso
