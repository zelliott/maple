In the brain, zzso of zzso zzso make close contact with zzso zzso cells that form the zzso zzso The aim of the present work was to investigate whether and how calcium signals can be communicated from zzso to zzso cells following acute mechanical cell zzso The experiments were performed on zzso zzso prepared from primary rat brain zzso and an zzso cell line zzso A single zzso was acutely damaged by mechanical stimulation of sufficient strength with a zzso and the resulting zzso calcium changes were monitored using zzso and digital calcium zzso Mechanical damage to a single zzso triggered a large zzso calcium wave that zzso to surrounding zzso and also to even remotely located (several hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium waves induced by mechanical cell damage were largely deflected by fast zzso were able to cross a zzso lane, were zzso inhibited by zzso a zzso blocker, and were largely reduced in size in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that mechanical damage to a single zzso can produce far reaching calcium signals that are zzso by the release of a calcium zzso zzso zzso and that can be communicated to zzso zzso As zzso zzso calcium is an important factor in the regulation of zzso barrier zzso and zzso mechanical cell zzso zzso calcium signals are hypothesized to play a role in the initiation of brain zzso and the stimulation of brain zzso zzso
