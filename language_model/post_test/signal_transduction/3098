zzso zzso zzso Factor 1 zzso has been implicated in zzso signaling by zzso Growth Factor beta zzso Paradoxically, zzso functions both as a zzso zzso or as an alternative zzso factor that promotes zzso zzso Using ordinary zzso models, we have investigated the effect of zzso on the dynamics of zzso zzso An zzso model that includes the formation of transient zzso zzso complexes is the only one that can account for zzso signaling compatible with the different observations reported for zzso In addition, our model predicts that varying zzso ratios play a critical role in the zzso of the zzso signal induced by zzso especially for short stimulation times that mediate higher threshold zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso of the expression of zzso target genes as a function zzso ratios fully validate this zzso Our zzso model, which successfully zzso the seemingly opposite roles of zzso also reveals how changing zzso ratios affect the cellular response to stimulation by zzso accounting for a highly graded determination of cell zzso
