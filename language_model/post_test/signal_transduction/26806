zzso is a fundamental process by which distant sites within a protein system sense each zzso zzso regulation is such an efficient mechanism that it is used to control protein activity in most biological zzso including signal zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso Over recent years, our view and understanding of the fundamental principles underlying zzso have been enriched and often utterly zzso This has been especially so for powerful techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance zzso which offers an atomic view of the intrinsic motions of zzso Here, I discuss recent results on the zzso zzso protein zzso that have drastically revised our view about how zzso interactions are zzso zzso has provided the first zzso identified system showing that zzso zzso can be zzso through changes in protein motions, in the absence of changes in the mean structure of the zzso and zzso favorable changes in protein motions may activate zzso proteins that are otherwise structurally zzso
