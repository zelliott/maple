zzso is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors originating from the zzso lineage of neural zzso The tumor shows extremely different clinical zzso such as spontaneous zzso on one hand and aggressive growth on the other zzso The different biological behavior of zzso appears to be determined by the genetic abnormalities including amplification of zzso zzso DNA zzso and some zzso zzso However, the spontaneous zzso of zzso mimics the programmed cell death normally occurring in developing sympathetic cells expressing both zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso expression is the most important factor related to the induction of tumor cell differentiation and/or programmed cell death because without its expression spontaneous zzso of zzso never zzso Thus, the enigmatic clinical behaviors of zzso are strictly linked to the molecular mechanism of neural crest zzso
