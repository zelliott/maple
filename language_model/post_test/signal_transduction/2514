Members of the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso family have an important role in zzso signal zzso as exemplified by the crucial role of zzso for zzso differentiation and zzso Although a variety of cell surface receptors have been found to activate zzso zzso zzso the specific signaling pathways and zzso molecules used by zzso zzso are still largely zzso In this study a zzso family zzso zzso was found to induce zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso and DNA binding activity of all the zzso factors tested, including zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso and insect zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reporter zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no or only weak ability to activate zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was found to induce zzso of zzso zzso proteins without zzso of zzso zzso zzso We further analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso which was found to be regulated by protein zzso C delta zzso zzso but not beta 1, zzso or zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies show that zzso a zzso family zzso can function as an zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and identify a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
