Plants and pathogens have continuously confronted each other during evolution in a battle for growth and zzso New advances in the field have provided fascinating insights into the mechanisms that have zzso to gain a competitive advantage in this zzso When plants encounter an invading zzso not only responses signaled by defense hormones are activated to restrict pathogen invasion, but also the zzso of additional hormone pathways is required to serve other purposes, which are equally important for plant survival, such as zzso of resources, control of cell death, regulation of water stress, and modification of plant zzso zzso pathogens can counteract both types of responses as a strategy to enhance zzso zzso regulate production and signaling responses of plant hormones during infection, and also produce zzso themselves to zzso plant zzso These results indicate that hormone signaling is a relevant component in zzso zzso and that the ability to dictate hormonal zzso is critical to the outcome of an zzso
