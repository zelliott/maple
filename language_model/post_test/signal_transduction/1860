The signal zzso zzso through which excess zzso zzso stimulates the larvae of many marine zzso to zzso is incompletely zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso plays important roles in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we asked whether blocking zzso receptors might prevent excess zzso zzso from stimulating metamorphosis in this zzso Surprisingly, the effects of the three putative zzso zzso tested (all at 10 zzso varied with exposure duration and the age of competent zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso known to have a number of other pharmacological effects, blocked the zzso action of excess zzso zzso during the initial zzso exposure periods in most zzso particularly for younger or smaller competent zzso However, zzso in the absence of excess zzso zzso also zzso zzso particularly over the next 18 zzso and worked faster on older competent larvae than on younger competent zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso had similar effects, blocking zzso metamorphosis in short-term zzso and stimulating metamorphosis in longer zzso particularly for older competent zzso Although the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso effects of excess zzso zzso in only 1 of 6 zzso during the first 6 h of exposure, it blocked metamorphosis in 2 of the zzso during zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso receptors are involved in the zzso through which excess zzso zzso stimulates metamorphosis in zzso zzso In addition, the largely zzso zzso effects of zzso an inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso suggest that zzso zzso oxide may play a natural role in zzso metamorphosis in this zzso Overall, our results would then suggest that exposing larvae of zzso zzso to excess zzso leads to a shutdown of zzso oxide synthesis via a zzso pathway, a zzso that can be blocked by some zzso zzso zzso zzso might eventually be stimulating metamorphosis by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso again acting downstream from the steps acted on directly by excess zzso
