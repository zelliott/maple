We have used an zzso strain of the soft rot pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso plant responses to this bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as tools to facilitate this zzso We show that zzso elicits zzso formation in zzso and tobacco and triggers systemic resistance in zzso zzso of resistance is accompanied by the expression of salicylic acid zzso but also zzso zzso marker genes zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting that both zzso and zzso defense pathways are zzso Use of zzso zzso and transgenic zzso plants show that both pathways are required for the induction of zzso zzso plants treated simultaneously with both zzso zzso known to trigger only zzso defense zzso and zzso react with accelerated and enhanced induction of the marker genes zzso and zzso both locally and zzso This mutual amplification of defense gene expression involves both zzso and zzso defense zzso The two zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso also cooperate in triggering increased production of zzso and zzso zzso
