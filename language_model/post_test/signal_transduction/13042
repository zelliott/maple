We have developed a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso called the zzso zzso which we constructed on the basis of the zzso site of the mouse type 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso sponge exhibited approximately zzso higher affinity for zzso than the parental zzso and specifically zzso with the zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso zzso with the zzso sponge inhibited zzso zzso release zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso sponge expressed in zzso cells also inhibited zzso in response to stimulation with zzso or zzso Its zzso effects were dependent upon the level of its expression over the increased zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso sponge significantly reduced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein in zzso cells, indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso may be partly attributable to zzso
