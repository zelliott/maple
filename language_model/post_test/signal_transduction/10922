The plant hormones zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso are involved in diverse plant zzso including the regulation of gene expression during zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso Previously, zzso has been implicated in enhancing disease zzso in various plant species, but currently very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso In this study, we obtained evidence that a complex interplay between zzso and zzso signaling pathways regulate plant defense gene expression and disease zzso First, we showed that zzso zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso from defense zzso By contrast, zzso zzso as zzso by the zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and induced zzso from zzso responsive defense zzso Second, we found that disruption of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, which is a positive regulator of zzso zzso results in elevated levels of zzso and activated zzso from zzso responsive defense zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso zzso showed increased resistance to the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso Finally, using zzso and zzso signaling zzso we showed that interaction between zzso and zzso signaling is mutually zzso in zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that the zzso interactions between multiple components of zzso and the zzso signaling pathways zzso defense and stress responsive gene expression in response to zzso and zzso zzso
