zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family and has been shown to play an essential role in zzso zzso zzso zzso We recently generated zzso zzso zzso mice to examine the role of zzso activity of zzso in zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso mice were completely resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso due to impaired zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso activity did not affect the levels of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso a reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso stability contributed to the reduced zzso and zzso production in bone zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso type I zzso production was abolished in zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso In addition, influenza zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso was also dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso zzso activity plays a critical role in zzso immune zzso
