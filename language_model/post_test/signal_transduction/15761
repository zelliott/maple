zzso are characterized by an zzso zzso (AP) body zzso This particular shape arises during zzso by zzso events leading to zzso Although zzso mechanisms that lead to the formation of the anterior part of the body are well zzso the ones concerning the zzso part still remain poorly zzso Here, we used tissue zzso in the chicken zzso to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso has a key role in axis zzso Using zzso zzso we characterized a clear zzso zzso of cell and tissue zzso in the zzso during zzso zzso zzso the tissue movement from the global motion of cells we demonstrated that this zzso zzso to a zzso of cell zzso lacking any zzso indicating that the zzso cell movements associated with axis zzso in the zzso are not intrinsic but reflect tissue zzso Both zzso signaling zzso and zzso experiments lead to disruption of the zzso zzso and a slowing down of axis zzso Finally we performed experiments indicating that zzso effect on zzso is due to its effect on cell migration and not to regulation of the cell zzso We propose a new zzso model in which the zzso of non directional cell zzso in the zzso controls zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
