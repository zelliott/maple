Male zzso use zzso zzso as orientation cues during the zzso zzso In addition to the needs of evaluating the quality and quantity of the zzso zzso the male zzso also needs to resolve the zzso structure of the zzso plume to proceed toward the releasing point zzso To understand how a zzso zzso signal is processed at the central level, we used zzso recording methods to characterize the response patterns of zzso lobe zzso zzso to zzso stimulation with the full zzso zzso blend and its single components in male zzso zzso zzso zzso Air zzso delivered at zzso of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 zzso were used to carry the zzso Two types of zzso zzso were characterized according to their capabilities to resolve stimulus zzso The most common type could resolve at least zzso zzso thus termed fast zzso another type could not resolve any zzso thus termed slow zzso When fast zzso were excited by zzso they always displayed zzso response patterns, a zzso phase followed by a zzso zzso This pattern could be evoked by stimulation with both the single zzso components and the zzso The zzso capability of the fast zzso correlated significantly with the size of the zzso zzso When the zzso was higher and the fall time of the zzso faster, the zzso could follow more zzso per zzso Moreover, interactions between different zzso components zzso different response patterns did not improve the zzso capability of fast zzso
