zzso is an essential component of the signal zzso complex downstream of the zzso and zzso zzso Although regarded as the first zzso in the signaling zzso the role of zzso zzso activity versus its scaffold function is still zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso function in zzso zzso mice were generated by replacing the wild type zzso gene with a zzso gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was rendered inactive by mutating the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso pocket essential for zzso zzso zzso of embryonic zzso and zzso obtained from zzso zzso mice demonstrate lack of cellular responsiveness to stimulation with zzso or a zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso complex and its subsequent zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are severely impaired in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso is largely absent in these zzso Additionally, zzso analysis identified zzso response genes and revealed that the induction of zzso zzso is largely zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso activity plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso induction of inflammatory zzso
