zzso zzso zzso is an zzso junction protein recognized to regulate barrier function, but emerging evidence indicates that zzso may also exert control on other cellular functions such as zzso suppression of zzso We investigated the hypothesis that loss of zzso in human zzso cells activates zzso of zzso zzso zzso For study, zzso targeted to zzso was zzso into brain zzso zzso or pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso for zzso which depleted zzso of zzso zzso This loss of zzso resulted in increased promoter reporter activity of zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso as well as of target zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were all zzso during the period of zzso of zzso zzso although the zzso and extent of the expression profiles zzso The zzso zzso of zzso molecules corresponded with increased zzso zzso to the zzso surface and elevated zzso protein zzso We further explored the role of zzso as a potential signaling mechanism responsible for regulation of zzso activities by zzso zzso indicated that loss of zzso increased zzso zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso prevented zzso nuclear zzso This implicates zzso in signaling the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso The findings provide strong evidence that zzso in zzso expression in zzso cells is a potent stimulus for zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso We conclude that zzso functions to suppress transcription, which is an important and novel regulation in vascular zzso
