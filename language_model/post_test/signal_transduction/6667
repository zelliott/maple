zzso the array of known zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso It can be attacked by two distinct zzso and can also be zzso at the zzso and zzso The zzso that perform the latter reactions zzso during zzso zzso the zzso accounted for zzso of the total zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso alkaline zzso and specific zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso may be important in zzso calcium zzso The production of zzso may provide a link between zzso zzso zzso production and the synthesis of zzso and zzso because zzso can itself be further zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso activity were separated by zzso zzso One of these was a zzso and the other appeared to be a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso We investigated how the metabolism of zzso might be controlled in rat liver zzso which contained most of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was subject to kinetic zzso such that the zzso zzso was greatly zzso zzso zzso which is itself an alternative precursor of zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso We do not yet know the concentration of zzso in liver, although indirect evidence supports the idea that it is an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso Our results illustrate the relationship between zzso zzso zzso production and the synthesis of higher zzso in rat liver, whilst also providing some insight into how this zzso association is zzso
