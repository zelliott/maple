zzso zzso zzso arrest shortly after zzso and display a characteristic shortened zzso zzso a significantly reduced zzso as well as a thickened visceral zzso zzso zzso rescue experiments demonstrate that bypassing the primary requirement for zzso in the zzso zzso allows the zzso to zzso zzso zzso signals are thus sufficient to promote zzso formation and zzso To further zzso essential zzso activities contributed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso dependent pathways in the early zzso here we performed zzso profiling of zzso zzso embryonic stem zzso cells and day 4 zzso bodies zzso 

zzso from zzso versus zzso zzso zzso cells and day 4 zzso were zzso using zzso zzso In addition to several known zzso target zzso we identified numerous zzso transcripts that are zzso in the zzso As expected, zzso cell markers were dramatically zzso We also observed an increase in zzso potency markers zzso zzso zzso germ cell markers zzso zzso zzso as well as early zzso markers zzso zzso zzso Additionally, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was decreased in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These changes, in combination with increased levels of zzso zzso cause excessive basement membrane zzso Similarly, in the context of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed an expanded basement membrane zzso associated with the thickened zzso zzso 

zzso functional loss results in a dramatic shift in gene expression patterns and in the zzso cell lineage causes an excess deposition of, or an inability to breakdown and zzso the underlying zzso zzso These structural abnormalities probably disrupt zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso visceral zzso required for zzso
