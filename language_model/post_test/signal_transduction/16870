zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso for zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso domain containing zzso and zzso pattern recognition zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso an zzso associated with a potentially fatal deregulation of the immune system, whose zzso is not well zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso domain as a hotspot for zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso severely impair zzso immune zzso in primary cells from zzso patients and in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso abolish the zzso interaction resulting in impaired zzso of zzso and recruitment of linear zzso chain assembly complex zzso to the zzso We show that the zzso binding site in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso pocket and find that a zzso zzso zzso compound zzso zzso zzso zzso function downstream of zzso to limit zzso These findings suggest that impaired immune zzso in response to zzso stimulation is a general zzso in zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso interaction may be targeted zzso to zzso inflammatory zzso
