In the zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso which belong to the vast bacterial zzso family, effectively repress translation of target zzso containing a typical recognition sequence near the translation start zzso Three small zzso zzso zzso zzso with clustered recognition sequences can zzso zzso and zzso and thereby relieve zzso zzso According to a previously established structural model, the zzso protein makes optimal contacts with an zzso sequence zzso zzso in which the central zzso form a zzso Here, we questioned the relevance of the zzso structure in target zzso We found that two predicted zzso structures, zzso (in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso (in zzso zzso zzso allowed effective interaction with the zzso protein in zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso were poor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the strong binding of zzso to the zzso zzso structure in an zzso zzso Modeling studies highlighted the crucial role of the second zzso in the loop zzso In conclusion, a refined structural model of zzso interaction zzso certain zzso zzso among the preferred zzso zzso
