The zzso zzso of memory zzso T cells as well as persistent viral infections have been shown to facilitate the zzso of highly differentiated zzso zzso T cells, a phenomenon that has been associated with an impaired immune function in zzso However, the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso of zzso zzso T cells have not yet been zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso cluster is zzso during zzso zzso zzso differentiation in zzso The increased expression of zzso in zzso zzso T cells is associated with decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso a protein that plays a key role in the DNA damage response zzso Following treatment with the classic zzso agent zzso a zzso II zzso zzso was increased in zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso T cells and correlated with an impaired zzso in this cell zzso The reduced capacity of zzso zzso T cell to repair DNA was characterized by the automated zzso analysis of DNA unwinding zzso zzso as well as by decreased zzso of zzso at zzso of zzso at zzso and of zzso at zzso zzso zzso could prevent zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells, suggesting a role for zzso in the survival and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells in zzso
