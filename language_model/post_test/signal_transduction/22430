zzso a compound isolated from citrus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso shown to have zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study has investigated that zzso exerted zzso effects on the cell zzso invasion, and migration abilities of a highly zzso zzso cells under zzso zzso Data also showed zzso could inhibit the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso activities, protein expressions, zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Also, our data revealed that zzso inhibited zzso with concurrent reduction in the protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by western zzso whereas the protein level of zzso increased zzso Otherwise, zzso zzso cells showed tremendously decreased in the zzso and degradation of inhibitor of zzso zzso the nuclear level of zzso and the binding ability of zzso to zzso response zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly decreased the levels of zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso with a marked reduction in cell invasion and zzso These results suggest that zzso can reduce invasion and migration of zzso cells, and such a characteristic may be of great value in the development of a potential cancer zzso
