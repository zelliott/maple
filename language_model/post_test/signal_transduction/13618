zzso factors zzso are zzso factors consisting of an zzso zzso binding to a stable zzso zzso regulate multiple signaling pathways that could contribute to zzso supporting their potential role in zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso is zzso and required for transforming growth factor zzso induction of collagen in zzso zzso zzso Here, we performed in zzso and in zzso studies of potential zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has two major zzso zzso and zzso with different target gene zzso In cultured human zzso cells, zzso treatment increased both zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso did not increase zzso zzso levels nor decrease the rate of protein degradation, suggesting that it enhances zzso expression through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was required for increased, zzso zzso expression in response to zzso and zzso zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso expression using zzso decreased zzso and zzso type I collagen zzso while zzso zzso zzso increased the collagen response, with zzso being significantly more effective than zzso In zzso mouse zzso zzso target genes were zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate potential signaling interaction between zzso and zzso to promote zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso is more important during zzso
