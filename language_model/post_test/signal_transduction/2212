The zzso zzso of zzso regulates zzso cell shape changes during the process of zzso closure in zzso Here, zzso in the zzso gene are zzso In zzso closure, zzso zzso with zzso by regulating the expression of zzso zzso acts as a relay signal that triggers cell shape changes and zzso expression in neighboring zzso In addition to the joint requirement of zzso and zzso during zzso closure, zzso functions independently of zzso during early stages of zzso These findings demonstrate common and distinct roles of zzso and zzso during zzso and suggest a zzso link between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso signaling during zzso cell shape zzso
