The ability of zzso or rat zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso expression was analyzed in a zzso rat zzso cell culture zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso zzso equivalent to those of the second half of pregnancy in rats, were required to elicit zzso zzso zzso A zzso induction of zzso zzso was observed in cells treated 24 h with 1 zzso of zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression induced by zzso but did not affect zzso expression on its zzso zzso induction of zzso expression was independent of the zzso regulated zzso zzso members of the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, based on the inability of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to block induction of zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso expression required protein zzso C zzso zzso based on the ability of the preferential zzso delta inhibitor zzso to abolish induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso however, was not sufficient to promote induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and 5 DNA binding activities were induced by zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells but only zzso 3 DNA binding was reduced by zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells resulted in increased zzso on zzso and zzso of zzso 3, and these responses were reduced and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 3 in the corpus zzso were also increased in the second half of pregnancy when zzso levels are zzso zzso 3, but not zzso 1 or 5, zzso with zzso zzso delta during zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso with zzso delta from zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso delta complex formation required zzso delta zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso delta is obligatory for zzso zzso zzso that zzso delta complexes with zzso 3 in response to zzso zzso zzso and that zzso delta is involved in the regulation of zzso 3 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso promotes zzso expression in zzso cells and that this event is zzso at least in part, via zzso zzso
