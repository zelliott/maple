zzso zzso is a prominent zzso zzso of synaptic zzso Recent studies proposed two apparently incompatible zzso via protein zzso C zzso and via zzso Here we show how these two pathways zzso First, we confirm that zzso zzso indeed continue to zzso transmission after zzso zzso (the zzso zzso but only in zzso that previously experienced zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso Second, we identify an essential zzso zzso by expressing a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso supported basic transmission, but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, synaptic depression was increased, but not zzso release evoked by zzso zzso These data show that zzso of both zzso and zzso pathways (via zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso is an essential downstream target in the zzso zzso This zzso is of general importance for zzso zzso
