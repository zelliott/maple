zzso evasion is required for zzso tuberculosis to survive in the face of robust zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso tuberculosis can indirectly inhibit zzso T cells by suppressing the major zzso complex class II zzso cell function of zzso This study was undertaken to determine if zzso tuberculosis could directly inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were zzso from zzso by negative zzso selection followed by flow zzso zzso zzso T cells were activated for 16 to 48 h with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso tuberculosis and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso 2 production, zzso and expression of zzso zzso all of which were decreased in the presence of zzso zzso zzso identified that zzso tuberculosis cell wall zzso specifically, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were potent zzso zzso zzso was not dependent on zzso zzso signaling and could be zzso through stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was decreased in the presence of zzso tuberculosis zzso indicating that zzso tuberculosis zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso by interfering with zzso zzso zzso
