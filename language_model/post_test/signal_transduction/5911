zzso evidence suggests that protein zzso zzso signaling pathways are under the regulation of zzso oxygen zzso Although protein zzso zzso are directly regulated by zzso zzso it is not clear whether protein zzso zzso zzso are also directly regulated by zzso zzso In this study we report a mechanism of direct zzso zzso specific for the zzso in the zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso families, key zzso in zzso signal zzso zzso is fully active when reduced and retains zzso of the full activity toward various zzso when zzso This zzso is caused by zzso of a specific zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso of zzso linked by a zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso loop in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso is zzso only in 8 of the zzso zzso in the human zzso including 3 of the 10 zzso family zzso and all 4 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is also zzso regulated by zzso because of this zzso zzso whereas zzso a zzso that lacks a zzso zzso at the corresponding position, is not similarly zzso These results demonstrate a mechanism of direct zzso regulation zzso in certain specific zzso
