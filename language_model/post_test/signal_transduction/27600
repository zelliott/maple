Over the last few years, zzso have been identified as potent second zzso molecules modulating cell growth and zzso A newly emerging facet to this class of lipids suggests a picture where the balance between two zzso lipids (as shown in the particular example of zzso and zzso in T zzso zzso determines the cell fate by setting the stage for various protein signaling zzso Here, we provide a further example of such a decisive balance composed of the two lipids zzso and zzso that determines the allergic responsiveness of mast zzso High zzso zzso of zzso act as a potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso plus zzso zzso synthesis and zzso production by preventing zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso In contrast, high zzso levels of zzso also zzso by zzso zzso mast cells, activate the zzso protein zzso pathway, resulting in zzso and zzso release, or in combination with zzso give zzso zzso zzso high zzso of zzso are dominant over zzso as they counteract its zzso zzso zzso it might be zzso that zzso is pivotal to the zzso of signaling zzso initiated at the zzso zzso zzso I by modulating the balance of the zzso zzso
