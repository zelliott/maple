The zzso zzso family is zzso in many zzso and its therapeutic manipulation by targeted zzso and zzso zzso has resulted in effective zzso However, many zzso remain zzso to current zzso We describe a new approach that directs zzso zzso zzso resulting in biased signaling and zzso Due to known zzso affinities and the necessity of zzso receptors to zzso to zzso zzso zzso formed by the synthetic linkage of two zzso zzso zzso two zzso growth factor zzso zzso or an zzso and a zzso zzso can potentially drive zzso zzso interactions and diminish formation of zzso zzso which are implicated in many zzso and are a prevalent outcome of stimulation by native, zzso zzso or zzso We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this approach by showing that zzso zzso zzso can bias signaling in zzso cancer cells, resulting in some cases in decreased migration, inhibited zzso and increased zzso whereas native zzso stimulation increased the zzso potential of the same zzso zzso this new approach may have therapeutic relevance in zzso breast, zzso and other zzso in which zzso has been zzso
