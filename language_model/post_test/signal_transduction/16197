zzso and transient zzso interactions are associated with biological zzso but many are still undefined because of the difficulties in their zzso Here, we describe a redesigned method to screen transient zzso interactions by using a novel signal amplification circuit, which is incorporated into zzso to artificially magnify the signal responding to the zzso This refined method is based on the previously established zzso recruitment system, which zzso zzso zzso signaling and mating growth selection to screen interacting protein zzso In the current study, to test the capability of our method, we chose zzso of the zzso derived from zzso zzso protein A as candidate zzso and the zzso region of human zzso as the zzso By introduction of an artificial signal amplifier into the previous zzso recruitment system, the signal zzso responding to transient interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso region with significantly low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully amplified in zzso zzso zzso zzso As a result of zzso with the opposite mating type of zzso zzso cells, zzso colonies were vigorously and selectively generated on the screening plates, whereas our previous system rarely produced positive zzso This new approach will be useful for exploring the numerous transient interactions that remain undefined because of the lack of powerful screening tools for their zzso
