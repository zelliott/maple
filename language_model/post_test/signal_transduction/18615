Loss of sensitivity to zzso zzso growth factor zzso growth arrest is an important step towards zzso transformation in human zzso cells, and zzso zzso of differentiation or DNA zzso has been associated with cell proliferation and zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso in cellular sensitivity to zzso 

Using an immortalized prostate zzso cell line, zzso cells, we suppressed zzso expression through zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso expression suppressed cell proliferation and at the same time induced cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso made cells more vulnerable to zzso growth zzso The zzso effect on zzso was associated with zzso of two downstream zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso and zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso levels might be a crucial factor in the development of resistance to zzso growth suppression in human prostate zzso zzso
