zzso human zzso cause zzso familial Alzheimer's disease and render cells susceptible to zzso in cultured cell zzso We show that loss of zzso function in zzso zzso increases levels of zzso in developing zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso causes zzso and zzso zzso resembling those of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso exerts a dominant negative effect when expressed at high zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso leads to reduced zzso zzso synthesis affecting levels of the intact approximately zzso precursor and its approximately zzso processed zzso zzso zzso zzso is cell autonomous and can be blocked by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the increased cell death is due to a zzso mechanism that eliminates improperly specified cell zzso We describe a genetic model in which the zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso and we find that Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso are less effective at inducing zzso than zzso zzso
