Cell signaling does not occur randomly over the cell surface, but is integrated within zzso membrane zzso termed zzso By targeting zzso to raft zzso or to a zzso plasma membrane zzso we studied the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the raft zzso form, but not zzso zzso display signaling events resembling those observed after zzso attachment, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also increases zzso zzso zzso of the dominant negative zzso abrogates zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is a downstream event in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso inactive zzso zzso abrogates the zzso feedback zzso of zzso activity, suggesting that zzso contributes to zzso suppression of zzso zzso Because raft recruitment of zzso occurs zzso after cell attachment, these results provide a mechanism by which zzso may influence cell zzso and migration by zzso regulating zzso zzso
