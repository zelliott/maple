The role of the neural zzso zzso oxide zzso in cerebral zzso has been investigated extensively in the past zzso NO may play either a protective or destructive role in zzso and the literature is plagued with contradictory zzso Working with NO presents many unique difficulties and here we review the potential artifacts that may have contributed to discrepancies and cause future problems for the zzso zzso Recent evidence challenges the idea that NO from zzso builds up to levels zzso sufficient to directly elicit cell death during the zzso zzso zzso the case is strengthened for a role of NO in delayed death zzso zzso by the zzso NO zzso zzso it seems unlikely that NO is released in high enough quantities to inhibit zzso in zzso the formation of zzso nitrogen species, such as zzso represents the more likely zzso to cell zzso The protective and zzso properties of NO have become of increasing zzso NO from zzso cells may, via stimulating zzso production, protect the zzso brain by acutely zzso blood flow, and by helping to form new blood vessels in the longer term zzso zzso zzso production may also stop cells dying by zzso zzso and help repair damage by stimulating zzso In addition NO may act as a direct zzso and participate in the triggering of protective gene expression zzso that zzso cerebral zzso zzso Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which NO is protective may ultimately identify new potential therapeutic zzso
