zzso zzso cells exist within a complex environment that affects how they interpret and respond to zzso We have applied a zzso in zzso systems approach to understand how zzso immune cells communicate with zzso cells to regulate responses to inflammatory zzso zzso modeling analysis of a large zzso composed of zzso zzso and immune cell populations within the zzso revealed an intimate relationship between immune cells and the zzso response to zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso prompted a decrease in the expression of zzso which in turn increased the steady state number of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso This change in the immune compartment affected the zzso zzso milieu and subsequent zzso cell signaling network, with cells becoming hypersensitive to zzso zzso in a way that could be predicted by mathematical zzso In zzso we have uncovered a novel cellular network that regulates the response of zzso zzso cells to inflammatory stimuli in an in zzso zzso
