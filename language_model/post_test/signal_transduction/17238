zzso is a zzso adapter protein involved in DNA repair, cell survival and stress zzso To date, most studies of this protein have been focused in the tumor zzso The role of zzso in stem cell biology has never been zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso cells to zzso the function of zzso zzso cells are zzso fetal zzso cells which possess the ability to differentiate into a multitude of zzso cell lineages when chemically induced and can be more easily amplified in zzso In this study, we have established that zzso expression was normally expressed in zzso cells but become zzso when the cells were induced to zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso using zzso in zzso cells could accelerate induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso we zzso that zzso played an important role in maintaining the zzso of zzso zzso We used zzso analysis to examine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso also altered the expression of zzso genes and components of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways which are zzso involved in maintaining stem cell zzso Comparative zzso profiling also revealed that zzso resulted in decreased expressions of zzso zzso In sum, we propose that zzso acts like an zzso protein that promotes zzso and at the same time zzso the differentiation of zzso zzso
