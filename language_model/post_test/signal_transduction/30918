zzso zzso zzso zzso which is defective in patients with zzso zzso zzso is expressed not only in B cells but also in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso play a crucial role in the innate immune response against infections by sensing pathogens through zzso receptors zzso However, it is not known whether zzso zzso in zzso might impair zzso signaling in zzso which are susceptible to various zzso The zzso maturation and zzso production zzso by zzso were examined in zzso DC from zzso patients and normal zzso The zzso expression in zzso was analyzed by flow zzso zzso signaling in zzso was evaluated for the zzso maturation based on zzso expression and production of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso were similar between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso less zzso maturation of zzso from zzso patients than normal controls based on zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso resulted in significantly lower production of zzso but neither zzso nor zzso by zzso from zzso patients in comparison to normal zzso These findings suggest that zzso may thus be required for zzso signaling in zzso The impaired zzso signaling in zzso may therefore be partly responsible for the occurrence of severe infections with bacteria and some viruses in zzso zzso
