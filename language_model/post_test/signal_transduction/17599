zzso for the zzso region of zzso G zzso are a structurally diverse group of zzso Within the three zzso gamma R families zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso the presence of distinct genes and alternative zzso zzso leads to a variety of zzso zzso that are most zzso different in the zzso and zzso zzso An obvious example of structural variation in the zzso and zzso zzso is observed in the zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso which is nearly identical to zzso gamma zzso in the zzso zzso lacks both zzso and zzso protein zzso and is anchored to the cell through a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gamma zzso function presents a considerable challenge in understanding the role of different zzso gamma R receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso While one hypothesis for the role of zzso gamma zzso in zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso functions is that zzso gamma zzso serves as a binding zzso which focuses the zzso zzso for more efficient recognition and zzso signaling by zzso gamma zzso recent observations from a number of laboratories suggest that zzso gamma zzso on zzso can zzso signals across the membrane independent of zzso engagement of zzso gamma zzso We will review these data and present recent data which suggest that the role of zzso gamma zzso extends beyond direct initiation of functions to a more complex role of synergistic zzso zzso These findings will be reviewed in the context of the experimental approaches that have been used to examine the roles of zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso on zzso zzso
