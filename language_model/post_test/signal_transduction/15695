T cell zzso zzso signaling enhances zzso in zzso a zzso that promotes growth arrest and zzso zzso by increasing surface retention of zzso T zzso zzso zzso via interactions with zzso zzso V zzso mediates zzso by transferring zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso produced by the sequential action of zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso signaling enhances zzso levels of zzso and zzso in parallel with zzso whereas limiting levels of zzso and zzso zzso the increase in zzso or zzso zzso activity induced by zzso signaling with zzso or zzso respectively, limits zzso suggesting that enhanced zzso and zzso activity are both required for this zzso zzso and zzso have an approximately 250- and approximately zzso higher affinity for zzso than zzso respectively, and increasing zzso expression paradoxically zzso zzso branching by limiting zzso supply to zzso suggesting that restricted changes in zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso cells serves to enhance availability of zzso to zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso signaling zzso regulates multiple zzso zzso at the zzso level to zzso promote zzso zzso and by extension, zzso surface zzso T cell growth arrest, and zzso
