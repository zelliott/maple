A short period of cerebral zzso leads to necrosis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Until recently no mechanisms contributing to this selective vulnerability were zzso During the last decade an increasing amount of research has been concentrated on identifying signs of disturbed signal zzso in these zzso after zzso The present thesis is a review of these studies with some emphasis on my own contributions to the zzso zzso and rat models of transient global zzso are the most frequently zzso In order to produce the selective necrosis the main arteries to the brain are zzso for zzso zzso In the rat it is often also necessary to lower the blood zzso It takes zzso days of zzso before the zzso zzso cells become zzso The studies show that the necrosis can be attenuated or aggravated by drugs acting as zzso or enhancers of signal zzso if administered shortly after zzso The necrosis can be similarly influenced by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The protective effect of the zzso however, can be due to the zzso decrease in zzso During zzso there is an increase in the zzso concentration of several zzso and zzso zzso as well as in zzso second zzso Some of the latter also show an increase during zzso In zzso zzso studies of zzso proteins show either unchanged or zzso distributed zzso of the zzso binding to the various zzso and zzso zzso proteins following zzso and early zzso A second decrease is seen in the zzso at the time of and probably secondary to the zzso The zzso zzso decrease appears during the first minutes of zzso and lasts for up to 14 zzso The protective zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso also leads to a decrease in zzso zzso The changes in zzso regulation are not accompanied by increased zzso zzso activity in the zzso In zzso zzso mapping of the regional cerebral zzso rate of zzso show increased metabolism in the zzso during the first hour of zzso compared to the rest of the brain were it is zzso This relative zzso is not seen if the zzso has been deprived of its primary source of zzso zzso A later secondary increase seen in the more or less zzso zzso zzso cell layer is probably due to zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso studies on the expression of zzso zzso and protein respectively has been used to depict zzso with increased zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
