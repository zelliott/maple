The gastrointestinal tract is the central organ for zzso of zzso and zzso and at the same time it forms the main protective barrier between the sterile environment of the body and the outside zzso In zzso the zzso has further evolved to harbor a vast load of zzso bacteria that have important functions for the zzso Discrimination by the host defense system of zzso from self can prevent invasion of zzso but equivalent responses to dietary or colonizing bacteria can lead to devastating consequences for the zzso This dilemma imposed by the gut environment has probably contributed significantly to the evolutionary drive that has led to sophisticated mechanisms and diversification of the immune system to allow for protection while maintaining the integrity of the zzso zzso The immense expansion and specialization of the immune system is particularly mirrored in the zzso zzso organization, and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are key players in the unique zzso defense mechanisms that have evolved in zzso
