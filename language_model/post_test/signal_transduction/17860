The aim of present study was to characterize the in zzso and in zzso pharmacological effects of zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso zzso on corpus zzso smooth muscle and penile zzso zzso zzso relaxed zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso and this effect was partially antagonized by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a selective soluble zzso zzso inhibitor that completely blocked the relaxation induced by sodium zzso suggesting that zzso binds to soluble zzso zzso at a different site from zzso oxide zzso Both zzso and sodium zzso but not zzso zzso zzso caused zzso increases in zzso zzso levels in cultured rabbit zzso smooth muscle cells and produced synergistic zzso zzso administration of zzso (10 zzso evoked penile zzso in rats with zzso zzso More importantly, zzso was able to significantly augment the zzso effects of a zzso dose of zzso These results suggest that the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso levels, leading to relaxation of zzso smooth zzso These zzso events may be related to the zzso properties of zzso in zzso
