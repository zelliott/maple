zzso zzso disorders are a mounting problem despite the advent of highly active zzso zzso To address mechanisms of zzso zzso disorders, we used an zzso zzso zzso model to study innate immune responses in brain that suppress viral replication during acute zzso We previously reported that during acute infection in brain, zzso type I zzso signaling occurs, where zzso zzso is induced while zzso is simultaneously zzso Two downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso also show differential expression zzso In this study, we show that differential signaling is due to interactions between zzso and zzso zzso produce high levels of zzso upon zzso infection, which binds to zzso receptors on zzso leading to a selective suppression of zzso and the zzso gene TRAIL while simultaneously inducing zzso and zzso The interactions between zzso and zzso pathways are a novel finding that may specifically occur in the zzso
