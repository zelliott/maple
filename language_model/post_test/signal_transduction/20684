The possible consequences of zzso zzso zzso receptors on identified zzso zzso derived from rat zzso have been investigated in terms of: 1) zzso of zzso zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso transient rise in zzso zzso in zzso of cortical zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso conditions suggested that the release occurred largely from internal stores in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an inward current in approximately zzso of each zzso zzso tested using the zzso patch clamp zzso The use of zzso patch recording confirmed a similar population of cells responsive to zzso The zzso current was associated with a decrease in membrane zzso The reversal potential was close to the zzso equilibrium potential, consistent with the closure of zzso zzso The current demonstrated similar zzso values and Hill zzso and also a marked degree of zzso for both zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso the zzso response was of the B2 zzso The data were consistent with the functional translation of zzso zzso occupation to zzso responses in distinct zzso of cortical zzso and zzso zzso
