zzso evidence suggests a potential link between cocaine abuse, disruptions in zzso axis zzso and zzso but molecular mechanisms remain zzso zzso zzso is a gene containing a zzso zzso element within its first zzso that is involved in synaptic zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso bound by their respective zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and subsequent binding of this complex to the zzso zzso element of the zzso zzso In this study, the effects of chronic cocaine abuse on zzso expression in zzso and zzso mice were zzso In zzso mice, decreased zzso expression was observed in the absence of changes in levels of zzso hormones or other zzso signaling zzso zzso we hypothesized that cocaine decreases zzso expression via zzso in zzso availability and zzso zzso In support of this hypothesis, zzso was significantly decreased in brains of zzso mice while zzso the main zzso responsible for zzso zzso degradation, was significantly zzso zzso from this study provide the first evidence for a direct effect of cocaine abuse on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso a gene essential for adult zzso
