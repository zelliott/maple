Clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that alcohol consumption prior to burn injury leads to zzso immune function and subsequent higher rates of morbidity and zzso Our laboratory previously observed higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the lungs of mice following ethanol and burn zzso To understand the mechanism of the increased inflammatory response, we looked at different signaling initiators of inflammation including zzso receptors 2 and 4 zzso and 4) zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice were treated with vehicle or a single binge dose of ethanol zzso zzso and subsequently given a sham or burn zzso zzso hours zzso systemic and pulmonary levels of zzso zzso were zzso and differences in zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso 

Higher numbers of zzso were observed in the lungs of zzso mice following the combined insult of ethanol and burn injury relative to either injury zzso This increase in zzso zzso was absent in the zzso knockout zzso zzso levels of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso were also elevated in zzso mice but not in zzso knockout zzso zzso with these findings, pulmonary levels of zzso and zzso were increased in zzso mice following burn and ethanol compared to burn injury alone as well as to their zzso knockout zzso In contrast, zzso knockout mice displayed similar levels, to zzso mice, of zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso in the zzso 

These data suggest that zzso signaling is a crucial zzso component in the exuberant inflammation after ethanol and burn zzso However, zzso does not appear to play a vital role in the zzso pulmonary zzso
