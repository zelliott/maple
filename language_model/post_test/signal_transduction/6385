During systemic infections, the immune system can signal the brain and act on different zzso circuits via soluble zzso such as zzso zzso that act on the cells forming the zzso barrier and the zzso zzso These activated cells release zzso of the zzso type zzso which is the zzso zzso that triggers the pathways involved in the control of zzso functions necessary to restore zzso and provide zzso feedback to innate zzso Among these zzso functions, zzso of the circuits that control the plasma release of zzso is probably the most critical to the survival of the host in the presence of zzso This review zzso this issue and describes in depth the molecular details (including the emerging role of zzso receptors during zzso underlying the influence of circulating inflammatory molecules on the cerebral zzso focusing on their contribution in the synthesis and action zzso in the zzso We also provide an innovative view supporting the concept of zzso and delayed zzso involving the same zzso but different groups of cells, signal zzso zzso and target zzso
