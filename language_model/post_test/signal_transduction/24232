G zzso receptors zzso are involved in a large variety of zzso disorders, and are thus important pharmaceutical drug zzso Here, we describe the development and characterization of a zzso reporter gene zzso as a functional zzso for the zzso zzso of the human zzso B1 zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso The zzso reporter gene zzso provides high sensitivity due to the absence of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso allows zzso cloning of cells expressing functional zzso zzso zzso characterization reveals comparable sensitivity and potency of known zzso zzso zzso and zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and other direct zzso of second zzso The zzso zzso has been zzso for cell density, time of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is well suited to automation and zzso required for zzso zzso
