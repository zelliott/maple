zzso a highly zzso form of cell suicide, is regulated by zzso signals and their zzso with zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso are constantly expressed in the normal cells as inactive zzso The activity of zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso reactions of zzso are needed to execute zzso zzso zzso is one of these zzso signal zzso in which zzso are zzso into characteristic zzso structure, called zzso with zzso that activate the zzso zzso for zzso To investigate the dynamics of signal zzso zzso regulated by zzso we construct a mathematical model for zzso zzso assembly zzso The model first reveals that intermediate products can remain zzso even after all assemble reactions are zzso The second result of the model is that the conversion efficiency of zzso zzso assembly is zzso when the initial concentration of zzso c is equal to that of zzso When the concentration of zzso c is sufficiently larger or smaller than that of zzso the final zzso zzso production is zzso because intermediate zzso zzso zzso and bigger zzso which themselves are unable to form active zzso accumulate too fast in the cells, choking a smooth production of zzso zzso Slow zzso of zzso zzso and small zzso increase the conversion zzso We also study the optimal number of zzso zzso an active zzso that maximize the conversion efficiency in assembly process, and found that the zzso is the zzso
