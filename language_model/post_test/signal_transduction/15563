zzso about signaling pathways is typically compiled based on data gathered using different cell zzso This approach implicitly assumes that the cell line dependence is not zzso However, different cell lines do not always respond to a particular stimulus in the same way, and lack of coherent data collected from closely related cellular systems can be zzso to the efforts to understand the regulation of biological zzso To address this issue, we created a clone library of human zzso zzso zzso cells that expresses different levels of zzso and zzso receptors in combination with zzso zzso Using our clone library, we have zzso the zzso zzso patterns and systematically tested the zzso of the existing hypotheses about the interaction patterns between zzso zzso 

Our study identified zzso as the dominant zzso partner for both zzso and zzso zzso to earlier suggestions, we find that lateral interactions with zzso do not lead to strong zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are only zzso linked in zzso zzso We also find that observed weak zzso is zzso where stimulation of zzso leads to zzso zzso whereas zzso stimulation does not activate the zzso Repeating our experiments at lower cell zzso established that cell zzso is not a major factor in the observed interaction zzso We have also zzso the dependence of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on different zzso zzso We found that zzso signaling makes the strongest contribution to zzso zzso and that, stimulation of either zzso or zzso leads to significant zzso zzso 

Our study shows that clone cell libraries can be a powerful resource in systems biology research by making it possible to differentiate between various hypotheses in a consistent cellular zzso Using our constructed clone library we zzso the cell signaling patterns to establish the role of zzso in the zzso between zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso Our results for zzso cells show that the weak linkage between zzso and zzso pathways can lead to distinct downstream cellular signaling patterns in response to the zzso of these two zzso
