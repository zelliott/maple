It is well established that zzso signals from both the plasma membrane zzso and zzso zzso However, very little is known about whether and how the zzso signals at the PM and zzso to zzso regulate various signaling pathways and the zzso zzso In this communication, we established a system that allowed the specific zzso of zzso at different cell locations: PM and zzso PM zzso of zzso is achieved by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is achieved by zzso the wild type zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso after its zzso into zzso with a previously reported zzso We showed that both zzso zzso at PM and zzso activated zzso to a similar level, but zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso We further showed that zzso zzso at PM and zzso resulted in differential zzso dynamics of zzso zzso which caused the differential zzso of two downstream zzso zzso and zzso Finally we showed that zzso signaling from PM and zzso led to different zzso zzso zzso cells that only generate PM zzso signals have a larger cell size and slower proliferation rate than zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates cell functions through a zzso interplay of zzso zzso
