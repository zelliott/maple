zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso present a new strategy for promoting the biological activity of high density zzso zzso This study aimed to compare the zzso effects of zzso a new zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso HDL zzso 

New Zealand White rabbits zzso received daily infusions of zzso zzso or zzso complexes of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso of zzso carotid zzso Human coronary artery zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso with zzso or zzso stimulating with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in zzso reductions of zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso in the artery wall zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso treatment reduced zzso induced zzso levels of inflammatory markers zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

These studies demonstrate that zzso exhibits zzso properties that are comparable to zzso both in zzso and in zzso and that these effects are zzso via the zzso signaling zzso
