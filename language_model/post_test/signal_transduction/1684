Increased flux of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to mediate zzso insulin resistance in zzso The end product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a donor sugar zzso for complex zzso in the zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso addition to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso modification was blocked by pharmacological zzso of zzso the zzso that zzso zzso removal from zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment increased levels of zzso and caused insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso resistance induced through the zzso by zzso and chronic insulin treatment correlated with increased zzso levels on zzso zzso Whereas insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso were not affected by zzso zzso of zzso downstream zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 beta at zzso was zzso zzso insulin resistance was associated with increased zzso modification of several proteins including insulin zzso zzso 1 and zzso two important zzso of insulin zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso levels zzso insulin signaling and contribute to the mechanism by which increased flux through the zzso leads to insulin resistance in zzso
