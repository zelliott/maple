zzso DNA and synthetic zzso containing zzso motifs have become the focus of many studies due to their ability to activate cells of the innate immune system through interaction with zzso zzso 9 zzso This study was undertaken to investigate if and how zzso zzso activate liver zzso zzso cells zzso known to be the main site of clearance of zzso from the zzso 

zzso of zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was measured by zzso 

Here we show for the first time that mouse zzso express zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, our findings suggest that zzso are first taken up by zzso by scavenger zzso zzso and then join zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso in zzso results in the zzso of zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso 

The presence of functional zzso in zzso emphasizes the importance of these cells in the innate defense mechanisms of the zzso
