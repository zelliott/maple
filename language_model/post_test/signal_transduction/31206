zzso plays a central role in resistance to zzso caused by zzso zzso coli zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso may play a key role in inflammatory disorders and in initiating host zzso In this study we used an experimental mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection to show that zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso surface of zzso collecting duct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice carrying an zzso zzso of zzso failed to clear zzso bacteria and exhibited a dramatic slump in zzso zzso as compared with infected zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the level of expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso still remained greater in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso Using primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso that expressed zzso and its accessory molecules zzso zzso and zzso we also show that zzso zzso both a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso pathway, leading to zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso collecting duct cells are actively involved in the initiation of an immune response via several distinct signaling pathways and suggest that zzso cells play an active role in the recognition of zzso colonizing the zzso
