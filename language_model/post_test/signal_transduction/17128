Evidence suggests the zzso activity of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso directly contributes to killing zzso zzso zzso components that regulate this process remain incompletely zzso We describe a role for the zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene 1 zzso during the zzso of fatty acids as a fuel for zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso In a zzso infection model, zzso expression of zzso zzso is specific to zzso cells and is regulated zzso by zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso cells are impaired in their ability to zzso fatty acids as an energy zzso for zzso zzso production resulting in defective zzso zzso Additionally, the requirement for fatty acid zzso during zzso zzso production and zzso activity toward zzso bacteria is zzso in zzso zzso These results reveal zzso as a key component of the zzso zzso connecting infection, cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso
