zzso delayed zzso zzso current zzso that is sensitive to zzso zzso block has been identified in all vascular smooth muscle zzso studied to zzso These channels conduct outward, zzso zzso current that influences resting membrane potential and contributes to zzso of action zzso zzso muscle cells in most zzso resistance vessels regulate zzso influx and zzso tone by low zzso zzso changes in membrane zzso Block of zzso with zzso leads to contraction and an enhanced zzso response to increased zzso zzso We investigated the zzso of zzso currents in isolated, freshly dispersed smooth muscle cells from rabbit portal vein and coronary arteries in zzso zzso clamp zzso Our findings indicate that zzso channels are regulated by signal zzso mechanisms involving zzso zzso that activate zzso protein zzso zzso or protein zzso C zzso In this paper, the properties and potential function of zzso channels in vascular smooth muscle are zzso Further, the regulation and potential role of zzso in zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso II, zzso and zzso are zzso
