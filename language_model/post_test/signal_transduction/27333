zzso binding zzso proteins play an important role in zzso signal zzso downstream from many zzso including zzso zzso Moreover, it was recently reported that the zzso of G zzso in addition to the zzso regulate zzso zzso In this study, membrane G protein zzso was estimated by Western zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against specific G proteins zzso alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso obtained from 6 heroin addicts and 6 control subjects without a history of drug zzso zzso of the G zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso in heroin zzso compared with controls, and that of G alpha zzso tended to increase in heroin zzso Present findings suggest that the zzso in G zzso signal zzso may be involved in the mechanism of zzso zzso
