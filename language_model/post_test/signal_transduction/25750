The human zzso is a zzso zzso organ under the influence of zzso steroid zzso zzso in this highly coordinated regulation of zzso proliferation and differentiation may result in zzso and diseases such as zzso and zzso zzso Environmental toxins belonging to the group of zzso aromatic zzso zzso are zzso zzso which accumulate in biological zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso including infertility, zzso and zzso zzso However, suitable cellular models of the zzso are lacking and the molecular mechanism of zzso action in the zzso is not fully zzso In this study, we have characterized a previously established immortalized human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso model as a responsive in zzso cell model to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of selected environmentally relevant zzso in human zzso We show that zzso zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso manner and that the induction of zzso target genes is modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso did not interfere with zzso actions in these zzso Independent of their ability to bind to zzso the zzso investigated here increased cell migration by zzso Furthermore, we have identified several candidates by zzso analysis, which are involved in heat shock responses and protein modification and zzso Our data suggest that zzso environmental pollutants directly alter zzso cell stress responses and metabolism independent of zzso zzso
