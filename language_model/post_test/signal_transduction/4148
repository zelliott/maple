Following the growth hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso become zzso zzso along with other zzso zzso Previously, we reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins with molecular masses of zzso 95 zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso and in mouse zzso that express zzso zzso We have studied this zzso zzso event in greater zzso Three proteins with apparent molecular masses of 93, 95, and 96 zzso showed increased zzso zzso in a zzso manner following zzso treatment of cells that express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins is independent of zzso of protein zzso C zzso Cell zzso studies revealed that the majority of zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso and zzso have zzso of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso are not zzso related with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may be important zzso signal zzso independent of zzso zzso and different from the characterized members in the zzso zzso
