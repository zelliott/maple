Many laboratories, using a variety of organisms, have contributed to deciphering the identity and the order of the components leading from zzso zzso zzso zzso to various zzso events, including changes in gene zzso The gaps have only been filled zzso This zzso summarizes the findings and points out the degree of conservation of the same zzso in distant organisms, both at the molecular level and in terms of the consecutive zzso The review also looks at points at which this zzso might be zzso and points onto which other pathways might be zzso These interactions are not always clear cut, and understanding them will be the challenge for the zzso
