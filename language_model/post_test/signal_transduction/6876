zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2) zzso factors regulate zzso development in a redundant zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso also zzso resistance to the cereal pathogen zzso zzso To further zzso the role of zzso zzso factors in plant zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plants were challenged with the virulent zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso plants were highly resistant to zzso zzso whereas zzso plants showed enhanced zzso to this zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso plant zzso to zzso zzso was partially dependent on salicylic acid zzso zzso but independent of the zzso zzso protein zzso OF zzso 1 zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso dramatically reversed zzso zzso resistance in the zzso zzso double zzso but only marginally affected the zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not increase zzso to zzso zzso Together, our zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggest that zzso acts upstream of zzso zzso in disease zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso plants were more susceptible to the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso whereas zzso plants exhibited heightened resistance which could be maintained in the absence of zzso zzso Together, the data reveal that zzso is involved in zzso zzso to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and in zzso resistance to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso
